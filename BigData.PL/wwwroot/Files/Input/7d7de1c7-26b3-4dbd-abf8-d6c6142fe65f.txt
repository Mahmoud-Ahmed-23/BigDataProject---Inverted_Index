The Alan Turing Institute is the United Kingdom s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence  founded in      and largely funded by the UK government  It is named after Alan Turing             the British mathematician and computing pioneer 


Governance edit 
The Alan Turing Institute is an independent private sector legal entity  operating not for profit and as a charity             It is a joint venture among the University of Cambridge  the University of Edinburgh  the University of Oxford  University College London  UCL  and the University of Warwick  selected on the basis of international peer review             In       the institute was joined by eight additional university partners  Queen Mary University of London  University of Leeds  University of Manchester  University of Newcastle  University of Southampton  University of Birmingham  University of Exeter and University of Bristol 
The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council  EPSRC   the primary funder of the institute  is also a member of the joint venture  The primary responsibility for establishing the Alan Turing Institute has been assigned to the EPSRC  with continuing engagement in the shaping of the institute from the Department for Business  Energy and Industrial Strategy  BEIS  and the Government Office for Science   The Chair  Doug Gurr  was appointed in       and the CEO  Jean Innes  in       Between      and       the Director and CEO was Sir Adrian Smith  The inaugural Director from      was Andrew Blake  scientist             

Funding edit 
Funding for the creation of the institute came from a     m investment for the  Eight Great Technologies              and specifically so called  big data   signalled by the UK Government in                 and announced by George Osborne  Chancellor of the Exchequer  in the      budget             The bulk of the investment in  big data  was directed to computational infrastructure  Of the remainder     m was allocated to the institute to cover the first five years of its operation             The five founder universities each contributed   m to the institute             Further funding has come primarily through grants from Research Councils  university partners and from strategic and other partnerships            
In June       the EPSRC awarded the institute     million  on behalf of UK Research and Innovation  for                     
The government s      Spring Budget provided a further     m  spread over five years  directed towards applying data science and artificial intelligence to healthcare  protecting the environment and bolstering national defence              Soon after  a review by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council recommended improvements in financial oversight of funding for the institute              

Location edit 
The institute is named in honour of Alan Turing             often considered the father of Computer Science
Concurrently with the selection of founder universities  the EPSRC initiated a process to find a  location partner   The resulting selection of the British Library in London was announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in December      during the launch of the Knowledge Quarter  a partnership of organisations in and around the King s Cross area of the capital              
As of       the Alan Turing Institute is housed within the current British Library building  but it is anticipated it will occupy new premises in a development planned on land between the Francis Crick Institute and library              In February      the plans for the new building were approved by the local council             

Background edit 
The Alan Turing Institute was founded following a letter from the Council for Science and Technology  CST  to the UK prime minister    June        describing the  Age of Algorithms   The letter presented a case that  The Government  working with the universities and industry  should create a National Centre to promote advanced research and translational work in algorithms and the application of data science  
The Alan Turing Institute fits into a complex organisational landscape that includes the Open Data Institute  the Digital Catapult and infrastructure investments  The role of the institute is to provide the expertise and fundamental research into data science and artificial intelligence needed to solve real world problems            
The Alan Turing Institute has since      run an annual event called AI UK              which is described as a national showcase of data science and artificial intelligence 
The organisation s intranet is called Mathison  which was Alan Turing s middle name 

History edit 
In      Lloyd s Register Foundation became the institute s first strategic partner  providing a grant of     million over five years to support research into the engineering applications of big data                                    
In March       the Turing Institute announced a new strategy  dubbed  Turing                   Following the release of the strategy  an all male team of four senior academics was hired to deliver on the new strategy  leading to a letter signed by     staff members to express serious concerns about the institute s approach to diversity and inclusion              
In October       the Institute started a redundancy consultation process  affecting around     of the     staff members              
In December          employees of the Alan Turing Institute sent a letter to the board of the institute to expresses no confidence in the body s executive leadership and asked the board to intervene              In addition to concerns about gender diversity and the redundancy round  the letter mentions the institute s sense of direction as issues  Furthermore  it outlines how a lack of accountability and transparency  as well as poor decision making by the executive  are leading to a catastrophic decline in trust in leadership and rising levels of stress and burnout across employees  Reportedly  an internal review by the institute mirrors these conclusions
