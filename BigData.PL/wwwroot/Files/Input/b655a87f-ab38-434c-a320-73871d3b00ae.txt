When I first started  I had many doubts and was completely new to application development  Before joining this course  I attended a Zoho interview with low confidence  However  after enrolling in this course  I noticed significant improvements in my thinking and communication skills  The initial phase of the course really boosted my problem solving abilities and helped me gain a deep understanding of how to use programming languages efficiently  Within just one month  I acquired knowledge in Java  Spring Boot  caching  frameworks  Kafka  and more 

Although I wasn t able to complete the entire course  I gained enough knowledge to feel confident about fitting into this company as a developer  At the beginning  I faced some confusion due to language barriers  but the doubt solving sessions allowed me to communicate with my mentors  who understood my challenges and helped me build confidence 

This course has been instrumental in helping me secure this job  During my interview  I mentioned to the HR that I was attending a GeeksforGeeks course  which motivated me to put in my full effort to achieve my goals  
 Thank you gfgReviews and Ratingskrishna nitturkarPlaced at ValueMomentumWith the help of this course   First of all I got a proper  Java Backend Syllabus Structure  Then I got to know the concepts clearly and then the live classes helped me to learn Java Backend Frameworks like Spring Boot  Hibernate  JPA etc  The over all Knowledge I got from this Course was very High and It helped me a lot in learning Java Liki LikhitaPlaced at DeloitteI was really pleased with the quality of the course  as well as the administration  I look forward to attending another  The instructor was very willing to answer questions from individuals  which is very helpful  Overall I  x   m very glad I have taken up this decision to do the course   Prajjwal SinghPlaced at Deutsche BankI wanted to diversify my backend knowledge with Java Spring boot which happened to be   as it was popular in industry  overwhelming for me and was unable to grasp concepts  I enrolled in Java Backend Live and the instructor was very knowledgeable and even better incredible software engineer he told us stuff that is not usually found in YouTube videos how to find stuff  debugging and reading console logs Hitesh GargPlaced in Sophos I previously had zero experience in JAVA Development  I joined this course with many expectations and this course really did fulfil them  This course is not only about JAVA but its more than that you will learn many things like Redis  Kafka  Spring security and all  I was able to crack many interviews of JAVA just because of this course  A really good investment that I made   
Vishal PrajapatPlaced in Concretio Before joining the geeks for geeks Java back end Development course  I have only a basic knowledge of java  But after that joining the live course I learned all the things which are demanding in the industry from a real life industry experts mentor  They helped me gain confidence in working towards the projects  How you can manage the project  how to handle all the features and learned about various technologies like Java spring boot  Hibernate  Redis  Kafka  MongoDB  etc  Which eventually helped me to acquire a job in the IT industry  The content provided by geeks for geeks is the best part of my course and the journey goes from basic to intermediate to advanced level  It helped me a lot  I expressed my gratitude towards geeks for geeks family Krishnendu GuptaPlaced in Walmart as a Software EngineerJava Backend development course helped me to understand the necessary technologies required to become proficient in software development  I got a fairly good idea about the technologies like Spring boot  Microservices  Kafka  REST API  The projects have helped me to understand the application part better so overall it has helped me a lot during my interviews Kshitij KumarPlaced in HashedIn  Deloitte  The course was very good  It had a very structured syllabus  I had initial exposure to Spring Boot but this course and mentor explanation solved my doubts and also gave me good exposure to Redis  Kafka  and Microservices  I was really impressed with his teaching  explanation  and his guidance Raman TayalPlaced in PhonePe I am a college student after learning Data Structures and Algorithms I wanted to learn some basic development aspects  that was a reason I joined this course after researching many websites finally found GFG Backend Development  In this course  I learned about Java Backend Development from very basics to a really good level  Mentor had a good experience in this field and helped where I was stuck  It was worth taking this course Pranay Chary AmberpetaPlaced At Tata Consultancy ServiceThis course helped me a lot to understand more about the Java Backend Development  Which includes Spring Boot  Hibernate   Redis  Kafka
