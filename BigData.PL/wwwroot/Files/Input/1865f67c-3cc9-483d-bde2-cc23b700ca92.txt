Pottery from Guandimiao

Guandimiao is a Chinese archaeological site in Xingyang  Henan  It is the site of a small Late Shang village  inhabited by around     people at its peak  and occupied from c             to           BCE  It likely exported ceramics  example pictured  and cattle  while importing mass produced goods such as arrowheads and hairpins from the Shang capital at Yinxu           km           mi  to the north  The villagers practiced rituals such as pyromancy using locally produced oracle bones and the sacrifice of cattle as well as  more rarely  pigs and humans  Burials at the site have been noted for the almost complete absence of grave goods beyond occasional cowrie shells and sacrificed dogs  It was first excavated from      to      during preparations for the South North Water Transfer Project  work at the site has significantly broadened scholars  understanding of rural Shang economies and rituals  as well as the layout of rural villages  which have received relatively little attention in comparison to urban centers   Full      article
