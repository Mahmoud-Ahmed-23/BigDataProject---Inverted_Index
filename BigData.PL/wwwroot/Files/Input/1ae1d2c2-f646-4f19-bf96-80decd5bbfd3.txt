A semantic network  or frame network is a knowledge base that represents semantic relations between concepts in a network  This is often used as a form of knowledge representation  It is a directed or undirected graph consisting of vertices  which represent concepts  and edges  which represent semantic relations between concepts             mapping or connecting semantic fields  A semantic network may be instantiated as  for example  a graph database or a concept map  Typical standardized semantic networks are expressed as semantic triples 
Semantic networks are used in neurolinguistics and natural language processing applications such as semantic parsing            and word sense disambiguation             Semantic networks can also be used as a method to analyze large texts and identify the main themes and topics  e g   of social media posts   to reveal biases  e g   in news coverage   or even to map an entire research field            


History edit 
Examples of the use of semantic networks in logic  directed acyclic graphs as a mnemonic tool  dates back centuries  the earliest documented use being the Greek philosopher Porphyry s commentary on Aristotle s categories in the third century AD 
In computing history   Semantic Nets  for the propositional calculus were first implemented for computers by Richard H  Richens of the Cambridge Language Research Unit in      as an  interlingua  for machine translation of natural languages             although the importance of this work and the Cambridge Language Research Unit was only belatedly realized 
Semantic networks were also independently implemented by Robert F  Simmons            and Sheldon Klein  using the first order predicate calculus as a base  after being inspired by a demonstration of Victor Yngve  The  line of research was originated by the first President of the Association for Computational Linguistics  Victor Yngve  who in      had published descriptions of algorithms for using a phrase structure grammar to generate syntactically well formed nonsense sentences  Sheldon Klein and I about           were fascinated by the technique and generalized it to a method for controlling the sense of what was generated by respecting the semantic dependencies of words as they occurred in text              Other researchers  most notably M  Ross Quillian            and others at System Development Corporation helped contribute to their work in the early     s as part of the SYNTHEX project  It s these publications at System Development Corporation that most modern derivatives of the term  semantic network  cite as their background  Later prominent works were done by Allan M  Collins and Quillian  e g   Collins and Quillian                         Collins and Loftus             Quillian                                                   Still later in       Hermann Helbig fully described MultiNet             
In the late     s  two universities in the Netherlands  Groningen and Twente  jointly began a project called Knowledge Graphs  which are semantic networks but with the added constraint that edges are restricted to be from a limited set of possible relations  to facilitate algebras on the graph              In the subsequent decades  the distinction between semantic networks and knowledge graphs was blurred                          In       Google gave their knowledge graph the name Knowledge Graph 
The semantic link network was systematically studied as a semantic social networking method  Its basic model consists of semantic nodes  semantic links between nodes  and a semantic space that defines the semantics of nodes and links and reasoning rules on semantic links   The systematic theory and model was published in                   This research direction can trace to the definition of inheritance rules for efficient model retrieval in                  and the Active Document Framework ADF              Since       research has developed toward social semantic networking              This work is a systematic innovation at the age of the World Wide Web and global social networking rather than an application or simple extension of the Semantic Net  Network   Its purpose and scope are different from that of the Semantic Net  or network               The rules for reasoning and evolution and automatic discovery of implicit links play an important role in the Semantic Link Network                          Recently it has been developed to support Cyber Physical Social Intelligence              It was used for creating a general summarization method              The self organised Semantic Link Network was integrated with a multi dimensional category space to form a semantic space to support advanced applications with multi dimensional abstractions and self organised semantic links                         It has been verified that Semantic Link Network play an important role in understanding and representation through text summarisation applications                          Semantic Link Network has been extended from cyberspace to cyber physical social space  Competition relation and symbiosis relation as well as their roles in evolving society were studied in the emerging topic  Cyber Physical Social Intelligence            
More specialized forms of semantic networks has been created for specific use  For example  in       Fawsy Bendeck s PhD thesis formalized the Semantic Similarity Network  SSN  that contains specialized relationships and propagation algorithms to simplify the semantic similarity representation and calculations             

Basics of semantic networks edit 
A semantic network is used when one has knowledge that is best understood as a set of concepts that are related to one another 
Most semantic networks are cognitively based  They consist of arcs  spokes  and nodes  hubs  which can be organized into a taxonomic hierarchy  Different semantic networks can also be connected by bridge nodes  Semantic networks contributed to the ideas of spreading activation  inheritance  and nodes as proto objects 
One process of constructing semantic networks  known also as co occurrence networks  includes identifying keywords in the text  calculating the frequencies of co occurrences  and analyzing the networks to find central words and clusters of themes in the network             

In linguistics edit 
In the field of linguistics  semantic networks represent how the human mind handles associated concepts  Typically  concepts in a semantic network can have one of two different relationships  either semantic or associative  
If semantic in relation  the two concepts are linked by any of the following semantic relationships  synonymy  antonymy  hypernymy  hyponymy  holonymy  meronymy  metonymy  or polysemy  These are not the only semantic relationships  but some of the most common  
If associative in relation  the two concepts are linked based on their frequency to occur together  These associations are accidental  meaning that nothing about their individual meanings requires them to be associated with one another  only that they typically are  Examples of this would be pig and farm  pig and trough  or pig and mud  While nothing about the meaning of pig forces it to be associated with farms  as pigs can be wild  the fact that pigs are so frequently found on farms creates an accidental associated relationship  These thematic relationships are common within semantic networks and are notable results in free association tests 
As the initial word is given  activation of the most closely related concepts begin  spreading outward to the lesser associated concepts  An example of this would be the initial word pig prompting mammal  then animal  and then breathes  This example shows that taxonomic relationships are inherent within semantic networks  The most closely related concepts typically share semantic features  which are determinants of semantic similarity scores  Words with higher similarity scores are more closely related  thus have higher probability of being a close word in the semantic network 
These relationships can be suggested into the brain through priming  where previous examples of the same relationship are shown before the target word is shown  The effect of priming on a semantic network linking can be seen through the speed of the reaction time to the word  Priming can help to reveal the structure of a semantic network and which words are most closely associated with the original word 
Disruption of a semantic network can lead to a semantic deficit  not to be confused with as semantic dementia  

In the brain edit 
There exists physical manifestation of semantic relationships in the brain as well  Category specific semantic circuits show that words belonging to different categories are processed in circuits differently located throughout the brain  For example  the semantic circuits for a word associated with the face or mouth  such as lick  is located in a different place of the brain than a word associated with the leg or foot  such as kick   This is a primary result of a      study published by Friedemann Pulverm ller     citation needed       These semantic circuits are directly tied to their sensorimotor areas of the brain  This is known as embodied semantics  a subtopic of embodied language processing 
If brain damage occurs  the normal processing of semantic networks could be disrupted  leading to preference into what kind of relationships dominate the semantic network in the mind 

Examples edit 
In Lisp edit 
The following code shows an example of a semantic network in the Lisp programming language using an association list 

 setq  database 
       canary   is a bird 
            color yellow 
            size small  
   penguin  is a bird 
            movement swim  
   bird     is a vertebrate 
            has part wings 
            reproduction egg laying    

To extract all the information about the  canary  type  one would use the assoc function with a key of  canary              

WordNet edit 
Main article  WordNet
An example of a semantic network is WordNet  a lexical database of English  It groups English words into sets of synonyms called synsets  provides short  general definitions  and records the various semantic relations between these synonym sets  Some of the most common semantic relations defined are meronymy  A is a meronym of B if A is part of B   holonymy  B is a holonym of A if B contains A   hyponymy  or troponymy   A is subordinate of B  A is kind of B   hypernymy  A is superordinate of B   synonymy  A denotes the same as B  and antonymy  A denotes the opposite of B  
WordNet properties have been studied from a network theory perspective and compared to other semantic networks created from Roget s Thesaurus and word association tasks   From this perspective the three of them are a small world structure             

Other examples edit 
It is also possible to represent logical descriptions using semantic networks such as the existential graphs of Charles Sanders Peirce or the related conceptual graphs of John F  Sowa             These have expressive power equal to or exceeding standard first order predicate logic   Unlike WordNet or other lexical or browsing networks  semantic networks using these representations can be used for reliable automated logical deduction   Some automated reasoners exploit the graph theoretic features of the networks during processing 
Other examples of semantic networks are Gellish models  Gellish English with its Gellish English dictionary  is a formal language that is defined as a network of relations between concepts and names of concepts  Gellish English is a formal subset of natural English  just as Gellish Dutch is a formal subset of Dutch  whereas multiple languages share the same concepts  Other Gellish networks consist of knowledge models and information models that are expressed in the Gellish language  A Gellish network is a network of  binary  relations between things  Each relation in the network is an expression of a fact that is classified by a relation type  Each relation type itself is a concept that is defined in the Gellish language dictionary  Each related thing is either a concept or an individual thing that is classified by a concept  The definitions of concepts are created in the form of definition models  definition networks  that together form a Gellish Dictionary  A Gellish network can be documented in a Gellish database and is computer interpretable 
SciCrunch is a collaboratively edited knowledge base for scientific resources  It provides unambiguous identifiers  Research Resource IDentifiers or RRIDs  for software  lab tools etc  and it also provides options to create links between RRIDs and from communities 
Another example of semantic networks  based on category theory  is ologs  Here each type is an object  representing a set of things  and each arrow is a morphism  representing a function  Commutative diagrams also are prescribed to constrain the semantics 
In the social sciences people sometimes use the term semantic network to refer to co occurrence networks                          The basic idea is that words that co occur in a unit of text  e g  a sentence  are semantically related to one another  Ties based on co occurrence can then be used to construct semantic networks  This process includes identifying keywords in the text  constructing co occurrence networks  and analyzing the networks to find central words and clusters of themes in the network  It is a particularly useful method to analyze large text and big data             

Software tools edit 
There are also elaborate types of semantic networks connected with corresponding sets of software tools used for lexical knowledge engineering  like the Semantic Network Processing System  SNePS  of Stuart C  Shapiro             or the MultiNet paradigm of Hermann Helbig              especially suited for the semantic representation of natural language expressions and used in several NLP applications 
Semantic networks are used in specialized information retrieval tasks  such as plagiarism detection  They provide information on hierarchical relations in order to employ semantic compression to reduce language diversity and enable the system to match word meanings  independently from sets of words used 
The Knowledge Graph proposed by Google in      is actually an application of semantic network in search engine 
Modeling multi relational data like semantic networks in low dimensional spaces through forms of embedding has benefits in expressing entity relationships as well as extracting relations from mediums like text  There are many approaches to learning these embeddings  notably using Bayesian clustering frameworks or energy based frameworks  and more recently  TransE              NeurIPS        Applications of embedding knowledge base data include Social network analysis and Relationship extraction
