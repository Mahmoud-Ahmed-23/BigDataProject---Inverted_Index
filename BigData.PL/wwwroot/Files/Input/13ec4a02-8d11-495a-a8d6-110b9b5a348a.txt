							The Pan Arab Golf Championship for Juniors and Ladies commenced on Wednesday at the Madinaty and Katameya Dunes golf courses in Egypt  and will run until Saturday  The event  described as the first and largest Arab golf event of its kind  is also serving as a platform to highlight Egypt       s ambitious vision to significantly increase its tourism revenues through golf tourism 
Omar Hisham Talaat Moustafa  President of the Egyptian Golf Federation  speaking as a guest on the        Mal       ab ON        programme with journalist Ibrahim Abdel Gawad  stated that the championship       s activities would extend beyond sporting competitions  He explained that the event aims to offer unique experiences for families  featuring exciting shows and a golf festival held on the sidelines  An open invitation was extended to Egyptian families to participate and learn more about the sport 
Discussing the golf industry from an investment perspective  Moustafa noted that many countries have successfully leveraged the sport to attract tourists and generate substantial income  He pointed out that Egypt received approximately    million tourists last year  with a strategic plan in place to double this figure to    million  Moustafa suggested that golf tourism could be a significant component of this plan 
He drew comparisons  emphasising that Costa del Sol in Spain boasts over    courses  attracting around     million golf tourists annually  Similarly  the Turkish city of Belek  with    courses  welcomes         golf tourists each year 
Moustafa explained that Egypt currently has    existing golf courses  which are visited by only        tourists annually  He stated that these courses have the capacity to host        rounds of golf per year  yet currently  no more than        rounds are played annually  He added that Egypt has the potential to attract a specific segment of tourists interested in playing the sport  noting that there is already high demand for such activities 
He asserted that Egypt is well positioned to implement this vision         The average duration of a golf tourist       s trip is five days  with only two days dedicated to playing  while the remaining time is spent visiting tourist  heritage  and entertainment attractions         Moustafa said         With a simple calculation  hosting an additional        golf rounds could attract        tourists per course in Egypt  totalling         new tourists        
Moustafa further elaborated on the economic benefits         Studies indicate that the spending level of a golf tourist is four times higher than that of an average tourist  This means that while the average spending of    million traditional tourists is approximately     billion  at an average of        per tourist  a golf tourist spends         If         tourists visit the country annually  this could generate      billion        
He recalled Egypt       s successful hosting of an        Asian Tour        international championship three years ago  which was broadcast in over    countries         This is the model Egypt can implement to attract golf enthusiasts  especially since Egypt possesses competitive advantages over the cities previously mentioned         Moustafa stated         Tourists will have the opportunity to enjoy unique Egyptian coastal destinations  as well as tourist  archaeological  and heritage sites        
Mohamed Anwar  Vice President of the Egyptian Golf Federation  sought to dispel common misconceptions about the sport         Golf is not a sport for the wealthy or elderly as some imagine         Anwar affirmed         The age range of golfers is varied  and it is a game played by children  youth  adults  and women  The stereotype some hold about this sport has changed globally  where the sport was viewed narrowly until the     s  That perception has completely changed in the world and must change in Egypt too  Incidentally  most players in Egypt belong to middle class families  not the wealthy class as some believe        
Adding to the discussion  Egyptian international golfer Captain Amr Abou El Ela noted the growing trend of this type of tourism in the Arab region         Dubai has become a major destination for golfers  and Agadir in Morocco and Port El Kantaoui in Sousse  Tunisia  have become among the most important destinations for players in the Arab region         Abou El Ela said         Egypt has a great opportunity to benefit from its tourism assets to attract this type of tourism
