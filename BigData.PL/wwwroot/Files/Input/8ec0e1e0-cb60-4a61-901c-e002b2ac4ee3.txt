Representation of consciousness from the   th century by Robert Fludd  an English Paracelsian physician
Consciousness  at its simplest  is awareness of a state or object  either internal to oneself or in one s external environment             However  its nature has led to millennia of analyses  explanations  and debate among philosophers  scientists  and theologians  Opinions differ about what exactly needs to be studied or even considered consciousness  In some explanations  it is synonymous with the mind  and at other times  an aspect of it  In the past  it was one s  inner life   the world of introspection  of private thought  imagination  and volition             Today  it often includes any kind of cognition  experience  feeling  or perception  It may be awareness  awareness of awareness  metacognition  or self awareness  either continuously changing or not                        The disparate range of research  notions  and speculations raises a curiosity about whether the right questions are being asked            
Examples of the range of descriptions  definitions or explanations are  ordered distinction between self and environment  simple wakefulness  one s sense of selfhood or soul explored by  looking within   being a metaphorical  stream  of contents  or being a mental state  mental event  or mental process of the brain 


Etymology edit 
The words  conscious  and  consciousness  in the English language date to the   th century  and the first recorded use of  conscious  as a simple adjective was applied figuratively to inanimate objects   the conscious Groves                                           It derived from the Latin conscius  con   together  and scio  to know   which meant  knowing with  or  having joint or common knowledge with another   especially as in sharing a secret             Thomas Hobbes in Leviathan        wrote   Where two  or more men  know of one and the same fact  they are said to be Conscious of it one to another              There were also many occurrences in Latin writings of the phrase conscius sibi  which translates literally as  knowing with oneself   or in other words  sharing knowledge with oneself about something   This phrase has the figurative sense of  knowing that one knows   which is something like the modern English word  conscious   but it was rendered into English as  conscious to oneself  or  conscious unto oneself   For example  Archbishop Ussher wrote in      of  being so conscious unto myself of my great weakness             
The Latin conscientia  literally  knowledge with   first appears in Roman juridical texts by writers such as Cicero  It means a kind of shared knowledge with moral value  specifically what a witness knows of someone else s deeds                          Although Ren  Descartes              writing in Latin  is generally taken to be the first philosopher to use conscientia in a way less like the traditional meaning and more like the way modern English speakers would use  conscience   his meaning is nowhere defined              In Search after Truth  Regul  ad directionem ingenii ut et inquisitio veritatis per lumen naturale  Amsterdam       he wrote the word with a gloss  conscienti   vel interno testimonio  translatable as  conscience  or internal testimony                            It might mean the knowledge of the value of one s own thoughts             

John Locke  a   th century British Age of Enlightenment philosopher
The origin of the modern concept of consciousness is often attributed to John Locke who defined the word in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding  published in       as  the perception of what passes in a man s own mind                           The essay strongly influenced   th century British philosophy  and Locke s definition appeared in Samuel Johnson s celebrated Dictionary                    
The French term conscience is defined roughly like English  consciousness  in the      volume of Diderot and d Alembert s Encyclop die as  the opinion or internal feeling that we ourselves have from what we do              

Problem of definition edit 


About forty meanings attributed to the term consciousness can be identified and categorized based on functions and experiences  The prospects for reaching any single  agreed upon  theory independent definition of consciousness appear remote             



Scholars are divided  as to whether Aristotle had a concept of consciousness  He does not use any single word or terminology that is clearly similar to the phenomenon or concept defined by John Locke  Victor Caston contends that Aristotle did have a concept more clearly similar to perception             
Modern dictionary definitions of the word consciousness evolved over several centuries and reflect a range of seemingly related meanings  with some differences that have been controversial  such as the distinction between inward awareness and perception of the physical world  or the distinction between conscious and unconscious  or the notion of a mental entity or mental activity that is not physical 
The common usage definitions of consciousness in Webster s Third New International Dictionary        are as follows 

awareness or perception of an inward psychological or spiritual fact  intuitively perceived knowledge of something in one s inner self
inward awareness of an external object  state  or fact
concerned awareness  INTEREST  CONCERN often used with an attributive noun  e g  class consciousness 
the state or activity that is characterized by sensation  emotion  volition  or thought  mind in the broadest possible sense  something in nature that is distinguished from the physical
the totality in psychology of sensations  perceptions  ideas  attitudes  and feelings of which an individual or a group is aware at any given time or within a particular time span compare STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS
waking life  as that to which one returns after sleep  trance  fever  wherein all one s mental powers have returned      
the part of mental life or psychic content in psychoanalysis that is immediately available to the ego compare PRECONSCIOUS  UNCONSCIOUS
The Cambridge English Dictionary defines consciousness as  the state of understanding and realizing something              
The Oxford Living Dictionary defines consciousness as   t he state of being aware of and responsive to one s surroundings     a  person s awareness or perception of something   and   t he fact of awareness by the mind of itself and the world              
Philosophers have attempted to clarify technical distinctions by using a jargon of their own  The corresponding entry in the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy        reads 

Consciousness
Philosophers have used the term consciousness for four main topics  knowledge in general  intentionality  introspection  and the knowledge it specifically generates  and phenomenal experience    Something within one s mind is  introspectively conscious  just in case one introspects it  or is poised to do so   Introspection is often thought to deliver one s primary knowledge of one s mental life  An experience or other mental entity is  phenomenally conscious  just in case there is  something it is like  for one to have it  The clearest examples are  perceptual experience  such as tastings and seeings  bodily sensational experiences  such as those of pains  tickles and itches  imaginative experiences  such as those of one s own actions or perceptions  and streams of thought  as in the experience of thinking  in words  or  in images   Introspection and phenomenality seem independent  or dissociable  although this is controversial             
Traditional metaphors for mind edit 
During the early   th century  the emerging field of geology inspired a popular metaphor that the mind likewise had hidden layers  which recorded the past of the individual                                   By       most psychologists believed that  consciousness was but a small part of mental life                                   and this idea underlies the goal of Freudian therapy  to expose the unconscious layer of the mind 
Other metaphors from various sciences inspired other analyses of the mind  for example  Johann Friedrich Herbart described ideas as being attracted and repulsed like magnets  John Stuart Mill developed the idea of  mental chemistry  and  mental compounds   and Edward B  Titchener sought the  structure  of the mind by analyzing its  elements   The abstract idea of states of consciousness mirrored the concept of states of matter 
In       William James noted that the  ambiguous word  content  has been recently invented instead of  object   and that the metaphor of mind as a container seemed to minimize the dualistic problem of how  states of consciousness can know  things  or objects                                    by      psychologists were busily studying the  contents of conscious experience by introspection and experiment                                     Another popular metaphor was James s doctrine of the stream of consciousness  with continuity  fringes  and transitions                         vii            a     
James discussed the difficulties of describing and studying psychological phenomena  recognizing that commonly used terminology was a necessary and acceptable starting point towards more precise  scientifically justified language  Prime examples were phrases like inner experience and personal consciousness 

The first and foremost concrete fact which every one will affirm to belong to his inner experience is the fact that consciousness of some sort goes on   States of mind  succeed each other in him        But everyone knows what the terms mean  only  in a rough way        When I say every  state  or  thought  is part of a personal consciousness   personal consciousness  is one of the terms in question  Its meaning we know so long as no one asks us to define it  but to give an accurate account of it is the most difficult of philosophic tasks        The only states of consciousness that we naturally deal with are found in personal consciousnesses  minds  selves  concrete particular I s and you s                                       
From introspection to awareness and experience edit 
Prior to the   th century  philosophers treated the phenomenon of consciousness as the  inner world  of  one s own mind   and introspection was the mind  attending to  itself      b      an activity seemingly distinct from that of perceiving the  outer world  and its physical phenomena  In      William James noted the distinction along with doubts about the inward character of the mind  Things  have been doubted  but thoughts and feelings have never been doubted  The outer world  but never the inner world  has been denied  Everyone assumes that we have direct introspective acquaintance with our thinking activity as such  with our consciousness as something inward and contrasted with the outer objects which it knows  Yet I must confess that for my part I cannot feel sure of this conclusion        It seems as if consciousness as an inner activity were rather a postulate than a sensibly given fact                                     
By the     s  for many philosophers and psychologists who talked about consciousness  the word no longer meant the  inner world  but an indefinite  large category called awareness  as in the following example 

It is difficult for modern Western man to grasp that the Greeks really had no concept of consciousness in that they did not class together phenomena as varied as problem solving  remembering  imagining  perceiving  feeling pain  dreaming  and acting on the grounds that all these are manifestations of being aware or being conscious                                 
Many philosophers and scientists have been unhappy about the difficulty of producing a definition that does not involve circularity or fuzziness              In The Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology       edition   Stuart Sutherland emphasized external awareness  and expressed a skeptical attitude more than a definition 

Consciousness The having of perceptions  thoughts  and feelings  awareness  The term is impossible to define except in terms that are unintelligible without a grasp of what consciousness means  Many fall into the trap of equating consciousness with self consciousness to be conscious it is only necessary to be aware of the external world  Consciousness is a fascinating but elusive phenomenon  it is impossible to specify what it is  what it does  or why it has evolved  Nothing worth reading has been written on it             
Using  awareness   however  as a definition or synonym of consciousness is not a simple matter 

If awareness of the environment       is the criterion of consciousness  then even the protozoans are conscious  If awareness of awareness is required  then it is doubtful whether the great apes and human infants are conscious             
In       philosopher Thomas Nagel used  consciousness    conscious experience    subjective experience  and the  subjective character of experience  as synonyms for something that  occurs at many levels of animal life           although  it is difficult to say in general what provides evidence of it               Nagel s terminology also included what has been described as  the standard  what it s like  locution              in reference to the impenetrable subjectivity of any organism s experience which Nagel referred to as  inner life  without implying any kind of introspection  On Nagel s approach  Peter Hacker commented                                     Consciousness  thus conceived  is extended to the whole domain of  experience  of  Life  subjectively understood   He regarded this as a  novel analysis of consciousness                                  and has been particularly critical of Nagel s terminology and its philosophical consequences             In      he attacked Nagel s  what it s like  phrase as  malconstructed  and meaningless English it sounds as if it asks for an analogy  but does not and he called Nagel s approach logically  misconceived  as a definition of consciousness              In      Hacker went further and asserted that Nagel had  laid the groundwork for          forty years of fresh confusion about consciousness  and that  the contemporary philosophical conception of consciousness that is embraced by the  consciousness studies community  is incoherent                                     

Influence on research edit 
Many philosophers have argued that consciousness is a unitary concept that is understood by the majority of people despite the difficulty philosophers have had defining it              The term  subjective experience   following Nagel  is amibiguous  as philosophers seem to differ from non philosophers in their intuitions about its meaning              Max Velmans proposed that the  everyday understanding of consciousness  uncontroversially  refers to experience itself rather than any particular thing that we observe or experience  and he added that consciousness  is  therefore  exemplified by all the things that we observe or experience                                   whether thoughts  feelings  or perceptions  Velmans noted however  as of       that there was a deep level of  confusion and internal division              among experts about the phenomenon of consciousness  because researchers lacked  a sufficiently well specified use of the term   to agree that they are investigating the same thing                                   He argued additionally that  pre existing theoretical commitments  to competing explanations of consciousness might be a source of bias 
Within the  modern consciousness studies  community the technical phrase  phenomenal consciousness  is a common synonym for all forms of awareness  or simply  experience                                   without differentiating between inner and outer  or between higher and lower types  With advances in brain research   the presence or absence of experienced phenomena                                  of any kind underlies the work of those neuroscientists who seek  to analyze the precise relation of conscious phenomenology to its associated information processing  in the brain                                   This neuroscientific goal is to find the  neural correlates of consciousness   NCC   One criticism of this goal is that it begins with a theoretical commitment to the neurological origin of all  experienced phenomena  whether inner or outer      c      Also  the fact that the easiest  content of consciousness  to be so analyzed is  the experienced three dimensional world  the phenomenal world  beyond the body surface                                  invites another criticism  that most consciousness research since the     s  perhaps because of bias  has focused on processes of external perception             
From a history of psychology perspective  Julian Jaynes rejected popular but  superficial views of consciousness                                   especially those which equate it with  that vaguest of terms  experience                                   In      he insisted that if not for introspection  which for decades had been ignored or taken for granted rather than explained  there could be no  conception of what consciousness is                                   and in       he reaffirmed the traditional idea of the phenomenon called  consciousness   writing that  its denotative definition is  as it was for Ren  Descartes  John Locke  and David Hume  what is introspectable                                    Jaynes saw consciousness as an important but small part of human mentality  and he asserted   there can be no progress in the science of consciousness until          what is introspectable  is  sharply distinguished                                   from the unconscious processes of cognition such as perception  reactive awareness and attention  and automatic forms of learning  problem solving  and decision making                                     
The cognitive science point of view with an inter disciplinary perspective involving fields such as psychology  linguistics and anthropology             requires no agreed definition of  consciousness  but studies the interaction of many processes besides perception  For some researchers  consciousness is linked to some kind of  selfhood   for example to certain pragmatic issues such as the feeling of agency and the effects of regret             and action on experience of one s own body or social identity              Similarly Daniel Kahneman  who focused on systematic errors in perception  memory and decision making  has differentiated between two kinds of mental processes  or cognitive  systems               the  fast  activities that are primary  automatic and  cannot be turned off                                    and the  slow   deliberate  effortful activities of a secondary system  often associated with the subjective experience of agency  choice  and concentration                                    Kahneman s two systems have been described as  roughly corresponding to unconscious and conscious processes                                   The two systems can interact  for example in sharing the control of attention                                   While System   can be impulsive   System   is in charge of self control                                    and  When we think of ourselves  we identify with System    the conscious  reasoning self that has beliefs  makes choices  and decides what to think about and what to do                                   
Some have argued that we should eliminate the concept from our understanding of the mind  a position known as consciousness semanticism             
In medicine  a  level of consciousness  terminology is used to describe a patient s arousal and responsiveness  which can be seen as a continuum of states ranging from full alertness and comprehension  through disorientation  delirium  loss of meaningful communication  and finally loss of movement in response to painful stimuli              Issues of practical concern include how the level of consciousness can be assessed in severely ill  comatose  or anesthetized people  and how to treat conditions in which consciousness is impaired or disrupted              The degree or level of consciousness is measured by standardized behavior observation scales such as the Glasgow Coma Scale 

Philosophy of mind edit 
While historically philosophers have defended various views on consciousness  surveys indicate that physicalism is now the dominant position among contemporary philosophers of mind              For an overview of the field  approaches often include both historical perspectives  e g   Descartes  Locke  Kant  and organization by key issues in contemporary debates  An alternative is to focus primarily on current philosophical stances and empirical findings 

Coherence of the concept edit 
Philosophers differ from non philosophers in their intuitions about what consciousness is              While most people have a strong intuition for the existence of what they refer to as consciousness              skeptics argue that this intuition is too narrow  either because the concept of consciousness is embedded in our intuitions  or because we all are illusions  Gilbert Ryle  for example  argued that traditional understanding of consciousness depends on a Cartesian dualist outlook that improperly distinguishes between mind and body  or between mind and world  He proposed that we speak not of minds  bodies  and the world  but of entities  or identities  acting in the world  Thus  by speaking of  consciousness  we end up leading ourselves by thinking that there is any sort of thing as consciousness separated from behavioral and linguistic understandings             

Types edit 
Ned Block argues that discussions on consciousness have often failed properly to distinguish phenomenal consciousness from access consciousness  The terms had been used before Block used them  but he adopted the short forms P consciousness and A consciousness              According to Block 

P consciousness is raw experience  it is moving  colored forms  sounds  sensations  emotions and feelings with our bodies and responses at the center  These experiences  considered independently of any impact on behavior  are called qualia 
A consciousness is the phenomenon whereby information in our minds is accessible for verbal report  reasoning  and the control of behavior  So  when we perceive  information about what we perceive is access conscious  when we introspect  information about our thoughts is access conscious  when we remember  information about the past is access conscious  and so on 
Block adds that P consciousness does not allow of easy definition  he admits that he  cannot define P consciousness in any remotely noncircular way             
Although some philosophers  such as Daniel Dennett  have disputed the validity of this distinction              others have broadly accepted it  David Chalmers has argued that A consciousness can in principle be understood in mechanistic terms  but that understanding P consciousness is much more challenging  he calls this the hard problem of consciousness             
Some philosophers believe that Block s two types of consciousness are not the end of the story  William Lycan  for example  argued in his book Consciousness and Experience that at least eight clearly distinct types of consciousness can be identified  organism consciousness  control consciousness  consciousness of  state event consciousness  reportability  introspective consciousness  subjective consciousness  self consciousness  and that even this list omits several more obscure forms             
There is also debate over whether or not A consciousness and P consciousness always coexist or if they can exist separately  Although P consciousness without A consciousness is more widely accepted  there have been some hypothetical examples of A without P  Block  for instance  suggests the case of a  zombie  that is computationally identical to a person but without any subjectivity  However  he remains somewhat skeptical concluding  I don t know whether there are any actual cases of A consciousness without P consciousness  but I hope I have illustrated their conceptual possibility              

Distinguishing consciousness from its contents edit 
Sam Harris observes   At the level of your experience  you are not a body of cells  organelles  and atoms  you are consciousness and its ever changing contents               Seen in this way  consciousness is a subjectively experienced  ever present field in which things  the contents of consciousness  come and go 
Christopher Tricker argues that this field of consciousness is symbolized by the mythical bird that opens the Daoist classic the Zhuangzi  This bird s name is Of a Flock  peng     yet its back is countless thousands of miles across and its wings are like clouds arcing across the heavens   Like Of a Flock  whose wings arc across the heavens  the wings of your consciousness span to the horizon  At the same time  the wings of every other being s consciousness span to the horizon  You are of a flock  one bird among kin              

Mind body problem edit 
Main article  Mind body problem
Illustration of mind body dualism by Ren  Descartes  Inputs are passed by the sensory organs to the pineal gland  and from there to the immaterial spirit 
Mental processes  such as consciousness  and physical processes  such as brain events  seem to be correlated  however the specific nature of the connection is unknown 
The first influential philosopher to discuss this question specifically was Descartes  and the answer he gave is known as mind body dualism  Descartes proposed that consciousness resides within an immaterial domain he called res cogitans  the realm of thought   in contrast to the domain of material things  which he called res extensa  the realm of extension               He suggested that the interaction between these two domains occurs inside the brain  perhaps in a small midline structure called the pineal gland             
Although it is widely accepted that Descartes explained the problem cogently  few later philosophers have been happy with his solution  and his ideas about the pineal gland have especially been ridiculed              However  no alternative solution has gained general acceptance  Proposed solutions can be divided broadly into two categories  dualist solutions that maintain Descartes s rigid distinction between the realm of consciousness and the realm of matter but give different answers for how the two realms relate to each other  and monist solutions that maintain that there is really only one realm of being  of which consciousness and matter are both aspects  Each of these categories itself contains numerous variants  The two main types of dualism are substance dualism  which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics   and property dualism  which holds that the laws of physics are universally valid but cannot be used to explain the mind   The three main types of monism are physicalism  which holds that the mind is made out of matter   idealism  which holds that only thought or experience truly exists  and matter is merely an illusion   and neutral monism  which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them   There are also  however  a large number of idiosyncratic theories that cannot cleanly be assigned to any of these schools of thought             
Since the dawn of Newtonian science with its vision of simple mechanical principles governing the entire universe  some philosophers have been tempted by the idea that consciousness could be explained in purely physical terms  The first influential writer to propose such an idea explicitly was Julien Offray de La Mettrie  in his book Man a Machine  L homme machine   His arguments  however  were very abstract              The most influential modern physical theories of consciousness are based on psychology and neuroscience  Theories proposed by neuroscientists such as Gerald Edelman             and Antonio Damasio              and by philosophers such as Daniel Dennett              seek to explain consciousness in terms of neural events occurring within the brain  Many other neuroscientists  such as Christof Koch              have explored the neural basis of consciousness without attempting to frame all encompassing global theories  At the same time  computer scientists working in the field of artificial intelligence have pursued the goal of creating digital computer programs that can simulate or embody consciousness             
A few theoretical physicists have argued that classical physics is intrinsically incapable of explaining the holistic aspects of consciousness  but that quantum theory may provide the missing ingredients  Several theorists have therefore proposed quantum mind  QM  theories of consciousness              Notable theories falling into this category include the holonomic brain theory of Karl Pribram and David Bohm  and the Orch OR theory formulated by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose  Some of these QM theories offer descriptions of phenomenal consciousness  as well as QM interpretations of access consciousness  None of the quantum mechanical theories have been confirmed by experiment  Recent publications by G  Guerreshi  J  Cia  S  Popescu  and H  Briegel             could falsify proposals such as those of Hameroff  which rely on quantum entanglement in protein  At the present time many scientists and philosophers consider the arguments for an important role of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing              Empirical evidence is against the notion of quantum consciousness  an experiment about wave function collapse led by Catalina Curceanu in      suggests that quantum consciousness  as suggested by Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff  is highly implausible             
Apart from the general question of the  hard problem  of consciousness  which is  roughly speaking  the question of how mental experience can arise from a physical basis               a more specialized question is how to square the subjective notion that we are in control of our decisions  at least in some small measure  with the customary view of causality that subsequent events are caused by prior events  The topic of free will is the philosophical and scientific examination of this conundrum 

Problem of other minds edit 
Main article  Problem of other minds
Many philosophers consider experience to be the essence of consciousness  and believe that experience can only fully be known from the inside  subjectively  The problem of other minds is a philosophical problem traditionally stated as the following epistemological question  Given that I can only observe the behavior of others  how can I know that others have minds              The problem of other minds is particularly acute for people who believe in the possibility of philosophical zombies  that is  people who think it is possible in principle to have an entity that is physically indistinguishable from a human being and behaves like a human being in every way but nevertheless lacks consciousness              Related issues have also been studied extensively by Greg Littmann of the University of Illinois              and by Colin Allen  a professor at the University of Pittsburgh  regarding the literature and research studying artificial intelligence in androids             
The most commonly given answer is that we attribute consciousness to other people because we see that they resemble us in appearance and behavior  we reason that if they look like us and act like us  they must be like us in other ways  including having experiences of the sort that we do              There are  however  a variety of problems with that explanation  For one thing  it seems to violate the principle of parsimony  by postulating an invisible entity that is not necessary to explain what we observe              Some philosophers  such as Daniel Dennett in a research paper titled  The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies   argue that people who give this explanation do not really understand what they are saying              More broadly  philosophers who do not accept the possibility of zombies generally believe that consciousness is reflected in behavior  including verbal behavior   and that we attribute consciousness on the basis of behavior  A more straightforward way of saying this is that we attribute experiences to people because of what they can do  including the fact that they can tell us about their experiences

The term  qualia  was introduced in philosophical literature by C  I  Lewis  The word is derived from Latin and means  of what sort   It is basically a quantity or property of something as perceived or experienced by an individual  like the scent of rose  the taste of wine  or the pain of a headache  They are difficult to articulate or describe  The philosopher and scientist Daniel Dennett describes them as  the way things seem to us   while philosopher and cognitive scientist David Chalmers expanded on qualia as the  hard problem of consciousness  in the     s  When qualia is experienced  activity is simulated in the brain  and these processes are called neural correlates of consciousness  NCCs   Many scientific studies have been done to attempt to link particular brain regions with emotions or experiences                                     
Species which experience qualia are said to have sentience  which is central to the animal rights movement  because it includes the ability to experience pain and suffering             

Identity edit 
Main article  Personal identity
An unsolved problem in the philosophy of consciousness is how it relates to the nature of personal identity              This includes questions regarding whether someone is the  same person  from moment to moment  If that is the case  another question is what exactly the  identity carrier  is that makes a conscious being  the same  being from one moment to the next  The problem of determining personal identity also includes questions such as Benj Hellie s vertiginous question  which can be summarized as  Why am I me and not someone else                The philosophical problems regarding the nature of personal identity have been extensively discussed by Thomas Nagel in his book The View from Nowhere 
A common view of personal identity is that an individual has a continuous identity that persists from moment to moment  with an individual having a continuous identity consisting of a line segment stretching across time from birth to death  In the case of an afterlife as described in Abrahamic religions  one s personal identity is believed to stretch infinitely into the future  forming a ray or line  This notion of identity is similar to the form of dualism advocated by Ren  Descartes  However  some philosophers argue that this common notion of personal identity is unfounded  Daniel Kolak has argued extensively against it in his book I am You              Kolak refers to the aforementioned notion of personal identity being linear as  Closed individualism   Another view of personal identity according to Kolak is  Empty individualism   in which one s personal identity only exists for a single moment of time  However  Kolak advocates for a view of personal identity called Open individualism  in which all consciousness is in reality a single being and individual personal identity in reality does not exist at all  Another philosopher who has contested the notion of personal identity is Derek Parfit  In his book Reasons and Persons              he describes a thought experiment known as the teletransportation paradox  In Buddhist philosophy  the concept of anatt  refers to the idea that the self is an illusion 
Other philosophers have argued that Hellie s vertiginous question has a number of philosophical implications relating to the metaphysical nature of consciousness  Christian List argues that the vertiginous question and the existence of first personal facts is evidence against physicalism  and evidence against other third personal metaphysical pictures  including standard versions of dualism              List also argues that the vertiginous question implies a  quadrilemma  for theories of consciousness  He claims that at most three of the following metaphysical claims can be true   first person realism    non solipsism    non fragmentation   and  one world    and at at least one of these four must be false              List has proposed a model he calls the  many worlds theory of consciousness  in order to reconcile the subjective nature of consciousness without lapsing into solipsism              Vincent Conitzer argues that the nature of identity is connected to A series and B series theories of time  and that A theory being true implies that the  I  is metaphysically distinguished from other perspectives              Giovanni Merlo has argued that the subjectivist view of mental phenomena goes a considerable way towards solving various long standing philosophical puzzles related to various aspects of consciousness  such as the unity of consciousness  the contents of self awareness  and the problems with transmitting information related to the contents of subjective experience              Other philosophical theories regarding the metaphysical nature of self are Caspar Hare s theories of perspectival realism              in which things within perceptual awareness have a defining intrinsic property that exists absolutely and not relative to anything  and egocentric presentism  in which the experiences of other individuals are not present in the way that one s current perspective is                         

Scientific study edit 
For many decades  consciousness as a research topic was avoided by the majority of mainstream scientists  because of a general feeling that a phenomenon defined in subjective terms could not properly be studied using objective experimental methods              In      George Mandler published an influential psychological study which distinguished between slow  serial  and limited conscious processes and fast  parallel and extensive unconscious ones              The Science and Religion Forum                  annual conference   From Artificial Intelligence to Human Consciousness  identified the nature of consciousness as a matter for investigation  Donald Michie was a keynote speaker  Starting in the     s  an expanding community of neuroscientists and psychologists have associated themselves with a field called Consciousness Studies  giving rise to a stream of experimental work published in books              journals such as Consciousness and Cognition  Frontiers in Consciousness Research  Psyche  and the Journal of Consciousness Studies  along with regular conferences organized by groups such as the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness             and the Society for Consciousness Studies 
Modern medical and psychological investigations into consciousness are based on psychological experiments  including  for example  the investigation of priming effects using subliminal stimuli               and on case studies of alterations in consciousness produced by trauma  illness  or drugs  Broadly viewed  scientific approaches are based on two core concepts  The first identifies the content of consciousness with the experiences that are reported by human subjects  the second makes use of the concept of consciousness that has been developed by neurologists and other medical professionals who deal with patients whose behavior is impaired  In either case  the ultimate goals are to develop techniques for assessing consciousness objectively in humans as well as other animals  and to understand the neural and psychological mechanisms that underlie it             

Measurement via verbal report edit 
The Necker cube  an ambiguous image
Experimental research on consciousness presents special difficulties  due to the lack of a universally accepted operational definition  In the majority of experiments that are specifically about consciousness  the subjects are human  and the criterion used is verbal report  in other words  subjects are asked to describe their experiences  and their descriptions are treated as observations of the contents of consciousness             
For example  subjects who stare continuously at a Necker cube usually report that they experience it  flipping  between two  D configurations  even though the stimulus itself remains the same              The objective is to understand the relationship between the conscious awareness of stimuli  as indicated by verbal report  and the effects the stimuli have on brain activity and behavior  In several paradigms  such as the technique of response priming  the behavior of subjects is clearly influenced by stimuli for which they report no awareness  and suitable experimental manipulations can lead to increasing priming effects despite decreasing prime identification  double dissociation              
Verbal report is widely considered to be the most reliable indicator of consciousness  but it raises a number of issues               For one thing  if verbal reports are treated as observations  akin to observations in other branches of science  then the possibility arises that they may contain errors but it is difficult to make sense of the idea that subjects could be wrong about their own experiences  and even more difficult to see how such an error could be detected               Daniel Dennett has argued for an approach he calls heterophenomenology  which means treating verbal reports as stories that may or may not be true  but his ideas about how to do this have not been widely adopted               Another issue with verbal report as a criterion is that it restricts the field of study to humans who have language  this approach cannot be used to study consciousness in other species  pre linguistic children  or people with types of brain damage that impair language  As a third issue  philosophers who dispute the validity of the Turing test may feel that it is possible  at least in principle  for verbal report to be dissociated from consciousness entirely  a philosophical zombie may give detailed verbal reports of awareness in the absence of any genuine awareness              
Although verbal report is in practice the  gold standard  for ascribing consciousness  it is not the only possible criterion               In medicine  consciousness is assessed as a combination of verbal behavior  arousal  brain activity  and purposeful movement  The last three of these can be used as indicators of consciousness when verbal behavior is absent                            The scientific literature regarding the neural bases of arousal and purposeful movement is very extensive  Their reliability as indicators of consciousness is disputed  however  due to numerous studies showing that alert human subjects can be induced to behave purposefully in a variety of ways in spite of reporting a complete lack of awareness              Studies related to the neuroscience of free will have also shown that the influence consciousness has on decision making is not always straightforward              

Mirror test and contingency awareness edit 
See also  Mirror test
Mirror test subjected on a common octopus
Another approach applies specifically to the study of self awareness  that is  the ability to distinguish oneself from others  In the     s Gordon Gallup developed an operational test for self awareness  known as the mirror test  The test examines whether animals are able to differentiate between seeing themselves in a mirror versus seeing other animals  The classic example involves placing a spot of coloring on the skin or fur near the individual s forehead and seeing if they attempt to remove it or at least touch the spot  thus indicating that they recognize that the individual they are seeing in the mirror is themselves               Humans  older than    months  and other great apes  bottlenose dolphins  orcas  pigeons  European magpies and elephants have all been observed to pass this test               While some other animals like pigs have been shown to find food by looking into the mirror              
Contingency awareness is another such approach  which is basically the conscious understanding of one s actions and its effects on one s environment               It is recognized as a factor in self recognition  The brain processes during contingency awareness and learning is believed to rely on an intact medial temporal lobe and age  A study done in      involving transcranial direct current stimulation  Magnetic resonance imaging  MRI  and eyeblink classical conditioning supported the idea that the parietal cortex serves as a substrate for contingency awareness and that age related disruption of this region is sufficient to impair awareness              

Neural correlates edit 
Schema of the neural processes underlying consciousness  from Christof Koch
A major part of the scientific literature on consciousness consists of studies that examine the relationship between the experiences reported by subjects and the activity that simultaneously takes place in their brains that is  studies of the neural correlates of consciousness  The hope is to find that activity in a particular part of the brain  or a particular pattern of global brain activity  which will be strongly predictive of conscious awareness  Several brain imaging techniques  such as EEG and fMRI  have been used for physical measures of brain activity in these studies              
Another idea that has drawn attention for several decades is that consciousness is associated with high frequency  gamma band  oscillations in brain activity  This idea arose from proposals in the     s  by Christof von der Malsburg and Wolf Singer  that gamma oscillations could solve the so called binding problem  by linking information represented in different parts of the brain into a unified experience               Rodolfo Llin s  for example  proposed that consciousness results from recurrent thalamo cortical resonance where the specific thalamocortical systems  content  and the non specific  centromedial thalamus  thalamocortical systems  context  interact in the gamma band frequency via synchronous oscillations              
A number of studies have shown that activity in primary sensory areas of the brain is not sufficient to produce consciousness  it is possible for subjects to report a lack of awareness even when areas such as the primary visual cortex  V   show clear electrical responses to a stimulus               Higher brain areas are seen as more promising  especially the prefrontal cortex  which is involved in a range of higher cognitive functions collectively known as executive functions               There is substantial evidence that a  top down  flow of neural activity  i e   activity propagating from the frontal cortex to sensory areas  is more predictive of conscious awareness than a  bottom up  flow of activity               The prefrontal cortex is not the only candidate area  however  studies by Nikos Logothetis and his colleagues have shown  for example  that visually responsive neurons in parts of the temporal lobe reflect the visual perception in the situation when conflicting visual images are presented to different eyes  i e   bistable percepts during binocular rivalry                Furthermore  top down feedback from higher to lower visual brain areas may be weaker or absent in the peripheral visual field  as suggested by some experimental data and theoretical arguments               nevertheless humans can perceive visual inputs in the peripheral visual field arising from bottom up V  neural activities                            Meanwhile  bottom up V  activities for the central visual fields can be vetoed  and thus made invisible to perception  by the top down feedback  when these bottom up signals are inconsistent with the brain s internal model of the visual world                           
Modulation of neural responses may correlate with phenomenal experiences  In contrast to the raw electrical responses that do not correlate with consciousness  the modulation of these responses by other stimuli correlates surprisingly well with an important aspect of consciousness  namely with the phenomenal experience of stimulus intensity  brightness  contrast   In the research group of Danko Nikoli  it has been shown that some of the changes in the subjectively perceived brightness correlated with the modulation of firing rates while others correlated with the modulation of neural synchrony               An fMRI investigation suggested that these findings were strictly limited to the primary visual areas               This indicates that  in the primary visual areas  changes in firing rates and synchrony can be considered as neural correlates of qualia at least for some type of qualia 
In       the perturbational complexity index  PCI  was proposed  a measure of the algorithmic complexity of the electrophysiological response of the cortex to transcranial magnetic stimulation  This measure was shown to be higher in individuals that are awake  in REM sleep or in a locked in state than in those who are in deep sleep or in a vegetative state               making it potentially useful as a quantitative assessment of consciousness states 
Assuming that not only humans but even some non mammalian species are conscious  a number of evolutionary approaches to the problem of neural correlates of consciousness open up  For example  assuming that birds are conscious a common assumption among neuroscientists and ethologists due to the extensive cognitive repertoire of birds there are comparative neuroanatomical ways to validate some of the principal  currently competing  mammalian consciousness brain theories  The rationale for such a comparative study is that the avian brain deviates structurally from the mammalian brain  So how similar are they  What homologs can be identified  The general conclusion from the study by Butler  et al               is that some of the major theories for the mammalian brain                                        also appear to be valid for the avian brain  The structures assumed to be critical for consciousness in mammalian brains have homologous counterparts in avian brains  Thus the main portions of the theories of Crick and Koch               Edelman and Tononi               and Cotterill              seem to be compatible with the assumption that birds are conscious  Edelman also differentiates between what he calls primary consciousness  which is a trait shared by humans and non human animals  and higher order consciousness as it appears in humans alone along with human language capacity               Certain aspects of the three theories  however  seem less easy to apply to the hypothesis of avian consciousness  For instance  the suggestion by Crick and Koch that layer   neurons of the mammalian brain have a special role  seems difficult to apply to the avian brain  since the avian homologs have a different morphology  Likewise  the theory of Eccles                           seems incompatible  since a structural homolog analogue to the dendron has not been found in avian brains  The assumption of an avian consciousness also brings the reptilian brain into focus  The reason is the structural continuity between avian and reptilian brains  meaning that the phylogenetic origin of consciousness may be earlier than suggested by many leading neuroscientists 
Joaquin Fuster of UCLA has advocated the position of the importance of the prefrontal cortex in humans  along with the areas of Wernicke and Broca  as being of particular importance to the development of human language capacities neuro anatomically necessary for the emergence of higher order consciousness in humans              
A study in      looked at lesions in specific areas of the brainstem that were associated with coma and vegetative states  A small region of the rostral dorsolateral pontine tegmentum in the brainstem was suggested to drive consciousness through functional connectivity with two cortical regions  the left ventral anterior insular cortex  and the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex  These three regions may work together as a triad to maintain consciousness              

Models edit 
Further information  Models of consciousness
A wide range of empirical theories of consciousness have been proposed                                         Adrian Doerig and colleagues list    notable theories               while Anil Seth and Tim Bayne list    notable theories              

Global workspace theory edit 
Global workspace theory  GWT  is a cognitive architecture and theory of consciousness proposed by the cognitive psychologist Bernard Baars in       Baars explains the theory with the metaphor of a theater  with conscious processes represented by an illuminated stage  This theater integrates inputs from a variety of unconscious and otherwise autonomous networks in the brain and then broadcasts them to unconscious networks  represented in the metaphor by a broad  unlit  audience    The theory has since been expanded upon by other scientists including cognitive neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene and Lionel Naccache                           

Integrated information theory edit 
Integrated information theory  IIT   pioneered by neuroscientist Giulio Tononi in       postulates that consciousness resides in the information being processed and arises once the information reaches a certain level of complexity  Additionally  IIT is one of the only leading theories of consciousness that attempts to create a     mapping between conscious states and precise  formal mathematical descriptions of those mental states  Proponents of this model suggest that it may provide a physical grounding for consciousness in neurons  as they provide the mechanism by which information is integrated  This also relates to the  hard problem of consciousness  proposed by David Chalmers  The theory remains controversial  because of its lack of credibility      clarification needed                                           

Orchestrated objective reduction edit 
Orchestrated objective reduction  Orch OR   or the quantum theory of mind  was proposed by scientists Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff  and states that consciousness originates at the quantum level inside neurons  The mechanism is held to be a quantum process called objective reduction that is orchestrated by cellular structures called microtubules  which form the cytoskeleton around which the brain is built  The duo proposed that these quantum processes accounted for creativity  innovation  and problem solving abilities  Penrose published his views in the book The Emperor s New Mind  In       the discovery of quantum vibrations inside microtubules gave new life to the argument             

Attention schema theory edit 
In       Graziano and Kastner              proposed the  attention schema  theory of awareness  In that theory  specific cortical areas  notably in the superior temporal sulcus and the temporo parietal junction  are used to build the construct of awareness and attribute it to other people  The same cortical machinery is also used to attribute awareness to oneself  Damage to these cortical regions can lead to deficits in consciousness such as hemispatial neglect  In the attention schema theory  the value of explaining the feature of awareness and attributing it to a person is to gain a useful predictive model of that person s attentional processing  Attention is a style of information processing in which a brain focuses its resources on a limited set of interrelated signals  Awareness  in this theory  is a useful  simplified schema that represents attentional states  To be aware of X is explained by constructing a model of one s attentional focus on X 

Entropic brain theory edit 
The entropic brain is a theory of conscious states informed by neuroimaging research with psychedelic drugs  The theory suggests that the brain in primary states such as rapid eye movement  REM  sleep  early psychosis and under the influence of psychedelic drugs  is in a disordered state  normal waking consciousness constrains some of this freedom and makes possible metacognitive functions such as internal self administered reality testing and self awareness                                                      Criticism has included questioning whether the theory has been adequately tested              

Projective consciousness model edit 
In       work by David Rudrauf and colleagues  including Karl Friston  applied the active inference paradigm to consciousness  leading to the projective consciousness model  PCM   a model of how sensory data is integrated with priors in a process of projective transformation  The authors argue that  while their model identifies a key relationship between computation and phenomenology  it does not completely solve the hard problem of consciousness or completely close the explanatory gap              

Claustrum being the conductor for consciousness edit 
In       a proposal was made by molecular biologist Francis Crick  co discoverer of the double helix   which stated that to bind together an individual s experience  a conductor of an orchestra is required  Together with neuroscientist Christof Koch  he proposed that this conductor would have to collate information rapidly from various regions of the brain  The duo reckoned that the claustrum was well suited for the task  However  Crick died while working on the idea             
The proposal is backed by a study done in       where a team at the George Washington University induced unconsciousness in a    year old woman suffering from intractable epilepsy by stimulating her claustrum  The woman underwent depth electrode implantation and electrical stimulation mapping  The electrode between the left claustrum and anterior dorsal insula was the one which induced unconsciousness  Correlation for interactions affecting medial parietal and posterior frontal channels during stimulation increased significantly as well  Their findings suggested that the left claustrum or anterior insula is an important part of a network that subserves consciousness  and that disruption of consciousness is related to increased EEG signal synchrony within frontal parietal networks  However  this remains an isolated  hence inconclusive study                          

Biological function and evolution edit 
The emergence of consciousness during biological evolution remains a topic of ongoing scientific inquiry  The survival value of consciousness is still a matter of exploration and understanding  While consciousness appears to play a crucial role in human cognition  decision making  and self awareness  its adaptive significance across different species remains a subject of debate 
Some people question whether consciousness has any survival value  Some argue that consciousness is a by product of evolution  Thomas Henry Huxley for example defends in an essay titled  On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata  and its History  an epiphenomenalist theory of consciousness  according to which consciousness is a causally inert effect of neural activity  as the steam whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery                To this William James objects in his essay Are We Automata  by stating an evolutionary argument for mind brain interaction implying that if the preservation and development of consciousness in the biological evolution is a result of natural selection  it is plausible that consciousness has not only been influenced by neural processes  but has had a survival value itself  and it could only have had this if it had been efficacious                            Karl Popper develops a similar evolutionary argument in the book The Self and Its Brain              
Opinions are divided on when and how consciousness first arose  It has been argued that consciousness emerged  i  exclusively with the first humans   ii  exclusively with the first mammals   iii  independently in mammals and birds  or  iv  with the first reptiles               Other authors date the origins of consciousness to the first animals with nervous systems or early vertebrates in the Cambrian over     million years ago               Donald Griffin suggests in his book Animal Minds a gradual evolution of consciousness               Further exploration of the origins of consciousness  particularly in molluscs  has been done by Peter Godfrey Smith in his book Metazoa              
Regarding the primary function of conscious processing  a recurring idea in recent theories is that phenomenal states somehow integrate neural activities and information processing that would otherwise be independent               This has been called the integration consensus  Another example has been proposed by Gerald Edelman called dynamic core hypothesis which puts emphasis on reentrant connections that reciprocally link areas of the brain in a massively parallel manner               Edelman also stresses the importance of the evolutionary emergence of higher order consciousness in humans from the historically older trait of primary consciousness which humans share with non human animals  see Neural correlates section above   These theories of integrative function present solutions to two classic problems associated with consciousness  differentiation and unity  They show how our conscious experience can discriminate between a virtually unlimited number of different possible scenes and details  differentiation  because it integrates those details from our sensory systems  while the integrative nature of consciousness in this view easily explains how our experience can seem unified as one whole despite all of these individual parts  However  it remains unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness  Nor is it explained what specific causal role conscious integration plays  nor why the same functionality cannot be achieved without consciousness  Not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously  e g   neural activity related to vegetative functions  reflexes  unconscious motor programs  low level perceptual analyzes  etc    and many kinds of information can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness  as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect               Hence it remains unclear why any of it is conscious  For a review of the differences between conscious and unconscious integrations  see the article of Ezequiel Morsella              
As noted earlier  even among writers who consider consciousness to be well defined  there is widespread dispute about which animals other than humans can be said to possess it               Edelman has described this distinction as that of humans possessing higher order consciousness while sharing the trait of primary consciousness with non human animals  see previous paragraph   Thus  any examination of the evolution of consciousness is faced with great difficulties  Nevertheless  some writers have argued that consciousness can be viewed from the standpoint of evolutionary biology as an adaptation in the sense of a trait that increases fitness               In his article  Evolution of consciousness   John Eccles argued that special anatomical and physical properties of the mammalian cerebral cortex gave rise to consciousness    a  psychon     linked to  a  dendron through quantum physics                 Bernard Baars proposed that once in place  this  recursive  circuitry may have provided a basis for the subsequent development of many of the functions that consciousness facilitates in higher organisms               Peter Carruthers has put forth one such potential adaptive advantage gained by conscious creatures by suggesting that consciousness allows an individual to make distinctions between appearance and reality               This ability would enable a creature to recognize the likelihood that their perceptions are deceiving them  e g  that water in the distance may be a mirage  and behave accordingly  and it could also facilitate the manipulation of others by recognizing how things appear to them for both cooperative and devious ends 
Other philosophers  however  have suggested that consciousness would not be necessary for any functional advantage in evolutionary processes                            No one has given a causal explanation  they argue  of why it would not be possible for a functionally equivalent non conscious organism  i e   a philosophical zombie  to achieve the very same survival advantages as a conscious organism  If evolutionary processes are blind to the difference between function F being performed by conscious organism O and non conscious organism O   it is unclear what adaptive advantage consciousness could provide               As a result  an exaptive explanation of consciousness has gained favor with some theorists that posit consciousness did not evolve as an adaptation but was an exaptation arising as a consequence of other developments such as increases in brain size or cortical rearrangement               Consciousness in this sense has been compared to the blind spot in the retina where it is not an adaption of the retina  but instead just a by product of the way the retinal axons were wired               Several scholars including Pinker  Chomsky  Edelman  and Luria have indicated the importance of the emergence of human language as an important regulative mechanism of learning and memory in the context of the development of higher order consciousness  see Neural correlates section above  

Altered states edit 
Main article  Altered state of consciousness
A Buddhist monk meditating
There are some brain states in which consciousness seems to be absent  including dreamless sleep or coma  There are also a variety of circumstances that can change the relationship between the mind and the world in less drastic ways  producing what are known as altered states of consciousness  Some altered states occur naturally  others can be produced by drugs or brain damage               Altered states can be accompanied by changes in thinking  disturbances in the sense of time  feelings of loss of control  changes in emotional expression  alternations in body image and changes in meaning or significance              
The two most widely accepted altered states are sleep and dreaming  Although dream sleep and non dream sleep appear very similar to an outside observer  each is associated with a distinct pattern of brain activity  metabolic activity  and eye movement  each is also associated with a distinct pattern of experience and cognition  During ordinary non dream sleep  people who are awakened report only vague and sketchy thoughts  and their experiences do not cohere into a continuous narrative  During dream sleep  in contrast  people who are awakened report rich and detailed experiences in which events form a continuous progression  which may however be interrupted by bizarre or fantastic intrusions                   failed verification      Thought processes during the dream state frequently show a high level of irrationality  Both dream and non dream states are associated with severe disruption of memory  it usually disappears in seconds during the non dream state  and in minutes after awakening from a dream unless actively refreshed              
Research conducted on the effects of partial epileptic seizures on consciousness found that patients who have partial epileptic seizures experience altered states of consciousness                            In partial epileptic seizures  consciousness is impaired or lost while some aspects of consciousness  often automated behaviors  remain intact  Studies found that when measuring the qualitative features during partial epileptic seizures  patients exhibited an increase in arousal and became absorbed in the experience of the seizure  followed by difficulty in focusing and shifting attention 
A variety of psychoactive drugs  including alcohol  have notable effects on consciousness               These range from a simple dulling of awareness produced by sedatives  to increases in the intensity of sensory qualities produced by stimulants  cannabis  empathogens entactogens such as MDMA   Ecstasy    or most notably by the class of drugs known as psychedelics               LSD  mescaline  psilocybin  dimethyltryptamine  and others in this group can produce major distortions of perception  including hallucinations  some users even describe their drug induced experiences as mystical or spiritual in quality  The brain mechanisms underlying these effects are not as well understood as those induced by use of alcohol               but there is substantial evidence that alterations in the brain system that uses the chemical neurotransmitter serotonin play an essential role              
There has been some research into physiological changes in yogis and people who practise various techniques of meditation  Some research with brain waves during meditation has reported differences between those corresponding to ordinary relaxation and those corresponding to meditation  It has been disputed  however  whether there is enough evidence to count these as physiologically distinct states of consciousness              
The most extensive study of the characteristics of altered states of consciousness was made by psychologist Charles Tart in the     s and     s  Tart analyzed a state of consciousness as made up of a number of component processes  including exteroception  sensing the external world   interoception  sensing the body   input processing  seeing meaning   emotions  memory  time sense  sense of identity  evaluation and cognitive processing  motor output  and interaction with the environment                   self published source      Each of these  in his view  could be altered in multiple ways by drugs or other manipulations  The components that Tart identified have not  however  been validated by empirical studies  Research in this area has not yet reached firm conclusions  but a recent questionnaire based study identified eleven significant factors contributing to drug induced states of consciousness  experience of unity  spiritual experience  blissful state  insightfulness  disembodiment  impaired control and cognition  anxiety  complex imagery  elementary imagery  audio visual synesthesia  and changed meaning of percepts              

Medical aspects edit 
The medical approach to consciousness is scientifically oriented  It derives from a need to treat people whose brain function has been impaired as a result of disease  brain damage  toxins  or drugs  In medicine  conceptual distinctions are considered useful to the degree that they can help to guide treatments  The medical approach focuses mostly on the amount of consciousness a person has  in medicine  consciousness is assessed as a  level  ranging from coma and brain death at the low end  to full alertness and purposeful responsiveness at the high end              
Consciousness is of concern to patients and physicians  especially neurologists and anesthesiologists  Patients may have disorders of consciousness or may need to be anesthetized for a surgical procedure  Physicians may perform consciousness related interventions such as instructing the patient to sleep  administering general anesthesia  or inducing medical coma               Also  bioethicists may be concerned with the ethical implications of consciousness in medical cases of patients such as the Karen Ann Quinlan case               while neuroscientists may study patients with impaired consciousness in hopes of gaining information about how the brain works              

Assessment edit 
In medicine  consciousness is examined using a set of procedures known as neuropsychological assessment               There are two commonly used methods for assessing the level of consciousness of a patient  a simple procedure that requires minimal training  and a more complex procedure that requires substantial expertise  The simple procedure begins by asking whether the patient is able to move and react to physical stimuli  If so  the next question is whether the patient can respond in a meaningful way to questions and commands  If so  the patient is asked for name  current location  and current day and time  A patient who can answer all of these questions is said to be  alert and oriented times four   sometimes denoted  A amp Ox   on a medical chart   and is usually considered fully conscious              
The more complex procedure is known as a neurological examination  and is usually carried out by a neurologist in a hospital setting  A formal neurological examination runs through a precisely delineated series of tests  beginning with tests for basic sensorimotor reflexes  and culminating with tests for sophisticated use of language  The outcome may be summarized using the Glasgow Coma Scale  which yields a number in the range       with a score of   to   indicating coma  and    indicating full consciousness  The Glasgow Coma Scale has three subscales  measuring the best motor response  ranging from  no motor response  to  obeys commands    the best eye response  ranging from  no eye opening  to  eyes opening spontaneously   and the best verbal response  ranging from  no verbal response  to  fully oriented    There is also a simpler pediatric version of the scale  for children too young to be able to use language              
In       an experimental procedure was developed to measure degrees of consciousness  the procedure involving stimulating the brain with a magnetic pulse  measuring resulting waves of electrical activity  and developing a consciousness score based on the complexity of the brain activity              

Disorders edit 
Medical conditions that inhibit consciousness are considered disorders of consciousness               This category generally includes minimally conscious state and persistent vegetative state  but sometimes also includes the less severe locked in syndrome and more severe chronic coma                            Differential diagnosis of these disorders is an active area of biomedical research                                         Finally  brain death results in possible irreversible disruption of consciousness               While other conditions may cause a moderate deterioration  e g   dementia and delirium  or transient interruption  e g   grand mal and petit mal seizures  of consciousness  they are not included in this category 




Disorder
Description


Locked in syndrome
The patient has awareness  sleep wake cycles  and meaningful behavior  viz   eye movement   but is isolated due to quadriplegia and pseudobulbar palsy 


Minimally conscious state
The patient has intermittent periods of awareness and wakefulness and displays some meaningful behavior 


Persistent vegetative state
The patient has sleep wake cycles  but lacks awareness and only displays reflexive and non purposeful behavior 


Chronic coma
The patient lacks awareness and sleep wake cycles and only displays reflexive behavior 


Brain death
The patient lacks awareness  sleep wake cycles  and brain mediated reflexive behavior 

Medical experts increasingly view anosognosia as a disorder of consciousness               Anosognosia is a Greek derived term meaning  unawareness of disease   This is a condition in which patients are disabled in some way  most commonly as a result of a stroke  but either misunderstand the nature of the problem or deny that there is anything wrong with them               The most frequently occurring form is seen in people who have experienced a stroke damaging the parietal lobe in the right hemisphere of the brain  giving rise to a syndrome known as hemispatial neglect  characterized by an inability to direct action or attention toward objects located to the left with respect to their bodies  Patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed on the left side of the body  but sometimes deny being unable to move  When questioned about the obvious problem  the patient may avoid giving a direct answer  or may give an explanation that does not make sense  Patients with hemispatial neglect may also fail to recognize paralyzed parts of their bodies  one frequently mentioned case is of a man who repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg out of the bed he was lying in  and when asked what he was doing  complained that somebody had put a dead leg into the bed with him  An even more striking type of anosognosia is Anton Babinski syndrome  a rarely occurring condition in which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally  and persist in this claim in spite of all evidence to the contrary              

Outside human adults edit 
In children edit

Of the eight types of consciousness in the Lycan classification  some are detectable in utero and others develop years after birth  Psychologist and educator William Foulkes studied children s dreams and concluded that prior to the shift in cognitive maturation that humans experience during ages five to seven               children lack the Lockean consciousness that Lycan had labeled  introspective consciousness  and that Foulkes labels  self reflection                In a      paper  Katherine Nelson and Robyn Fivush use  autobiographical consciousness  to label essentially the same faculty  and agree with Foulkes on the timing of this faculty s acquisition  Nelson and Fivush contend that  language is the tool by which humans create a new  uniquely human form of consciousness  namely  autobiographical consciousness                Julian Jaynes had staked out these positions decades earlier                            Citing the developmental steps that lead the infant to autobiographical consciousness  Nelson and Fivush point to the acquisition of  theory of mind   calling theory of mind  necessary for autobiographical consciousness  and defining it as  understanding differences between one s own mind and others  minds in terms of beliefs  desires  emotions and thoughts   They write   The hallmark of theory of mind  the understanding of false belief  occurs     at five to six years of age               

In animals edit 
Main article  Animal consciousness
The topic of animal consciousness is beset by a number of difficulties  It poses the problem of other minds in an especially severe form  because non human animals  lacking the ability to express human language  cannot tell humans about their experiences               Also  it is difficult to reason objectively about the question  because a denial that an animal is conscious is often taken to imply that it does not feel  its life has no value  and that harming it is not morally wrong  Descartes  for example  has sometimes been blamed for mistreatment of animals due to the fact that he believed only humans have a non physical mind               Most people have a strong intuition that some animals  such as cats and dogs  are conscious  while others  such as insects  are not  but the sources of this intuition are not obvious  and are often based on personal interactions with pets and other animals they have observed              

Thomas Nagel argues that while a human might be able to imagine what it is like to be a bat by taking  the bat s point of view   it would still be impossible  to know what it is like for a bat to be a bat    Townsend s big eared bat pictured  
Philosophers who consider subjective experience the essence of consciousness also generally believe  as a correlate  that the existence and nature of animal consciousness can never rigorously be known  Thomas Nagel spelled out this point of view in an influential essay titled  What Is it Like to Be a Bat    He said that an organism is conscious  if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism something it is like for the organism   and he argued that no matter how much we know about an animal s brain and behavior  we can never really put ourselves into the mind of the animal and experience its world in the way it does itself               Other thinkers  such as Douglas Hofstadter  dismiss this argument as incoherent               Several psychologists and ethologists have argued for the existence of animal consciousness by describing a range of behaviors that appear to show animals holding beliefs about things they cannot directly perceive Donald Griffin s      book Animal Minds reviews a substantial portion of the evidence              
On July          eminent scientists from different branches of neuroscience gathered at the University of Cambridge to celebrate the Francis Crick Memorial Conference  which deals with consciousness in humans and pre linguistic consciousness in nonhuman animals  After the conference  they signed in the presence of Stephen Hawking  the  Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness   which summarizes the most important findings of the survey 
 We decided to reach a consensus and make a statement directed to the public that is not scientific  It s obvious to everyone in this room that animals have consciousness  but it is not obvious to the rest of the world  It is not obvious to the rest of the Western world or the Far East  It is not obvious to the society               
 Convergent evidence indicates that non human animals      including all mammals and birds  and other creatures      have the necessary neural substrates of consciousness and the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors               

In artificial intelligence edit 
Main article  Artificial consciousness
The idea of an artifact made conscious is an ancient theme of mythology  appearing for example in the Greek myth of Pygmalion  who carved a statue that was magically brought to life  and in medieval Jewish stories of the Golem  a magically animated homunculus built of clay               However  the possibility of actually constructing a conscious machine was probably first discussed by Ada Lovelace  in a set of notes written in      about the Analytical Engine invented by Charles Babbage  a precursor  never built  to modern electronic computers  Lovelace was essentially dismissive of the idea that a machine such as the Analytical Engine could think in a humanlike way  She wrote 

It is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that might arise as to the powers of the Analytical Engine           The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything  It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform  It can follow analysis  but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths  Its province is to assist us in making available what we are already acquainted with              
One of the most influential contributions to this question was an essay written in      by pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing  titled Computing Machinery and Intelligence  Turing disavowed any interest in terminology  saying that even  Can machines think   is too loaded with spurious connotations to be meaningful  but he proposed to replace all such questions with a specific operational test  which has become known as the Turing test               To pass the test  a computer must be able to imitate a human well enough to fool interrogators  In his essay Turing discussed a variety of possible objections  and presented a counterargument to each of them  The Turing test is commonly cited in discussions of artificial intelligence as a proposed criterion for machine consciousness  it has provoked a great deal of philosophical debate  For example  Daniel Dennett and Douglas Hofstadter argue that anything capable of passing the Turing test is necessarily conscious               while David Chalmers argues that a philosophical zombie could pass the test  yet fail to be conscious               A third group of scholars have argued that with technological growth once machines begin to display any substantial signs of human like behavior then the dichotomy  of human consciousness compared to human like consciousness  becomes pass  and issues of machine autonomy begin to prevail even as observed in its nascent form within contemporary industry and technology                          J rgen Schmidhuber argues that consciousness is the result of compression               As an agent sees representation of itself recurring in the environment  the compression of this representation can be called consciousness 

John Searle in December     
In a lively exchange over what has come to be referred to as  the Chinese room argument   John Searle sought to refute the claim of proponents of what he calls  strong artificial intelligence  AI   that a computer program can be conscious  though he does agree with advocates of  weak AI  that computer programs can be formatted to  simulate  conscious states  His own view is that consciousness has subjective  first person causal powers by being essentially intentional due to the way human brains function biologically  conscious persons can perform computations  but consciousness is not inherently computational the way computer programs are  To make a Turing machine that speaks Chinese  Searle imagines a room with one monolingual English speaker  Searle himself  in fact   a book that designates a combination of Chinese symbols to be output paired with Chinese symbol input  and boxes filled with Chinese symbols  In this case  the English speaker is acting as a computer and the rulebook as a program  Searle argues that with such a machine  he would be able to process the inputs to outputs perfectly without having any understanding of Chinese  nor having any idea what the questions and answers could possibly mean  If the experiment were done in English  since Searle knows English  he would be able to take questions and give answers without any algorithms for English questions  and he would be effectively aware of what was being said and the purposes it might serve  Searle would pass the Turing test of answering the questions in both languages  but he is only conscious of what he is doing when he speaks English  Another way of putting the argument is to say that computer programs can pass the Turing test for processing the syntax of a language  but that the syntax cannot lead to semantic meaning in the way strong AI advocates hoped                           
In the literature concerning artificial intelligence  Searle s essay has been second only to Turing s in the volume of debate it has generated               Searle himself was vague about what extra ingredients it would take to make a machine conscious  all he proposed was that what was needed was  causal powers  of the sort that the brain has and that computers lack  But other thinkers sympathetic to his basic argument have suggested that the necessary  though perhaps still not sufficient  extra conditions may include the ability to pass not just the verbal version of the Turing test  but the robotic version               which requires grounding the robot s words in the robot s sensorimotor capacity to categorize and interact with the things in the world that its words are about  Turing indistinguishably from a real person  Turing scale robotics is an empirical branch of research on embodied cognition and situated cognition              
In       Victor Argonov has suggested a non Turing test for machine consciousness based on a machine s ability to produce philosophical judgments               He argues that a deterministic machine must be regarded as conscious if it is able to produce judgments on all problematic properties of consciousness  such as qualia or binding  having no innate  preloaded  philosophical knowledge on these issues  no philosophical discussions while learning  and no informational models of other creatures in its memory  such models may implicitly or explicitly contain knowledge about these creatures  consciousness   However  this test can be used only to detect  but not refute the existence of consciousness  A positive result proves that a machine is conscious but a negative result proves nothing  For example  absence of philosophical judgments may be caused by lack of the machine s intellect  not by absence of consciousness 

Stream of consciousness edit 
Main article  Stream of consciousness  psychology 
William James is usually credited with popularizing the idea that human consciousness flows like a stream  in his Principles of Psychology of      
According to James  the  stream of thought  is governed by five characteristics               

Every thought tends to be part of a personal consciousness 
Within each personal consciousness thought is always changing 
Within each personal consciousness thought is sensibly continuous 
It always appears to deal with objects independent of itself 
It is interested in some parts of these objects to the exclusion of others 
A similar concept appears in Buddhist philosophy  expressed by the Sanskrit term Citta sa t na  which is usually translated as mindstream or  mental continuum   Buddhist teachings describe that consciousness manifests moment to moment as sense impressions and mental phenomena that are continuously changing               The teachings list six triggers that can result in the generation of different mental events               These triggers are input from the five senses  seeing  hearing  smelling  tasting or touch sensations   or a thought  relating to the past  present or the future  that happen to arise in the mind  The mental events generated as a result of these triggers are  feelings  perceptions and intentions behaviour  The moment by moment manifestation of the mind stream is said to happen in every person all the time  It even happens in a scientist who analyzes various phenomena in the world  or analyzes the material body including the organ brain               The manifestation of the mindstream is also described as being influenced by physical laws  biological laws  psychological laws  volitional laws  and universal laws               The purpose of the Buddhist practice of mindfulness is to understand the inherent nature of the consciousness and its characteristics              

Narrative form edit 
In the West  the primary impact of the idea has been on literature rather than science   stream of consciousness as a narrative mode  means writing in a way that attempts to portray the moment to moment thoughts and experiences of a character  This technique perhaps had its beginnings in the monologues of Shakespeare s plays and reached its fullest development in the novels of James Joyce and Virginia Woolf  although it has also been used by many other noted writers              
Here  for example  is a passage from Joyce s Ulysses about the thoughts of Molly Bloom 

Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the City Arms hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out  d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a well educated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her              
Spiritual approaches edit 
Further information  Higher consciousness
The Upanishads hold the oldest recorded map of consciousness  as explored by sages through meditation              
The Canadian psychiatrist Richard Maurice Bucke  author of the      book Cosmic Consciousness  A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind  distinguished between three types of consciousness   Simple Consciousness   awareness of the body  possessed by many animals   Self Consciousness   awareness of being aware  possessed only by humans  and  Cosmic Consciousness   awareness of the life and order of the universe  possessed only by humans who have attained  intellectual enlightenment or illumination               
Another thorough account of the spiritual approach is Ken Wilber s      book The Spectrum of Consciousness  a comparison of western and eastern ways of thinking about the mind  Wilber described consciousness as a spectrum with ordinary awareness at one end  and more profound types of awareness at higher levels              
Other examples include the various levels of spiritual consciousness presented by Prem Saran Satsangi and Stuart Hameroff

Notes edit 


  From the introduction by Ralph Barton Perry       

  From the Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy          Locke s use of  consciousness  was widely adopted in British philosophy  In the late nineteenth century the term  introspection  began to be used  G  F  Stout s definition is typical   To introspect is to attend to the workings of one s own mind                                                      

   Investigating  how experience ensues from the brain   rather than exploring a factual claim  betrays a philosophical commitment
