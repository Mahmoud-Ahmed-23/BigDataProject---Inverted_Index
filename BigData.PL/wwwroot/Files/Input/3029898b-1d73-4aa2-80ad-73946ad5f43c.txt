    How Should Investors Respond to Trump s Tariff Turmoil 

The global markets have been rocked by renewed trade tensions  with nearly      trillion wiped from equity values following new US tariffs targeting over     countries  Investors now face a crucial question  should they  buy the dip  or pull out before things worsen 

While some see opportunity buying into stocks like Nvidia and Rolls Royce others are moving toward safer assets like bonds and cash  Yet  risk indicators such as the Put Call ratio and the CBOE Skew Index remain neutral  signaling caution but not full panic 

The deeper concern  Inflation  Fidelity International estimates that the full implementation of Trump s tariffs could trigger a     percentage point shock to US inflation  complicating the Federal Reserve s ability to cut interest rates  Meanwhile  economists warn of a      trillion hit to the global economy and a decline in real income per capita in the US 

Major institutional investors  including the UK s CCLA  have already reduced their equity exposure  anticipating long term volatility 

In uncertain times like these  experts urge a calm  disciplined approach  diversify  stay informed  and avoid emotional decisions
