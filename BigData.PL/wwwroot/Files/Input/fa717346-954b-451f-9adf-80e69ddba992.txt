Discipline covering formal decision making
Decision analysis  DA  is the discipline comprising the philosophy  methodology  and professional practice necessary to address important decisions in a formal manner  Decision analysis includes many procedures  methods  and tools for identifying  clearly representing  and formally assessing important aspects of a decision  for prescribing a recommended course of action by applying the maximum expected utility axiom to a well formed representation of the decision  and for translating the formal representation of a decision and its corresponding recommendation into insight for the decision maker  and other corporate and non corporate stakeholders 


History edit 
In       mathematical philosopher Frank Ramsey pioneered the idea of subjective probability as a  representation of an individual s beliefs or uncertainties  Then  in the     s  mathematician John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern developed an axiomatic basis for utility theory as a way of expressing an individual s preferences over uncertain outcomes   This is in contrast to social choice theory  which addresses the problem of deriving group preferences from individual preferences    Statistician Leonard Jimmie Savage then developed an alternate  axiomatic framework for decision analysis in the early     s   The resulting expected utility theory provides a complete axiomatic basis for decision making under uncertainty 
Once these basic theoretical developments had been established  the methods of decision analysis were then further codified and popularized  becoming widely taught  e g   in business schools and departments of industrial engineering   A brief and highly accessible introductory text was published in      by decision theorist Howard Raiffa of the Harvard Business School             Subsequently  in       Ralph Keeney and Howard Raiffa extended the basics of utility theory to provide a comprehensive methodology for handling decisions involving trade offs between multiple objectives             Engineering professor Ron Howard of Stanford University and decision analyst Jim Matheson then published  in       a set of readings on decision analysis             this was expanded into a two volume set in                  Subsequent textbooks and additional developments are documented below under Further reading 
Although decision analysis is inherently interdisciplinary  involving contributions from mathematicians  philosophers  economists  statisticians  and cognitive psychologists   it has historically been considered a branch of operations research  In       the Decision Analysis Society was formed as a special interest group within Operations Research Society of America  ORSA   which later merged with The Institute of Management Sciences  TIMS  to become the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences  INFORMS   Beginning in       INFORMS has published a dedicated journal for these topics  Decision Analysis 
Following along with these academic developments  decision analysis has also evolved into a mature professional discipline             The method has been used to support business and public policy decision making since the late     s  applications from           were reviewed in the inaugural issue of Decision Analysis              Decision analysis has been especially widely adopted in the pharmaceutical industry and the oil and gas industry  since both industries regularly need to make large high risk decisions  e g   about investing in development of a new drug or making a major acquisition             

Methodology edit 
Framing is the front end of decision analysis  which focuses on developing an opportunity statement  what and why   boundary conditions  success measures  a decision hierarchy  strategy table  and action items   It is sometimes believed that the application of decision analysis always requires the use of quantitative methods   In reality  however  many decisions can be made using qualitative tools that are part of the decision analysis toolbox  such as value focused thinking             without the need for quantitative methods 
The framing process may lead to the development of an influence diagram or decision tree   These are commonly used graphical representations of decision analysis problems  These graphical tools are used to represent the alternatives available to the decision maker  the uncertainties they involve  and how well the decision maker s objectives would be achieved by various final outcomes  They can also form the basis of a quantitative model when needed   For example  quantitative methods of conducting Bayesian inference and identifying optimal decisions using influence diagrams were developed in the     s                         and are now incorporated in software 
In a quantitative decision analysis model  uncertainties are represented through probabilities    specifically  subjective probabilities  The decision maker s attitude to risk is represented by utility functions  and the attitude to trade offs between conflicting objectives can be expressed using multi attribute value functions or multi attribute utility functions  if there is risk involved    In some cases  utility functions can be replaced by the probability of achieving an uncertain aspiration level or  target                            Based on the axioms of decision analysis  the best decision to choose is the one whose consequences have the maximum expected utility  or that maximizes the probability of achieving the uncertain aspiration level  
It is sometimes assumed that quantitative decision analysis can be applied only to factors that lend themselves easily to measurement  e g   in natural units such as dollars    However  quantitative decision analysis and related methods  such as applied information economics  can also be applied even to seemingly intangible factors  

Decision analysis as a prescriptive approach edit 
Prescriptive decision making research focuses on how to make  optimal  decisions  based on the axioms of rationality   while descriptive decision making research aims to explain how people actually make decisions  regardless of whether their decisions are  good  or optimal    Unsurprisingly  therefore  there are numerous situations in which decisions made by individuals depart markedly from the decisions that would be recommended by decision analysis 
Some have criticized formal methods of decision analysis for allowing decision makers to avoid taking responsibility for their own decisions  and instead recommend reliance on intuition or  gut feelings                Moreover  for decisions that must be made under significant time pressure  it is not surprising that formal methods of decision analysis are of little use  with intuition and expertise becoming more important             
However  when time permits  studies have demonstrated that quantitative algorithms for decision making can yield results that are superior to  unaided intuition               In addition  despite the known biases in the types of human judgments required for decision analysis  research has shown at least a modest benefit of training and feedback in reducing bias             
Critics cite the phenomenon of paralysis by analysis as one possible consequence of over reliance on decision analysis in organizations  the expense of decision analysis is in itself a factor in the analysis   However  strategies are available to reduce such risk             
There is currently a great deal of interest in quantitative methods for decision making   However  many such methods depart from the axioms of decision analysis  and can therefore generate misleading recommendations under some circumstances  so are not truly prescriptive methods   Some of the most popular of such non decision analytic methods include fuzzy set theory for the representation of uncertainties  and the analytic hierarchy process for the representation of preferences or value judgments   While there may occasionally be justification for such methods in applications  e g   based on ease of use   decision analysts would argue for multi attribute utility theory as the gold standard to which other methods should be compared  based on its rigorous axiomatic basis 
Although decision analysis has been frequently used in support of government decision making  it is important to note that the basic theory applies only to individual decision makers   There is unfortunately no axiomatic prescriptive theory comparable to decision analysis that is specifically designed for group or public policy decisions   For more on this topic  see group decision making for discussions of the behavioral issues involved in group decisions  and social choice theory for theoretical considerations that can affect group decisions 

Applications edit 
Decision analytic methods have been used in a wide variety of fields  including business  planning  marketing  negotiation   management  environmental remediation  health care  research  energy  exploration  litigation and dispute resolution  etc   An important early application was a study of the pros and cons of hurricane seeding  undertaken by the Stanford Research Institute in the early     s for the Environmental Science Services Administration  a predecessor of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration              
Decision analysis is today used by major corporations to make multibillion dollar capital investments  For example  In       Chevron won the Decision Analysis Society Practice Award for its use of decision analysis in all major decisions              In a video detailing Chevron s use of decision analysis  Chevron Vice Chairman George Kirkland notes that  decision analysis is a part of how Chevron does business for a simple  but powerful  reason  it works               It can also be used to make complex personal decisions  such as planning for retirement  deciding when to have a child              planning a major vacation  or choosing among several possible medical treatments  

Energy  Decision analysis has been used to structure the energy objectives for Germany                         
Entrepreneurship  The concept of certainty equivalents from decision analysis was used to design novel and highly efficient mechanisms for funding of new businesses that are desirable to both backers and entrepreneurs             
Health Care  Decision analysis has been applied to medical decision making regarding breast cancer diagnosis             and therapy              treatment of thyroid cancer              and lung cancer             
Insurance  Decision analysts have explored the use of insurance as a mechanism to encourage adoption of beneficial health behaviors              The method has also been applied to determine optimal strategies for purchase of long term care insurance as a function of age  wealth  and risk tolerance             
Litigation  Attorneys have used decision analysis to identify strategies likely to lead to beneficial outcomes in litigation             
Portfolio Management  Decision analysis has been recommended as a method of improving resource allocations in portfolio management                        
Military Planning  Decision analysis has been applied to the problem of base closure             
Radioactive Waste  Decision analysis has been used to evaluate alternatives for radioactive waste repositories in both the United States and the United Kingdom                           At a smaller scale  it has also been used to evaluate options for dealing with surplus weapons grade plutonium                         
Research and Development  Decision analysis has been used to recommend portfolios of projects to fund in research and development             
Terrorism and Homeland Security  Decision analysis has been used to represent the values of both terrorists and defenders to support homeland security decision making
