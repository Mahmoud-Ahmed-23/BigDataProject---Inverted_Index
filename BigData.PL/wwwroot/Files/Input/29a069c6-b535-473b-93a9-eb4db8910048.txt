Recidivism   r  s d v z m   from Latin  recidivus  recurring   derived from re   again  and cadere  to fall   is the act of a person repeating an undesirable behavior after they have experienced negative consequences of that behavior  or have been trained to extinguish it  Recidivism is also used to refer to the percentage of former prisoners who are rearrested for a similar offense            
The term is frequently used in conjunction with criminal behavior and substance abuse  Recidivism is a synonym of relapse  which is more commonly used in medicine and in the disease model of addiction      medical citation needed     


Causes edit 
A      study found that harsh prison conditions  including isolation  tended to increase recidivism  though none of these effects were statistically significant             Various researchers have noted that prisoners are stripped of civil rights and are reluctantly absorbed into communities        which further increases their alienation and isolation  Other contributors to recidivism include the difficulties released offenders face in finding jobs  in renting apartments or in getting education  Owners of businesses will often refuse to hire a convicted felon and are at best hesitant  especially when filling any position that entails even minor responsibility or the handling of money  this includes most work   especially to those convicted of thievery  such as larceny  or to drug addicts              Many leasing corporations  those organisations and people who own and rent apartments  as of          update      routinely perform criminal background checks and disqualify ex convicts   However  especially in the inner city or in areas with high crime rates  lessors may not always apply their official policies in this regard  When they do  apartments may be rented by someone other than the occupant  People with criminal records report difficulty or inability to find educational opportunities  and are often denied financial aid based on their records  In the United States of America  those found guilty of even a minor misdemeanor  in some states  a citation offense  such as a traffic ticket      citation needed      or misdemeanour drug offence  e g  possession of marijuana or heroin  while receiving Federal student aid are disqualified from receiving further aid for a specified period of time            

Prediction edit 
The likelihood of recidivism for a previously convicted criminal can be predicted using structured professional judgement  SPJ  tools in an effort to reduce recidivism by measuring protective factors such as stable work  attitudes towards authority and living circumstances  Two tools used for SPJ include the HCR               and the newer SAPROF developed in the late     s                        SPJ tools are also used in forensic psychiatry 

Effect of employment edit 
Most research regarding recidivism indicates that those ex inmates that obtain employment after release from prison tend to have lower rates of recidivism              In one study  it was found that even if marginal employment  especially for ex inmates over the age of     is offered to ex inmates  those ex inmates are less likely to commit crime than their counterparts              Another study found that ex inmates were less likely to re offend if they found and maintained stable employment throughout their first year of parole             
African Americans are disproportionately represented in the American prison system  representing approximately half the prison population              Of this population  many enter into the prison system with less than a high school diploma              The lack of education makes ex inmates qualify for low skill  low wage employment   In addition to lack of education  many inmates report a difficulty in finding employment prior to incarceration              If an ex inmate served a long prison sentence  they have lost an opportunity to gain work experience or network with potential job employers   Because of this  employers and agencies that assist with employment believe that ex inmates cannot obtain or maintain employment            
For African American ex inmates  their race is an added barrier to obtaining employment after release   According to one study  African Americans are more likely to re offend because employment opportunities are not as available in the communities they return to in relation to whites             

Effect of education edit 
Educational programs in prisons have demonstrated significant benefits  particularly in reducing recidivism rates and improving post release employment outcomes  As of       approximately       of inmates were rearrested after three years and       after five years              However  when participating in educational programs  inmates can reduce their chances of recidivism anywhere from      to                  Inmates  in regards to partaking in educational programs  can improve cognitive ability  work skills as well as being able to further their education upon release   Moreover  inmates with higher educational levels lower their odds of recidivism  For instance  inmates who have attained a certificate of vocation reduce recidivating by        and inmates who have attained a GED reduce recidivating by                   However  inmates with an Associates in Arts or Associates in Science reduce recidivating by                  
Additionally  while taxpayers are adversely affected as their tax money goes into the prison system  educating inmates is cost effective              Investing in education can drastically reduce incarceration costs  For a one dollar investment in educational programs  there would be a reduction of costs of incarceration by nearly five dollars              Also  the Three State Recidivism Study found that  two dollars are reduced for every dollar saved on correctional education  One of the states studied  Maryland  benefited from almost       million in returns  as they had a budget of       million allocated for correctional education              Overall  education reduces recidivism rates which can reduce cost of incarceration as well as reduce the number of people who commit crime within the community             
Three State Recidivism Study
Maryland  Minnesota and Ohio were involved in a study pertaining to education and recidivism  This study was conducted by the Correctional Education Association  CEA  for the U S  Department of Correctional Education from      to      and published in       Stephen Steurer  Ph D   a researcher and the Executive Direction of the CEA  was the Project Director  The lead researcher  Linda Smith  Ph D  and project manager  Alice Tracy  Ph D  were main researchers as well              Over       released inmates were examined in how educational participation while incarcerated impacted their post release behavior  To determine the influence of education on recidivism  researchers interviewed inmates  collected their criminal history and educational data  and post release data  With this information  it was determined that participants in prison education  reduced recidivism                 

Institutions and Correctional Facilities edit 
Across the United States     to     of incarcerated individuals have not earned a high school diploma or its equivalent              Thus  all U S  prisons have basic and remedial education programs that are designed to provide incarcerated individuals with the opportunity to attain the knowledge and skills equivalent to a high school diploma             
Some prisons offer vocational training  Vocational education directly prepares students for specific occupations rather than broad intellectual cultivation              Common vocational training programs can include the following  carpentry  electrical work  landscaping  office services  welding  Correctional facilities can offer reading and writing groups  This form of education is meant to use literature and writing as a form of therapy and can be referred to as  bibliotherapy   Such programs can encourage interpersonal skills and social engagement within incarcerated individuals              
Degree granting education programs are another form of educational opportunity available in correctional facilities              These programs are typically offered by institutions with well established academic reputations  many of which are listed in the National Directory of Higher Education in Prison Programs  These institutions work to ensure that incarcerated students receive the same level of educational quality as their on campus counterparts  Despite being a powerful tool for reducing recidivism  these programs remain uncommon in prisons due to financial and institutional constraints 

Mental disorders edit 
Psychopaths may have a markedly distorted sense of the potential consequences of their actions  not only for others  but also for themselves  They do not  for example  deeply recognize the risk of being caught  disbelieved or injured as a result of their behaviour              However  numerous studies and recent large scale meta analysis cast serious doubt on claims made about the ability of psychopathy ratings to predict who will offend or respond to treatment                                                                                                 
In       Carmel stated that the term recidivism is often used in the psychiatric and mental health literature to mean  rehospitalization   which is problematic because the concept of recidivism generally refers to criminal reoffense              Carmel reviewed the medical literature for articles with recidivism  vs  terms like rehospitalization  in the title and found that articles in the psychiatric literature were more likely to use the term recidivism with its criminological connotation than articles in the rest of medicine  which avoided the term  Carmel suggested that  as a means of decreasing stigmatization of psychiatric patients  we should avoid the word  recidivism  when what we mean is  rehospitalization    A      followup by Peirson argued that  public policy makers and leaders should be careful to not misuse the word and unwittingly stigmatize persons with mental illness and substance use disorders              

Law and economics edit 
The law and economics literature has provided various justifications for the fact that the sanction imposed on an offender depends on whether he was convicted previously  In particular  some authors such as Rubinstein        and Polinsky and Rubinfeld        have argued that a record of prior offenses provides information about the offender s characteristics  e g   a higher than average propensity to commit crimes                           However  Shavell        has pointed out that making sanctions depend on offense history may be advantageous even when there are no characteristics to be learned about  In particular  Shavell        p            argues that when  detection of a violation implies not only an immediate sanction  but also a higher sanction for a future violation  an individual will be deterred more from committing a violation presently               Building on Shavell s        insights  M ller and Schmitz        show that it may actually be optimal to further amplify the overdeterrence of repeat offenders when exogenous restrictions on penalties for first time offenders are relaxed             
Also  economists and scholars who research issues related to the IMF use the term recidivism to refer to the behaviour of states who repeatedly engage in IMF economic programs such as SBAs  For example  South Korea  Zaire  Liberia and Panama each spent well over    years under consecutive IMF agreements             

Policies addressing recidivism edit 
Countless policies aim to ameliorate recidivism  but many involve a complete overhaul of societal values concerning justice  punishment  and second chances      citation needed      Other proposals have little impact due to cost and resource issues and other constraints  Plausible approaches include 

allowing current trends to continue without additional intervention  maintaining the status quo 
increasing the presence and quality of pre release services  within incarceration facilities  that address factors associated with  for example  drug related criminality addiction treatment and mental health counseling and education programs vocational training
increasing the presence and quality of community based organizations that provide post release reentry services  in the same areas mentioned in approach   
Prison contemplative programs
The current criminal justice system focuses on the front end  arrest and incarceration   and largely ignores the tail end  and preparation for the tail end   which includes rehabilitation and re entry into the community   In most correctional facilities  if planning for re entry takes place at all  it only begins a few weeks or months before the release of an inmate    This process is often referred to as release planning or transition planning and its parameters may be largely limited to helping a person identify a place to stay upon release and  possibly  a source of income               A judge in Missouri  David Mason  believes the Transcendental Meditation program is a successful tool for rehabilitation  Mason and four other Missouri state and federal judges have sentenced offenders to learn the Transcendental Meditation program as an anti recidivism modality             

By country edit 
Norway edit 
Further information  Incarceration in Norway and Crime in Norway
Norway has one of the lowest reimprisonment rates within   years in the world at     in                                   in           in           in           in       and     in                   In Norway the recidivism rate measured by re charging in the   year period from base year      is for any charged offense        for property theft        for criminal damage        for violence and maltreatment        for sexual offenses        for drug and alcohol offenses        and for traffic offenses                    Prisons in Norway and the Norwegian criminal justice system focus on restorative justice and rehabilitating prisoners rather than punishment             

United States edit

According to the latest study by the US Department of Justice  recidivism measures require three characteristics     a starting event  such as a release from prison    a measure of failure following the starting event  such as a subsequent arrest  conviction  or return to prison    an observation or follow up period that generally extends from the date of the starting event to a predefined end date as in   months    year    years    years  or   years               The latest   Government study of recidivism  reported that     of state prisoners were arrested at some point in the   years following their release  A large majority of those were arrested within the first   years  and more than     get rearrested within the first year  However  the longer the time period  the higher the reported recidivism rate  but the lower the actual threat to public safety             
According to an April      report by the Pew Center on the States        of prisoners released in      were reincarcerated within   years             
According to the National Institute of Justice  almost    percent of the recently released return before the end of their first year out  About    percent of         prisoners released in    states in      were arrested for a new crime within three years of their release from prison  and    percent were arrested within five years  and by year nine that number reaches    percent             
Beginning in the     s  the US rate of incarceration increased dramatically  filling prisons to capacity in bad conditions for inmates   Crime continues inside many prison walls  Gangs exist on the inside  often with tactical decisions made by imprisoned leaders             
While the US justice system has traditionally focused its efforts at the front end of the system  by locking people up  it has not exerted an equal effort at the tail end of the system  decreasing the likelihood of reoffending among formerly incarcerated persons  This is a significant issue because ninety five percent of prisoners will be released back into the community at some point             
A cost study performed by the Vera Institute of Justice              a non profit committed to decarceration in the United States  found that the average per inmate cost of incarceration among the    states surveyed was         per year             
According to a national study published in      by The Urban Institute  within three years almost   out of    released males will be rearrested and half will be back in prison              The study says this happens due to personal and situation characteristics  including the individual s social environment of peers  family  community  and state level policies             
There are many other factors in recidivism  such as the individual s circumstances before incarceration  events during their incarceration  and the period after they are released from prison  both immediate and long term 
One of the main reasons why they find themselves back in jail is because it is difficult for the individual to fit back in with  normal  life   They have to reestablish ties with their family  return to high risk places and secure formal identification  they often have a poor work history and now have a criminal record to deal with   Many prisoners report being anxious about their release  they are excited about how their life will be different  this time  which does not always end up being the case             

Drug related crime edit 
Of US federal inmates in      about half       were serving time for drug offenses             
It is estimated that three quarters of those returning to prison have a history of substance abuse  Over    percent of mentally ill prisoners in the United States also have a substance use disorder              Nevertheless  only   to    percent of prisoners who meet DSM criteria for a substance use disorder receive treatment             
Persons who are incarcerated or otherwise have compulsory involvement with the criminal justice system show rates of substance abuse and dependence four times higher than those of the general population  yet fewer than    percent of federal and state prisoners who meet the pertinent diagnostic criteria receive treatment             
Studies assessing the effectiveness of alcohol drug treatment have shown that inmates who participate in residential treatment programs while incarcerated have   to    percent lower recidivism rates and    to    percent lower drug relapse rates than their counterparts who receive no treatment in prison              Inmates who receive aftercare  treatment continuation upon release  demonstrate an even greater reduction in recidivism rate             

Recidivism rates edit 
The United States Department of Justice tracked the re arrest  re conviction  and re incarceration of former inmates for   years after their release from prisons in    states in                    Key findings include 


Released prisoners with the highest rearrest rates were robbers          burglars          larcenists          motor vehicle thieves          those in prison for possessing or selling stolen property         and those in prison for possessing  using or selling illegal weapons         
Within   years       of released rapists were arrested for another rape  and      of those who had served time for homicide were arrested for another homicide   These are the lowest rates of re arrest for the same category of crime 
The         offenders discharged in      had accumulated     million arrest charges before their most recent imprisonment and another         charges within   years of release 

The Prison Policy Initiative analyzed the recidivism rates associated with various initial offenses and found that statistically   people convicted of any violent offense are less likely to be re arrested in the years after release than those convicted of property  drug  or public order offenses              
The ability of former criminals to achieve social mobility appears to narrow as criminal records become electronically stored and accessible             
An accused s history of convictions are called antecedents  known colloquially as  previous  or  form  in the UK and  priors  in the United States and Australia 
There are organizations that help with the re integration of ex detainees into society by helping them obtain work  teaching them various societal skills  and by providing all around support 
In an effort to be more fair and to avoid adding to already high imprisonment rates in the US  courts across America have started using quantitative risk assessment software when trying to make decisions about releasing people on bail and sentencing  which are based on their history and other attributes               It analyzed recidivism risk scores calculated by one of the most commonly used tools  the Northpointe COMPAS system  and looked at outcomes over two years  and found that only     of those deemed high risk actually committed additional crimes during that period and that African American defendants were far more likely to be given high scores than white defendants             
The TRACER Act is intended to monitor released terrorists to prevent recidivism  Nevertheless  rates of re offending for political crimes are much less than for non political crimes             

African Americans and recidivism edit 
With regard to the United States incarceration rate  African Americans represent only about    percent of the United States population  yet account for approximately half the prison population as well as ex offenders once released from prison              As compared to whites  African Americans are incarcerated     times higher for violent offenses      times higher for property offenses and     times higher for drug offenses             
African Americans comprise a majority of the prison reentry population  yet few studies have been aimed at studying recidivism among this population   Recidivism is highest amongst those under the age of    who are male and African American  and African Americans have significantly higher levels of recidivism as compared to whites             
The sheer number of ex inmates exiting prison into the community is significant  however  chances of recidivism are low for those who avoid contact with the law for at least three years after release              The communities ex inmates are released into play a part in their likelihood to re offend  release of African American ex inmates into communities with higher levels of racial inequality  i e  communities where poverty and joblessness affect members of one ethnicity more so than others  has been shown to be correlated with higher rates of recidivism  possibly due to the ex inmates being  isolated from employers  health care services  and other institutions that can facilitate a law abiding reentry into society              

Reducing recidivism among African Americans edit 
A cultural re grounding of African Americans is important to improve self esteem and help develop a sense of community             
Culturally specific programs and services that focus on characteristics that include the target population values  beliefs  and styles of problem solving may be beneficial in reducing recidivism among African American inmates      citation needed      programs involving social skills training and social problem solving could also be effective             
For example  research shows that treatment effectiveness should include cognitive behavioral and social learning techniques of modeling  role playing  reinforcement  extinction  resource provision  concrete verbal suggestions  symbolic modeling  giving reasons  prompting  and cognitive restructuring  the effectiveness of the intervention incorporates a relapse prevention element   Relapse prevention is a cognitive behavioral approach to self management that focuses on teaching alternate responses to high risk situations              Research also shows that restorative justice approaches to rehabilitation and reentry coupled with the therapeutic benefits of working with plants  say through urban agriculture  lead to psychosocial healing and reintegration into one s former community             
Several theories suggest that access to low skill employment among parolees is likely to have favorable outcomes  at least over the short term  by strengthening internal and external social controls that constrain behavior toward legal employment   Any legal employment upon release from prison may help to tip the balance of economic choice toward not needing to engage in criminal activity              Employment as a turning point enhances attachment and commitment to mainstream individuals and pursuits  From that perspective  ex inmates are constrained from criminal acts because they are more likely to weigh the risk of severing social ties prior to engaging in illegal behavior and opt to refuse to engage in criminal activity             
In       a bipartisan effort  headed by Koch family foundations and the ACLU  reforms to reduce recidivism rates among low income minority communities were announced with major support across political ideologies  President Obama has praised these efforts who noted the unity will lead to an improved situation of the prison system                         
There is greater indication that education in prison helps prevent reincarceration             

Studies edit 
There have been hundreds of studies on the relationship between correctional interventions and recidivism   These studies show that a reliance on only supervision and punitive sanctions can actually increase the likelihood of someone reoffending  while well implemented prison and reentry programs can substantially reduce recidivism              Counties  states  and the federal government will often commission studies on trends in recidivism  in addition to research on the impacts of their programming 

Minnesota edit 
The Minnesota Department of Corrections did a study on criminals who are in prison to see if rehabilitation during incarceration correlates with recidivism or saved the state money   They used the Minnesota s Challenge Incarceration Program  CIP  which consisted of three phases   The first was a six month institutional phase followed by two aftercare phases  each lasting at least six months  for a total of about eighteen months   The first phase was the  boot camp  phase   Here  inmates had daily schedules sixteen hours long where they participated in activities and showed discipline   Some activities in phase one included physical training  manual labor  skills training  drug therapy  and transition planning   The second and third phases were called  community phases    In phase two the participants are on intensive supervised release  ISR    ISR includes being in contact with your supervisor on a daily basis  being a full time employee  keeping curfew  passing random drug and alcohol tests  and doing community service while continuing to participate completely in the program   The final phase is phase three   During this phase one is still on ISR and has to remain in the community while maintaining a full time job   They have to continue with community service and their participation in the program   Once phase three is complete participants have  graduated  CIP   They are then put on supervision until the end of their sentence   Inmates who drop out or fail to complete the program are sent back to prison to serve the rest of their sentence  Information was gathered through a quasi experimental design   This compared the recidivism rates of the CIP participants with a control group   The findings of the study have shown that the CIP program did not significantly reduce the chances of recidivism   However  CIP did increase the amount of time before rearrest   Moreover  CIP early release graduates lower the costs for the state by millions every year             

Kentucky edit 
A study was done by Robert Stanz in Jefferson County  Kentucky  which discussed an alternative to jail time   The alternative was  home incarceration  in which the defendant would complete his or her time at home instead of in jail  According to the study   Results show that the majority of offenders do successfully complete the program  but that a majority are also re arrested within   years of completion               In doing this  they added to the rate of recidivism  In doing a study on the results of this program  Stanz considered age  race  neighborhood  and several other aspects   Most of the defendants who fell under the recidivism category included those who were younger  those who were sentenced for multiple charges  those accruing fewer technical violations  males  and those of African American descent              In contrast  a study published by the African Journal of Criminology and Justice Studies in      used data from the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections to examine       juvenile offenders who were released in the           fiscal year 
The study built a socio demographic of the offenders who were returned to the correctional system within a year of release  There was no significant difference between black offenders and white offenders  The study concluded that race does not play an important role in juvenile recidivism  The findings ran counter to conventional beliefs on the subject  which may not have controlled for other variables             

Methadone maintenance therapy  MMT  edit 
A study was conducted regarding the recidivism rate of inmates receiving MMT  Methadone Maintenance Therapy    This therapy is intended to wean heroin users from the drug by administering small doses of methadone  thereby avoiding withdrawal symptoms      inmates who took part in MMT programs between    November      and    October      were observed after their release  Among these former inmates   there was no statistically significant effect of receiving methadone in the jail or dosage on subsequent recidivism risks

Male prisoners are exposed and subject to sexual and physical violence in prisons   When these events occur  the victim usually suffers emotionally and physically  Studies suggest that this leads the inmate to accept these types of behaviors and value their lives and the lives of others less when they are released   These dehumanizing acts  combined with learned violent behavior  are implicated in higher recidivism rates             Two studies were done to attempt to provide a  national  recidivism rate for the US   One was done in      which included         state prisoners from    different states   The other study was done in      on         prisoners from    states   Both studies represent two thirds of the overall prisoners released in their corresponding years              An image developed by Matt Kelley indicates the percent of parolees returning to prison in each state in        According to this image  in       there was more recidivism in the southern states  particularly in the Midwestern region   However  for the majority  the data is spread out throughout the regions 

Rikers Island  New York  New York edit 
The recidivism rate in the New York City jail system is as high as       The jail at Rikers Island  in New York  is making efforts to reduce this statistic by teaching horticulture to its inmates   It is shown that the inmates that go through this type of rehabilitation have significantly lower rates of recidivism             

Arizona and Nevada edit 
A study by the University of Nevada  Reno on recidivism rates across the United States showed that  at only      percent  Arizona has the lowest rate of recidivism among offenders compared to all other US states              Nevada has one of the lowest rates of recidivism among offenders at only      percent             

California edit 
The recidivism rate in California as of           is                  Recidivism has reduced slightly in California from the years of      to      by                   However  California still has one of the highest recidivism rates in the nation  This high recidivism rate contributes greatly to the overcrowding of jails and prisons in California             

Connecticut edit 
A study conducted in Connecticut followed        prisoners for a three year period to see how many of them would end up going back to jail  Results from the study found that about     of offenders were rearrested for a new crime and sent to prison again within the first three years they were released   Of the        prisoners  about     of them were convicted of a new crime             

Florida edit 
In       the Florida Department of Corrections created a graph showing the general recidivism rate of all offenders released from prison from July      until six and a half years later   This graph shows that recidivism is much more likely within the first six months after they are released   The longer the offenders stayed out of prison  the less likely they were to return
