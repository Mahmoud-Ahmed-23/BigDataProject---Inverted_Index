Background edit 
At the time of the match Ke Jie was ranked  st among all human players worldwide under R mi Coulom s ranking system  and had held that position since late                  Ke Jie was also ranked number one in the world under  Korea Baduk Association s             Japan Go Association s            and Chinese Weiqi Association s            ranking systems  
The version of AlphaGo in this match was AlphaGo Master  the one that defeated top pros in    online games             using four TPUs on a single machine with Elo rating                   DeepMind claimed that this version was   stone stronger than the version used in AlphaGo v  Lee Sedol             AlphaGo Master was actually the second best version that DeepMind had at the time  for it was already in possession of AlphaGo Zero  a version much stronger than the Master version  this can be known by the fact that Nature received their paper on AlphaGo Zero on April    before the games with Ke Jie             DeepMind did not reveal the existence of AlphaGo Zero until the paper was published in Nature in October
