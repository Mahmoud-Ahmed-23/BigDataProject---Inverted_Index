							IQOS       s success in Egypt signals a promising opportunity for the introduction of additional smoke free products to the market  according to Tommaso Di Giovanni  Vice President for International Communication and Engagement at Philip Morris International  PMI   With an estimated    million adult smokers in the country  IQOS has already made significant progress in providing a reduced risk alternative to traditional cigarettes 
In an interview with Daily News Egypt  Di Giovanni highlighted the considerable potential of the Egyptian market for expanding PMI s portfolio of smoke free products  including heated tobacco devices 
Transforming Tobacco
The transformation of Philip Morris International  PMI  began with the recognition that change was necessary         We were and we are selling a product that causes diseases and is addictive  cigarettes         Di Giovanni noted  This awareness has fueled the company s drive to innovate and offer better alternatives for both society and consumers   Anyone who sells a product that causes disease and is addictive would like to do better   he said  stressing PMI s dual responsibility to society and to the company itself 
He further emphasized that improving the health of adult smokers is not only a moral obligation but also a sound business strategy         It s a win win for our company and for public health         he explained  adding that addressing societal concerns can help PMI stay ahead of the competition while positively impacting global health 
A Focus on Science and Innovation
PMI s transformation is grounded in scientific evidence  Di Giovanni noted  highlighting the critical role of research and development in driving the company s shift toward less harmful products         Scientific evidence has been a key driver in our choices         he said  explaining that this approach has enabled PMI to offer innovative alternatives  such as heated tobacco and e vapor products  which aim to reduce health risks compared to traditional cigarettes 
Egyptian Market Potential
Turning to Egypt  where approximately    million adults smoke  Di Giovanni expressed optimism about introducing smoke free products like vapes and nicotine pouches to the market  The success of IQOS  which has already gained a foothold in Egypt  provides promising prospects for future launches and efforts to        take Egyptians who smoke away from cigarettes        
Culturally  these products are expected to resonate well with adult smokers  with vapor from these devices resembling traditional water pipes  making them a good cultural fit  However  he emphasized that the right regulatory and commercial environments are crucial for encouraging widespread adoption 
Sustainability as a Core Value
Sustainability is a fundamental pillar of PMI s strategy  Di Giovanni sees it as key to reducing the societal impact of the company s activities         For us  the first goal of sustainability is to address the public health issues posed by cigarettes         he said  adding that replacing cigarettes with better alternatives is at the heart of their mission to improve society 
By focusing on a comprehensive range of smoke free products  PMI aims to ensure a future where innovation and responsibility are aligned         The ultimate goal is to offer a portfolio of products that meets the diverse needs of the market while supporting sustainability goals         he pointed out 
The Road Ahead
PMI remains committed to its transformative journey  with a firm focus on transparency  science driven solutions  and societal well being         Our mission is clear  to lead the way toward a smoke free future  driven by innovation  step by step         Di Giovanni concluded
