Artificial intelligence  AI  program
AlphaGeometry is an artificial intelligence  AI  program that can solve hard problems in Euclidean geometry  The system comprises a data driven large language model  LLM  and a rule based symbolic engine  Deductive Database Arithmetic Reasoning    It was developed by DeepMind  a subsidiary of Google  The program solved    geometry problems out of    from the International Mathematical Olympiad  IMO  under competition time limits a performance almost as good as the average human gold medallist  For comparison  the previous AI program  called Wu s method  managed to solve only    problems                       
DeepMind published a paper about AlphaGeometry in the peer reviewed journal Nature on    January                  AlphaGeometry was featured in MIT Technology Review on the same day            
Traditional geometry programs are symbolic engines that rely exclusively on human coded rules to generate rigorous proofs  which makes them lack flexibility in unusual situations  AlphaGeometry combines such a symbolic engine with a specialized large language model trained on synthetic data of geometrical proofs  When the symbolic engine doesn t manage to find a formal and rigorous proof on its own  it solicits the large language model  which suggests a geometrical construct to move forward  However  it is unclear how applicable this method is to other domains of mathematics or reasoning  because symbolic engines rely on domain specific rules and because of the need for synthetic data            

AlphaGeometry   edit 
AlphaGeometry   is an improved version of AlphaGeometry  published on February          They added more features to the representation language to describe more geometry problems that involve movements of objects  and problems containing linear equations of angles  ratios  and distances  They targeted IMO geometry questions from      to       The expanded representation language allowed them to cover     of the questions                                  
It uses Gemini finetuned on a synthetically generated dataset of problems and solutions in the representation language  The model is used for making auxiliary constructions like lines and points  to help the tree search  It is also used for autoformalization  i e  converting a problem in English to a problem in the representation language
