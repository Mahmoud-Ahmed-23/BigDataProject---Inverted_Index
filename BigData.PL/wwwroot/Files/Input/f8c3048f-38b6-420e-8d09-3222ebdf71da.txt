							New Administrative Capital s  NAC  has sold        feddan from the        feddan offered for sale   excluding the landscape  infrastructure etc which make up        feddan   Magdy Amin  head of Real Estate Sector at the Administrative Capital for Urban Development  ACUD  said  
He added that the remaining       feddan will be marketed until July      
The Egyptian government is planning to move all ministries and agencies in June      to the NAC  The Government District s development process exceeded     and they are currently working on the interiors of the ministry buildings  
Additionally  the infrastructure s completion of the Government district will be complete in April      
ACUD is the owner and developer for the NAC in Egypt and is located    km east of Cairo with a total area of         feddan 
Daily News Egypt sat down with leaders of the ACUD to learn more about the development process at the new capital project 
Ahmed Zaki Abdeen ACUD s chairperson said that they are preparing designs for the Shura Council to move to the NAC 
Abdeen added that the company is ready to offer lands in mixed use areas in the NAC after the operation of the government district at twice the current meter price 
Furthermore  ACUD s spokesperson Khaled El Hosseini  said that prices per square metre jumped by approximately      since the first offering 
What are the updates in the Green River area in the NAC project 
Abdeen  The Green River area spans over a total of       feddans  out of which      feddans have been reserved for green areas and     feddans for mixed use activities  The mixed use areas are currently being developed and marketed through the New Urban Communities Authority  NUCA   The NUCA is responsible for developing the area       s infrastructure and offering lands for developers as well as managing the projects within the Green River area
