							Lake Burullus  one of Egypt s most vital ecological and economic water bodies  is facing severe microplastic contamination  according to a new study published in the April      edition of Scientific Reports  The research  led by a team of Egyptian scientists  found widespread pollution across the lake  with plastic particles posing serious risks to both marine life and human health 
The study showed that water samples taken near drainage canals contained an average of     microplastic particles per cubic meter more than five times the concentration found in open lake waters  Researchers identified eight types of plastic polymers commonly found in consumer and industrial products  such as plastic bags  bottles  and fishing gear 
The prevalence of microplastics small enough to be consumed by fish was especially concerning  Nile tilapia  a major source of protein for millions of Egyptians  was found to be highly susceptible to ingesting these particles  Previous research has shown that microplastics can cause cellular damage and reproductive disorders in fish  raising concerns about the impact on food safety and human health 
Using advanced mapping and tracking tools  the researchers linked the pollution to agricultural runoff  urban waste drainage  and discharges from nearby industrial zones  The southern parts of the lake where runoff is most concentrated showed the highest levels of contamination 
Lake Burullus is responsible for producing around     of Egypt s fish supply and is recognized internationally as a protected wetland  It supports over     plant species and serves as a key habitat for migratory birds  making the implications of this pollution far reaching 
The study       s authors urged urgent action to contain the growing crisis  They called for reforms in waste collection and treatment systems to prevent plastic from entering the lake  alongside stronger regulation of industrial pollution and greater public awareness to reduce plastic usage  Without swift and comprehensive intervention  they warned  the environmental and economic damage to Lake Burullus could become irreversible
