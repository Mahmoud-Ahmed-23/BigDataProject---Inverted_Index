							All eyes are now on Ankara  as people across the region and beyond await the visit of US President Donald Trump to T rkiye this May   a trip recently announced by the White House  The anticipated visit has reignited speculation about the future of Turkish American relations at a time when the alliance between the two countries is experiencing one of its most turbulent phases in decades  What was once a strategic partnership has  over the years  oscillated between open hostility and cautious rapprochement  This uneasy dynamic continues to reverberate throughout the geopolitical balance in both the Middle East and Europe  The United States  which traditionally regarded Ankara as an indispensable NATO ally and a key player in regional security  now appears to be reassessing T rkiye s position within its broader strategic framework  A host of transformations in Ankara s regional and international conduct have compelled Washington to reconsider the value and risks of this alliance 
A recent bill introduced in the US Congress by a bipartisan group of legislators  calling for T rkiye to be reclassified from a European nation to a Middle Eastern country in the State Department s records  is far more than a mere bureaucratic measure  It stands as a political message   unambiguous and revealing   signaling how the American political establishment currently perceives President Erdo an s T rkiye  The move suggests that Washington increasingly views Ankara as a state drifting away from the Western bloc and aligning itself more closely with Russia  China  Iran  and Hamas  in direct conflict with US security and strategic interests 
The language used by representatives Brad Schneider and Gus Bilirakis was unusually blunt  In their description  T rkiye today  harbors Hamas operatives  supports Russia s war machine  and undermines NATO unity while simultaneously demanding the privileges of a Western ally   It seems Washington is no longer willing to turn a blind eye to Erdo an s disruptive foreign policy  especially as tensions continue to escalate over sensitive issues like Ankara s acquisition of Russian defense systems  its rapprochement with Tehran  and its equivocal stance on the war in Ukraine 
Yet Erdo an remains a master of political balancing acts  While he sometimes antagonizes the West  he is also quick to court it when the situation demands  The recent statements made by Turkish Treasury and Finance Minister Mehmet  im ek during his visit to Washington made this clear   im ek declared his country s intention to deepen cooperation with the United States across multiple sectors  defense  space technology  artificial intelligence  and energy  Erdo an knows full well that T rkiye s regional status remains intricately tied to its relationship with Washington  and that  despite recurring disputes  pragmatism tends to prevail in the end

What is particularly notable is that this shifting relationship is playing out against the backdrop of growing signs of rapprochement between Erdo an and Trump  The US president has recently expressed conspicuous warmth towards Erdo an  describing him as a  strong and smart leader  and highlighting T rkiye s pivotal role in shaping the balance of power in Syria  Should Trump indeed decide to include T rkiye in his upcoming Middle East tour this May  it would be a telling indicator of a recalibration in Turkish American relations 
This rapprochement  however  will not come without conditions  The US demands clear assurances from Ankara that Syria will not be allowed to become a safe haven for extremist groups  that Iranian influence in the region will be contained  and that T rkiye s understandings with Moscow will not contradict Israeli interests  At the heart of this intricate equation lies the Gaza file 
In light of the ongoing war on Gaza and Israel s relentless military campaign  it has become increasingly evident that Erdo an sees Gaza as a crucial card in enhancing T rkiye s regional leverage   whether through his country s ties with Hamas or through his vociferous statements in support of the Palestinian cause  While Trump s populist rhetoric often leans heavily in Israel s favor  his administration recognizes the importance of maintaining open channels with Ankara to manage tensions surrounding this sensitive issue  T rkiye s unique relationship with Hamas and its ability to exert influence on the Palestinian scene make it a factor that cannot be excluded from any future arrangements in the Gaza Strip 
This context helps explain the apparent contradictions between the American Congress and the White House  While lawmakers adopt a confrontational tone toward T rkiye  the executive branch  particularly under Trump  seeks to keep avenues of dialogue open  relying on Erdo an s pragmatism  Trump understands that such a rapprochement could serve multiple US interests  applying pressure on Iran and Russia in the Syrian theater  securing economic deals in defense and energy with Ankara  and establishing a discreet channel to Hamas that could prove useful in future negotiations over the Palestinian Israeli conflict or in managing the devastating consequences of the war in Gaza 
T rkiye s evolving relationship with the United States has thus become a microcosm of the broader strategic disarray engulfing the Middle East in       There are no stable alliances  no permanent hostilities   only transient deals  shifting interests  and calculations that change with every new American administration  What remains certain is that Erdo an  the consummate political tactician  knows Washington will ultimately be reluctant to sever ties with Ankara completely  T rkiye is far from an ordinary Middle Eastern country  it is a regional crossroads  a complex political actor  and a key to resolving a host of regional crises   from Syria to Ukraine  from Gaza to energy disputes in the Eastern Mediterranean 
As Israel and Greece watch this potential rapprochement with growing concern  and Moscow and Tehran monitor developments with caution  all eyes now turn to the coming month of May  Will Trump s anticipated visit to T rkiye mark a genuine turning point in relations between the two nations  or merely another episode in a long history of rivalry and transactional diplomacy  The likeliest scenario is that Trump will not grant Erdo an everything he desires  nor will he forgo the strategic opportunity of leveraging T rkiye s role to advance his own regional agenda  In this ongoing game of carrot and stick  Turkish American relations remain a reflection of the Middle East s enduring volatility
