Establishment of a theorem using inference from the axioms
In logic and mathematics  a formal proof or derivation is a finite sequence of sentences  known as well formed formulas when relating to formal language   each of which is an axiom  an assumption  or follows from the preceding sentences in the sequence  according to the rule of inference  It differs from a natural language argument in that it is rigorous  unambiguous and mechanically verifiable             If the set of assumptions is empty  then the last sentence in a formal proof is called a theorem of the formal system  The notion of theorem is generally effective  but there may be no method by which we can reliably find proof of a given sentence or determine that none exists  The concepts of Fitch style proof  sequent calculus and natural deduction are generalizations of the concept of proof                       
The theorem is a syntactic consequence of all the well formed formulas preceding it in the proof  For a well formed formula to qualify as part of a proof  it must be the result of applying a rule of the deductive apparatus  of some formal system  to the previous well formed formulas in the proof sequence 
Formal proofs often are constructed with the help of computers in interactive theorem proving  e g   through the use of proof checker and automated theorem prover              Significantly  these proofs can be checked automatically  also by computer  Checking formal proofs is usually simple  while the problem of finding proofs  automated theorem proving  is usually computationally intractable and or only semi decidable  depending upon the formal system in use 


Background edit 
Formal language edit 
Main article  Formal language
A formal language is a set of finite sequences of symbols  Such a language can be defined without reference to any meanings of any of its expressions  it can exist before any interpretation is assigned to it         that is  before it has any meaning  Formal proofs are expressed in some formal languages 

Formal grammar edit 
Main articles  Formal grammar and Formation rule
A formal grammar  also called formation rules  is a precise description of the well formed formulas of a formal language  It is synonymous with the set of strings over the alphabet of the formal language which constitute well formed formulas  However  it does not describe their semantics  i e  what they mean  

Formal systems edit 
Main article  Formal system
A formal system  also called a logical calculus  or a logical system  consists of a formal language together with a deductive apparatus  also called a deductive system   The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of transformation rules  also called inference rules  or a set of axioms  or have both  A formal system is used to derive one expression from one or more other expressions 

Interpretations edit 
Main articles  Formal semantics  logic  and Interpretation  logic 
An interpretation of a formal system is the assignment of meanings to the symbols  and truth values to the sentences of a formal system  The study of interpretations is called formal semantics  Giving an interpretation is synonymous with constructing a model
