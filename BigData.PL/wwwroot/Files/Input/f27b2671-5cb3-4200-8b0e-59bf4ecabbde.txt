Business process automation  BPA   also known as business automation  refers to the technology enabled automation of business processes            


Deployment edit 
BPA tool sets vary in capability  but there is a trend towards the use of artificial intelligence technologies that can understand natural language and unstructured data sets  interact with human beings  and adapt to new types of problems without human guided training                 self published source     

Business process management implementation edit 
A business process management system differs from BPA  However  it is possible to implement automation based on a BPM implementation  The methods to achieve this vary  from writing custom application code to using specialist BPA tools                 self published source     

Robotic process automation edit 
Main article  Robotic process automation
Robotic process automation  RPA  involves the deployment of attended or unattended software agents in an organization s environment  These software agents  or robots  are programmed to perform pre defined structured and repetitive sets of business tasks or processes  Robotic process automation is designed to streamline workflows by delegating repetitive tasks to software agents  allowing human workers to focus on more complex and strategic activities                 self published source     
BPA providers typically focus on different industry sectors  but the underlying approach is generally similar in that they aim to provide the shortest route to automation by interacting with the user interface rather than modifying the application code or database behind it            

Use of artificial intelligence edit 
Artificial intelligence software robots are used to handle unstructured data sets  like images  texts  audios  and are often deployed after implementing robotic process automation  They can  for instance  generate an automatic transcript from a video  The combination of automation and artificial intelligence  AI  enables autonomy for the robots  along with the capability to perform cognitive tasks                 self published source      At this stage  the robot can learn and improve processes by analyzing and adapting them
