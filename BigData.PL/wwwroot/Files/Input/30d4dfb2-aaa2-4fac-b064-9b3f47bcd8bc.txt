							CAIRO  President Barack Obama s Mideast envoy said Saturday in Cairo that a Palestinian state alongside Israel is the only way to end the Mideast conflict  adding that Egypt was necessary to achieve this goal 
George Mitchell s trip to Egypt came after three days of separate meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders in Israel  
His repeated declaration that the US would not settle for anything less than the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel was seen as a stern message to Israel s hard line leaders  who have expressed misgivings about a two state solution 
 We believe that a comprehensive Middle East peace is not only in the interest of the people of the Middle East  the Palestinians  and Israelis and Egyptians         but it is also in the national interest of the United States and people around the world   he told reporters Saturday after meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit 
 The president believes and I believe that a comprehensive peace in the Middle East will be possible only as a result of the leadership of Egypt  President Mubarak         and the whole  Egyptian  government   he added 
Obama has not yet detailed his Mideast policy  and both Israelis and Palestinians have been watching closely for a possible shift in US positions 
Mitchell s has also been to Saudi Arabia during this tour  where he met the Saudi King   AP
