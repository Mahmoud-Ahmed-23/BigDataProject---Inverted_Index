Type of statistical analysis
Nonparametric statistics is a type of statistical analysis that makes minimal assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data being studied  Often these models are infinite dimensional  rather than finite dimensional  as in parametric statistics             Nonparametric statistics can be used for descriptive statistics or statistical inference  Nonparametric tests are often used when the assumptions of parametric tests are evidently violated            


Definitions edit 
The term  nonparametric statistics  has been defined imprecisely in the following two ways  among others 
The first meaning of nonparametric involves techniques that do not rely on data belonging to any particular parametric family of probability distributions   
These include  among others 

Methods which are distribution free  which do not rely on assumptions that the data are drawn from a given parametric family of probability distributions 
Statistics defined to be a function on a sample  without dependency on a parameter 
An example is Order statistics  which are based on ordinal ranking of observations 
The discussion following is taken from Kendall s Advanced Theory of Statistics            


Statistical hypotheses concern the behavior of observable random variables      For example  the hypothesis  a  that a normal distribution has a specified mean and variance is statistical  so is the hypothesis  b  that it has a given mean but unspecified variance  so is the hypothesis  c  that a distribution is of normal form with both mean and variance unspecified  finally  so is the hypothesis  d  that two unspecified continuous distributions are identical 
It will have been noticed that in the examples  a  and  b  the distribution underlying the observations was taken to be of a certain form  the normal  and the hypothesis was concerned entirely with the value of one or both of its parameters   Such a hypothesis  for obvious reasons  is called parametric 
Hypothesis  c  was of a different nature  as no parameter values are specified in the statement of the hypothesis  we might reasonably call such a hypothesis non parametric   Hypothesis  d  is also non parametric but  in addition  it does not even specify the underlying form of the distribution and may now be reasonably termed distribution free   Notwithstanding these distinctions  the statistical literature now commonly applies the label  non parametric  to test procedures that we have just termed  distribution free   thereby losing a useful classification 


The second meaning of non parametric involves techniques that do not assume that the structure of a model is fixed   Typically  the model grows in size to accommodate the complexity of the data   In these techniques  individual variables are typically assumed to belong to parametric distributions  and assumptions about the types of associations among variables are also made   These techniques include  among others 

non parametric regression  which is modeling whereby the structure of the relationship between variables is treated non parametrically  but where nevertheless there may be parametric assumptions about the distribution of model residuals 
non parametric hierarchical Bayesian models  such as models based on the Dirichlet process  which allow the number of latent variables to grow as necessary to fit the data  but where individual variables still follow parametric distributions and even the process controlling the rate of growth of latent variables follows a parametric distribution 
Applications and purpose edit 
Non parametric methods are widely used for studying populations that have a ranked order  such as movie reviews receiving one to five  stars     The use of non parametric methods may be necessary when data have a ranking but no clear numerical interpretation  such as when assessing preferences  In terms of levels of measurement  non parametric methods result in ordinal data 
As non parametric methods make fewer assumptions  their applicability is much more general than the corresponding parametric methods  In particular  they may be applied in situations where less is known about the application in question   Also  due to the reliance on fewer assumptions  non parametric methods are more robust 
Non parametric methods are sometimes considered simpler to use and more robust than parametric methods  even when the assumptions of parametric methods are justified  This is due to their more general nature  which may make them less susceptible to misuse and misunderstanding  Non parametric methods can be considered a conservative choice  as they will work even when their assumptions are not met  whereas parametric methods can produce misleading results when their assumptions are violated 
The wider applicability and increased robustness of non parametric tests comes at a cost  in cases where a parametric test s assumptions are met  non parametric tests have less statistical power   In other words  a larger sample size can be required to draw conclusions with the same degree of confidence 

Non parametric models edit 
Non parametric models differ from parametric models in that the model structure is not specified a priori but is instead determined from data  The term non parametric is not meant to imply that such models completely lack parameters but that the number and nature of the parameters are flexible and not fixed in advance 

A histogram is a simple nonparametric estimate of a probability distribution 
Kernel density estimation is another method to estimate a probability distribution 
Nonparametric regression and semiparametric regression methods have been developed based on kernels  splines  and wavelets 
Data envelopment analysis provides efficiency coefficients similar to those obtained by multivariate analysis without any distributional assumption 
KNNs classify the unseen instance based on the K points in the training set which are  nearest to it 
A support vector machine  with a Gaussian kernel  is a nonparametric large margin classifier 
The method of moments with polynomial probability distributions 
Methods edit 
Non parametric  or distribution free  inferential statistical methods are mathematical procedures for statistical hypothesis testing which  unlike parametric statistics  make no assumptions about the probability distributions of the variables being assessed  The most frequently used tests include

Analysis of similarities
Anderson Darling test  tests whether a sample is drawn from a given distribution
Statistical bootstrap methods  estimates the accuracy sampling distribution of a statistic
Cochran s Q  tests whether k treatments in randomized block designs with     outcomes have identical effects
Cohen s kappa  measures inter rater agreement for categorical items
Friedman two way analysis of variance  Repeated Measures  by ranks  tests whether k treatments in randomized block designs have identical effects
Empirical likelihood
Kaplan Meier   estimates the survival function from lifetime data  modeling censoring
Kendall s tau  measures statistical dependence between two variables
Kendall s W  a measure between   and   of inter rater agreement 
Kolmogorov Smirnov test  tests whether a sample is drawn from a given distribution  or whether two samples are drawn from the same distribution 
Kruskal Wallis one way analysis of variance by ranks  tests whether  gt         independent samples are drawn from the same distribution 
Kuiper s test  tests whether a sample is drawn from a given distribution  sensitive to cyclic variations such as day of the week 
Logrank test  compares survival distributions of two right skewed  censored samples 
Mann Whitney U or Wilcoxon rank sum test  tests whether two samples are drawn from the same distribution  as compared to a given alternative hypothesis

History edit 
Early nonparametric statistics include the median    th century or earlier  use in estimation by Edward Wright        see Median        History  and the sign test by John Arbuthnot        in analyzing the human sex ratio at birth  see Sign test        History
