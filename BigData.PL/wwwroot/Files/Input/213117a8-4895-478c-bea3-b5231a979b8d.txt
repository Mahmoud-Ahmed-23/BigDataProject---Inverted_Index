Chemistry has many sub disciplines such as analytical chemistry  physical chemistry  biochemistry  and more  Chemistry plays a crucial role in various industries  including pharmaceuticals  materials science  environmental science  and energy production  making it a cornerstone of modern science and technology

The area of science devoted to studying nature and also composition  properties  elements  and compounds that form matter as well as looking into their reactions forming new substances is chemistry  Chemistry has also been categorized further based on the particular areas of study

What is Chemistry Branches of ChemistryExamples and Applications of Chemistry in Our Daily LivesFree Chemistry Study MaterialCBSE Chemistry Notes What is Chemistry Chemistry focuses on the properties  both physical and chemical structure  transformations they undergo as well as the energy that is either absorbed or released during reactions that accompany these structural changes 

All materials on earth whether they are naturally occurring or are artificially produced include fundamental units known as atoms  These atoms also consist of elementary particles  but they are called the structural and fundamental entities of chemical substances 

Chemistry includes writing the composition of compounds  their uses  and also how they are used along with the synthesis of new compounds by combining two or more substances 

Chemical processes include cooking  fermentation  glass making  and also metallurgy  Advancements in chemical technology have led to the production of semiconductors  liquid crystals  Teflon  and also superconductors among others 

Branches of ChemistryChemistry is divided into five branches as follows 

Physical Chemistry Organic ChemistryInorganic Chemistry Analytical Chemistry BiochemistryPhysical ChemistryHere  this field of chemistry focuses on the many processes and changes that take place in materials  It tries to quantify  correlate  and rationalize the structural properties of reactions through its unique approach focusing on physical principles underlying all chemical interactions  e g   gas laws   It is a combination of physics and also chemistry to examine the elements in a superior manner 

In physical chemistry  we can see how molecules and atoms interact with each other to create specific molecules  We can also know many other aspects of the issue  such as those relating to its transformation from solidity into liquid 

Organic ChemistryOrganic chemistry is one of the branches of this science that describes the structure  properties  and reactions of carbohydrates having carbon atoms as a dominant element  Chemicals in this branch are hydrocarbons  compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen  as well as other substances that contain carbon along with oxygen  nitrogen  sulfur  phosphorus halogens etc 

These substances and chemicals make up the organic compounds that dominate over earthly life forms 

Inorganic ChemistryThis category contains the analysis of non carbon compounds and also some organometallic combinations  It primarily discusses the non carbon compounds  Most inorganic compounds are ionic  comprising the cations and anions linked by ion covalent bonds  The study of oxides  carbonates  sulfates and also halides are included in the Inorganic compounds 

Analytical ChemistryThis branch deals with the separation and quantification techniques using various equipment  It involves a number of techniques to study and measure substances like separation  the identification or quantification This branch may employ classical methods  wet chemical methods and also modern analytical techniques  

BiochemistryThis is the branch of chemistry that specializes in examining the chemical substances and reactions involved with plants  animals  or also microorganisms  This branch deals with the chemistry of the life 

Examples and Applications of Chemistry in Our Daily LivesChemical reactions are always taking place around us  The human body is made up of chemical substances  Our human body is     water  The way we react to situations is all because of the chemical reactions of hormones  From the digestion of food to how we think  we are surrounded by chemistry and chemical reactions  A few applications of chemistry in our daily lives are given below  

A chemical reaction is the process of photosynthesis where plants make food and water  sunlight  and carbon dioxide supplies are changed into glucose and also oxygen Therefore  the use of soaps and detergents to get rid of dirtiness is not only a biological function but also a chemical reaction  These will not occur without the chemistry required Medicines are drugs that mend humans by curing them from diseases and infections Another use of chemicals in our daily lives is packaged foods Free Chemistry Study MaterialAcids  Bases  and SaltsAlcohols  Phenols  and EthersAldehydes  Ketones  and Carboxylic AcidsAminesAtoms and MoleculesBiomoleculesBohr s Atomic Model Carbon and its CompoundsChemical Bonding and Molecular StructureChemical CompoundsChemical KineticsChemical Reactions and EquationsChemistry in Everyday LifeClassification of Elements and Periodicity in PropertiesCoal and PetroleumCombustion and FlameCoordination CompoundsCorrosionCrystallizationElectrochemistryElements of the Periodic TableEnvironmental ChemistryEquilibriumFibre to FabricGeneral Principles and Processes of Isolation of ElementsHaloalkanes and HaloarenesHydrocarbonsHydrogenIs Matter Around Us Pure Laws of Chemical CombinationLiquification of GasesMaterials  Metals and Non metalsMatter in Our SurroundingsMetals and Non MetalsNamed ReactionsOrganic ChemistryPeriodic Classification of ElementsPhysical and Chemical ChangesPollution of Air and WaterPolyatomic IonsPolymersRadioactive IsotopesRedox ReactionsRutherford s Atomic ModelSolutionsSome Basic Concepts of ChemistryStates of MatterStructure of AtomSurface ChemistrySynthetic Fibres and PlasticsThe d and f   Block ElementsThe p Block ElementsThe s Block ElementsThe Solid StateThermodynamicsTyndall EffectUses of Chemical CompoundsWater of CrystallizationValence Bond TheoryVSEPR TheoryCBSE Chemistry Notes CBSE Notes for Class   Chemistry
