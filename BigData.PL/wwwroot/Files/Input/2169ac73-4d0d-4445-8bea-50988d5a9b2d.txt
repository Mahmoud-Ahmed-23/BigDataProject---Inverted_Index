Mathematical function having a characteristic S shaped curve or sigmoid curve  
 
  

The logistic curve  
Plot of the error function
A sigmoid function is any mathematical function whose graph has a characteristic S shaped or sigmoid curve 
A common example of a sigmoid function is the logistic function  which is defined by the formula

Other sigmoid functions are given in the Examples section  In some fields  most notably in the context of artificial neural networks  the term  sigmoid function  is used as a synonym for  logistic function  
Special cases of the sigmoid function include the Gompertz curve  used in modeling systems that saturate at large values of x  and the ogee curve  used in the spillway of some dams   Sigmoid functions have domain of all real numbers  with return  response  value commonly monotonically increasing but could be decreasing  Sigmoid functions most often show a return value  y axis  in the range   to    Another commonly used range is from    to   
A wide variety of sigmoid functions including the logistic and hyperbolic tangent functions have been used as the activation function of artificial neurons  Sigmoid curves are also common in statistics as cumulative distribution functions  which go from   to     such as the integrals of the logistic density  the normal density  and Student s t probability density functions  The logistic sigmoid function is invertible  and its inverse is the logit function 


Definition edit 
A sigmoid function is a bounded  differentiable  real function that is defined for all real input values and has a positive derivative at each point                       and exactly     at the inflection point 

Properties edit 
In general  a sigmoid function is monotonic  and has a first derivative which is bell shaped  Conversely  the integral of any continuous  non negative  bell shaped function  with one local maximum and no local minimum  unless degenerate  will be sigmoidal  Thus the cumulative distribution functions for many common probability distributions are sigmoidal  One such example is the error function  which is related to the cumulative distribution function of a normal distribution  another is the arctan function  which is related to the cumulative distribution function of a Cauchy distribution 
A sigmoid function is constrained by a pair of horizontal asymptotes as

          xb  
          x   e 
      
    
      displaystyle x rightarrow  pm  infty  
  
 
A sigmoid function is convex for values less than a particular point  and it is concave for values greater than that point  in many of the examples here  that point is   

Examples edit 
Some sigmoid functions compared  In the drawing all functions are normalized in such a way that their slope at the origin is

Applications edit 
Inverted logistic S curve to model the relation between wheat yield and soil salinity
Many natural processes  such as those of complex system learning curves  exhibit a progression from small beginnings that accelerates and approaches a climax over time  When a specific mathematical model is lacking  a sigmoid function is often used            
The van Genuchten Gupta model is based on an inverted S curve and applied to the response of crop yield to soil salinity 
Examples of the application of the logistic S curve to the response of crop yield  wheat  to both the soil salinity and depth to water table in the soil are shown in modeling crop response in agriculture 
In artificial neural networks  sometimes non smooth functions are used instead for efficiency  these are known as hard sigmoids 
In audio signal processing  sigmoid functions are used as waveshaper transfer functions to emulate the sound of analog circuitry clipping            
In biochemistry and pharmacology  the Hill and Hill Langmuir equations are sigmoid functions 
In computer graphics and real time rendering  some of the sigmoid functions are used to blend colors or geometry between two values  smoothly and without visible seams or discontinuities 
Titration curves between strong acids and strong bases have a sigmoid shape due to the logarithmic nature of the pH scale 
The logistic function can be calculated efficiently by utilizing type III Unums            
An hierarchy of sigmoid growth models with increasing complexity  number of parameters  was built            with the primary goal to re analyze kinetic data  the so called N t curves  from heterogeneous nucleation experiments              in electrochemistry  The hierarchy includes at present three models  with      and   parameters  if not counting the maximal number of nuclei Nmax  respectively a tanh  based model called                 originally devised to describe diffusion limited crystal growth  not aggregation   in  D  the Johnson Mehl Avrami Kolmogorov  JMAKn  model              and the Richards model              It was shown that for the concrete purpose even the simplest model works and thus it was implied that the experiments revisited are an example of two step nucleation with the first step being the growth of the metastable phase in which the nuclei of the stable phase form
