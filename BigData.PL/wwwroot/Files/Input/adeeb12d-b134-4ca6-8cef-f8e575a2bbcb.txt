Ability to make ethical judgements
Moral agency is an individual s ability to make moral choices based on some notion of right and wrong and to be held accountable for these actions             A moral agent is  a being who is capable of acting with reference to right and wrong

Most philosophers suggest only rational beings  who can reason and form self interested judgments  are capable of being moral agents  Some suggest those with limited rationality  for example  people who are mildly mentally disabled or infants             also have some basic moral capabilities            
Determinists argue all of our actions are the product of antecedent causes  and some believe this is incompatible with free will and thus claim that we have no real control over our actions  Immanuel Kant argued that whether or not our real self  the noumenal self  can choose  we have no choice but to believe that we choose freely when we make a choice  This does not mean that we can control the effects of our actions 
Some Indeterminists would argue we have no free will either  If  with respect to human behavior  a so called  cause  results in an indeterminate number of possible  so called  effects   that does not mean the person had the free thinking independent will to choose that  effect   More likely  it was the indeterminate consequence of his chance genetics  chance experiences and chance circumstances relevant at the time of the  cause  
In Kant s philosophy  this calls for an act of faith  the faith free agent is based on something a priori  yet to be known  or immaterial  Otherwise  without free agent s a priori fundamental source  socially essential concepts created from human mind  such as justice  would be undermined  responsibility implies freedom of choice  and  in short  civilization and human values would crumble 
It is useful to compare the idea of moral agency with the legal doctrine of mens rea  which means guilty mind  and states that a person is legally responsible for what he does as long as he should know what he is doing  and his choices are deliberate  Some theorists discard any attempts to evaluate mental states and  instead  adopt the doctrine of strict liability  whereby one is liable under the law without regard to capacity  and that the only thing is to determine the degree of punishment  if any  Moral determinists would most likely adopt a similar point of view 
Psychologist Albert Bandura has observed that moral agents engage in selective moral disengagement in regards to their own inhumane conduct            

Distinction between moral agents and moral patients edit 
Moral agents are entities whose actions are eligible for moral consideration  An example of this would be a young child old enough to understand right from wrong  yet they hit their siblings on an occasion when they get angry  The action of hitting is up for moral consideration because the child is old enough to consider whether or not it is the correct action to take and the morality of their behavior            
Moral patients are entities that themselves are eligible for moral consideration  An example of this would be a child who does not know how to determine right from wrong  A child in this situation is up for moral consideration by others because those around them understand they are incapable of understanding the consequences of their actions and are therefore unable to understand the morality of a situation due to developmental barriers            
Many philosophers  such as Immanuel Kant  view morality as a transaction among rational parties  i e   among moral agents  In Richard Dean s article on Kant s moral theory he discusses how agents who are able to control their tendencies or drives  are able to remain unbiased as they determine the path of moral action  The ability to be able to control this is called moral commitment  Agents need to become experts in this control in order to be able to declare something as moral or immoral and retain reputability             For this reason  they would exclude other animals from moral consideration 
Utilitarian philosophers Jeremy Bentham and Peter Singer have argued that the key to inclusion in the moral community is not rationality         for if it were  we might have to exclude some disabled people and infants  and might also have to distinguish between the degrees of rationality of healthy adults         but the real object of moral action is the avoidance of suffering                        An example of this is the abortion debate  Further examples can be taken from the argument from marginal cases 

Artificial moral agents edit 
Discussions of artificial moral agency center around a few main ideas  The first discussion is on whether it is possible for an artificial system to be a moral agent   see artificial systems and moral responsibility 
The second discussion concerns efforts to construct machines with ethically significant behaviors   see machine ethics  
Finally  there is debate about whether robots should be constructed as moral agents 
Research has shown that humans do perceive robots as having varying degrees of moral agency  These perceptions can manifest in two distinct ways     ideas about a robot s moral capacity  the ability to be do good or bad  and    ideas about its dependence or independence on programming  where high dependency equates to low agency             
Research suggests that the moral judgment of an action may not depend on whether the agent is a human or a robot  However  robots are rarely given credit for acting well  and must behave more consistently well to be trusted             
Creating a robot or  social machine  capable of understanding moral judgments as moral judgments and not through proxies  which is how AI systems are trained to align with human values moral ethical codes  does not seem likely soon  However  a machine with those capabilities could be potentially created in the future             

Non human animals edit 
Discussion of moral agency in non human animals involves both debate about the nature of morality and about the capacities and behavior of human and non human animals                          Thinkers who agree about the nature  behavior and abilities of different species may still disagree about which capacities are important for moral agency or about the significance of particular behaviors in determining moral agency              Since moral agents are often thought to warrant particular moral consideration  this discussion is sometimes linked to debates in animal rights about practices involving non human animals             
Studies of animal biology and behavior have provided strong evidence of complex social structures and behavioral norms in non human species  There is also evidence that some non human species  especially other primates  can demonstrate empathy and emotions such as guilt or grief  though some thinkers dispute this                          However  humans display distinctive capacities related to intelligence and rationality such as the ability to engage in abstract and symbolic thought and to employ complex language             
Philosophers and biologists who claim that non human animals are moral agents typically argue that moral agency is dependent on empathy or social relations  and stress the evidence for these in non human animals              They may also point out behaviors which in humans are described as moral activities  such as the punishment of individuals who break social norms  Some thinkers suggest that there are a variety of types or levels of moral agency which vary by species  or that animals may act morally without being full moral agents                         
Thinkers who hold that only humans can be moral agents typically argue that moral agency depends on rationality  They highlight distinctive human abilities and the unique complexity of human behavior  They argue that shared behaviors such as the punishment of wrongdoers are nevertheless underpinned by very different internal processes  meaning that these behaviors qualify as moral activity for humans but not for non humans
