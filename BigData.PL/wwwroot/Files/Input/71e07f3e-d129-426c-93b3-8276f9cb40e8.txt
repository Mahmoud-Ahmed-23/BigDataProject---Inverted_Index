Plot edit 
After a flying saucer lands in Washington  D C   the United States Army quickly surrounds it  A humanoid emerges and announces that he comes  in peace and with good will   When he unexpectedly opens a small device  he is shot and wounded by a nervous soldier  A tall robot emerges from the saucer and quickly disintegrates the soldiers  weapons  The alien orders the robot  Gort  to desist  He explains that the now broken device was a gift for the President of the United States that would have enabled him  to study life on the other planets  
The alien  Klaatu  is taken to Walter Reed Army Hospital  After surgery  he uses a salve to quickly heal his wound  The Army is unable to enter the saucer  Gort stands outside  silent and unmoving 
Klaatu tells the President s secretary  Mr  Harley  that he has a message that must be delivered to all the world s leaders simultaneously  Harley tells him that in the current world situation  this is impossible  Klaatu proposes that he spend time among ordinary humans to better understand their  unreasoning suspicions and attitudes   Harley rejects the proposal  and Klaatu remains locked in his hospital room 

Michael Rennie plays Klaatu  a humanoid visitor from space who has a message that must be delivered to all the world s leaders simultaneously Patricia Neal plays Helen Benson  Bobby Benson s mother  to whom Klaatu reveals his mission  giving her the code phrase  Klaatu barada nikto  to give to Gort in case of emergency Billy Gray plays Helen s young son  Bobby Benson  the first to figure out that  Mr  Carpenter  is an alien from outer space after following him to the spaceship Sam Jaffe plays Professor Jacob Barnhardt  who agrees to gather scientists from around the world at the saucer to hear Klaatu s message and suggests that Klaatu peacefully demonstrate the power he possesses beforehand Hugh Marlowe plays Tom Stevens  Helen s boyfriend  who becomes jealous of Klaatu as  Mr  Carpenter  and then tries to exploit the story to become famous and wealthy Lock Martin plays Gort  the robot  wearing a rubber suit over his      frame 
Klaatu escapes and stays in a boarding house using the name Mr  Carpenter  adopted from a dry cleaner s suit tag  Among the residents are young widow Helen Benson and her son Bobby  Helen s boyfriend  Tom Stevens  becomes jealous of the stranger 
Bobby takes Klaatu on a tour of the city  including a visit to his father s grave in Arlington National Cemetery  Klaatu learns that most of the dead are soldiers killed in wars  They also visit the Lincoln Memorial  When Klaatu asks Bobby   Who is the greatest living person    Bobby suggests Professor Barnhardt  They visit the scientist s home  but he is out  Klaatu sees that Barnhardt s blackboard is covered with equations  an attempt to solve the three body problem   Klaatu adds to them and  after being discovered by the housekeeper  leaves his contact information 
That evening  a government agent escorts Klaatu to Barnhardt  Klaatu tells Barnhardt that the people of other planets are concerned about Earth s possible aggression  now that humanity has developed rockets and rudimentary atomic power  He states that if his message is ignored  Earth could be  eliminated   Barnhardt agrees to gather scientists from around the world at the saucer  he also suggests that Klaatu peacefully demonstrate the power he possesses beforehand 
Klaatu returns to his spaceship  unaware that Bobby is following him  Bobby watches as Gort knocks out two soldiers so Klaatu can reenter the saucer  Bobby runs home and tells Helen  She does not believe him  but Tom is suspicious 
The next day  for half an hour  starting at    noon east coast time  all electrical equipment on Earth ceases to function             except for essential services  such as hospitals and aircraft in flight 
Klaatu learns that Bobby watched him the previous night  He visits Helen at work  reveals his mission  and asks that she not betray him  Helen asks Tom to keep Klaatu s identity secret  but he refuses to listen  already in the process of alerting the military 
Helen and Klaatu rush to Barnhardt s home  They hope that Barnhardt can hide Klaatu until the meeting that evening  Klaatu tells Helen that if anything should happen to him  she must go to Gort and say   Klaatu barada nikto  
The Army tracks them in their taxi  Klaatu is shot and killed  and his body is moved to a nearby police station cell  Helen rushes to the saucer and says Klaatu s phrase to Gort  Gort retrieves Klaatu s body  and revives him inside the saucer  though Klaatu tells Helen that his revival is only temporary 
Helen departs the spaceship with Klaatu and Gort  joining Dr  Barnhart among the gathered scientists  Klaatu tells the scientists gathered outside that an interplanetary organization has created a police force of invincible robots like Gort   In matters of aggression  we have given them absolute power over us   Klaatu concludes   Your choice is simple  join us and live in peace  or pursue your present course and face obliteration  We shall be waiting for your answer   Klaatu and Gort depart in the saucer

Metaphors edit 
Advertisement from     
In a      interview  producer Julian Blaustein explained that Joseph Breen  the film censor installed by the Motion Picture Association of America at the Twentieth Century Fox studios  balked at the portrayal of Klaatu s resurrection and limitless power             At the behest of the MPAA  a line was written into the script  when Helen asks Klaatu whether Gort has unlimited power over life and death  Klaatu explains that Gort has only revived him temporarily   that power is reserved to the Almighty Spirit                          Of the elements that he added to Klaatu s character  screenwriter Edmund North said   It was my private little joke  I never discussed this angle with Blaustein or Wise because I didn t want it expressed  I had originally hoped that the Christ comparison would be subliminal              
That the question even came up in an interview is proof enough that such comparisons did not remain subliminal  but they are subtle enough so that it is not immediately obvious to all viewers that those elements were intended to compare Klaatu to Jesus Christ              When Klaatu escapes from the hospital  he steals the clothing of a Maj  John Carpenter  giving him the initials J C    carpentry was the profession that the New Testament says Jesus learned from Joseph  his father  His previous actions are misunderstood  and he eventually is killed by military authority  At the end of the film  Klaatu  having been restored to life  ascends into the  night  sky  Other parallels include his coming to Earth with a message for all mankind  his befriending of a child  possessing wisdom and specialized scientific knowledge beyond those of any human being  and people being given a sign of his power  At the start of the film  one of the British radar technicians  upon observing the speed of Klaatu s spaceship  is heard to exclaim   Holy Christmas              

Production edit 
Development edit 
Producer Julian Blaustein originally set out to make a film under the working titles of Farewell to the Master and Journey to the World which illustrated the fear and suspicion that characterized the early Cold War and Atomic Age  He reviewed more than two hundred science fiction short stories and novels in search of a storyline that could be used because this film genre was well suited for a metaphorical discussion of such grave issues  Studio head Darryl F  Zanuck gave the go ahead for this project  and Blaustein hired Edmund North to write the screenplay based on elements from Harry Bates s      short story  Farewell to the Master   The revised final screenplay was completed on February           Science fiction writer Raymond F  Jones worked as an uncredited adviser             

Pre production edit 
The set was designed by Thomas Little and Claude Carpenter  They collaborated with the architect Frank Lloyd Wright for the design of the spacecraft  Paul Laffoley has suggested that the futuristic interior was inspired by Wright s Johnson Wax Headquarters  completed in       Laffoley quotes Wright and his attempt in designing the exterior            to imitate an experimental substance that I have heard about which acts like living tissue  If cut  the rift would appear to heal like a wound  leaving a continuous surface with no scar              

Filming edit 
Principal outdoor photography was shot on the   th Century Fox sound stages and on its studio back lot  now located in Century City  California   with a second unit shooting background and other scenes in Washington  D C   and at Fort George G  Meade in Maryland  The shooting schedule was from April   to May           and the primary actors never traveled to Washington to make the film  Director Robert Wise indicated in the DVD commentary that the United States Department of Defense refused participation in the film based on a reading of the script  The military equipment shown  however  came from the  rd Armored Cavalry Regiment then stationed at Fort Meade which supplied the vehicles  equipment  and soldiers for the segments depicting Army operations              One of the film s tanks bears the  Brave Rifles  insignia of the  rd Armored Cavalry Regiment             
The robot Gort was played by Lock Martin  who worked as an usher at Grauman s Chinese Theatre and stood seven feet and seven inches tall  Not accustomed to a confining  heat inducing costume  he worked carefully while wearing the two oversized  laced up  foamed neoprene suits for the illusion of a seamless metallic Gort  Wise decided Martin s on screen shooting time would be limited to half hour intervals  so Martin  with his generally weak constitution  would face no more than minor discomfort  These segments  in turn  were then edited together into the film s final print             
In a commentary track on DVD  interviewed by fellow director Nicholas Meyer  Wise said he wanted the film to appear as realistic and believable as possible  to push the core message against armed conflict in the real world  The original title is  The Day the World Stops   Blaustein said his aim was to promote a  strong United Nations              

Herrmann s score edit 
The music score was composed by Bernard Herrmann in August       and is the first film score he composed after moving from New York to Hollywood  Herrmann chose unusual instrumentation for the film  violin  cello  and bass  all three electric   two theremin electronic instruments  played by Dr  Samuel Hoffman and Paul Shure   two Hammond organs  Fox studio s Wurlitzer organ  three vibraphones  two glockenspiels  marimba  tam tam  two bass drums  three sets of timpani  two pianos  celesta  two harps  one horn  three trumpets  three trombones  and four tubas              Herrmann s advances in film scoring included Unison organs  tubas  piano  and bass drum  staggered tritone movement  and glissando in theremins  as well as exploitation of the dissonance between D and E flat and experimentation with unusual overdubbing and tape reversal techniques  In using the theremin  Herrmann made an early foray into electronic music  one year before Karlheinz Stockhausen and three years before Edgard Var se

Critical reception edit 
Variety praised the documentary style   the yarn is told interestingly enough and imbued with sufficient science fiction lures and suspense so that only seldom does its moralistic wordiness get in the way          Cast  although secondary to the story  works well                           Harrison s Reports wrote   Very good  It is by far the best of the science fiction pictures yet produced  It holds one s interest undiminished from start to finish and  although the theme is admittedly fantastic  one is made to feel as if he is seeing a real life occurrence because of the expert handling of the subject matter and the extremely fine special effects work               The Los Angeles Times praised the film s seriousness  though it also found  certain subversive elements               Bosley Crowther of The New York Times dismissed the film as  tepid entertainment  and described Gort as  oddly unmenacing              
The Day the Earth Stood Still was moderately successful when released  accruing US           in distributors  U S  and Canadian rentals  making it the year s   nd biggest earner               Rentals  refers to the distributor studio s share of the box office gross  which  according to Gebert  is roughly half of the money generated by ticket sales             
The Day the Earth Stood Still earned more plaudits in other countries  the Hollywood Foreign Press Association gave the filmmakers a special Golden Globe Award for  promoting international understanding   Bernard Herrmann s score also received a nomination at the Golden Globes              The French magazine Cahiers du Cin ma was impressed  its contributor Pierre Kast called it  almost literally stunning  and praised its  moral relativism              

Legacy edit 
The Day the Earth Stood Still received recognition from the American Film Institute and was selected for preservation in the United States Library of Congress s National Film Registry  In       it was ranked number    on     Years              Thrills  a list of America s most heart pounding films              It placed number    on a similar list     Years              Cheers  a list of America s most inspiring films              In June       the American Film Institute revealed its     Top                      the best ten films in ten  classic  American film genres                  after polling more than       people from the creative community  The Day the Earth Stood Still was acknowledged as the fifth best film in the science fiction genre              In       the film was selected by The New York Times as one of The Best      Movies Ever Made             
Ringo Starr brought the imagery of the film back into popular culture by using a modified scene of the ship and Klaatu for the cover of his      album Goodnight Vienna   Lou Cannon and Colin Powell believed the film inspired Ronald Reagan to discuss uniting against an alien invasion when meeting Mikhail Gorbachev in       Two years later  Reagan told the United Nations   I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world               The film is playing in the opening scene of the first episode of Star Trek  Strange New Worlds when Captain Pike refers to it as a  classic               American rock musician Willie Nile released an album entitled The Day The Earth Stood Still in       The album s title track was inspired by the deserted streets of New York City during the Covid    pandemic  and contains the  Klaatu Barada Nikto  phrase in its chorus 
The Day the Earth Stood Still is now considered one of the best films released in                               The Day the Earth Stood Still is in Arthur C  Clarke s list of the    best science fiction films of all time              The film holds a     rating at the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on    reviews  with an average rating of          The consensus states   Socially minded yet entertaining  The Day the Earth Stood Still imparts its moral of peace and understanding without didacticism               Tony Magistrale describes the film as one of the best examples of early techno horror             

Adaptations edit 
The film was dramatized as a radio play on January          for the Lux Radio Theatre  Michael Rennie reprised his lead role as Klaatu with actress Jean Peters as Helen Benson              This production was later re broadcast on the Hollywood Radio Theater  the re titled Lux Radio Theatre  which aired on the Armed Forces Radio Service             
The      remake The Day the Earth Stood Still was directed by Scott Derrickson and stars Keanu Reeves as Klaatu  Rather than leaving to humans the chance to collaborate  the remake rests on Klaatu s decision whether to let humanity be destroyed or saved             

Klaatu barada nikto edit 
Since the release of the film  the phrase  Klaatu barada nikto  has appeared repeatedly in fiction and in popular culture  The Robot Hall of Fame described it as  one of the most famous commands in science fiction               and Frederick S  Clarke of Cinefantastique called it in       the most famous phrase ever spoken by an extraterrestrial              
Patricia Neal had a problem speaking the phrase  though she was proud of the film overall   I do think it s the best science fiction film ever made  although I admit that I sometimes had a difficult time keeping a straight face  Michael would patiently watch me bite my lips to avoid giggling and ask  with true British reserve   Is that the way you intend to play it               
Edmund H  North  who wrote The Day the Earth Stood Still  also created the alien language used in the film  including the iconic phrase  Klaatu barada nikto   The official spelling for the phrase comes directly from the script and provides insight as to its proper pronunciation  No translation was given in the film  Philosophy professor Aeon J  Skoble speculates the famous phrase is a  safe word  which is part of a fail safe feature used during diplomatic missions such as the one Klaatu and Gort make to Earth  With the use of the safe word  Gort s deadly force can be deactivated in the event the robot is mistakenly triggered into a defensive posture  Skoble observes that the theme has evolved into a  staple of science fiction that the machines charged with protecting us from ourselves will misuse or abuse their power              
Fantastic Films explored the meaning of  Klaatu barada nikto  in a      article titled  The Language of Klaatu   The article  written by Tauna Le Marbe  who is listed as its  alien linguistics editor   attempts to translate all the alien words Klaatu used throughout the film              In the article  the literal translation for Klaatu barada nikto was  Stop Barbarism  I have  death  bind  and the free translation was  I die  repair me  do not retaliate              
The documentary Decoding  Klaatu Barada Nikto   Science Fiction as Metaphor examined the phrase  Klaatu barada nikto  with some of the people involved in the production of The Day the Earth Stood Still  Robert Wise  the director of the film  conveyed an account of Edmund North telling him   Well  it s just something I kind of cooked up  I thought it sounded good               Billy Gray  who played Bobby Benson in the film  said he believed the message was coming from Klaatu and that  Barada Nikto must mean          save Earth              
Florence Blaustein  widow of the producer Julian Blaustein  said North had to pass a street called Baroda every day going to work and indicated  I think that s how that was born               The film historian Steven Jay Rubin recalled an interview he had with North when he asked the question   What is the direct translation of Klaatu Barada Nikto  and Edmund North said to me  There s hope for Earth  if the scientists can be reached                Director Robert Wise clearly remembered the phrase for when he was awarded the American Film Institute s Lifetime Achievement Award in       he ended his acceptance speech with the phrase    Klaatu barada nikto    which tonight means   Thank you from the bottom of my heart
