                                                                C is a general purpose  procedural  and middle level programming language developed by Dennis M  Ritchie at Bell Laboratories in       It is also known as the  mother of all programming languages  as it influenced many modern programming languages like C    Java  Python  and Go  Why learn C The C language is a popular choice for system level and application programming due to its powerful  efficient  and flexible nature  Below are some key features of C language that show the ability and power of the C language Simple and Direct  nbsp C is a simple language with a small set of keywords due to which programmers have to take manual approach which provides a deeper understanding of how different concepts work at a low level  Fast Speed  nbsp C is a statically typed compiler based language so it is faster that other languages such as Python Memory Management  nbsp C provides direct access to lower level memory management using pointers and functions like realloc    free    etc  Structure Similarity  Many programming languages have borrowed their syntax from C language  so it is easy to learn them if you already know C C FundamentalsThis section of the C Tutorial includes basic concepts that build the foundation for writing C programs  It teaches you how to store and output data  perform arithmetic and other operations  control the program flow  etc IntroductionSetting Up C EnvironmentCompilation ProcessIdentifiersKeywordsVariablesData TypesQuiz  C Basics   Variables   Data TypesInput and OutputOperatorsQuiz  Input and Output   OperatorsConditional StatementsLoopsQuiz  Conditional Statements and LoopsC FunctionsFunctions are block of code that performs a specific task  They allows programmers to write modular and reusable code FunctionsParameter Passing TechniquesMain FunctionRecursion Inline FunctionNested FunctionsQuiz  FunctionsCompound Data TypesCompound data types are created from primitive data types and provides a different way to use them according to our needs  This section of C tutorial teaches you about the compound data types and how to efficiently organize and process real world data ArraysPointersStringsQuiz  Array   Pointers   StringsStructuresUnionsEnumeration  or enum Quiz  Structure  amp  UnionMemory Management in CThis section covers the manual memory management in C using pointers  The dynamic memory management in C uses functions like malloc    calloc    realloc    and free   to manually manage the memory while avoiding errors such as memory leak Program s Memory LayoutDynamic Memory AllocationMemory LeaksQuiz  Memory ManagementFile HandlingThis section teaches you how to work with files in C  including creating  reading  writing  manipulating and deleting files Basics of File HandlingRead a FileRead Write Structure From to a FileEOF  getc   and feof  Delete a FileQuiz  File Handling Error HandlingUnlike other programming languages that have automatic error handling  In C language error handling is to be manually done by the developers using error handling methods  debugging strategies  and functions like perror    strerror    etc Error HandlingException Handling Using gotoFile Error HandlingDivide by Zero ExceptionMiscellaneous C ConceptsThis section explores various essential of C language that do not fit into a single category but play a vital role in C programming and provide advanced functionality to your program PreprocessorsMacrosQuiz  Preprocessors and Macros Header FilesDate and TimeLinkageStorage

explore advanced topics such as Data structures and Algorithms in C to solve complex problems and you can also contribute to open source projects  or even start preparing for competitive programming contests to and gain some hands on experience  Job Roles for C ProgrammersC is worth learning in      as it is still used for system programming  embedded systems  operating systems  game engines  networking  and high performance computing  C programmers can work in roles such as Embedded Systems Engineer  Engineers who develop embedded systems  that mainly concern on hardware and software integration for devices like IoT  Firmware Engineer  Create firmware for hardware devices to control their functionality and ensure proper operation of embedded systems System Programmer  People who work on system level software like operating systems  device drivers  Game Developer  Designs and creates video games ensuring smooth gameplay across platforms Network Engineer  Configure create and manage computer networks  like LANs  WANs  to ensure efficient and secure communication across the network You can use our list of carefully selected interview questions based on C programming to
