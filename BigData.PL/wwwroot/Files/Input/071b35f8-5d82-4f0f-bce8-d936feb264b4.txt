A recommender system  RecSys   or a recommendation system  sometimes replacing system with terms such as platform  engine  or algorithm   sometimes only called  the algorithm  or  algorithm             is a subclass of information filtering system that provides suggestions for items that are most pertinent to a particular user                                   Recommender systems are particularly useful when an individual needs to choose an item from a potentially overwhelming number of items that a service may offer                        Modern recommendation systems such as those used on large social media sites  make extensive use of AI  machine learning and related techniques to learn the behavior and preferences of each user  and tailor their feed accordingly            
Typically  the suggestions refer to various decision making processes  such as what product to purchase  what music to listen to  or what online news to read            
Recommender systems are used in a variety of areas  with commonly recognised examples taking the form of playlist generators for video and music services  product recommenders for online stores  or content recommenders for social media platforms and open web content recommenders                        These systems can operate using a single type of input  like music  or multiple inputs within and across platforms like news  books and search queries  There are also popular recommender systems for specific topics like restaurants and online dating  Recommender systems have also been developed to explore research articles and experts             collaborators              and financial services             
A content discovery platform is an implemented software recommendation platform which uses recommender system tools  It utilizes user metadata in order to discover and recommend appropriate content  whilst reducing ongoing maintenance and development costs  A content discovery platform delivers personalized content to websites  mobile devices and set top boxes  A large range of content discovery platforms currently exist for various forms of content ranging from news articles and academic journal articles             to television              As operators compete to be the gateway to home entertainment  personalized television is a key service differentiator  Academic content discovery has recently become another area of interest  with several companies being established to help academic researchers keep up to date with relevant academic content and serendipitously discover new content             


Overview edit 
Recommender systems usually make use of either or both collaborative filtering and content based filtering  as well as other systems such as knowledge based systems  Collaborative filtering approaches build a model from a user s past behavior  items previously purchased or selected and or numerical ratings given to those items  as well as similar decisions made by other users  This model is then used to predict items  or ratings for items  that the user may have an interest in              Content based filtering approaches utilize a series of discrete  pre tagged characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties             
The differences between collaborative and content based filtering can be demonstrated by comparing two early music recommender systems  Last fm and Pandora Radio 

Last fm creates a  station  of recommended songs by observing what bands and individual tracks the user has listened to on a regular basis and comparing those against the listening behavior of other users  Last fm will play tracks that do not appear in the user s library  but are often played by other users with similar interests  As this approach leverages the behavior of users  it is an example of a collaborative filtering technique             
Pandora uses the properties of a song or artist  a subset of the     attributes provided by the Music Genome Project  to seed a  station  that plays music with similar properties  User feedback is used to refine the station s results  deemphasizing certain attributes when a user  dislikes  a particular song and emphasizing other attributes when a user  likes  a song  This is an example of a content based approach 
Each type of system has its strengths and weaknesses  In the above example  Last fm requires a large amount of information about a user to make accurate recommendations  This is an example of the cold start problem  and is common in collaborative filtering systems                                                                          Whereas Pandora needs very little information to start  it is far more limited in scope  for example  it can only make recommendations that are similar to the original seed  
Recommender systems are a useful alternative to search algorithms since they help users discover items they might not have found otherwise  Of note  recommender systems are often implemented using search engines indexing non traditional data 
Recommender systems have been the focus of several granted patents                                                              and there are more than    software libraries             that support the development of recommender systems including LensKit                          RecBole              ReChorus             and RecPack             

History edit 
Elaine Rich created the first recommender system in       called Grundy                          She looked for a way to recommend users books they might like  Her idea was to create a system that asks users specific questions and classifies them into classes of preferences  or  stereotypes   depending on their answers  Depending on users  stereotype membership  they would then get recommendations for books they might like 
Another early recommender system  called a  digital bookshelf   was described in a      technical report by Jussi Karlgren at Columbia University 
            
and implemented at scale and worked through in technical reports and publications from      onwards by Jussi Karlgren  then at SICS                         
and research groups led by Pattie Maes at MIT              Will Hill at Bellcore              and Paul Resnick  also at MIT                         whose work with GroupLens was awarded the      ACM Software Systems Award 
Montaner provided the first overview of recommender systems from an intelligent agent perspective              Adomavicius provided a new  alternate overview of recommender systems               Herlocker provides an additional overview of evaluation techniques for recommender systems              and Beel et al  discussed the problems of offline evaluations              Beel et al  have also provided literature surveys on available research paper recommender systems and existing challenges                         

Approaches edit 
Collaborative filtering edit 
Main article  Collaborative filtering
An example of collaborative filtering based on a rating system
One approach to the design of recommender systems that has wide use is collaborative filtering              Collaborative filtering is based on the assumption that people who agreed in the past will agree in the future  and that they will like similar kinds of items as they liked in the past  The system generates recommendations using only information about rating profiles for different users or items  By locating peer users items with a rating history similar to the current user or item  they generate recommendations using this neighborhood  Collaborative filtering methods are classified as memory based and model based  A well known example of memory based approaches is the user based algorithm              while that of model based approaches is matrix factorization  recommender systems              
A key advantage of the collaborative filtering approach is that it does not rely on machine analyzable content and therefore it is capable of accurately recommending complex items such as movies without requiring an  understanding  of the item itself  Many algorithms have been used in measuring user similarity or item similarity in recommender systems  For example  the k nearest neighbor  k NN  approach             and the Pearson Correlation as first implemented by Allen             
When building a model from a user s behavior  a distinction is often made between explicit and implicit forms of data collection 
Examples of explicit data collection include the following 

Asking a user to rate an item on a sliding scale 
Asking a user to search 
Asking a user to rank a collection of items from favorite to least favorite 
Presenting two items to a user and asking him her to choose the better one of them 
Asking a user to create a list of items that he she likes  see Rocchio classification or other similar techniques  
Examples of implicit data collection include the following 

Observing the items that a user views in an online store 
Analyzing item user viewing times             
Keeping a record of the items that a user purchases online 
Obtaining a list of items that a user has listened to or watched on his her computer 
Analyzing the user s social network and discovering similar likes and dislikes 
Collaborative filtering approaches often suffer from three problems  cold start  scalability  and sparsity             

Cold start  For a new user or item  there is not enough data to make accurate recommendations  Note  one commonly implemented solution to this problem is the multi armed bandit algorithm                                                             
Scalability  There are millions of users and products in many of the environments in which these systems make recommendations  Thus  a large amount of computation power is often necessary to calculate recommendations 
Sparsity  The number of items sold on major e commerce sites is extremely large  The most active users will only have rated a small subset of the overall database  Thus  even the most popular items have very few ratings 
One of the most famous examples of collaborative filtering is item to item collaborative filtering  people who buy x also buy y   an algorithm popularized by Amazon com s recommender system             
Many social networks originally used collaborative filtering to recommend new friends  groups  and other social connections by examining the network of connections between a user and their friends             Collaborative filtering is still used as part of hybrid systems 

Content based filtering edit 
Another common approach when designing recommender systems is content based filtering  Content based filtering methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the user s preferences                          These methods are best suited to situations where there is known data on an item  name  location  description  etc    but not on the user  Content based recommenders treat recommendation as a user specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user s likes and dislikes based on an item s features 
In this system  keywords are used to describe the items  and a user profile is built to indicate the type of item this user likes  In other words  these algorithms try to recommend items similar to those that a user liked in the past or is examining in the present  It does not rely on a user sign in mechanism to generate this often temporary profile  In particular  various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user  and the best matching items are recommended  This approach has its roots in information retrieval and information filtering research 
To create a user profile  the system mostly focuses on two types of information 

A model of the user s preference 
A history of the user s interaction with the recommender system 
Basically  these methods use an item profile  i e   a set of discrete attributes and features  characterizing the item within the system  To abstract the features of the items in the system  an item presentation algorithm is applied  A widely used algorithm is the tf idf representation  also called vector space representation               The system creates a content based profile of users based on a weighted vector of item features  The weights denote the importance of each feature to the user and can be computed from individually rated content vectors using a variety of techniques  Simple approaches use the average values of the rated item vector while other sophisticated methods use machine learning techniques such as Bayesian Classifiers  cluster analysis  decision trees  and artificial neural networks in order to estimate the probability that the user is going to like the item             
A key issue with content based filtering is whether the system can learn user preferences from users  actions regarding one content source and use them across other content types  When the system is limited to recommending content of the same type as the user is already using  the value from the recommendation system is significantly less than when other content types from other services can be recommended  For example  recommending news articles based on news browsing is useful  Still  it would be much more useful when music  videos  products  discussions  etc   from different services  can be recommended based on news browsing  To overcome this  most content based recommender systems now use some form of the hybrid system 
Content based recommender systems can also include opinion based recommender systems  In some cases  users are allowed to leave text reviews or feedback on the items  These user generated texts are implicit data for the recommender system because they are potentially rich resources of both feature aspects of the item and users  evaluation sentiment to the item  Features extracted from the user generated reviews are improved metadata of items  because as they also reflect aspects of the item like metadata  extracted features are widely concerned by the users  Sentiments extracted from the reviews can be seen as users  rating scores on the corresponding features  Popular approaches of opinion based recommender system utilize various techniques including text mining  information retrieval  sentiment analysis  see also Multimodal sentiment analysis  and deep learning             

Hybrid recommendations approaches edit 
Most recommender systems now use a hybrid approach  combining collaborative filtering  content based filtering  and other approaches  There is no reason why several different techniques of the same type could not be hybridized  Hybrid approaches can be implemented in several ways  by making content based and collaborative based predictions separately and then combining them  by adding content based capabilities to a collaborative based approach  and vice versa   or by unifying the approaches into one model              Several studies that empirically compared the performance of the hybrid with the pure collaborative and content based methods and demonstrated that the hybrid methods can provide more accurate recommendations than pure approaches  These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem  as well as the knowledge engineering bottleneck in knowledge based approaches             
Netflix is a good example of the use of hybrid recommender systems              The website makes recommendations by comparing the watching and searching habits of similar users  i e   collaborative filtering  as well as by offering movies that share characteristics with films that a user has rated highly  content based filtering  
Some hybridization techniques include 

Weighted  Combining the score of different recommendation components numerically 
Switching  Choosing among recommendation components and applying the selected one 
Mixed  Recommendations from different recommenders are presented together to give the recommendation 
Cascade  Recommenders are given strict priority  with the lower priority ones breaking ties in the scoring of the higher ones 
Meta level  One recommendation technique is applied and produces some sort of model  which is then the input used by the next technique             
Technologies edit 
Session based recommender systems edit 
These recommender systems use the interactions of a user within a session             to generate recommendations  Session based recommender systems are used at YouTube             and Amazon              These are particularly useful when history  such as past clicks  purchases  of a user is not available or not relevant in the current user session  Domains where session based recommendations are particularly relevant include video  e commerce  travel  music and more  Most instances of session based recommender systems rely on the sequence of recent interactions within a session without requiring any additional details  historical  demographic  of the user  Techniques for session based recommendations are mainly based on generative sequential models such as recurrent neural networks                          transformers              and other deep learning based approaches                         

Reinforcement learning for recommender systems edit 
The recommendation problem can be seen as a special instance of a reinforcement learning problem whereby the user is the environment upon which the agent  the recommendation system acts upon in order to receive a reward  for instance  a click or engagement by the user                                      One aspect of reinforcement learning that is of particular use in the area of recommender systems is the fact that the models or policies can be learned by providing a reward to the recommendation agent  This is in contrast to traditional learning techniques which rely on supervised learning approaches that are less flexible  reinforcement learning recommendation techniques allow to potentially train models that can be optimized directly on metrics of engagement  and user interest             

Multi criteria recommender systems edit 
Multi criteria recommender systems  MCRS  can be defined as recommender systems that incorporate preference information upon multiple criteria  Instead of developing recommendation techniques based on a single criterion value  the overall preference of user u for the item i  these systems try to predict a rating for unexplored items of u by exploiting preference information on multiple criteria that affect this overall preference value  Several researchers approach MCRS as a multi criteria decision making  MCDM  problem  and apply MCDM methods and techniques to implement MCRS systems              See this chapter             for an extended introduction 

Risk aware recommender systems edit 
The majority of existing approaches to recommender systems focus on recommending the most relevant content to users using contextual information  yet do not take into account the risk of disturbing the user with unwanted notifications  It is important to consider the risk of upsetting the user by pushing recommendations in certain circumstances  for instance  during a professional meeting  early morning  or late at night  Therefore  the performance of the recommender system depends in part on the degree to which it has incorporated the risk into the recommendation process  One option to manage this issue is DRARS  a system which models the context aware recommendation as a bandit problem  This system combines a content based technique and a contextual bandit algorithm             

Mobile recommender systems edit 
Further information  Location based recommendation
Mobile recommender systems make use of internet accessing smartphones to offer personalized  context sensitive recommendations  This is a particularly difficult area of research as mobile data is more complex than data that recommender systems often have to deal with  It is heterogeneous  noisy  requires spatial and temporal auto correlation  and has validation and generality problems             
There are three factors that could affect the mobile recommender systems and the accuracy of prediction results  the context  the recommendation method and privacy              Additionally  mobile recommender systems suffer from a transplantation problem   recommendations may not apply in all regions  for instance  it would be unwise to recommend a recipe in an area where all of the ingredients may not be available  
One example of a mobile recommender system are the approaches taken by companies such as Uber and Lyft to generate driving routes for taxi drivers in a city              This system uses GPS data of the routes that taxi drivers take while working  which includes location  latitude and longitude   time stamps  and operational status  with or without passengers   It uses this data to recommend a list of pickup points along a route  with the goal of optimizing occupancy times and profits 

Generative recommenders edit 
Generative recommenders  GR  represent an approach that transforms recommendation tasks into sequential transduction problems  where user actions are treated like tokens in a generative modeling framework  In one method  known as HSTU  Hierarchical Sequential Transduction Units               high cardinality  non stationary  and streaming datasets are efficiently processed as sequences  enabling the model to learn from trillions of parameters and to handle user action histories orders of magnitude longer than before  By turning all of the system s varied data into a single stream of tokens and using a custom self attention approach instead of traditional neural network layers  generative recommenders make the model much simpler and less memory hungry  As a result  it can improve recommendation quality in test simulations and in real world tests  while being faster than previous Transformer based systems when handling long lists of user actions  Ultimately  this approach allows the model s performance to grow steadily as more computing power is used  laying a foundation for efficient and scalable  foundation models  for recommendations 

The Netflix Prize edit 
Main article  Netflix Prize
One of the events that energized research in recommender systems was the Netflix Prize  From      to       Netflix sponsored a competition  offering a grand prize of            to the team that could take an offered dataset of over     million movie ratings and return recommendations that were     more accurate than those offered by the company s existing recommender system  This competition energized the search for new and more accurate algorithms  On    September       the grand prize of US           was given to the BellKor s Pragmatic Chaos team using tiebreaking rules             
The most accurate algorithm in      used an ensemble method of     different algorithmic approaches  blended into a single prediction  As stated by the winners  Bell et al              


Predictive accuracy is substantially improved when blending multiple predictors  Our experience is that most efforts should be concentrated in deriving substantially different approaches  rather than refining a single technique   Consequently  our solution is an ensemble of many methods 
Many benefits accrued to the web due to the Netflix project  Some teams have taken their technology and applied it to other markets  Some members from the team that finished second place founded Gravity R amp D  a recommendation engine that s active in the RecSys community                            Tell  Inc  created a Netflix project derived solution for ecommerce websites 
A number of privacy issues arose around the dataset offered by Netflix for the Netflix Prize competition  Although the data sets were anonymized in order to preserve customer privacy  in      two researchers from the University of Texas were able to identify individual users by matching the data sets with film ratings on the Internet Movie Database  IMDb               As a result  in December       an anonymous Netflix user sued Netflix in Doe v  Netflix  alleging that Netflix had violated United States fair trade laws and the Video Privacy Protection Act by releasing the datasets              This  as well as concerns from the Federal Trade Commission  led to the cancellation of a second Netflix Prize competition in                  

Evaluation edit 
Performance measures edit 
Evaluation is important in assessing the effectiveness of recommendation algorithms  To measure the effectiveness of recommender systems  and compare different approaches  three types of evaluations are available  user studies  online evaluations  A B tests   and offline evaluations             
The commonly used metrics are the mean squared error and root mean squared error  the latter having been used in the Netflix Prize  The information retrieval metrics such as precision and recall or DCG are useful to assess the quality of a recommendation method  Diversity  novelty  and coverage are also considered as important aspects in evaluation              However  many of the classic evaluation measures are highly criticized             
Evaluating the performance of a recommendation algorithm on a fixed test dataset will always be extremely challenging as it is impossible to accurately predict the reactions of real users to the recommendations  Hence any metric that computes the effectiveness of an algorithm in offline data will be imprecise 
User studies are rather a small scale  A few dozens or hundreds of users are presented recommendations created by different recommendation approaches  and then the users judge which recommendations are best 
In A B tests  recommendations are shown to typically thousands of users of a real product  and the recommender system randomly picks at least two different recommendation approaches to generate recommendations  The effectiveness is measured with implicit measures of effectiveness such as conversion rate or click through rate 
Offline evaluations are based on historic data  e g  a dataset that contains information about how users previously rated movies             
The effectiveness of recommendation approaches is then measured based on how well a recommendation approach can predict the users  ratings in the dataset  While a rating is an explicit expression of whether a user liked a movie  such information is not available in all domains  For instance  in the domain of citation recommender systems  users typically do not rate a citation or recommended article  In such cases  offline evaluations may use implicit measures of effectiveness  For instance  it may be assumed that a recommender system is effective that is able to recommend as many articles as possible that are contained in a research article s reference list  However  this kind of offline evaluations is seen critical by many researchers                                                  For instance  it has been shown that results of offline evaluations have low correlation with results from user studies or A B tests                          A dataset popular for offline evaluation has been shown to contain duplicate data and thus to lead to wrong conclusions in the evaluation of algorithms              Often  results of so called offline evaluations do not correlate with actually assessed user satisfaction              This is probably because offline training is highly biased toward the highly reachable items  and offline testing data is highly influenced by the outputs of the online recommendation module                          Researchers have concluded that the results of offline evaluations should be viewed critically             

Beyond accuracy edit 
Typically  research on recommender systems is concerned with finding the most accurate recommendation algorithms  However  there are a number of factors that are also important 

Diversity   Users tend to be more satisfied with recommendations when there is a higher intra list diversity  e g  items from different artists                         
Recommender persistence   In some situations  it is more effective to re show recommendations               or let users re rate items               than showing new items  There are several reasons for this  Users may ignore items when they are shown for the first time  for instance  because they had no time to inspect the recommendations carefully 
Privacy   Recommender systems usually have to deal with privacy concerns              because users have to reveal sensitive information  Building user profiles using collaborative filtering can be problematic from a privacy point of view  Many European countries have a strong culture of data privacy  and every attempt to introduce any level of user profiling can result in a negative customer response  Much research has been conducted on ongoing privacy issues in this space  The Netflix Prize is particularly notable for the detailed personal information released in its dataset  Ramakrishnan et al  have conducted an extensive overview of the trade offs between personalization and privacy and found that the combination of weak ties  an unexpected connection that provides serendipitous recommendations  and other data sources can be used to uncover identities of users in an anonymized dataset              
User demographics   Beel et al  found that user demographics may influence how satisfied users are with recommendations               In their paper they show that elderly users tend to be more interested in recommendations than younger users 
Robustness   When users can participate in the recommender system  the issue of fraud must be addressed              
Serendipity   Serendipity is a measure of  how surprising the recommendations are                            For instance  a recommender system that recommends milk to a customer in a grocery store might be perfectly accurate  but it is not a good recommendation because it is an obvious item for the customer to buy    Serendipity  serves two purposes  First  the chance that users lose interest because the choice set is too uniform decreases  Second  these items are needed for algorithms to learn and improve themselves               
Trust   A recommender system is of little value for a user if the user does not trust the system               Trust can be built by a recommender system by explaining how it generates recommendations  and why it recommends an item 
Labelling   User satisfaction with recommendations may be influenced by the labeling of the recommendations               For instance  in the cited study click through rate  CTR  for recommendations labeled as  Sponsored  were lower  CTR        than CTR for identical recommendations labeled as  Organic   CTR         Recommendations with no label performed best  CTR        in that study 
Reproducibility edit 
Recommender systems are notoriously difficult to evaluate offline  with some researchers claiming that this has led to a reproducibility crisis in recommender systems publications  The topic of reproducibility seems to be a recurrent issue in some Machine Learning publication venues  but does not have a considerable effect beyond the world of scientific publication  In the context of recommender systems a      paper surveyed a small number of hand picked publications applying deep learning or neural methods to the top k recommendation problem  published in top conferences  SIGIR  KDD  WWW  RecSys  IJCAI   has shown that on average less than     of articles could be reproduced by the authors of the survey  with as little as     in some conferences  The articles considers a number of potential problems in today s research scholarship and suggests improved scientific practices in that area                                        
More recent work on benchmarking a set of the same methods came to qualitatively very different results              whereby neural methods were found to be among the best performing methods  Deep learning and neural methods for recommender systems have been used in the winning solutions in several recent recommender system challenges  WSDM               RecSys Challenge              
Moreover  neural and deep learning methods are widely used in industry where they are extensively tested                                       The topic of reproducibility is not new in recommender systems  By       Ekstrand  Konstan  et al  criticized that  it is currently difficult to reproduce and extend recommender systems research results   and that evaluations are  not handled consistently                Konstan and Adomavicius conclude that  the Recommender Systems research community is facing a crisis where a significant number of papers present results that contribute little to collective knowledge       often because the research lacks the       evaluation to be properly judged and  hence  to provide meaningful contributions                As a consequence  much research about recommender systems can be considered as not reproducible               Hence  operators of recommender systems find little guidance in the current research for answering the question  which recommendation approaches to use in a recommender systems  Said and Bellog n conducted a study of papers published in the field  as well as benchmarked some of the most popular frameworks for recommendation and found large inconsistencies in results  even when the same algorithms and data sets were used               Some researchers demonstrated that minor variations in the recommendation algorithms or scenarios led to strong changes in the effectiveness of a recommender system  They conclude that seven actions are necessary to improve the current situation                    survey other research fields and learn from them      find a common understanding of reproducibility      identify and understand the determinants that affect reproducibility      conduct more comprehensive experiments     modernize publication practices      foster the development and use of recommendation frameworks  and     establish best practice guidelines for recommender systems research

Artificial intelligence  AI  applications in recommendation systems are the advanced methodologies that leverage AI technologies  to enhance the performance recommendation engines  The AI based recommender can analyze complex data sets  learning from user behavior  preferences  and interactions to generate highly accurate and personalized content or product suggestions               The integration of AI in recommendation systems has marked a significant evolution from traditional recommendation methods  Traditional methods often relied on inflexible algorithms that could suggest items based on general user trends or apparent similarities in content  In comparison  AI powered systems have the capability to detect patterns and subtle distinctions that may be overlooked by traditional methods               These systems can adapt to specific individual preferences  thereby offering recommendations that are more aligned with individual user needs  This approach marks a shift towards more personalized  user centric suggestions 
Recommendation systems widely adopt AI techniques such as machine learning  deep learning  and natural language processing               These advanced methods enhance system capabilities to predict user preferences and deliver personalized content more accurately  Each technique contributes uniquely  The following sections will introduce specific AI models utilized by a recommendation system by illustrating their theories and functionalities      citation needed     

KNN based collaborative filters edit 
Collaborative filtering  CF  is one of the most commonly used recommendation system algorithms  It generates personalized suggestions for users based on explicit or implicit behavioral patterns to form predictions               Specifically  it relies on external feedback such as star ratings  purchasing history and so on to make judgments  CF make predictions about users  preference based on similarity measurements  Essentially  the underlying theory is   if user A is similar to user B  and if A likes item C  then it is likely that B also likes item C  
There are many models available for collaborative filtering  For AI applied collaborative filtering  a common model is called K nearest neighbors  The ideas are as follows 

Data Representation  Create a n dimensional space where each axis represents a user s trait  ratings  purchases  etc    Represent the user as a point in that space 
Statistical Distance   Distance  measures how far apart users are in this space  See statistical distance for computational details
Identifying Neighbors  Based on the computed distances  find k nearest neighbors of the user to which we want to make recommendations
Forming Predictive Recommendations  The system will analyze the similar preference of the k neighbors  The system will make recommendations based on that similarity
Neural networks edit 
An artificial neural network  ANN   is a deep learning model structure which aims to mimic a human brain  They comprise a series of neurons  each responsible for receiving and processing information transmitted from other interconnected neurons               Similar to a human brain  these neurons will change activation state based on incoming signals  training input and backpropagated output   allowing the system to adjust activation weights during the network learning phase  ANN is usually designed to be a black box model  Unlike regular machine learning where the underlying theoretical components are formal and rigid  the collaborative effects of neurons are not entirely clear  but modern experiments has shown the predictive power of ANN 
ANN is widely used in recommendation systems for its power to utilize various data  Other than feedback data  ANN can incorporate non feedback data which are too intricate for collaborative filtering to learn  and the unique structure allows ANN to identify extra signal from non feedback data to boost user experience               Following are some examples 

Time and Seasonality  what specify time and date or a season that a user interacts with the platform
User Navigation Patterns  sequence of pages visited  time spent on different parts of a website  mouse movement  etc 
External Social Trends  information from outer social media
Two Tower Model edit 
The Two Tower model is a neural architecture              commonly employed in large scale recommendation systems  particularly for candidate retrieval tasks               It consists of two neural networks 

User Tower  Encodes user specific features  such as interaction history or demographic data 
Item Tower  Encodes item specific features  such as metadata or content embeddings 
The outputs of the two towers are fixed length embeddings that represent users and items in a shared vector space  A similarity metric  such as dot product or cosine similarity  is used to measure relevance between a user and an item 
This model is highly efficient for large datasets as embeddings can be pre computed for items  allowing rapid retrieval during inference  It is often used in conjunction with ranking models for end to end recommendation pipelines 

Natural language processing edit 
Natural language processing is a series of AI algorithms to make natural human language accessible and analyzable to a machine               It is a fairly modern technique inspired by the growing amount of textual information  For application in recommendation system  a common case is the Amazon customer review  Amazon will analyze the feedbacks comments from each customer and report relevant data to other customers for reference  The recent years have witnessed the development of various text analysis models  including latent semantic analysis  LSA   singular value decomposition  SVD   latent Dirichlet allocation  LDA   etc  Their uses have consistently aimed to provide customers with more precise and tailored recommendations 

Specific applications edit 
Academic content discovery edit 
An emerging market for content discovery platforms is academic content                            Approximately      academic journal articles are published daily  making it increasingly difficult for researchers to balance time management with staying up to date with relevant research              Though traditional tools academic search tools such as Google Scholar or PubMed provide a readily accessible database of journal articles  content recommendation in these cases are performed in a  linear  fashion  with users setting  alarms  for new publications based on keywords  journals or particular authors 
Google Scholar provides an  Updates  tool that suggests articles by using a statistical model that takes a researchers  authorized paper and citations as input              Whilst these recommendations have been noted to be extremely good  this poses a problem with early career researchers which may be lacking a sufficient body of work to produce accurate recommendations             

Decision making edit

In contrast to an engagement based ranking system employed by social media and other digital platforms  a bridging based ranking optimizes for content that is unifying instead of polarizing                            Examples include Polis and Remesh which have been used around the world to help find more consensus around specific political issues               Twitter has also used this approach for managing its community notes               which YouTube planned to pilot in                                 Aviv Ovadya also argues for implementing bridging based algorithms in major platforms by empowering deliberative groups that are representative of the platform s users to control the design and implementation of the algorithm              

Television edit 
As the connected television landscape continues to evolve  search and recommendation are seen as having an even more pivotal role in the discovery of content               With broadband connected devices  consumers are projected to have access to content from linear broadcast sources as well as internet television  Therefore  there is a risk that the market could become fragmented  leaving it to the viewer to visit various locations and find what they want to watch in a way that is time consuming and complicated for them  By using a search and recommendation engine  viewers are provided with a central  portal  from which to discover content from several sources in just one location
