							Members of the parliament representing the governorate of Port Said defended protesters who took the streets in their hometown on Tuesday  against sudden increase in the prices of flats that were part of a social housing programme 
 Those protests were not directed against the state or the army  There were no chants against the military or President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi or state institutions   read a copy of the statement published by state news agency MENA 
The MPs said that some media outlets wrongly portrayed the issue  adding that the citizens of Port Said decided to stand up to those trying to manipulate them 
Nearly a dozen demonstrators were arrested on Tuesday night for protesting against price increases forced upon them by the Housing and Development Bank  HDB   for houses that had previously been booked and for which they had paid deposits 
Those arrested are being investigated and could face charges for obstructing roads  under the controversial Protest Law
