AlphaGo is a computer program that plays the board game Go             It was developed by the London based DeepMind Technologies             an acquired subsidiary of Google  Subsequent versions of AlphaGo became increasingly powerful  including a version that competed under the name Master             After retiring from competitive play  AlphaGo Master was succeeded by an even more powerful version known as AlphaGo Zero  which was completely self taught without learning from human games  AlphaGo Zero was then generalized into a program known as AlphaZero  which played additional games  including chess and shogi   AlphaZero has in turn been succeeded by a program known as MuZero which learns without being taught the rules 
AlphaGo and its successors use a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to find its moves based on knowledge previously acquired by machine learning  specifically by an artificial neural network  a deep learning method  by extensive training  both from human and computer play             A neural network is trained to identify the best moves and the winning percentages of these moves  This neural network improves the strength of the tree search  resulting in stronger move selection in the next iteration 
In October       in a match against Fan Hui  the original AlphaGo became the first computer Go program to beat a human professional Go player without handicap on a full sized       board                        In March       it beat Lee Sedol in a five game match  the first time a computer Go program has beaten a   dan professional without handicap             Although it lost to Lee Sedol in the fourth game  Lee resigned in the final game  giving a final score of   games to   in favour of AlphaGo  In recognition of the victory  AlphaGo was awarded an honorary   dan by the Korea Baduk Association             The lead up and the challenge match with Lee Sedol were documented in a documentary film also titled AlphaGo             directed by Greg Kohs  The win by AlphaGo was chosen by Science as one of the Breakthrough of the Year runners up on    December                  
At the      Future of Go Summit  the Master version of AlphaGo beat Ke Jie  the number one ranked player in the world at the time  in a three game match  after which AlphaGo was awarded professional   dan by the Chinese Weiqi Association             
After the match between AlphaGo and Ke Jie  DeepMind retired AlphaGo  while continuing AI research in other areas              The self taught AlphaGo Zero achieved a       victory against the early competitive version of AlphaGo  and its successor AlphaZero was perceived as the world s top player in Go by the end of the     s                         


History edit 
Decommissioned AlphaGo backend rack
Go is considered much more difficult for computers to win than other games such as chess  because its strategic and aesthetic nature makes it hard to directly construct an evaluation function  and its much larger branching factor makes it prohibitively difficult to use traditional AI methods such as alpha beta pruning  tree traversal and heuristic search                        
Almost two decades after IBM s computer Deep Blue beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov in the      match  the strongest Go programs using artificial intelligence techniques only reached about amateur   dan level             and still could not beat a professional Go player without a handicap                                    In       the software program Zen  running on a four PC cluster  beat Masaki Takemiya   p  twice at five  and four stone handicaps              In       Crazy Stone beat Yoshio Ishida   p  at a four stone handicap             
According to DeepMind s David Silver  the AlphaGo research project was formed around      to test how well a neural network using deep learning can compete at Go              AlphaGo represents a significant improvement over previous Go programs  In     games against other available Go programs  including Crazy Stone and Zen  AlphaGo running on a single computer won all but one              In a similar matchup  AlphaGo running on multiple computers won all     games played against other Go programs  and     of games played against AlphaGo running on a single computer  The distributed version in October      was using       CPUs and     GPUs            

Match against Fan Hui edit 
Main article  AlphaGo versus Fan Hui
In October       the distributed version of AlphaGo defeated the European Go champion Fan Hui              a   dan  out of   dan possible  professional  five to zero                         This was the first time a computer Go program had beaten a professional human player on a full sized board without handicap              The announcement of the news was delayed until    January      to coincide with the publication of a paper in the journal Nature            describing the algorithms used            

Match against Lee Sedol edit 
Main article  AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol
AlphaGo played South Korean professional Go player Lee Sedol  ranked   dan  one of the best players at Go                  needs update      with five games taking place at the Four Seasons Hotel in Seoul  South Korea on                and    March                               which were video streamed live               Out of five games  AlphaGo won four games and Lee won the fourth game which made him recorded as the only human player who beat AlphaGo in all of its    official games              AlphaGo ran on Google s cloud computing with its servers located in the United States              The match used Chinese rules with a     point komi  and each side had two hours of thinking time plus three    second byoyomi periods              The version of AlphaGo playing against Lee used a similar amount of computing power as was used in the Fan Hui match              The Economist reported that it used       CPUs and     GPUs              At the time of play  Lee Sedol had the second highest number of Go international championship victories in the world after South Korean player Lee Chang ho who kept the world championship title for    years              Since there is no single official method of ranking in international Go  the rankings may vary among the sources  While he was ranked top sometimes  some sources ranked Lee Sedol as the fourth best player in the world at the time                          AlphaGo was not specifically trained to face Lee nor was designed to compete with any specific human players 
The first three games were won by AlphaGo following resignations by Lee                          However  Lee beat AlphaGo in the fourth game  winning by resignation at move      AlphaGo then continued to achieve a fourth win  winning the fifth game by resignation             
The prize was US   million  Since AlphaGo won four out of five and thus the series  the prize will be donated to charities  including UNICEF              Lee Sedol received          for participating in all five games and an additional         for his win in Game               
In June       at a presentation held at a university in the Netherlands  Aja Huang  one of the Deep Mind team  revealed that they had patched the logical weakness that occurred during the  th game of the match between AlphaGo and Lee  and that after move     which was dubbed the  divine move  by many professionals   it would play as intended and maintain Black s advantage  Before move     AlphaGo was leading throughout the game  but Lee s move caused the program s computing powers to be diverted and confused              Huang explained that AlphaGo s policy network of finding the most accurate move order and continuation did not precisely guide AlphaGo to make the correct continuation after move     since its value network did not determine Lee s   th move as being the most likely  and therefore when the move was made AlphaGo could not make the right adjustment to the logical continuation             

Sixty online games edit 
Main article  Master  software 
On    December       a new account on the Tygem server named  Magister   shown as  Magist  at the server s Chinese version  from South Korea began to play games with professional players  It changed its account name to  Master  on    December  then moved to the FoxGo server on   January       On   January  DeepMind confirmed that the  Magister  and the  Master  were both played by an updated version of AlphaGo  called AlphaGo Master                          As of   January       AlphaGo Master s online record was    wins and   losses              including three victories over Go s top ranked player  Ke Jie              who had been quietly briefed in advance that Master was a version of AlphaGo              After losing to Master  Gu Li offered a bounty of         yuan  US         to the first human player who could defeat Master              Master played at the pace of    games per day  Many quickly suspected it to be an AI player due to little or no resting between games  Its adversaries included many world champions such as Ke Jie  Park Jeong hwan  Yuta Iyama  Tuo Jiaxi  Mi Yuting  Shi Yue  Chen Yaoye  Li Qincheng  Gu Li  Chang Hao  Tang Weixing  Fan Tingyu  Zhou Ruiyang  Jiang Weijie  Chou Chun hsun  Kim Ji seok  Kang Dong yun  Park Yeong hun  and Won Seong jin  national champions or world championship runners up such as Lian Xiao  Tan Xiao  Meng Tailing  Dang Yifei  Huang Yunsong  Yang Dingxin  Gu Zihao  Shin Jinseo  Cho Han seung  and An Sungjoon  All    games except one were fast paced games with three    or    seconds byo yomi  Master offered to extend the byo yomi to one minute when playing with Nie Weiping in consideration of his age  After winning its   th game Master revealed itself in the chatroom to be controlled by Dr  Aja Huang of the DeepMind team              then changed its nationality to the United Kingdom  After these games were completed  the co founder of DeepMind  Demis Hassabis  said in a tweet   we re looking forward to playing some official  full length games later        in collaboration with Go organizations and experts                          
Go experts were impressed by the program s performance and its nonhuman play style  Ke Jie stated that  After humanity spent thousands of years improving our tactics  computers tell us that humans are completely wrong    I would go as far as to say not a single human has touched the edge of the truth of Go              

Future of Go Summit edit

Further information  AlphaGo versus Ke Jie
In the Future of Go Summit held in Wuzhen in May       AlphaGo Master played three games with Ke Jie  the world No   ranked player  as well as two games with several top Chinese professionals  one pair Go game and one against a collaborating team of five human players             
Google DeepMind offered     million dollar winner prizes for the three game match between Ke Jie and Master while the losing side took         dollars                          Master won all three games against Ke Jie                          after which AlphaGo was awarded professional   dan by the Chinese Weiqi Association             
After winning its three game match against Ke Jie  the top rated world Go player  AlphaGo retired  DeepMind also disbanded the team that worked on the game to focus on AI research in other areas              After the Summit  Deepmind published    full length AlphaGo vs AlphaGo matches  as a gift to the Go community             

AlphaGo Zero and AlphaZero edit 
Main articles  AlphaGo Zero and AlphaZero
AlphaGo s team published an article in the journal Nature on    October       introducing AlphaGo Zero  a version without human data and stronger than any previous human champion defeating version              By playing games against itself  AlphaGo Zero surpassed the strength of AlphaGo Lee in three days by winning     games to    reached the level of AlphaGo Master in    days  and exceeded all the old versions in    days             
In a paper released on arXiv on   December       DeepMind claimed that it generalized AlphaGo Zero s approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm  which achieved within    hours a superhuman level of play in the games of chess  shogi  and Go by defeating world champion programs  Stockfish  Elmo  and   day version of AlphaGo Zero in each case             

Teaching tool edit 
On    December       DeepMind released an AlphaGo teaching tool on its website             to analyze winning rates of different Go openings as calculated by AlphaGo Master              The teaching tool collects       Go openings from         human games each analyzed with            simulations by AlphaGo Master  Many of the openings include human move suggestions             

Versions edit 
An early version of AlphaGo was tested on hardware with various numbers of CPUs and GPUs  running in asynchronous or distributed mode  Two seconds of thinking time was given to each move  The resulting Elo ratings are listed below             In the matches with more time per move higher ratings are achieved

Algorithm edit 
As of       AlphaGo s algorithm uses a combination of machine learning and tree search techniques  combined with extensive training  both from human and computer play  It uses Monte Carlo tree search  guided by a  value network  and a  policy network   both implemented using deep neural network technology                        A limited amount of game specific feature detection pre processing  for example  to highlight whether a move matches a nakade pattern  is applied to the input before it is sent to the neural networks             The networks are convolutional neural networks with    layers  trained by reinforcement learning             
The system s neural networks were initially bootstrapped from human gameplay expertise  AlphaGo was initially trained to mimic human play by attempting to match the moves of expert players from recorded historical games  using a database of around    million moves              Once it had reached a certain degree of proficiency  it was trained further by being set to play large numbers of games against other instances of itself  using reinforcement learning to improve its play             To avoid  disrespectfully  wasting its opponent s time  the program is specifically programmed to resign if its assessment of win probability falls beneath a certain threshold  for the match against Lee  the resignation threshold was set to                 

Style of play edit 
Toby Manning  the match referee for AlphaGo vs  Fan Hui  has described the program s style as  conservative               AlphaGo s playing style strongly favours greater probability of winning by fewer points over lesser probability of winning by more points              Its strategy of maximising its probability of winning is distinct from what human players tend to do which is to maximise territorial gains  and explains some of its odd looking moves              It makes a lot of opening moves that have never or seldom been made by humans  It likes to use shoulder hits  especially if the opponent is over concentrated             

Responses to      victory edit 
AI community edit 
AlphaGo s March      victory was a major milestone in artificial intelligence research              Go had previously been regarded as a hard problem in machine learning that was expected to be out of reach for the technology of the time                                      Most experts thought a Go program as powerful as AlphaGo was at least five years away              some experts thought that it would take at least another decade before computers would beat Go champions                                     Most observers at the beginning of the      matches expected Lee to beat AlphaGo             
With games such as checkers  that has been solved by the Chinook computer engine   chess  and now Go won by computers  victories at popular board games can no longer serve as major milestones for artificial intelligence in the way that they used to  Deep Blue s Murray Campbell called AlphaGo s victory  the end of an era    board games are more or less done and it s time to move on              
When compared with Deep Blue or Watson  AlphaGo s underlying algorithms are potentially more general purpose and may be evidence that the scientific community is making progress towards artificial general intelligence                          Some commentators believe AlphaGo s victory makes for a good opportunity for society to start preparing for the possible future impact of machines with general purpose intelligence  As noted by entrepreneur Guy Suter  AlphaGo only knows how to play Go and doesn t possess general purpose intelligence    It  couldn t just wake up one morning and decide it wants to learn how to use firearms               AI researcher Stuart Russell said that AI systems such as AlphaGo have progressed quicker and become more powerful than expected  and we must therefore develop methods to ensure they  remain under human control               Some scholars   such as Stephen Hawking  warned  in May      before the matches  that some future self improving AI could gain actual general intelligence  leading to an unexpected AI takeover  other scholars disagree  AI expert Jean Gabriel Ganascia believes that  Things like  common sense     may never be reproducible               and says  I don t see why we would speak about fears  On the contrary  this raises hopes in many domains such as health and space exploration               Computer scientist Richard Sutton said  I don t think people should be scared    but I do think people should be paying attention              
In China  AlphaGo was a  Sputnik moment  which helped convince the Chinese government to prioritize and dramatically increase funding for artificial intelligence             
In       the DeepMind AlphaGo team received the inaugural IJCAI Marvin Minsky medal for Outstanding Achievements in AI   AlphaGo is a wonderful achievement  and a perfect example of what the Minsky Medal was initiated to recognise   said Professor Michael Wooldridge  Chair of the IJCAI Awards Committee    What particularly impressed IJCAI was that AlphaGo achieves what it does through a brilliant combination of classic AI techniques as well as the state of the art machine learning techniques that DeepMind is so closely associated with  It s a breathtaking demonstration of contemporary AI  and we are delighted to be able to recognise it with this award              

Go community edit 
Go is a popular game in China  Japan and Korea  and the      matches were watched by perhaps a hundred million people worldwide                          Many top Go players characterized AlphaGo s unorthodox plays as seemingly questionable moves that initially befuddled onlookers  but made sense in hindsight               All but the very best Go players craft their style by imitating top players  AlphaGo seems to have totally original moves it creates itself               AlphaGo appeared to have unexpectedly become much stronger  even when compared with its October      match             where a computer had beaten a Go professional for the first time ever without the advantage of a handicap              The day after Lee s first defeat  Jeong Ahram  the lead Go correspondent for one of South Korea s biggest daily newspapers  said  Last night was very gloomy    Many people drank alcohol               The Korea Baduk Association  the organization that oversees Go professionals in South Korea  awarded AlphaGo an honorary   dan title for exhibiting creative skills and pushing forward the game s progress             
China s Ke Jie  an    year old generally recognized as the world s best Go player at the time                          initially claimed that he would be able to beat AlphaGo  but declined to play against it for fear that it would  copy my style               As the matches progressed  Ke Jie went back and forth  stating that  it is highly likely that I  could  lose  after analysing the first three matches              but regaining confidence after AlphaGo displayed flaws in the fourth match             
Toby Manning  the referee of AlphaGo s match against Fan Hui  and Hajin Lee  secretary general of the International Go Federation  both reason that in the future  Go players will get help from computers to learn what they have done wrong in games and improve their skills             
After game two  Lee said he felt  speechless    From the very beginning of the match  I could never manage an upper hand for one single move  It was AlphaGo s total victory               Lee apologized for his losses  stating after game three that  I misjudged the capabilities of AlphaGo and felt powerless               He emphasized that the defeat was  Lee Se dol s defeat  and  not a defeat of mankind                           Lee said his eventual loss to a machine was  inevitable  but stated that  robots will never understand the beauty of the game the same way that we humans do               Lee called his game four victory a  priceless win that I  would  not exchange for anything              

AlphaGo documentary film        edit 
Reception edit 

On Rotten Tomatoes the documentary has an average rating of      from    reviews              
Michael Rechtshaffen of the Los Angeles Times gave the documentary a positive review and said   It helps matters when you have a group of engaging human subjects like soft spoken Sedol  who s as intensively contemplative as the game itself  contrasted by the spirited  personable Fan Hui  the Paris based European champ who accepts an offer to serve as an advisor for the DeepMind team after suffering a demoralizing AI trouncing   He also mentioned that with the passion of Hauschka s Volker Bertelmann  the film s producer  this documentary shows many unexpected sequences  including strategic and philosophical components               Rechtshaffen      
John Defore of The Hollywood Reporter  wrote this documentary is  an involving sports rivalry doc with an AI twist    In the end  observers wonder if AlphaGo s odd variety of intuition might not kill Go as an intellectual pursuit but shift its course  forcing the game s scholars to consider it from new angles  So maybe it isn t time to welcome our computer overlords  and won t be for a while   maybe they ll teach us to be better thinkers before turning us into their slaves              
Greg Kohs  the director of the film  said  The complexity of the game of Go  combined with the technical depth of an emerging technology like artificial intelligence seemed like it might create an insurmountable barrier for a film like this  The fact that I was so innocently unaware of Go and AlphaGo actually proved to be beneficial  It allowed me to approach the action and interviews with pure curiosity  the kind that helps make any subject matter emotionally accessible   Kohs also said that  Unlike the film s human characters   who turn their curious quest for knowledge into an epic spectacle with great existential implications  who dare to risk their reputation and pride to contest that curiosity   AI might not yet possess the ability to empathize  But it can teach us profound things about our humanness   the way we play board games  the way we think and feel and grow  It s a deep  vast premise  but my hope is  by sharing it  we can discover something within ourselves we never saw before              

Professional Go player edit 
Hajin Lee  a former professional Go player  described this documentary as being  beautifully filmed   In addition to the story itself  the feelings and atmosphere were also conveyed through different scene arrangements  For example  the close up shots of Lee Sedol when he realizes that the AlphaGo AI is intelligent  the atmospheric scene of the Korean commentator s distress and affliction following the first defeat  and the tension being held inside the room  The documentary also tells a story by describing the background of AlphaGo technology and the customs of the Korean Go community  She suggests some areas to be covered additionally  For instance  the details of the AI prior to AlphaGo  the confidence and pride of the professional Go players  and the shifting of perspective to the Go AI between and after the match as  If anything could be added  I would include information about the primitive level of top Go A I s before AlphaGo  and more about professional Go players  lives and pride  to provide more context for Lee Sedol s pre match confidence  and Go players  changing perception of AlphaGo as the match advanced               Lee        
Fan Hui  a professional Go player  and former player with AlphaGo said that  DeepMind had trained AlphaGo by showing it many strong amateur games of Go to develop its understanding of how a human plays before challenging it to play versions of itself thousands of times  a novel form of reinforcement learning which had given it the ability to rival an expert human  History had been made  and centuries of received learning overturned in the process  The program was free to learn the game for itself             

Technology and AI related fields edit 
James Vincent  a reporter from The Verge  comments that  It prods and pokes viewers with unsubtle emotional cues  like a reality TV show would   Now  you should be nervous  now you should feel relieved   The AlphaGo footage slowly captures the moment when Lee Sedol acknowledges the true power of AlphaGo AI  In the first game  he had more experience than his human programmed AI  so he thought it would be easy to beat the AI  However  the early game dynamics were not what he expected  After losing the first match  he became more nervous and lost confidence  Afterward  he reacted to attacks by saying that he just wanted to win the match  unintentionally displaying his anger  and acting in an unusual way  Also  he spends    minutes on one move  while AlphaGo only takes a minute and a half to respond  AlphaGo weighs each alternative equally and consistently  No reaction to Lee s fight  Instead  the game continues as if he was not there 
James also said that  suffice to say that humanity does land at least one blow on the machines  through Lee s so called  divine move    More likely  the forces of automation we ll face will be impersonal and incomprehensible  They ll come in the form of star ratings we can t object to  and algorithms we can t fully understand  Dealing with the problems of AI will take a perspective that looks beyond individual battles  AlphaGo is worth seeing because it raises these questions               Vincent       
Murray Shanahan  a professor of cognitive robotics at Imperial College London  critics that  Go is an extraordinary game but it represents what we can do with AI in all kinds of other spheres   says Murray Shanahan  professor of cognitive robotics at Imperial College London and senior research scientist at DeepMind  says   In just the same way there are all kinds of realms of possibility within Go that have not been discovered  we could never have imagined the potential for discovering drugs and other materials

Impacts on Go edit 
The documentary film AlphaGo                        raised hopes that Lee Sedol and Fan Hui would have benefitted from their experience of playing AlphaGo  but as of May          update       their ratings were little changed  Lee Sedol was ranked   th in the world  and Fan Hui    th               On    November       Lee announced his retirement from professional play  arguing that he could never be the top overall player of Go due to the increasing dominance of AI  Lee referred to them as being  an entity that cannot be defeated
