A self driving car  also known as an  autonomous car  AC   driverless car  robotaxi  robotic car or robo car                                   is a car that is capable of operating with reduced or no human input                        Self driving cars are responsible for all driving activities  such as perceiving the environment  monitoring important systems  and controlling the vehicle  which includes navigating from origin to destination            
As of late              update       no system has achieved full autonomy  SAE Level     In December       Waymo was the first to offer rides in self driving taxis to the public in limited geographic areas  SAE Level                    failed verification      and as of April               update      offers services in Arizona  Phoenix  and California  San Francisco and Los Angeles   In June       after a Waymo self driving taxi crashed into a utility pole in Phoenix  Arizona   all     of its Jaguar I Pace vehicles were recalled after they were found to have susceptibility to crashing into pole like items and had their software updated                                    In July       DeepRoute ai started offering self driving taxi rides in Shenzhen  China  Starting in February       Cruise offered self driving taxi service in San Francisco              but suspended service in       In       Honda was the first manufacturer to sell an SAE Level   car                                      followed by Mercedes Benz in

History edit 
Main article  History of self driving cars
Experiments have been conducted on advanced driver assistance systems  ADAS  since at least the     s              The first ADAS system was cruise control  which was invented in      by Ralph Teetor 
Trials began in the     s  The first semi autonomous car was developed in       by Japan s Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory              It required specially marked streets that were interpreted by two cameras on the vehicle and an analog computer  The vehicle reached speeds of         km h          mph  with the support of an elevated rail                         
Carnegie Mellon University s Navlab             and ALV                         semi autonomous projects launched in the     s  funded by the United States  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  DARPA  starting in      and Mercedes Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich s EUREKA Prometheus Project in                   By       ALV had reached         km h          mph   on two lane roads  Obstacle avoidance came in       and day and night off road driving by                   In      Navlab   completed the first autonomous US coast to coast journey  Traveling from Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania and San Diego  California        of the trip was autonomous  It completed the trip at an average speed of           mph             km h                                                   Until the second DARPA Grand Challenge in       automated vehicle research in the United States was primarily funded by DARPA  the US Army  and the US Navy  yielding incremental advances in speeds  driving competence  controls  and sensor systems             
The US allocated US          million in      for research on the National Automated Highway System              which demonstrated automated driving  combining highway embedded automation with vehicle technology  and cooperative networking between the vehicles and highway infrastructure  The programme concluded with a successful demonstration in                   Partly funded by the National Automated Highway System and DARPA  Navlab drove            km             mi  across the US in                  km             mi  or     autonomously              In       Delphi piloted a Delphi technology based Audi  over            km             mi  through    states      autonomously              In       Nevada  Florida  California  Virginia  Michigan  and Washington DC allowed autonomous car testing on public roads             
From      to       the European Commission funded development for connected and automated driving through Coordination Actions CARTRE and SCOUT programs              The Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda  STRIA  Roadmap for Connected and Automated Transport was published in                  
In November       Waymo announced testing of autonomous cars without a safety driver              However  an employee was in the car to handle emergencies             
In March       Elaine Herzberg became the first reported pedestrian killed by a self driving car  an Uber test vehicle with a human backup driver  prosecutors did not charge Uber  while the human driver was sentenced to probation             
In December       Waymo was the first to commercialize a robotaxi service  in Phoenix  Arizona              In October       Waymo launched a robotaxi service in a  geofenced  part of the area                          The cars were monitored in real time  and remote engineers intervened to handle exceptional conditions                         
In March       ahead of Roborace  Robocar set the Guinness World Record as the world s fastest autonomous car  Robocar reached             km h              mph              
In March       Honda began leasing in Japan a limited edition of     Legend Hybrid EX sedans equipped with Level    Traffic Jam Pilot  driving technology  which legally allowed drivers to take their eyes off the road when the car was travelling under    kilometres per hour          mph                                                  
In December       Waymo became the first service provider to offer driverless taxi rides to the general public  in a part of Phoenix  Arizona  Nuro began autonomous commercial delivery operations in California in                   DeepRoute ai launched robotaxi service in Shenzhen in July                   In December       Mercedes Benz received approval for a Level   car              In February       Cruise became the second service provider to offer driverless taxi rides to the general public  in San Francisco              In December       several manufacturers scaled back plans for self driving technology  including Ford and Volkswagen              In       Cruise suspended its robotaxi service              Nuro was approved for Level   in Palo Alto in August                   
As of August               update       vehicles operating at Level   and above were an insignificant market factor      citation needed      as of early       Honda leases a Level   car in Japan  and Mercedes sells two Level   cars in Germany  California and Nevada                         

Definitions edit 
Organizations such as SAE have proposed terminology standards  However  most terms have no standard definition and are employed variously by vendors and others  Proposals to adopt aviation automation terminology for cars have not prevailed             
Names such as AutonoDrive  PilotAssist  Full Self Driving or DrivePilot are used even though the products offer an assortment of features that may not match the names              Despite offering a system dubbed  Full Self Driving   Tesla stated that its system did not autonomously handle all driving tasks              In the United Kingdom  a fully self driving car is defined as a car so registered  rather than one that supports a specific feature set              The Association of British Insurers claimed that the usage of the word autonomous in marketing was dangerous because car ads make motorists think  autonomous  and  autopilot  imply that the driver can rely on the car to control itself  even though they do not 

Automated driving system edit 
SAE identified   levels for driving automation from level   to level                An ADS is an SAE J     level   or higher system 

Advanced driver assistance system edit 
Main article  Advanced driver assistance system
An ADAS is a system that automates specific driving features  such as Forward Collision Warning  FCW   Automatic Emergency Braking  AEB   Lane Departure Warning  LDW   Lane Keeping Assistance  LKA  or Blind Spot Warning  BSW               An ADAS requires a human driver to handle tasks that the ADAS does not support 

Autonomy versus automation edit 
Autonomy implies that an automation system is under the control of the vehicle rather than a driver  Automation is function specific  handling issues such as speed control  but leaves broader decision making to the driver             
Euro NCAP defined autonomous as  the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident              
In Europe  the words automated and autonomous can be used together  For instance  Regulation  EU            supplied             

 automated vehicle  means a vehicle that can move without continuous driver supervision  but that driver intervention is still expected or required in the operational design domains  ODD              
 fully automated vehicle  means a vehicle that can move entirely without driver supervision             
Cooperative system edit 
A remote driver is a driver that operates a vehicle at a distance  using a video and data connection             

According to SAE J      Some driving automation systems may indeed be autonomous if they perform all of their functions independently and self sufficiently  but if they depend on communication and or cooperation with outside entities  they should be considered cooperative rather than autonomous

Operational design domain  ODD  is a term for a particular operating context for an automated system  often used in the field of autonomous vehicles  The context is defined by a set of conditions  including environmental  geographical  time of day  and other conditions  For vehicles  traffic and roadway characteristics are included  Manufacturers use ODD to indicate where how their product operates safely  A given system may operate differently according to the immediate ODD             

The concept presumes that automated systems have limitations              Relating system function to the ODD it supports is important for developers and regulators to establish and communicate safe operating conditions  Systems should operate within those limitations  Some systems recognize the ODD and modify their behavior accordingly  For example  an autonomous car might recognize that traffic is heavy and disable its automated lane change feature              Vendors have taken a variety of approaches to the self driving problem  Tesla s approach is to allow their  full self driving   FSD  system to be used in all ODDs as a Level    hands on  eyes on  ADAS              Waymo picked specific ODDs  city streets in Phoenix and San Francisco  for their Level   robotaxi service              Mercedes Benz offers Level   service in Las Vegas in highway traffic jams at speeds up to    miles per hour          km h               Mobileye s SuperVision system offers hands off eyes on driving on all road types at speeds up to     kilometres per hour          mph               GM s hands free Super Cruise operates on specific roads in specific conditions  stopping or returning control to the driver when ODD changes  In      the company announced plans to expand road coverage from         miles to         miles              Ford s BlueCruise hands off system operates on         miles of US divided highways             
Self driving edit 
The Union of Concerned Scientists defined self driving as  cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take control to safely operate the vehicle  Also known as autonomous or  driverless  cars  they combine sensors and software to control  navigate  and drive the vehicle              
The British Automated and Electric Vehicles Act      law defines a vehicle as  driving itself  if the vehicle is  not being controlled  and does not need to be monitored  by an individual              
Another British government definition stated   Self driving vehicles are vehicles that can safely and lawfully drive themselves              

British definitions edit 
In British English  the word automated alone has several meanings  such as in the sentence   Thatcham also found that the automated lane keeping systems could only meet two out of the twelve principles required to guarantee safety  going on to say they cannot  therefore  be classed as  automated driving   preferring  assisted driving                The first occurrence of the  automated  word refers to an Unece automated system  while the second refers to the British legal definition of an automated vehicle  British law interprets the meaning of  automated vehicle  based on the interpretation section related to a vehicle  driving itself  and an insured vehicle             
In November      the British Government introduced the Automated Vehicles Bill  It proposed definitions for related terms             

Self driving   A vehicle  satisfies the self driving test  if it is designed or adapted with the intention that a feature of the vehicle will allow it to travel autonomously  and it is capable of doing so  by means of that feature  safely and legally  
Autonomy  A vehicle travels  autonomously  if it is controlled by the vehicle  and neither the vehicle nor its surroundings are monitored by a person who can intervene 
Control  control of vehicle motion 
Safe  a vehicle that conforms to an acceptably safe standard 
Legal  a vehicle that offers an acceptably low risk of committing a traffic infraction 
SAE classification edit 
Tesla Autopilot is classified as an SAE Level   system                         
A six level classification system   ranging from fully manual to fully automated   was published in      by SAE International as J      Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems  the details are revised occasionally              This classification is based on the role of the driver  rather than the vehicle s capabilities  although these are related  After SAE updated its classification in        J                          the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  adopted the SAE standard                          The classification is a topic of debate  with various revisions proposed                         

Classifications edit 
A  driving mode   aka driving scenario  combines an ODD with matched driving requirements  e g   expressway merging  traffic jam                          Cars may switch levels in accord with the driving mode 
Above Level    level differences are related to how responsibility for safe movement is divided shared between ADAS and driver rather than specific driving features

SAE Automation Levels have been criticized     by whom       for their technological focus  It has been argued that the structure of the levels suggests that automation increases linearly and that more automation is better  which may not be the case              SAE Levels also do not account for changes that may be required to infrastructure             and road user behavior                         

Mobileye System edit 

Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua and CTO Shai Shalev Shwartz proposed an alternative taxonomy for autonomous driving systems  claiming that a more consumer friendly approach was needed  Its categories reflect the amount of driver engagement that is required                          Some vehicle makers have informally adopted some of the terminology involved  while not formally committing to it                                                 

Eyes on hands on edit 
The first level  hands on eyes on  implies that the driver is fully engaged in operating the vehicle  but is supervised by the system  which intervenes according to the features it supports  e g   adaptive cruise control  automatic emergency braking   The driver is entirely responsible  with hands on the wheel and eyes on the road             

Eyes on hands off edit 
Eyes on hands off allows the driver to let go of the wheel  The system drives  the driver monitors  and remains prepared to resume control as needed             

Eyes off hands off edit 
Eyes off hands off means that the driver can stop monitoring the system  leaving the system in full control   Eyes off requires that no errors be reproducible  not triggered by exotic transitory conditions  or frequent  that speeds are contextually appropriate  e g           mph on limited access roads   and that the system handles typical maneuvers  e g   getting cut off by another vehicle   The automation level could vary according to the road  e g   eyes off on freeways  eyes on on side streets              

No driver edit 
The highest level does not require a human driver in the car  monitoring is done either remotely  telepresence  or not at all             

Safety edit 
A critical requirement for the higher two levels is that the vehicle be able to conduct a Minimum Risk Maneuver and stop safely out of traffic without driver intervention             

Technology edit 
Main article  Vehicular automation
Architecture edit 
The perception system processes visual and audio data from outside and inside the car to create a local model of the vehicle  the road  traffic  traffic controls and other observable objects  and their relative motion  The control system then takes actions to move the vehicle  considering the local model  road map  and driving regulations                                                  


Several classifications have been proposed to describe ADAS technology  One proposal is to adopt these categories  navigation  path planning  perception  and car control              

Navigation edit 
Main article  Hybrid navigation
Navigation involves the use of maps to define a path between origin and destination  Hybrid navigation is the use of multiple navigation systems  Some systems use basic maps  relying on perception to deal with anomalies  Such a map understands which roads lead to which others  whether a road is a freeway  a highway  are one way  etc  Other systems require highly detailed maps  including lane maps  obstacles  traffic controls  etc 

Perception edit 
ACs need to be able to perceive the world around them  Supporting technologies include combinations of cameras  LiDAR  radar  audio  and ultrasound               GPS  and inertial measurement                                         Deep neural networks are used to analyse inputs from these sensors to detect and identify objects and their trajectories               Some systems use Bayesian simultaneous localization and mapping  SLAM  algorithms  Another technique is detection and tracking of other moving objects  DATMO   used to handle potential obstacles                            Other systems use roadside real time locating system  RTLS  technologies to aid localization  Tesla s  vision only  system uses eight cameras  without LIDAR or radar  to create its bird s eye view of the environment              

Path planning edit 
Path planning finds a sequence of segments that a vehicle can use to move from origin to destination  Techniques used for path planning include graph based search and variational based optimization techniques  Graph based techniques can make harder decisions such as how to pass another vehicle obstacle  Variational based optimization techniques require more stringent restrictions on the vehicle s path to prevent collisions               The large scale path of the vehicle can be determined by using a voronoi diagram  an occupancy grid mapping  or a driving corridor algorithm  The latter allows the vehicle to locate and drive within open space that is bounded by lanes or barriers              

Maps edit 
Maps are necessary for navigation  Map sophistication varies from simple graphs that show which roads connect to each other  with details such as one way vs two way  to those that are highly detailed  with information about lanes  traffic controls  roadworks  and more               Researchers at the MITComputer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory  CSAIL  developed a system called MapLite  which allows self driving cars to drive with simple maps  The system combines the GPS position of the vehicle  a  sparse topological map  such as OpenStreetMap  which has only  D road features   with sensors that observe road conditions               One issue with highly detailed maps is updating them as the world changes  Vehicles that can operate with less detailed maps do not require frequent updates or geo fencing 

Sensors edit 
Sensors are necessary for the vehicle to properly respond to the driving environment  Sensor types include cameras  LiDAR  ultrasound  and radar  Control systems typically combine data from multiple sensors                Multiple sensors can provide a more complete view of the surroundings and can be used to cross check each other to correct errors               For example  radar can image a scene in  e g   a nighttime snowstorm  that defeats cameras and LiDAR  albeit at reduced precision  After experimenting with radar and ultrasound  Tesla adopted a vision only approach  asserting that humans drive using only vision  and that cars should be able to do the same  while citing the lower cost of cameras versus other sensor types               By contrast  Waymo makes use of the higher resolution of LiDAR sensors and cites the declining cost of that technology              

Drive by wire edit 
Main article  Drive by wire
Drive by wire is the use of electrical or electro mechanical systems for performing vehicle functions such as steering or speed control that are traditionally achieved by mechanical linkages 

Driver monitoring edit 
Main article  Driver monitoring system
Driver monitoring is used to assess the driver s attention and alertness  Techniques in use include eye monitoring  and requiring the driver to maintain torque on the steering wheel               It attempts to understand driver status and identify dangerous driving behaviors              

Vehicle communication edit 
Main article  Vehicular communication systems
Vehicles can potentially benefit from communicating with others to share information about traffic  road obstacles  to receive map and software updates  etc                                        
ISO TC    specifies in vehicle transport information and control systems               while ISO TC     specifies information  communication and control systems in surface transport               International standards have been developed for ADAS functions  connectivity  human interaction  in vehicle systems  management engineering  dynamic map and positioning  privacy and security              
Rather than communicating among vehicles  they can communicate with road based systems to receive similar information 

Software update edit 
See also  Over the air programming
Software controls the vehicle  and can provide entertainment and other services  Over the air updates can deliver bug fixes and additional features over the internet  Software updates are one way to accomplish recalls that in the past required a visit to a service center  In March       the UNECE regulation on software update and software update management systems was published              

Safety model edit 
A safety model is software that attempts to formalize rules that ensure that ACs operate safely              
IEEE is attempting to forge a standard for safety models as  IEEE P      A Formal Model for Safety Considerations in Automated Vehicle Decision Making                In       a research group at National Institute of Informatics  NII  Japan  enhanced Mobileye s Reliable Safety System as  Goal Aware RSS  to enable RSS rules to deal with complex scenarios via program logic              

Notification edit 
The US has standardized the use of turquoise lights to inform other drivers that a vehicle is driving autonomously  It will be used in the      Mercedes Benz EQS and S Class sedans with Drive Pilot  an SAE Level   driving system      citation needed     
As of       the Turquoise light had not been standardized by the P R C or the UN ECE              

Artificial Intelligence edit 
Artificial intelligence  AI  plays a pivotal role in the development and operation of autonomous vehicles  AVs   enabling them to perceive their surroundings  make decisions  and navigate safely without human intervention  AI algorithms empower AVs to interpret sensory data from various onboard sensors  such as cameras  LiDAR  radar  and GPS  to understand their environment and improve its technological ability and overall safety over time              

Challenges edit 
Autonomous delivery vehicles stuck in one place by attempting to avoid one another
Obstacles edit 
The primary obstacle to ACs is the advanced software and mapping required to make them work safely across the wide variety of conditions that drivers experience               In addition to handling day night driving in good and bad weather              on roads of arbitrary quality  ACs must cope with other vehicles  road obstacles  poor missing traffic controls  flawed maps  and handle endless edge cases  such as following the instructions of a police officer managing traffic at a crash site 
Other obstacles include cost  liability                            consumer reluctance               ethical dilemmas                            security                                                      privacy               and legal regulatory framework               Further  AVs could automate the work of professional drivers  eliminating many jobs  which could slow acceptance              

Concerns edit 
Deceptive marketing edit 
Tesla calls its Level   ADAS  Full Self Driving  FSD  Beta                US Senators Richard Blumenthal and Edward Markey called on the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  to investigate this marketing in                    In December      in Japan  Mercedes Benz was punished by the Consumer Affairs Agency for misleading product descriptions              
Mercedes Benz was criticized for a misleading US commercial advertising E Class models               At that time  Mercedes Benz rejected the claims and stopped its  self driving car  ad campaign that had been running                            In August       the California Department of Motor Vehicles  DMV  accused Tesla of deceptive marketing practices              
With the Automated Vehicles Bill  AVB  self driving car makers could face prison for misleading adverts in the United Kingdom              

Security edit 
In the     s  concerns over ACs  vulnerability to cyberattacks and data theft emerged              

Espionage edit 
In      and       former Apple engineers were charged with stealing information related to Apple s self driving car project                                         In      the United States Department of Justice  DOJ  accused Chinese security officials of coordinating a hacking campaign to steal information from government entities  including research related to autonomous vehicles                            China has prepared  the Provisions on Management of Automotive Data Security  Trial  to protect its own data                            
Cellular Vehicle to Everything technologies are based on  G wireless networks               As of November          update       the US Congress was considering the possibility that imported Chinese AC technology could facilitate espionage              
Testing of Chinese automated cars in the US has raised concern over which US data are collected by Chinese vehicles to be stored in China and any link with the Chinese communist party              

Driver communications edit 
ACs complicate the need for drivers to communicate with each other  e g   to decide which car enters an intersection first  In an AC without a driver  traditional means such as hand signals do not work  no driver  no hands               

Behavior prediction edit 
ACs must be able to predict the behavior of possibly moving vehicles  pedestrians  etc  in real time in order to proceed safely              The task becomes more challenging the further into the future the prediction extends  requiring rapid revisions to the estimate to cope with unpredicted behavior  One approach is to wholly recompute the position and trajectory of each object many times per second  Another is to cache the results of an earlier prediction for use in the next one to reduce computational complexity                           

Handover edit 
The ADAS has to be able to safely accept control from and return control to the driver              

Trust edit 
Consumers will avoid ACs unless they trust them as safe                            Robotaxis operating in San Francisco received pushback over perceived safety risks               Automatic elevators were invented in       but did not become common until operator strikes and trust was built with advertising and features such as an emergency stop button                            However  with repeated use of autonomous driving functions  drivers  behavior and trust in autonomous vehicles gradually improved and both entered a more stable state  At the same time  this also improved the performance and reliability of the vehicle in complex conditions  thereby increasing public trust              

Economics edit 
Autonomy also presents various political and economic implications  The transportation sector holds significant sway in many political and economic landscapes  For instance  many US states generate much annual revenue from transportation fees and taxes               The advent of self driving cars could profoundly affect the economy by potentially altering state tax revenue streams  Furthermore  the transition to autonomous vehicles might disrupt employment patterns and labor markets  particularly in industries heavily reliant on driving professions               Data from the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that in       the sector employed over two million individuals as tractor trailer truck drivers               Additionally  taxi and delivery drivers represented approximately         positions  and bus drivers constituted a workforce of over                                                 Collectively  this amounts to a conceivable displacement of nearly     million jobs  surpassing the job losses experienced in the      Great Recession              

Equity and inclusion edit 
The prominence of certain demographic groups within the tech industry inevitably shapes the trajectory of autonomous vehicle  AV  development  potentially perpetuating existing inequalities              

Ethical issues edit 
See also  Machine ethics
Pedestrian detection edit 
Research from Georgia Tech revealed that autonomous vehicle detection systems were generally five percent less effective at recognizing darker skinned individuals  This accuracy gap persisted despite adjustments for environmental variables like lighting and visual obstructions              

Rationale for liability edit 
Standards for liability have yet to be adopted to address crashes and other incidents  Liability could rest with the vehicle occupant  its owner  the vehicle manufacturer  or even the ADAS technology supplier  possibly depending on the circumstances of the crash               Additionally  the infusion of ArtificiaI Intelligence technology in autonomous vehicles adds layers of complexity to ownership and ethical dynamics  Given that AI systems are inherently self learning  a question arises of whether accountability should rest with the vehicle owner  the manufacturer  or the AI developer              

Trolley problem edit 
The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics  Adapted for ACs  it considers an AC carrying one passenger confronting a pedestrian who steps in its way  The ADAS notionally has to choose between killing the pedestrian or swerving into a wall  killing the passenger               Possible frameworks include deontology  formal rules  and utilitarianism  harm reduction                                        
One public opinion survey reported that harm reduction was preferred  except that passengers wanted the vehicle to prefer them  while pedestrians took the opposite view  Utilitarian regulations were unpopular               Additionally  cultural viewpoints exert substantial influence on shaping responses to these ethical quandaries  Another study found that cultural biases impact preferences in prioritizing the rescue of certain individuals over others in car accident scenarios              

Privacy edit 
Some ACs require an internet connection to function  opening the possibility that a hacker might gain access to private information such as destinations  routes  camera recordings  media preferences  and or behavioral patterns  although this is true of an internet connected device                                        

Road infrastructure edit 
ACs make use of road infrastructure  e g   traffic signs  turn lanes  and may require modifications to that infrastructure to fully achieve their safety and other goals               In March       the Japanese government unveiled a plan to set up a dedicated highway lane for ACs               In April       JR East announced their challenge to raise their self driving level of Kesennuma Line bus rapid transit  BRT  in rural area from the current Level   to Level   at         km h              

Testing edit 
Approaches edit 
ACs can be tested via digital simulations                            in a controlled test environment               and or on public roads  Road testing typically requires some form of permit              or a commitment to adhere to acceptable operating principles               For example  New York requires a test driver to be in the vehicle  prepared to override the ADAS as necessary              

    s and disengagements edit 
A prototype of Waymo s self driving car  navigating public streets in Mountain View  California in     
In California  self driving car manufacturers are required to submit annual reports describing how often their vehicles autonomously disengaged from autonomous mode               This is one measure of system robustness  ideally  the system should never disengage               
In       Waymo reported    disengagements over              mi               km  of testing  an average distance of            mi             km  between disengagements  the highest  best  among companies reporting such figures  Waymo also logged more autonomous miles than other companies  Their      rate of      disengagements per            mi             km  was an improvement over the     disengagements per            mi             km  in       and     in       In March       Uber reported an average of           mi            km  per disengagement  In the final three months of       Cruise  owned by GM  averaged            mi             km  per disengagement over             mi               km

    s edit 
Disengagement definitions edit 
Reporting companies use varying definitions of what qualifies as a disengagement  and such definitions can change over time                            Executives of self driving car companies have criticized disengagements as a deceptive metric  because it does not consider varying road conditions              

Standards edit 
In April       WP    GRVA proposed a  Test Method for Automated Driving  NATM                
In October       Europe s pilot test  L Pilot  demonstrated ADAS for cars in Hamburg  Germany  in conjunction with ITS World Congress       SAE Level   and   functions were tested on ordinary roads                                        
In November       an International Standard ISO       on  Scenario based safety evaluation framework  was published                           

Collision avoidance edit 
In April       collision avoidance testing was demonstrated by Nissan                            Waymo published a document about collision avoidance testing in December                   

Simulation and validation edit 
In September       Biprogy released Driving Intelligence Validation Platform  DIVP  as part of Japanese national project  SIP adus   which is interoperable with Open Simulation Interface  OSI  of ASAM                                        

Toyota edit 
In November       Toyota demonstrated one of its GR Yaris test cars  which had been trained using professional rally drivers               Toyota used its collaboration with Microsoft in FIA World Rally Championship since the      season              

Pedestrian reactions edit 
In      David R  Large  senior research fellow with the Human Factors Research Group at the University of Nottingham  disguised himself as a car seat in a study to test people s reactions to driverless cars  He said   We wanted to explore how pedestrians would interact with a driverless car and developed this unique methodology to explore their reactions   The study found that  in the absence of someone in the driving seat  pedestrians trust certain visual prompts more than others when deciding whether to cross the road              

Incidents edit 
Tesla edit 
See also  List of Tesla Autopilot crashes
As of       Tesla s ADAS Autopilot Full Self Driving  beta  was classified as Level   ADAS              
On    January       the first of five known fatal crashes of a Tesla with Autopilot occurred  in China s Hubei province               Initially  Tesla stated that the vehicle was so badly damaged from the impact that their recorder was not able to determine whether the car had been on Autopilot at the time  However  the car failed to take evasive action 
Another fatal Autopilot crash occurred in May in Florida in a Tesla Model S                           that crashed into a tractor trailer  In a civil suit between the father of the driver killed and Tesla  Tesla documented that the car had been on Autopilot               According to Tesla   neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky  so the brake was not applied   Tesla claimed that this was Tesla s first known Autopilot death in over          million miles           million kilometers  with Autopilot engaged  Tesla claimed that on average one fatality occurs every         million miles           million kilometers  across all vehicle types in the US                                         However  this number also includes motorcycle pedestrian fatalities                            The ultimate National Transportation Safety Board  NTSB  report concluded Tesla was not at fault  the investigation revealed that for Tesla cars  the crash rate dropped by    percent after Autopilot was installed              
In February       a Tesla Cybertruck crashed while in Full Self Driving mode  raising concerns about autonomous driving and prompting an investigation from Tesla who said the crash would be probed   in line with standard protocol when any of our electric vehicles are involved in an accident while in FSD mode

In June       Google confirmed that    vehicles had suffered collisions as of that date  Eight involved rear end collisions at a stop sign or traffic light  in two of which the vehicle was side swiped by another driver  one in which another driver rolled a stop sign  and one where a driver was controlling the car manually               In July       three employees suffered minor injuries when their vehicle was rear ended by a car whose driver failed to brake  This was the first collision that resulted in injuries              
According to Google Waymo s accident reports as of early       their test cars had been involved in    collisions  of which other drivers were at fault    times  although in      the car s software caused a crash               On    February      a Google vehicle attempted to avoid sandbags blocking its path  During the maneuver it struck a bus  Google stated   In this case  we clearly bear some responsibility  because if our car hadn t moved  there wouldn t have been a collision                             Google characterized the crash as a misunderstanding and a learning experience  No injuries were reported              

Uber s Advanced Technologies Group  ATG  edit 
In March       Elaine Herzberg died after she was hit by an AC tested by Uber s Advanced Technologies Group  ATG  in Arizona  A safety driver was in the car  Herzberg was crossing the road about     feet from an intersection               Some experts said a human driver could have avoided the crash               Arizona governor Doug Ducey suspended the company s ability to test its ACs citing an  unquestionable failure  of Uber to protect public safety               Uber also stopped testing in California until receiving a new permit in                                
NTSB s final report determined that the immediate cause of the accident was that safety driver Rafaela Vasquez failed to monitor the road  because she was distracted by her phone  but that Uber s  inadequate safety culture  contributed  The report noted that the victim had  a very high level  of methamphetamine in her body               The board called on federal regulators to carry out a review before allowing automated test vehicles to operate on public roads                           
In September       Vasquez pled guilty to endangerment and was sentenced to three years  probation                          

NIO Navigate on Pilot edit

Pony ai edit 
The permit was issued and they actually have fifty permits now               In May       DMV revoked Pony ai s permit for failing to monitor the driving records of its safety drivers              

Cruise edit

Ford edit 
In February       a driver using the Ford BlueCruise hands free driving feature struck and killed the driver of a stationary car with no lights on in the middle lane of a freeway in Texas              
In March       a drunk driver who was speeding  holding her cell phone  and using BlueCruise on a Pennsylvania freeway struck and killed two people who had been driving two cars               The first car had become disabled and was on the left shoulder with part of the car in the left driving lane               The second driver had parked his car behind the first car presumably to help the first driver              
The NTSB is investigating both incidents              

Total incidents edit 
The NHTSA began mandating incident reports from autonomous vehicle companies in June       Some reports cite incidents from as early as August       with current data available through June                       
There have been a total of       autonomous vehicle incidents  both ADS and ADAS  reported during this timeframe        of those incidents         involved Tesla vehicles              

Public opinion surveys edit 
    s edit 
In a      online survey of       US and UK consumers      said they would be comfortable using a  driverless car               
A      survey of        vehicle owners found     who initially said they would be interested in purchasing a  fully autonomous car   However  that figure dropped to     if told the technology would cost US       more              
In a      survey of about       German drivers      had a positive attitude      were undecided      were skeptical and     were hostile              
A      survey of       consumers across    countries found      stated they would be likely to ride in a car controlled entirely by technology that does not require a human driver   with Brazil  India and China the most willing to trust automated technology              
In a      US telephone survey  over three quarters of licensed drivers said they would consider buying a self driving car  rising to     if car insurance were cheaper        said they would not continue to drive once an automated car was available              
In       a survey of       people from     countries reported that average respondents found manual driving the most enjoyable      did not want to pay more money for autonomy  Respondents were found to be most concerned about hacking misuse  and were also concerned about legal issues and safety  Finally  respondents from more developed countries were less comfortable with their vehicle sharing data               The survey reported consumer interest in purchasing an AC  stating that     of surveyed current owners were either  definitely  or  probably  interested              
In       a survey of       people in Germany that controlled for age  gender  and education reported that men felt less anxiety and more enthusiasm  whereas women showed the opposite  The difference was pronounced between young men and women and decreased with age              
In a      US  survey of       people      percent of respondents said they think autonomous cars are probably smarter than the average human driver   People were worried about safety and hacking risk  Nevertheless  only     of the interviewees saw no advantages in this new kind of cars              
In a      survey of       US adults found that many Americans anticipated significant impacts from various automation technologies including the widespread adoption of automated vehicles              
In       results from two opinion surveys of    and     US adults respectively were published  The questionnaire was termed the autonomous vehicle acceptance model  AVAM   including additional description to help respondents better understand the implications of various automation levels  Users were less accepting of high autonomy levels and displayed significantly lower intention to use autonomous vehicles  Additionally  partial autonomy  regardless of level  was perceived as requiring uniformly higher driver engagement  usage of hands  feet and eyes  than full autonomy              

In the     s edit 
In       a survey reported that only a quarter       of the world s population would feel safe in self driving cars              
In       a study by Saravanos et al               at New York University reported that     of their respondents  from a sample of      believed that conditionally automated cars  at Level    would be easy to use
