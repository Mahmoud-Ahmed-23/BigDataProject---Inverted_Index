Artificial intelligence in healthcare is the application of artificial intelligence  AI  to analyze and understand complex medical and healthcare data  In some cases  it can exceed or augment human capabilities by providing better or faster ways to diagnose  treat  or prevent disease                                  
As the widespread use of AI in healthcare is still relatively new  research is ongoing into its applications across various medical subdisciplines and related industries  AI programs are being applied to practices such as diagnostics             treatment protocol development             drug development             personalized medicine             and patient monitoring and care             Since radiographs are the most commonly performed imaging tests in radiology  the potential for AI to assist with triage and interpretation of radiographs is particularly significant            
Using AI also presents unprecedented ethical concerns related to issues such as data privacy  automation of jobs  and amplifying already existing biases              Furthermore  new technologies such as AI are often resisted by healthcare leaders  leading to slow and erratic adoption              In contrast  there are also several cases where AI has been put to use in healthcare without proper testing                                                  A systematic review and thematic analysis in      showed that most stakeholders including health professionals  patients  and the general public doubted that care involving AI could be empathetic              Moreover  meta studies have found that the scientific literature on AI in healthcare often suffers from a lack of reproducibility                                                 


Applications in healthcare systems edit 
Disease diagnosis edit 
Accurate and early diagnosis of diseases is still a challenge in healthcare  Recognizing medical conditions and their symptoms is a complex problem  AI can assist clinicians with its data processing capabilities to save time and improve accuracy              Through the use of machine learning  artificial intelligence can be able to substantially aid doctors in patient diagnosis through the analysis of mass electronic health records  EHRs               AI can help early prediction  for example  of Alzheimer s disease and dementias  by looking through large numbers of similar cases and possible treatments             
Doctors  decision making could also be supported by AI in urgent situations  for example in the emergency department  Here AI algorithms can help prioritize more serious cases and reduce waiting time  Decision support systems augmented with AI can offer real time suggestions and faster data interpretation to aid the decisions made by healthcare professionals             
In      a study reported higher satisfaction rates with ChatGPT generated responses compared with those from physicians for medical questions posted on Reddit s r AskDocs              Evaluators preferred ChatGPT s responses to physician responses in       of     evaluations  noting better quality and empathy  The authors noted that these were isolated questions taken from an online forum  not in the context of an established patient physician relationship              Moreover  responses were not graded on the accuracy of medical information  and some have argued that the experiment was not properly blinded  with the evaluators being coauthors of the study                                     
Recent developments in statistical physics  machine learning  and inference algorithms are also being explored for their potential in improving medical diagnostic approaches              Also  the establishment of large healthcare related data warehouses of sometimes hundreds of millions of patients provides extensive training data for AI models             

Electronic health records edit 
Electronic health records  EHR  are crucial to the digitalization and information spread of the healthcare industry  Now that around     of medical practices use EHR  some anticipate the use of artificial intelligence to interpret the records and provide new information to physicians             
One application uses natural language processing  NLP  to make more succinct reports that limit the variation between medical terms by matching similar medical terms              For example  the term heart attack and myocardial infarction mean the same things  but physicians may use one over the other based on personal preferences              NLP algorithms consolidate these differences so that larger datasets can be analyzed              Another use of NLP identifies phrases that are redundant due to repetition in a physician s notes and keeps the relevant information to make it easier to read              Other applications use concept processing to analyze the information entered by the current patient s doctor to present similar cases and help the physician remember to include all relevant details             
Beyond making content edits to an EHR  there are AI algorithms that evaluate an individual patient s record and predict a risk for a disease based on their previous information and family history              One general algorithm is a rule based system that makes decisions similarly to how humans use flow charts              This system takes in large amounts of data and creates a set of rules that connect specific observations to concluded diagnoses              Thus  the algorithm can take in a new patient s data and try to predict the likeliness that they will have a certain condition or disease              Since the algorithms can evaluate a patient s information based on collective data  they can find any outstanding issues to bring to a physician s attention and save time              One study conducted by the Centerstone research institute found that predictive modeling of EHR data has achieved        accuracy in predicting individualized treatment response              These methods are helpful due to the fact that the amount of online health records doubles every five years              Physicians do not have the bandwidth to process all this data manually  and AI can leverage this data to assist physicians in treating their patients             

Drug interactions edit 
Improvements in natural language processing led to the development of algorithms to identify drug drug interactions in medical literature                                                  Drug drug interactions pose a threat to those taking multiple medications simultaneously  and the danger increases with the number of medications being taken              To address the difficulty of tracking all known or suspected drug drug interactions  machine learning algorithms have been created to extract information on interacting drugs and their possible effects from medical literature  Efforts were consolidated in      in the DDIExtraction Challenge  in which a team of researchers at Carlos III University assembled a corpus of literature on drug drug interactions to form a standardized test for such algorithms              Competitors were tested on their ability to accurately determine  from the text  which drugs were shown to interact and what the characteristics of their interactions were               Researchers continue to use this corpus to standardize the measurement of the effectiveness of their algorithms                                     
Other algorithms identify drug drug interactions from patterns in user generated content  especially electronic health records and or adverse event reports                          Organizations such as the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System  FAERS  and the World Health Organization s VigiBase allow doctors to submit reports of possible negative reactions to medications  Deep learning algorithms have been developed to parse these reports and detect patterns that imply drug drug interactions             

Telemedicine edit

The increase of telemedicine  the treatment of patients remotely  has shown the rise of possible AI applications              AI can assist in caring for patients remotely by monitoring their information through sensors              A wearable device may allow for constant monitoring of a patient and the ability to notice changes that may be less distinguishable by humans  The information can be compared to other data that has already been collected using artificial intelligence algorithms that alert physicians if there are any issues to be aware of             
Another application of artificial intelligence is chat bot therapy  Some researchers charge that the reliance on chatbots for mental healthcare does not offer the reciprocity and accountability of care that should exist in the relationship between the consumer of mental healthcare and the care provider  be it a chat bot or psychologist   though             Some examples of these chatbots include Woebot  Earkick and Wysa                                      
Since the average age has risen due to a longer life expectancy  artificial intelligence could be useful in helping take care of older populations              Tools such as environment and personal sensors can identify a person s regular activities and alert a caretaker if a behavior or a measured vital is abnormal              Although the technology is useful  there are also discussions about limitations of monitoring in order to respect a person s privacy since there are technologies that are designed to map out home layouts and detect human interactions             

Workload management edit 
AI has the potential to streamline care coordination and reduce the workload  AI algorithms can automate administrative tasks  prioritize patient needs and facilitate seamless communication in a healthcare team              This enables healthcare providers to focus more on direct patient care and ensures the efficient and coordinated delivery of healthcare services 

Clinical applications edit 
Cardiovascular edit 
Artificial intelligence algorithms have shown promising results in accurately diagnosing and risk stratifying patients with concern for coronary artery disease  showing potential as an initial triage tool                          Other algorithms have been used in predicting patient mortality  medication effects  and adverse events following treatment for acute coronary syndrome              Wearables  smartphones  and internet based technologies have also shown the ability to monitor patients  cardiac data points  expanding the amount of data and the various settings AI models can use and potentially enabling earlier detection of cardiac events occurring outside of the hospital              A research in      found that AI can be used to predict heart attack with up to     accuracy              Another growing area of research is the utility of AI in classifying heart sounds and diagnosing valvular disease              Challenges of AI in cardiovascular medicine have included the limited data available to train machine learning models  such as limited data on social determinants of health as they pertain to cardiovascular disease             
A key limitation in early studies evaluating AI were omissions of data comparing algorithmic performance to humans  Examples of studies which assess AI performance relative to physicians includes how AI is non inferior to humans in interpretation of cardiac echocardiograms             and that AI can diagnose heart attack better than human physicians in the emergency setting  reducing both low value testing and missed diagnoses             
In cardiovascular tissue engineering and organoid studies  AI is increasingly used to analyze microscopy images  and integrate electrophysiological read outs             

Dermatology edit 
Medical imaging  such as X ray and photography  is a commonly used tool in dermatology             and the development of deep learning has been strongly tied to image      processing  Therefore  there is a natural fit between the dermatology and deep learning  Machine learning learning holds great potential to process these images for better diagnoses              Han et al  showed keratinocytic skin cancer detection from face photographs              Esteva et al  demonstrated dermatologist level classification of skin cancer from lesion images              Noyan et al  demonstrated a convolutional neural network that achieved     accuracy at identifying skin cells from microscopic Tzanck smear images              A concern raised with this work is that it has not engaged with disparities related to skin color or differential treatment of patients with non white skin tones             
According to some researchers  AI algorithms have been shown to be more effective than dermatologists at identifying cancer              However  a      review article found that a majority of papers analyzing the performance of AI algorithms designed for skin cancer classification failed to use external test sets              Only four research studies were found in which the AI algorithms were tested on clinics  regions  or populations distinct from those it was trained on  and in each of those four studies  the performance of dermatologists was found to be on par with that of the algorithm  Moreover  only one study             was set in the context of a full clinical examination  others were based on interaction through web apps or online questionnaires  with most based entirely on context free images of lesions  In this study  it was found that dermatologists significantly outperformed the algorithms  Many articles claiming superior performance of AI algorithms also fail to distinguish between trainees and board certified dermatologists in their analyses             
It has also been suggested that AI could be used to automatically evaluate the outcome of maxillo facial surgery or cleft palate therapy in regard to facial attractiveness or age appearance                         

Gastroenterology edit 
AI can play a role in various facets of the field of gastroenterology  Endoscopic exams such as esophagogastroduodenoscopies  EGD  and colonoscopies rely on rapid detection of abnormal tissue  By enhancing these endoscopic procedures with AI  clinicians can more rapidly identify diseases  determine their severity  and visualize blind spots  Early trials in using AI detection systems of early stomach cancer have shown sensitivity close to expert endoscopists             
AI can assist doctors treating ulcerative colitis in detecting the microscopic activity of the disease in people and predicting when flare ups will happen  For example  an AI powered tool  was developed to analyse digitised bowel samples  biopsies   The tool was able to distinguish with     accuracy between samples that show remission of colitis and those with active disease  It also predicted the risk of a flare up happening with the same accuracy  These rates of successfully using microscopic disease activity to predict disease flare are similar to the accuracy of pathologists                         

Obstetrics and gynaecology edit 
Artificial intelligence utilises massive amounts of data to help with predicting illness  prevention  and diagnosis  as well as patient monitoring  In obstetrics  artificial intelligence is utilized in magnetic resonance imaging  ultrasound  and foetal cardiotocography  AI contributes in the resolution of a variety of obstetrical diagnostic issues             

Infectious diseases edit 
AI has shown potential in both the laboratory and clinical spheres of infectious disease medicine              During the COVID    pandemic  AI has been used for early detection  tracking virus spread and analysing virus behaviour  among other things              However  there were only a few examples of AI being used directly in clinical practice during the pandemic itself             
Other applications  of AI around infectious diseases include support vector machines identifying antimicrobial resistance  machine learning analysis of blood smears to detect malaria  and improved point of care testing of Lyme disease based on antigen detection  Additionally  AI has been investigated for improving diagnosis of meningitis  sepsis  and tuberculosis  as well as predicting treatment complications in hepatitis B and hepatitis C patients             

Musculoskeletal edit 
AI has been used to identify causes of knee pain that doctors miss  that disproportionately affect Black patients              Underserved populations experience higher levels of pain  These disparities persist even after controlling for the objective severity of diseases like osteoarthritis  as graded by human physicians using medical images  raising the possibility that underserved patients  pain stems from factors external to the knee  such as stress  Researchers have conducted a study using a machine learning algorithm to show that standard radiographic measures of severity overlook objective but undiagnosed features that disproportionately affect diagnosis and management of underserved populations with knee pain  They proposed that new algorithmic measure ALG P could potentially enable expanded access to treatments for underserved patients             

Neurology edit 
The use of AI technologies has been explored for use in the diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer s disease  AD   For diagnostic purposes  machine learning models have been developed that rely on structural MRI inputs              The input datasets for these models are drawn from databases such as the Alzheimer s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative              Researchers have developed models that rely on convolutional neural networks with the aim of improving early diagnostic accuracy              Generative adversarial networks are a form of deep learning that have also performed well in diagnosing AD              There have also been efforts to develop machine learning models into forecasting tools that can predict the prognosis of patients with AD  Forecasting patient outcomes through generative models has been proposed by researchers as a means of synthesizing training and validation sets              They suggest that generated patient forecasts could be used to provide future models larger training datasets than current open access databases 

Oncology edit 
AI has been explored for use in cancer diagnosis  risk stratification  molecular characterization of tumors  and cancer drug discovery  A particular challenge in oncologic care that AI is being developed to address is the ability to accurately predict which treatment protocols will be best suited for each patient based on their individual genetic  molecular  and tumor based characteristics              AI has been trialed in cancer diagnostics with the reading of imaging studies and pathology slides             
In January       Google DeepMind announced an algorithm capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer detection in screening scans                          A number of researchers  including Trevor Hastie  Joelle Pineau  and Robert Tibshirani among others  published a reply claiming that DeepMind s research publication in Nature lacked key details on methodology and code   effectively undermin ing  its scientific value  and making it impossible for the scientific community to confirm the work              In the MIT Technology Review  author Benjamin Haibe Kains characterized DeepMind s work as  an advertisement  having little to do with science             
In July       it was reported that an AI algorithm developed by the University of Pittsburgh achieves the highest accuracy to date in identifying prostate cancer  with     sensitivity and     specificity                          In      a study reported the use of AI for CT based radiomics classification at grading the aggressiveness of retroperitoneal sarcoma with     accuracy compared with     for lab analysis of biopsies                         

Ophthalmology edit 
Artificial intelligence enhanced technology is being used as an aid in the screening of eye disease and prevention of blindness                   In       the U S  Food and Drug Administration authorized the marketing of the first medical device to diagnose a specific type of eye disease  diabetic retinopathy using an artificial intelligence algorithm              Moreover  AI technology may be used to further improve  diagnosis rates  because of the potential to decrease detection time             

Pathology edit 
Further information  Digital pathology
Ki   stain calculation by the open source software QuPath in a pure seminoma  which gives a measure of the proliferation rate of the tumor  The colors represent the intensity of expression  blue no expression  yellow low  orange moderate  and red high expression             
For many diseases  pathological analysis of cells and tissues is considered to be the gold standard of disease diagnosis  Methods of digital pathology allows microscopy slides to be scanned and digitally analyzed  AI assisted pathology tools have been developed to assist with the diagnosis of a number of diseases  including breast cancer  hepatitis B  gastric cancer  and colorectal cancer  AI has also been used to predict genetic mutations and prognosticate disease outcomes              AI is well suited for use in low complexity pathological analysis of large scale screening samples  such as colorectal or breast cancer screening  thus lessening the burden on pathologists and allowing for faster turnaround of sample analysis              Several deep learning and artificial neural network models have shown accuracy similar to that of human pathologists              and a study of deep learning assistance in diagnosing metastatic breast cancer in lymph nodes showed that the accuracy of humans with the assistance of a deep learning program was higher than either the humans alone or the AI program alone               Additionally  implementation of digital pathology is predicted to save over     million for a university center over the course of five years               though savings attributed to AI specifically have not yet been widely researched  The use of augmented and virtual reality could prove to be a stepping stone to wider implementation of AI assisted pathology  as they can highlight areas of concern on a pathology sample and present them in real time to a pathologist for more efficient review              AI also has the potential to identify histological findings at levels beyond what the human eye can see              and has shown the ability to use genotypic and phenotypic data to more accurately detect the tumor of origin for metastatic cancer               One of the major current barriers to widespread implementation of AI assisted pathology tools is the lack of prospective  randomized  multi center controlled trials in determining the true clinical utility of AI for pathologists and patients  highlighting a current area of need in AI and healthcare research             

Primary care edit 
Primary care has become one key development area for AI technologies                            AI in primary care has been used for supporting decision making  predictive modeling  and business analytics               There are only a few examples of AI decision support systems that were prospectively assessed on clinical efficacy when used in practice by physicians  But there are cases where the use of these systems yielded a positive effect on treatment choice by physicians              

Psychiatry edit 
In psychiatry  AI applications are still in a phase of proof of concept               Areas where the evidence is widening quickly include predictive modelling of diagnosis and treatment outcomes               chatbots  conversational agents that imitate human behaviour and which have been studied for anxiety and depression              
Challenges include the fact that many applications in the field are developed and proposed by private corporations  such as the screening for suicidal ideation implemented by Facebook in                    Such applications outside the healthcare system raise various professional  ethical and regulatory questions               Another issue is often with the validity and interpretability of the models  Small training datasets contain bias that is inherited by the models  and compromises the generalizability and stability of these models  Such models may also have the potential to be discriminatory against minority groups that are underrepresented in samples              
In       US based National Eating Disorders Association replaced its human helpline staff with a chatbot but had to take it offline after users reported receiving harmful advice from it                                        

Radiology edit 
AI is being studied within the field of radiology to detect and diagnose diseases through computerized tomography  CT  and magnetic resonance  MR  imaging               It may be particularly useful in settings where demand for human expertise exceeds supply  or where data is too complex to be efficiently interpreted by human readers               Several deep learning models have shown the capability to be roughly as accurate as healthcare professionals in identifying diseases through medical imaging  though few of the studies reporting these findings have been externally validated               AI can also provide non interpretive benefit to radiologists  such as reducing noise in images  creating high quality images from lower doses of radiation  enhancing MR image quality               and automatically assessing image quality               Further research investigating the use of AI in nuclear medicine focuses on image reconstruction  anatomical landmarking  and the enablement of lower doses in imaging studies               The analysis of images for supervised AI applications in radiology encompasses two primary techniques at present      convolutional neural network based analysis  and     utilization of radiomics              
AI is also used in breast imaging for analyzing screening mammograms and can participate in improving breast cancer detection rate              as well as reducing radiologist s reading workload

Industry edit 
The trend of large health companies merging allows for greater health data accessibility  Greater health data lays the groundwork for the implementation of AI algorithms 
A large part of industry focus of implementation of AI in the healthcare sector is in the clinical decision support systems  As more data is collected  machine learning algorithms adapt and allow for more robust responses and solutions               Numerous companies are exploring the possibilities of the incorporation of big data in the healthcare industry  Many companies investigate the market opportunities through the realms of  data assessment  storage  management  and analysis technologies  which are all crucial parts of the healthcare industry              
The following are examples of large companies that have contributed to AI algorithms for use in healthcare 

IBM s Watson Oncology is in development at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Cleveland Clinic  IBM is also working with CVS Health on AI applications in chronic disease treatment and with Johnson  amp  Johnson on analysis of scientific papers to find new connections for drug development  In May       IBM and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute began a joint project entitled Health Empowerment by Analytics  Learning and Semantics  HEALS   to explore using AI technology to enhance healthcare 
Microsoft s Hanover project  in partnership with Oregon Health  amp  Science University s Knight Cancer Institute  analyzes medical research to predict the most effective cancer drug treatment options for patients  Other projects include medical image analysis of tumor progression and the development of programmable cells              
Google s DeepMind platform is being used by the UK National Health Service to detect certain health risks through data collected via a mobile app  A second project with the NHS involves the analysis of medical images collected from NHS patients to develop computer vision algorithms to detect cancerous tissues

Intel s venture capital arm Intel Capital invested in      in the startup Lumiata  which uses AI to identify at risk patients and develop care options              
Elon Musk premiering the surgical robot that implants the Neuralink brain chip
Neuralink has come up with a next generation neuroprosthetic which intricately interfaces with thousands of neural pathways in the brain               Their process allows a chip  roughly the size of a quarter  to be inserted in the place of a chunk of a skull by a precision surgical robot to avoid accidental injury               
Digital consultant apps use AI to give medical consultation based on personal medical history and common medical knowledge  Users report their symptoms into the app  which uses speech recognition to compare against a database of illnesses  Babylon then offers a recommended action  taking into account the user s medical history  Entrepreneurs in healthcare have been effectively using seven business model archetypes to take AI solution buzzword  to the marketplace  These archetypes depend on the value generated for the target user  e g  patient focus vs  healthcare provider and payer focus  and value capturing mechanisms  e g  providing information or connecting stakeholders  
IFlytek launched a service robot  Xiao Man   which integrated artificial intelligence technology to identify the registered customer and provide personalized recommendations in medical areas  It also works in the field of medical imaging  Similar robots are also being made by companies such as UBTECH   Cruzr   and Softbank Robotics   Pepper

With the market for AI expanding constantly  large tech companies such as Apple  Google  Amazon  and Baidu all have their own AI research divisions  as well as millions of dollars allocated for acquisition of smaller AI based companies               Many automobile manufacturers are beginning to use machine learning healthcare in their cars as well               Companies such as BMW  GE  Tesla  Toyota  and Volvo all have new research campaigns to find ways of learning a driver s vital statistics to ensure they are awake  paying attention to the road  and not under the influence of substances              

Expanding care to developing nations edit 
Artificial intelligence continues to expand in its abilities to diagnose more people accurately in nations where fewer doctors are accessible to the public        Many new technology companies such as SpaceX and the Raspberry Pi Foundation have enabled more developing countries to have access to computers and the internet than ever before               With the increasing capabilities of AI over the internet  advanced machine learning algorithms can allow patients to get accurately diagnosed when they would previously have no way of knowing if they had a life threatening disease or not              
Using AI in developing nations that do not have the resources will diminish the need for outsourcing and can improve patient care  AI can allow for not only diagnosis of patient in areas where healthcare is scarce  but also allow for a good patient experience by resourcing files to find the best treatment for a patient               The ability of AI to adjust course as it goes also allows the patient to have their treatment modified based on what works for them  a level of individualized care that is nearly non existent in developing countries              

Regulation edit 
While research on the use of AI in healthcare aims to validate its efficacy in improving patient outcomes before its broader adoption  its use may nonetheless introduce several new types of risk to patients and healthcare providers  such as algorithmic bias  Do not resuscitate implications  and other machine morality issues  AI may also compromise the protection of patients  rights  such as the right to informed consent and the right to medical data protection               These challenges of the clinical use of AI have brought about a potential need for regulations  AI studies need to be completely and transparently reported to have value to inform regulatory approval  Depending on the phase of study  international consensus based reporting guidelines  TRIPOD AI               DECIDE AI               CONSORT AI               have been developed to provide recommendations on the key details that need to be reported 

A man speaking at the GDPR compliance workshop at the      Entrepreneurship Summit
Currently  there are regulations pertaining to the collection of patient data  This includes policies such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  HIPAA  and the European General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR                The GDPR pertains to patients within the EU and details the consent requirements for patient data use when entities collect patient healthcare data  Similarly  HIPAA protects healthcare data from patient records in the United States               In May       the White House announced its plan to host a series of workshops and formation of the National Science and Technology Council  NSTC  Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence  In October       the group published The National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan  outlining its proposed priorities for Federally funded AI research and development  within government and academia   The report notes a strategic R amp D plan for the subfield of health information technology is in development stages 
There is concern that large language models can overwhelm people with both accurate health information and also misinformation  leading to potential challenges in public health  This calls for the need for policy and user guidance related to health information through AI              

United Nations  WHO ITU  edit 
The joint ITU WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health  FG AI H  has built a platform   known as the ITU WHO AI for Health Framework   for the testing and benchmarking of AI applications in health domain  As of November       eight use cases are being benchmarked  including assessing breast cancer risk from histopathological imagery  guiding anti venom selection from snake images  and diagnosing skin lesions 

US FDA edit 
United States Food  amp  Drug Administration             
In January       the US FDA published a new Action Plan  entitled Artificial Intelligence  AI   Machine Learning  ML  Based Software as a Medical Device  SaMD  Action Plan               This plan lays out the FDA s future plans for regulation of medical devices that would include artificial intelligence in their software  There are five main actions the FDA plans to take to increase regulation     Tailored Regulatory Framework for Ai M  based SaMD     Good Machine Learning Practice  GMLP      Patient Centered Approach Incorporating Transparency to Users     Regulatory Science Methods Related to Algorithm Bias  amp  Robustness  and    Real World Performance RWP   This plan was in direct response to stakeholders  feedback on a      discussion paper also published by the FDA 
According to the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  the Office for Civil Rights  OCR  has issued guidance on the ethical use of AI in healthcare  The guidance outlines four core ethical principles that must be followed  respect for autonomy  beneficence  non maleficence  and justice  Respect for autonomy requires that individuals have control over their own data and decisions  Beneficence requires that AI be used to do good  such as improving the quality of care and reducing health disparities  Non maleficence requires that AI be used to do no harm  such as avoiding discrimination in decisions  Finally  justice requires that AI be used fairly  such as using the same standards for decisions no matter a person s race  gender  or income level  Moreover  as of March       the OCR hired a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer  OCAIO  to pursue the  implementation of the HHS AI strategy                The OCR also has issued rules and regulations to protect the privacy of individuals  health information  These regulations require healthcare providers to follow certain privacy rules when using AI  The OCR also requires healthcare providers to keep a record of how they use AI and to ensure that their AI systems are secure  Overall  the U S  has taken steps to protect individuals  privacy and ethical issues related to AI in healthcare             
The U S  is not the only country to develop or initiate regulations of data privacy with AI  Other countries have implemented data protection regulations  more specifically with company privacy invasions  In Denmark  the Danish Expert Group on Data Ethics has adopted recommendations on  Data for the Benefit of the People   These recommendations are intended to encourage the responsible use of data in the business sector  with a focus on data processing  The recommendations include a focus on equality and non discrimination with regard to bias in AI  as well as human dignity  The importance of human dignity is stressed  as it is said to outweigh profit and must be respected in all data processes             
The European Union has implemented the General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR  to protect citizens  personal data  which applies to the use of AI in healthcare  In addition  the European Commission has established guidelines to ensure the ethical development of AI  including the use of algorithms to ensure fairness and transparency               With GDPR  the European Union was the first to regulate AI through data protection legislation  The Union finds privacy as a fundamental human right  it wants to prevent unconsented and secondary uses of data by private or public health facilities  By streamlining access to personal data for health research and findings  they are able to instate the right and importance of patient privacy               In the United States  the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  HIPAA  requires organizations to protect the privacy and security of patient information  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have also released guidelines for the development of AI based medical applications              

Ethical concerns edit 
Data collection edit 
In order to effectively train Machine Learning and use AI in healthcare  massive amounts of data must be gathered  Acquiring this data  however  comes at the cost of patient privacy in most cases and is not well received publicly  For example  a survey conducted in the UK estimated that     of the population is uncomfortable with sharing their personal data in order to improve artificial intelligence technology               The scarcity of real  accessible patient data is a hindrance that deters the progress of developing and deploying more artificial intelligence in healthcare 
Furthermore  the lack of current regulations surrounding AI in the United States has generated concerns about mismanagement of patient data  such as with corporations utilizing patient data for financial gain  For example  Roche  a Swiss healthcare company  was found to have purchased healthcare data for approximately   million cancer patients at an estimated total cost of      billion               Naturally  this generates questions of ethical concern  Is there a monetary price that can be set for data  and should it depend on its perceived value or contributions to science  Is it fair to patients to sell their data  These concerns were addressed in a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in      that asked Americans for their opinions about the increased presence of AI in their daily lives  and the survey estimated that     of Americans were more concerned than excited about such increased presence  with    of participants specifically associating their concern with  people misusing AI                Ultimately  the current potential of artificial intelligence in healthcare is additionally hindered by  concerns about mismanagement of data collected  especially in the United States 

Automation edit 
A systematic review and thematic analysis in      showed that most stakeholders including health professionals  patients  and the general public doubted that care involving AI could be empathetic             
According to a      study  AI can replace up to     of jobs in the UK within the next    to    years               However  of these jobs  it was concluded that AI has not eliminated any healthcare jobs so far  Though if AI were to automate healthcare related jobs  the jobs most susceptible to automation would be those dealing with digital information  radiology  and pathology  as opposed to those dealing with doctor to patient interaction              
Automation can provide benefits alongside doctors as well  Some believe that AI may avert healthcare worker burnout and cognitive overload  so that doctors who take advantage of AI in healthcare will provide greater quality healthcare than doctors and medical establishments who do not              
Recently  there have been many discussions between healthcare experts in terms of AI and elder care  In relation to elder care  AI bots have been helpful in guiding older residents living in assisted living with entertainment and company  These bots are allowing staff in the home to have more one on one time with each resident  but the bots are also programmed with more ability in what they are able to do  such as knowing different languages and different types of care depending on the patient s conditions  The bot is an AI machine  which means it goes through the same training as any other machine   using algorithms to parse the given data  learn from it and predict the outcome in relation to what situation is at hand             

Bias edit 
Since AI makes decisions solely on the data it receives as input  it is important that this data represents accurate patient demographics  In a hospital setting  patients do not have full knowledge of how predictive algorithms are created or calibrated  Therefore  these medical establishments can unfairly code their algorithms to discriminate against minorities and prioritize profits rather than providing optimal care               A recent scoping review identified    equity challenges along with    strategies that can be implemented to help address them when AI applications are developed using many to many mapping              
There can also be unintended bias in these algorithms that can exacerbate social and healthcare inequities                     Since AI s decisions are a direct reflection of its input data  the data it receives must have accurate representation of patient demographics  For instance  if populations are less represented in healthcare data it is likely to create bias in AI tools that lead to incorrect assumptions of a demographic and impact the ability to provide appropriate care               White males are overly represented in medical data sets               Therefore  having minimal patient data on minorities can lead to AI making more accurate predictions for majority populations  leading to unintended worse medical outcomes for minority populations               Collecting data from minority communities can also lead to medical discrimination  For instance  HIV is a prevalent virus among minority communities and HIV status can be used to discriminate against patients               In addition to biases that may arise from sample selection  different clinical systems used to collect data may also impact AI functionality  For example  radiographic systems and their outcomes  e g   resolution  vary by provider  Moreover  clinician work practices  such as the positioning of the patient for radiography  can also greatly influence the data and make comparability difficult               However  these biases are able to be eliminated through careful implementation and a methodical collection of representative data 
A final source of algorithmic bias  which has been called  label choice bias   arises when proxy measures are used to train algorithms  that build in bias against certain groups  For example  a widely used algorithm predicted health care costs as a proxy for health care needs  and used predictions to allocate resources to help patients with complex health needs  This introduced bias because Black patients have lower costs  even when they are just as unhealthy as White patients               Solutions to the  label choice bias  aim to match the actual target  what the algorithm is predicting  more closely to the ideal target  what researchers want the algorithm to predict   so for the prior example  instead of predicting cost  researchers would focus on the variable of healthcare needs which is rather more significant  Adjusting the target led to almost double the number of Black patients being selected for the program 

History edit 
Research in the     s and     s produced the first problem solving program  or expert system  known as Dendral                            While it was designed for applications in organic chemistry  it provided the basis for a subsequent system MYCIN               considered one of the most significant early uses of artificial intelligence in medicine                            MYCIN and other systems such as INTERNIST   and CASNET did not achieve routine use by practitioners  however              
The     s and     s brought the proliferation of the microcomputer and new levels of network connectivity  During this time  there was a recognition by researchers and developers that AI systems in healthcare must be designed to accommodate the absence of perfect data and build on the expertise of physicians               Approaches involving fuzzy set theory               Bayesian networks               and artificial neural networks                            have been applied to intelligent computing systems in healthcare 
Medical and technological advancements occurring over this half century period that have enabled the growth of healthcare related applications of AI to include  

Improvements in computing power resulting in faster data collection and data processing             
Growth of genomic sequencing databases             
Widespread implementation of electronic health record systems             
Improvements in natural language processing and computer vision  enabling machines to replicate human perceptual processes                          
Enhanced the precision of robot assisted surgery             
Increased tree based machine learning models that allow flexibility in establishing health predictors             
Improvements in deep learning techniques and data logs for rare diseases
