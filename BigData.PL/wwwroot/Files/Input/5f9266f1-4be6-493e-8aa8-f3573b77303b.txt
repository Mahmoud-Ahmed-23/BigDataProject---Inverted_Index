							Egypt       s balance of payments  BOP  recorded an overall deficit of       m during the first half  July December       of the fiscal year  FY          Central Bank of Egypt  CBE  figures showed  This represented a slight increase from the       m deficit recorded in the same period of the previous fiscal year 
The outcome was primarily driven by a widening current account deficit  which reached      bn  compared to     bn a year earlier  the CBE said on Monday 
The larger current account deficit resulted mainly from a       increase in the trade deficit  which climbed to      bn  coupled with a       decline in the services surplus  falling to     bn 
However  the expansion of the deficit was partly offset by a significant      rise in net current transfers  reaching      bn  largely due to a surge in remittances from Egyptians working abroad  Furthermore  the investment income deficit narrowed by      to US     bn 
 nbsp 
The capital and financial account recorded a net inflow of     bn during the six month period  slightly down from     bn in the prior year period  Within this account  Foreign Direct Investment  FDI  in Egypt registered a net inflow of   bn  while portfolio investments experienced a net outflow of      bn 
 nbsp 
Regarding the trade deficit components  the non oil trade gap widened by        or     bn  to reach      bn  This was because non oil merchandise imports grew faster than exports 
 nbsp 
Non oil imports rose            bn  to      bn  driven by increased purchases of wheat  pharmaceuticals  gauze pads  vaccines  soya beans  and spare parts for cars and tractors  Meanwhile  non oil exports increased by            bn  to      bn  led by higher sales of wires and cables  ready made clothes  aluminium products  and fresh dried fruits 
 nbsp 
The oil trade deficit also expanded significantly  reaching     bn compared to     bn previously  Oil imports surged by            bn  to      bn  fuelled by higher imports of natural gas  up     bn   oil products  up     bn   and crude oil  up       m   Conversely  oil exports dropped by             m  to     bn  reflecting decreased export quantities and prices for crude oil  down       m  and natural gas  down       m   although exports of oil products increased by       m due to higher volumes 
 nbsp 
Within the services account  Suez Canal transit receipts experienced a sharp decline of        falling to     bn from     bn  The CBE attributed this drop to ongoing Red Sea maritime navigation tensions  which forced route diversions  leading to a       fall in net tonnage transiting the canal  to      m tons  and a       decrease in the number of vessels 
 nbsp 
On a positive note for services  tourism revenues increased by       to     bn  up from     bn  supported by a rise in the number of tourist nights to     m from     m 
 nbsp 
The surge in remittances from Egyptians working abroad was a key factor mitigating the current account deficit  rising       to      bn from     bn  The narrowing of the investment income deficit to     bn  from     bn  also helped  this resulted from a       decrease in investment income payments  to     bn  combined with a       increase in investment income receipts  to     bn  
 nbsp 
Examining the capital and financial account further  the net FDI inflow of     bn  up from     bn  comprised several elements  FDI in the oil sector shifted to a net inflow of       m from a previous net outflow of       m  as inflows for greenfield investments rose to     bn while cost recovery outflows by foreign partners fell to     bn 
 nbsp 
FDI into non oil sectors achieved a net inflow of     bn  This included     bn from greenfield investments or capital increases  up from     bn         m from real estate purchases by non residents  up from        m        bn in net reinvested earnings  down from     bn   and       m in net proceeds from selling assets to non residents  down from       m  
 nbsp 
Portfolio investment in Egypt recorded a significant shift  registering a net outflow of     bn compared to a net inflow of       m in the first half of the previous fiscal year 
 nbsp 
Changes within the banking sector showed a net inflow of     bn related to foreign assets  representing a decrease in assets   contrasting with a net outflow of     bn previously  Bank liabilities posted a net inflow of     bn  representing an increase in liabilities   compared to a net outflow of       m in the prior period 
 nbsp 
Finally  the change in the Central Bank of Egypt       s liabilities recorded a net inflow of       m  significantly lower than the     bn inflow recorded in the same period last year
