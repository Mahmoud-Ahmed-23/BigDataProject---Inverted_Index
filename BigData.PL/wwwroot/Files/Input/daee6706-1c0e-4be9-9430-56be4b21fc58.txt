							Having kicked off a skyrocketing career in squash at the tender age of     Nour El Tayeb has joined the ranks of Egypt s top tier of squash players  who continue to occupy the top rankings in the sport year after year 
Daily News Egypt spoke to El Tayeb about her career  why she chose this sport  and her thoughts on other players 
When did you start playing squash 
My father  Mohamed El Tayeb was a squash player  I used to join him while he was training  I started when I was five years old 
How did you reach your current position in squash 
This is because I love squash  I even have two sisters  Nada and Yasmin  who played squash  but they did not love the sport enough  so they did not complete  A punishment for me  when I was young and misbehaved  was to prevent me from going to squash training 
Did you try to play other sports when you were young 
Yes  from age five until I was about eight or nine  I also partook in swimming  gymnastics and basketball  Squash  however  was the sport I most enjoyed 
When was your first victory 
It was during the El Shams Club National Championship  I was about    years old and I won  Before this championship I would usually end up in second or third place  It was a good start for my sports career 
What was your first international championship 
It was the      British Junior Open Squash Championship  I participated in the under    female division  as I was    years old  and I won in this division 
Tell us why this championship is so important 
As Britain is where squash was invented  and the English Squash and Racketball Association is the entity that organises the British Junior Open Squash Championship  this championship is considered the second most important squash championship for juniors  The first is the World Junior Squash Championship 
What were your results at the World Junior Squash Championships 
I won the      World Junior Squash Championships  held in Boston  US  after defeating Nour El Sherbini in the final with scores of                        and a final score of     
In the      Junior Squash Championships  held in Chennai  India  I reached the final  but was defeated by El Sherbini  with scores of                         a final score of     
El Sherbini is two years younger than me  but her age does not reflect her level in the sport  as she is very competent 
In the      World Junior Squash Championships  held in Cologne  Germany  I also reached the finals  where I was defeated by US player Amanda Sobhy  with scores of                         and a final score of     
How many victories did you manage to secure in the British Junior Open Squash Championships 
I won five times  In       I won the female under    division  In       I won the under    division  In      and       I won the under    division  In       I won the under    division 
Did you participate in the Windy City Open Squash Tournament 
Yes I did  I reached the semi final in       where I lost to the legendry Malaysian champion Nicol David  with scores of                    and a final score of      In the final match  Nicol David was then defeated by Egypt       s Raneem El Wilily  with scores of                          and a final score of     
What other victories are you proud of 
I have won three Professional Squash Association  PSA  championships 
The first was in       I won the final against France       s Camille Serme  I am very proud of this victory for two reasons  The first is because Serme was ranked seventh or eighth internationally at the time  while I was ranked   th  The second reason was that it was the first time for me to win a non junior championship 
My second victory was during the Ireland Squash Open Championship  in       I won the final against New Zealand       s Jacqueline Hocks  At the time  it was the longest match in squash history for women  as we were both intent on winning 
The third championship was in Alexandria in      
What other significant victories did you secure  
I reached the final in three international prestigious championships  In the US Squash Open  held in October       I lost the final to English Laura Massaro 
In       I reached the Malaysian Squash Open final  where I lost to Raneem El Weleily  The same year  I qualified to Hong Kong       s Squash Open       s final  but lost to Nicol David 
What championships are you participating in next 
I am participating in the      Women       s World Open Squash  to be held in Malaysia  Other Egyptian champions are participating  including Raneem El Weleily  Nour El Sherbini  Omneya Abdel Kawy and Nouran Gohar 
In the qualifier match  if I win  I will play against Amanda Sobhy  who is currently ranked seventh internationally  If I win  I will qualify to the quarter finals  where I will have the chance to face off against Raneem El Weleily 
If I am lucky enough to reach the semi finals  I will have the chance to play against either Laura Massaro or Omneya Abdel Kawy 
Does this mean you will not face off against Nicol David 
Well  recently Nicol David failed to win the last five or six championships  In these championships  she easily lost to Nour El Sherbini 
Sherbini is now ranked second internationally  and I believe she is the best player now internationally  and I expect that she will be ranked first very soon  David  on the other hand  is ranked the fifth internationally 
El Sherbini will play against David  and I think the victory will go to El Sherbini  so I doubt I will meet David 
What are your most recent achievements 
I won the National Squash Championship  women       s division  while Omar Mosaad won the men       s division  It was celebrated at the Cairo Stadium  In the final match  I won against Raneem El Weleily  Mosaad defeated Zahed Mohamed in the final 
In this championship       s semi final  I won against Omneya Abdel Kawy  Defeating El Weleily and Abdel Kawy gave me great hope in winning the upcoming      Women       s World Open Squash 
So  it can be said that Heliopolis Sporting Club  HSC        s players stole the show during this championship 
Yes  as Omar Mosaad and I play for HSC  I am very grateful  as I am the first female player from HSC to win this championship in a long time 
Which male squash players have stood out recently  in your opinion 
Recently  I think Mohamed El Shorbagy  Omar Mosaad  Nick Matthew and Gr gory Gaultier  have achieved very positive results 
You previously said you suffered an injury last October  can you tell us more about it 
I had to stop playing last October due to an injury that I suffered  in the quarterfinals of the US Squash Open  playing against El Weleily  I completed this match and I managed to win  with scores of                               and a final score of     
I also won in the semi finals against Camille Serme  with scores of                         and a final score of      In the final  I lost to Laura Massaro  with scores of                               and a final score of     
About a week after this championship  I travelled to France for a surgery  as I suffered a tear in the labrum  which required surgery  I had to rest for two months  Afterwards  when I checked with the doctor  I was allowed to resume light activities 
What was the first tournament you participated in after the injury  
I registered in the      Allam British Open  but I bowed out in the last week  as my shoulders were still aching 
My first championship afterwards was HSC       s Squash Championship  I expected to lose  as I have been outside the court for a long time  but I won this championship  after defeating Mayar Hany in the final 
Can you name a player you particularly enjoy playing against 
Raneem El Weleily  as her performance makes our matches very interesting  Another thing is that she is respectful on the court  whether she wins or loses  She is currently playing for Wadi Degla Club  When she was playing at the HSC  I used to play with her and she used to give me useful advice 
Who is your idol in the sport 
An Australian squash female player called Rachael Grinham  who lived in Egypt    years ago  She used to play at HSC  Since I was    years old  I would watch her while she was playing and also used to play with her  Other Egyptian and international squash champions  including Ramy Ashour  also used to play and train with her 
What I like about her is that  despite being the world number one in      or       she was very modest and her performance was great  I believe playing at HSC helped her jump to become ranked the first internationally 
Afterwards  Raneem El Weleily became my idol  El Weleily as well  despite the high ranking she acquired in the sport  is very humble 
If squash is included in the Olympic Games  Egyptian players can bring home many Olympic medals  What is your view on this issue 
We all think about this issue  The World Squash Federation  WSF  has tried many times to include the sport among the Olympic sports  but has failed so far  The International Olympic Committee  IOC  is the entity responsible for approving the sports that enter the Olympics  however  and politics are somehow always involved 
Squash has been practiced for a very long time and it is an old sport  I am convinced that there is definitely a way for the WSF to include the sport as an Olympic one 
Can the media play any role in including squash as an Olympic sport 
Squash is developing and spreading via the media  and this is very important to include the sport as an Olympic one 
Are you satisfied with media coverage of the sport 
In this regards I feel that it is improving for example BeIN sports is eager to broadcast squash matches  The path is somewhat slow  but it is getting better 
What about the Egyptian media s coverage of the sport 
As Egyptian players  especially in squash  are achieving great results  the Egyptian media is focusing more attention to the sport  This was reflected when the prominent TV host Lamis El Hadidy hosted Mohamed El Shorbagy  RamyAshour  Raneem El Weleily  and Nour El Sherbini in the past three or four months 
Of course  I would like to see better results  better coverage  and more attention given to the players  as they do with the football figures  in order to attract more sponsors to support the sport and its players  We should utilise the fact that Egypt has the best squash players 
Do you think that Egypt will be able to maintain its level in squash 
As the new generation of squash players is witnessing the success of the current generation in the sport  I do believe that Egypt will maintain its position in the future
