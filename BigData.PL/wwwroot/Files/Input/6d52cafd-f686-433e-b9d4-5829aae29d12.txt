The implementation of the Dabaa nuclear project has witnessed serious delays  despite implementations plans taking place at the end of the     s under former President Abdel Nasser according to Nuclear Affairs and Energy Adviser at the Ministry of Electricity Ibrahim Al Osery 
Al Osery  who served as a senior inspector at the International Atomic Energy Agency in the past  worked to implement Egyptian nuclear plans in Dabaa  The project has the potential to provide up to     of Egypt s electric energy capacity  claimed Al Osery 
He claimed that implementation delays cost the country approximately   bn annually  adding that over the past    years Egypt has lost approximately     bn 
Egypt is currently awaiting a decision from President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi to begin implementation of a new national project revolving around nuclear powered electricity production through a tender offered for global bidding  according to Al Osery 
 nbsp 
We ll start with the obvious question  why has Egypt not yet implemented its nuclear programme 
Yes  the historic question  let s go back to the     s when Egypt resolved to produce electricity from nuclear power 
At the end of this decade Egypt worked to increase the capacity of its technical staff in Egyptian universities  sending them to friendly countries in order to be trained in nuclear programmes that would be implemented by Egyptian scholars  But Israeli aggression against Egypt in      and the occupation of the Sinai Peninsula put an end to this programme 
Egypt s first attempt to construct a nuclear reactor took place in Borg el Aral in Alexandria  but Israeli aggression against Egypt was one of the reasons that these ambitions were stalled 
Following the battle to liberate the Sinai Peninsula from Israel in October       President Anwar Sadat hoped to revive the programme again in      and agreed with US President Richard Nixon to implement two stations 
Two American companies offered to implement the project  but America imposed political conditions that Sadat refused 
What did Sadat do after he rejected US conditions 
Sadat was very determined to establish an Egyptian nuclear programme and attempt to overcome the energy crisis which loomed on the horizon in light of growing petroleum derivative consumption 
He developed a plan to construct eight stations through directing contracting  four of which had an electric capacity of     MW hours each  while the capacity of the four remaining stations would reach       MW hours each 
The capacity of energy produced from these stations was estimated according to Egypt s electricity network at that time 
At present  Egypt s total electric generation capacity amounts to        MW and the Dabaa nuclear project is expected to provide     of this capacity 
France offered to construct the first two stations and a shared working group was formed in order to transport nuclear technology c     A French company conducted a study of the areas in which the reactor could potentially be constructed  Dabaa  west of Alexandria  was chosen as the site 
But the assassination of President Sadat in October      delayed the project 
Why was the project delayed again in the era of ousted president Hosni Mubarak 
Mubarak requested that bidding be offered for project implementation  which served to delay the project more than four years  The contracting style was changed to a bid  which delayed the project another three and a half years  and then the political situation since    January      also played a part in postponing the project 
The project was offered as a tender and bids were received  Egypt was studied from technical and economic standpoints  but before project implementation was finalised  the Chernobyl accident took place in the     s in Ukraine  which served as a scapegoat on which more delays could be blamed 
Ukraine is an independent state with vast coal reserves  Nine nuclear stations were built following the incident and operations did not stop after the blast  At present  Ukraine has    nuclear reactors for electricity generation 
Those who fear risks associated with nuclear energy are not specialists in the field  nor do they take into consideration the experiences of other countries 
Why have experts not appeared in the media to explain the importance of the project 
As I said before  the Chernobyl incident formed a scapegoat on which more implementation delays could be blamed by creating panic in the Egyptian street regarding the dangers of nuclear reactors 
How can this be explained 
It is no secret that the West fears Egypt having a nuclear programme  America imposed political conditions on Sadat for implementing two stations in       but he refused to accept them 
But Egypt has announced more than once that its nuclear plan will be peaceful  despite the fact that neighbouring Israel does not promise the same 
But it is clear that there is a campaign against the project each time it comes out into the open again  Why is that 
Again  I say that those who launch these campaigns are not specialists and businessmen play a significant role in supporting the campaigns through the media outlets that they own 
People always recall the Chernobyl disaster  and because they are not specialists  they don t know that Chernobyl was a boiling water reactor  The number of reactors under construction of this type are only four of a total of    reactors under construction across the world  representing      of the total 
These reactors account for only      of the total electric energy produced by nuclear energy around the world 
Can you explain more about the type of reactors under construction 
The number of reactors under construction around the world number    with a capacity of        MW hours and    normal pressurised water reactor reactions represent       of the total  These reactors produce        MW hours  or       of total nuclear powered electricity 
Reactors that operate on boiled water  like that of Chernobyl  number only four across the world 
Only one gas cooled reactor exists at present  It produces     MW hours representing      of total production 
What kind reactors will be constructed on the Dabaa site 
The nuclear reactor that will be constructed in Dabaa after the president issues his decision will be a normal pressurised water reactor  No radioactive leaks have occurred in these types of reactors since the     s 
There are     nuclear reactors of this variety out of a total of     operational reactors worldwide 
How much will it cost to construct the Dabaa power plant 
Initial costs for the two reactors are estimated at   bn each  Various requisites for the project have been implemented  including the construction of two nuclear power plants with a capacity ranging between          Mw in order to allow all companies to apply for the tender 
The winning company will be chosen after its bid is studied from financial and technical standpoints 
According to the specifications stipulated by the Ministry of Electricity  the supplying company is obligated to cover     of foreign component costs   Loan repayment will include a grace period which will depend on the offer presented 
Payment for power plant construction costs will take place through the difference between the cost of nuclear fuel and cost of natural gas or oil 
Implementation delays cost the country approximately   bn annually over the past    years Egypt has lost approximately     bn 
 nbsp 
But aren t some countries beginning to abandon nuclear energy 
You must mean Germany  Germany generates     of its energy through coal      from natural gas      from nuclear energy  The remaining portion is generated through new and renewable energy such solar  hydro power  and wind 
Germany now regrets its decision to halt the construction of nuclear power plants to generate energy 
German demand for energy is different than that of Egypt  the former displays population growth of no more than       while the latter exceeds     This means that a great demand for electric power exists  which Germany can obtain from Europe s unified network 
In spite of Germany s experiment      operational reactors worldwide currently exist worldwide  mostly in European countries and the United States  The UAE recently announced that it hopes to establish two reactors in cooperation with South Korea  even though the UAE is an oil rich country 
Iran  also an oil rich country  has its own reactor and has plans to construct another 
Saudi Arabia just allocated     bn to construct    reactors  As the largest oil exporter in the world  is Saudi Arabia experiencing a power generation deficit 
What about China  which has one of the largest coal reserves in the world  China is currently constructing    nuclear plants in addition to another    already in operation  while France has    operational reactors and one under construction 
What about the recent Fukushima accident in Japan 
The leaks that occurred in Fukushima occurred in a type of reactor that operates on boiling water  the same variety as the Chernobyl reactors 
Nevertheless  Japan has two nuclear power plants under construction  a fact that contradicts the opinions of non specialists against the construction of nuclear reactors 
What is your opinion of the recently announced tariff for households and investors that purchase new and renewable energy 
I cannot give an opinion on the technical aspects of this as it is outside the realm of my specialty  but the decision is considered a major shift in state policy on Egypt s energy mix  which is something we ve been awaiting for years 
New and renewable energy sources alone aren t sufficient to combat the energy crisis experienced by Egypt  A strategy of expanding industrial investments over the coming months is in place  and projects recently announced by the state affirm this strategy 
No state in the world has a socio economic programme that depends on new and renewable energy sources only  Countries instead rely on five sources in different proportions represented through the energy mix  while the details of this mix depend on each state s capacity and economic circumstances 
Solar energy cannot be depended on as an alternative to nuclear energy  serving only as an additional source of energy  Nor is solar energy an intensive source of power  as capacity ranges between      acres for each MW hour 
This means that producing       MW in solar plants requires        KM  
Solar plant maintenance is very expensive and must be carried out weekly and monthly  as solar energy mirrors lose     of capacity if they are not cleaned for one month  On average they should be cleaned every three days  but this can vary according to the country  the amount of dust present  and the weather 
Is solar energy more expensive than nuclear energy 
It is  The cost of producing   KWh in solar energy is four times more expensive than that of nuclear energy when costs incurred after the station is no longer operational are taken into account 
What do you have to say about the Dabaa site 
The Dabaa location accommodates four to eight stations with a nuclear capacity of            MW  and locational studies take four years on average 
Transitioning to an alternative location would cost    bn   bn on top of funds already spent on the location
