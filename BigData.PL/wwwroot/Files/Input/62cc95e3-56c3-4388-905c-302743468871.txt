Topology  from the Greek words             place  location       and             study       is the branch of mathematics concerned with the properties of a geometric object that are preserved under continuous deformations  such as stretching  twisting  crumpling  and bending  that is  without closing holes  opening holes  tearing  gluing  or passing through itself 
A topological space is a set endowed with a structure  called a topology  which allows defining continuous deformation of subspaces  and  more generally  all kinds of continuity  Euclidean spaces  and  more generally  metric spaces are examples of topological spaces  as any distance or metric defines a topology  The deformations that are considered in topology are homeomorphisms and homotopies  A property that is invariant under such deformations is a topological property  The following are basic examples of topological properties  the dimension  which allows distinguishing between a line and a surface  compactness  which allows distinguishing between a line and a circle  connectedness  which allows distinguishing a circle from two non intersecting circles 
The ideas underlying topology go back to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz  who in the   th century envisioned the geometria situs and analysis situs  Leonhard Euler s Seven Bridges of K nigsberg problem and polyhedron formula are arguably the field s first theorems  The term topology was introduced by Johann Benedict Listing in the   th century  although  it was not until the first decades of the   th century that the idea of a topological space was developed 


Motivation edit 
M bius strips  which have only one surface and one edge  are a kind of object studied in topology 
The motivating insight behind topology is that some geometric problems depend not on the exact shape of the objects involved  but rather on the way they are put together  For example  the square and the circle have many properties in common  they are both one dimensional objects  from a topological point of view  and both separate the plane into two parts  the part inside and the part outside 
In one of the first papers in topology  Leonhard Euler demonstrated that it was impossible to find a route through the town of K nigsberg  now Kaliningrad  that would cross each of its seven bridges exactly once  This result did not depend on the lengths of the bridges or on their distance from one another  but only on connectivity properties  which bridges connect to which islands or riverbanks  This Seven Bridges of K nigsberg problem led to the branch of mathematics known as graph theory 
Similarly  the hairy ball theorem of algebraic topology says that  one cannot comb the hair flat on a hairy ball without creating a cowlick   This fact is immediately convincing to most people  even though they might not recognize the more formal statement of the theorem  that there is no nonvanishing continuous tangent vector field on the sphere  As with the Bridges of K nigsberg  the result does not depend on the shape of the sphere  it applies to any kind of smooth blob  as long as it has no holes 
To deal with these problems that do not rely on the exact shape of the objects  one must be clear about just what properties these problems do rely on  From this need arises the notion of homeomorphism  The impossibility of crossing each bridge just once applies to any arrangement of bridges homeomorphic to those in K nigsberg  and the hairy ball theorem applies to any space homeomorphic to a sphere 
Intuitively  two spaces are homeomorphic if one can be deformed into the other without cutting or gluing  A famous example  known as the  Topologist s Breakfast   is that a topologist cannot distinguish a coffee mug from a doughnut  a sufficiently pliable doughnut could be reshaped to a coffee cup by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it while shrinking the hole into a handle            
Homeomorphism can be considered the most basic topological equivalence  Another is homotopy equivalence  This is harder to describe without getting technical  but the essential notion is that two objects are homotopy equivalent if they both result from  squishing  some larger object 

History edit 
The Seven Bridges of K nigsberg was a problem solved by Euler 
See also  History of the separation axioms
Topology  as a well defined mathematical discipline  originates in the early part of the twentieth century  but some isolated results can be traced back several centuries             Among these are certain questions in geometry investigated by Leonhard Euler  His      paper on the Seven Bridges of K nigsberg is regarded as one of the first practical applications of topology             On    November       Euler wrote to a friend that he had realized the importance of the edges of a polyhedron  This led to his polyhedron formula  V   E   F      where V  E  and F respectively indicate the number of vertices  edges  and faces of the polyhedron   Some authorities regard this analysis as the first theorem  signaling the birth of topology            
Further contributions were made by Augustin Louis Cauchy  Ludwig Schl fli  Johann Benedict Listing  Bernhard Riemann and Enrico Betti             Listing introduced the term  Topologie  in Vorstudien zur Topologie  written in his native German  in       having used the word for ten years in correspondence before its first appearance in print             The English form  topology  was used in      in Listing s obituary in the journal Nature to distinguish  qualitative geometry from the ordinary geometry in which quantitative relations chiefly are treated             
Their work was corrected  consolidated and greatly extended by Henri Poincar   In       he published his ground breaking paper on Analysis Situs  which introduced the concepts now known as homotopy and homology  which are now considered part of algebraic topology

The development of topology in the   th century was marked by significant advances in both foundational theory and its application to other fields of mathematics  Unifying the work on function spaces of Georg Cantor  Vito Volterra  Cesare Arzel   Jacques Hadamard  Giulio Ascoli and others  Maurice Fr chet introduced the metric space in                  A metric space is now considered a special case of a general topological space  with any given topological space potentially giving rise to many distinct metric spaces  In       Felix Hausdorff coined the term  topological space  and defined what is now called a Hausdorff space             Currently  a topological space is a slight generalization of Hausdorff spaces  given in      by Kazimierz Kuratowski            
Modern topology depends strongly on the ideas of set theory  developed by Georg Cantor in the later part of the   th century  In addition to establishing the basic ideas of set theory  Cantor considered point sets in Euclidean space as part of his study of Fourier series  For further developments  see point set topology and algebraic topology 
The      Abel Prize was awarded to Dennis Sullivan  for his groundbreaking contributions to topology in its broadest sense  and in particular its algebraic  geometric and dynamical aspects              

Concepts edit 
Topologies on sets edit 
Main article  Topological space
The term topology also refers to a specific mathematical idea central to the area of mathematics called topology  Informally  a topology describes how elements of a set relate spatially to each other  The same set can have different topologies  For instance  the real line  the complex plane  and the Cantor set can be thought of as the same set with different topologies 
Formally  let X be a set and let   be a family of subsets of X  Then   is called a topology on X if 

Both the empty set and X are elements of   
Any union of elements of   is an element of   
Any intersection of finitely many elements of   is an element of   
If   is a topology on X  then the pair  X     is called a topological space  The notation X  may be used to denote a set X endowed with the particular topology    By definition  every topology is a   system 
The members of   are called open sets in X  A subset of X is said to be closed if its complement is in    that is  its complement is open   A subset of X may be open  closed  both  a clopen set   or neither  The empty set and X itself are always both closed and open  An open subset of X which contains a point x is called an open neighborhood of x 

Continuous functions and homeomorphisms edit 


A continuous deformation  a type of homeomorphism  of a mug into a doughnut  torus  and of a cow into a sphere
A continuous transformation can turn a coffee mug into a donut Ceramic model by Keenan Crane and Henry Segerman 
Main articles  Continuous function and homeomorphism
A function or map from one topological space to another is called continuous if the inverse  image  of any open set is open  If the function maps the real numbers to the real numbers  both spaces with the standard topology   then this definition of continuous is equivalent to the definition of continuous in calculus  If a continuous function is one to one and onto  and if the inverse of the function is also continuous  then the function is called a homeomorphism and the domain of the function is said to be homeomorphic to the range  Another way of saying this is that the function has a natural extension to the topology  If two spaces are homeomorphic  they have identical topological properties and are considered topologically the same  The cube and the sphere are homeomorphic  as are the coffee cup and the doughnut  However  the sphere is not homeomorphic to the doughnut 

Manifolds edit 
Main article  Manifold
While topological spaces can be extremely varied and exotic  many areas of topology focus on the more familiar class of spaces known as manifolds  A manifold is a topological space that resembles Euclidean space near each point   More precisely  each point of an n dimensional manifold has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to the Euclidean space of dimension n   Lines and circles  but not figure eights  are one dimensional manifolds   Two dimensional manifolds are also called surfaces  although not all surfaces are manifolds   Examples include the plane  the sphere  and the torus  which can all be realized without self intersection in three dimensions  and the Klein bottle and real projective plane  which cannot  that is  all their realizations are surfaces that are not manifolds  

Topics edit 
General topology edit 
Main article  General topology
General topology is the branch of topology dealing with the basic set theoretic definitions and constructions used in topology                          It is the foundation of most other branches of topology  including differential topology  geometric topology  and algebraic topology  Another name for general topology is point set topology 
The basic object of study is topological spaces  which are sets equipped with a topology  that is  a family of subsets  called open sets  which is closed under finite intersections and  finite or infinite  unions  The fundamental concepts of topology  such as continuity  compactness  and connectedness  can be defined in terms of open sets  Intuitively  continuous functions take nearby points to nearby points  Compact sets are those that can be covered by finitely many sets of arbitrarily small size  Connected sets are sets that cannot be divided into two pieces that are far apart  The words nearby  arbitrarily small  and far apart can all be made precise by using open sets  Several topologies can be defined on a given space  Changing a topology consists of changing the collection of open sets  This changes which functions are continuous and which subsets are compact or connected 
Metric spaces are an important class of topological spaces where the distance between any two points is defined by a function called a metric  In a metric space  an open set is a union of open disks  where an open disk of radius r centered at x is the set of all points whose distance to x is less than r  Many common spaces are topological spaces whose topology can be defined by a metric  This is the case of the real line  the complex plane  real and complex vector spaces and Euclidean spaces  Having a metric simplifies many proofs 

Algebraic topology edit 
Main article  Algebraic topology
Algebraic topology is a branch of mathematics that uses tools from algebra to study topological spaces              The basic goal is to find algebraic invariants that classify topological spaces up to homeomorphism  though usually most classify up to homotopy equivalence 
The most important of these invariants are homotopy groups  homology  and cohomology 
Although algebraic topology primarily uses algebra to study topological problems  using topology to solve algebraic problems is sometimes also possible  Algebraic topology  for example  allows for a convenient proof that any subgroup of a free group is again a free group 

Differential topology edit 
Main article  Differential topology
Differential topology is the field dealing with differentiable functions on differentiable manifolds              It is closely related to differential geometry and together they make up the geometric theory of differentiable manifolds 
More specifically  differential topology considers the properties and structures that require only a smooth structure on a manifold to be defined  Smooth manifolds are  softer  than manifolds with extra geometric structures  which can act as obstructions to certain types of equivalences and deformations that exist in differential topology  For instance  volume and Riemannian curvature are invariants that can distinguish different geometric structures on the same smooth manifold                  that is  one can smoothly  flatten out  certain manifolds  but it might require distorting the space and affecting the curvature or volume 

Geometric topology edit 
Main article  Geometric topology
Geometric topology is a branch of topology that primarily focuses on low dimensional manifolds  that is  spaces of dimensions       and    and their interaction with geometry  but it also includes some higher dimensional topology              Some examples of topics in geometric topology are orientability  handle decompositions  local flatness  crumpling and the planar and higher dimensional Sch nflies theorem 
In high dimensional topology  characteristic classes are a basic invariant  and surgery theory is a key theory 
Low dimensional topology is strongly geometric  as reflected in the uniformization theorem in   dimensions   every surface admits a constant curvature metric  geometrically  it has one of   possible geometries  positive curvature spherical  zero curvature flat  and negative curvature hyperbolic   and the geometrization conjecture  now theorem  in   dimensions   every   manifold can be cut into pieces  each of which has one of eight possible geometries 
  dimensional topology can be studied as complex geometry in one variable  Riemann surfaces are complex curves    by the uniformization theorem every conformal class of metrics is equivalent to a unique complex one  and   dimensional topology can be studied from the point of view of complex geometry in two variables  complex surfaces   though not every   manifold admits a complex structure 

Generalizations edit 
Occasionally  one needs to use the tools of topology but a  set of points  is not available  In pointless topology one considers instead the lattice of open sets as the basic notion of the theory              while Grothendieck topologies are structures defined on arbitrary categories that allow the definition of sheaves on those categories and with that the definition of general cohomology theories             

Applications edit 
Biology edit 
Topology has been used to study various biological systems including molecules and nanostructure  e g   membraneous objects   In particular  circuit topology and knot theory have been extensively applied to classify and compare the topology of folded proteins and nucleic acids  Circuit topology classifies folded molecular chains based on the pairwise arrangement of their intra chain contacts and chain crossings  Knot theory  a branch of topology  is used in biology to study the effects of certain enzymes on DNA  These enzymes cut  twist  and reconnect the DNA  causing knotting with observable effects such as slower electrophoresis             

Computer science edit 
Topological data analysis uses techniques from algebraic topology to determine the large scale structure of a set  for instance  determining if a cloud of points is spherical or toroidal   The main method used by topological data analysis is to 

Replace a set of data points with a family of simplicial complexes  indexed by a proximity parameter 
Analyse these topological complexes via algebraic topology   specifically  via the theory of persistent homology             
Encode the persistent homology of a data set in the form of a parameterized version of a Betti number  which is called a barcode             
Several branches of programming language semantics  such as domain theory  are formalized using topology  In this context  Steve Vickers  building on work by Samson Abramsky and Michael B  Smyth  characterizes topological spaces as Boolean or Heyting algebras over open sets  which are characterized as semidecidable  equivalently  finitely observable  properties             

Physics edit 
Topology is relevant to physics in areas such as condensed matter physics              quantum field theory  quantum computing and physical cosmology 
The topological dependence of mechanical properties in solids is of interest in the disciplines of mechanical engineering and materials science  Electrical and mechanical properties depend on the arrangement and network structures of molecules and elementary units in materials              The compressive strength of crumpled topologies is studied in attempts to understand the high strength to weight of such structures that are mostly empty space              Topology is of further significance in Contact mechanics where the dependence of stiffness and friction on the dimensionality of surface structures is the subject of interest with applications in multi body physics 
A topological quantum field theory  or topological field theory or TQFT  is a quantum field theory that computes topological invariants  Although TQFTs were invented by physicists  they are also of mathematical interest  being related to  among other things  knot theory  the theory of four manifolds in algebraic topology  and the theory of moduli spaces in algebraic geometry  Donaldson  Jones  Witten  and Kontsevich have all won Fields Medals for work related to topological field theory 
The topological classification of Calabi Yau manifolds has important implications in string theory  as different manifolds can sustain different kinds of strings             
In topological quantum computers  the qubits are stored in topological properties  that are by definition invariant with respect to homotopies             
In cosmology  topology can be used to describe the overall shape of the universe              This area of research is commonly known as spacetime topology 
In condensed matter  a relevant application to topological physics comes from the possibility of obtaining a one way current  which is a current protected from backscattering  It was first discovered in electronics with the famous quantum Hall effect  and then generalized in other areas of physics  for instance in photonics             by F D M Haldane 

Robotics edit 
The possible positions of a robot can be described by a manifold called configuration space              In the area of motion planning  one finds paths between two points in configuration space  These paths represent a motion of the robot s joints and other parts into the desired pose             

Games and puzzles edit 
Disentanglement puzzles are based on topological aspects of the puzzle s shapes and components                                     

Fiber art edit 
In order to create a continuous join of pieces in a modular construction  it is necessary to create an unbroken path in an order that surrounds each piece and traverses each edge only once  This process is an application of the Eulerian path
