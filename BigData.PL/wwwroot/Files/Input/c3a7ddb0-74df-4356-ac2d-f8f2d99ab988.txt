Form of artificial intelligence
Weak artificial intelligence  weak AI  is artificial intelligence that implements a limited part of the mind  or  as narrow AI                                   is focused on one narrow task  
Weak AI is contrasted with strong AI  which can be interpreted in various ways  

Artificial general intelligence  AGI   a machine with the ability to apply intelligence to any problem  rather than just one specific problem 
Artificial super intelligence  ASI   a machine with a vastly superior intelligence to the average human being 
Artificial consciousness  a machine that has consciousness  sentience and mind  John Searle uses  strong AI  in this sense  
Narrow AI can be classified as being  limited to a single  narrowly defined task  Most modern AI systems would be classified in this category              Artificial general intelligence is conversely the opposite 


Applications and risks edit 
Some examples of narrow AI are AlphaGo             self driving cars  robot systems used in the medical field  and diagnostic doctors  Narrow AI systems are sometimes dangerous if unreliable  And the behavior that it follows can become inconsistent             It could be difficult for the AI to grasp complex patterns and get to a solution that works reliably in various environments  This  brittleness  can cause it to fail in unpredictable ways            
Narrow AI failures can sometimes have significant consequences  It could for example cause disruptions in the electric grid  damage nuclear power plants  cause global economic problems  and misdirect autonomous vehicles             Medicines could be incorrectly sorted and distributed  Also  medical diagnoses can ultimately have serious and sometimes deadly consequences if the AI is faulty or biased            
Simple AI programs have already worked their way into our society unnoticed  Autocorrection for typing  speech recognition for speech to text programs  and vast expansions in the data science fields are examples             As much as narrow and relatively general AI is slowly starting to help out societies  they are also starting to hurt them as well  AI had already unfairly put people in jail  discriminated against women in the workplace for hiring  taught some problematic ideas to millions  and even killed people with automatic cars              AI might be a powerful tool that can be used for improving lives  but it could also be a dangerous technology with the potential for misuse 
Despite being  narrow  AI  recommender systems are efficient at predicting user reactions based their posts  patterns  or trends              For instance  TikTok s  For You  algorithm can determine user s interests or preferences in less than an hour              Some other social media AI systems are used to detect bots that may be involved in biased propaganda or other potentially malicious activities             

Weak AI versus strong AI edit 
John Searle contests the possibility of strong AI  by which he means conscious AI   He further believes that the Turing test  created by Alan Turing and originally called the  imitation game   used to assess whether a machine can converse indistinguishably from a human  is not accurate or appropriate for testing whether an AI is  strong              
Scholars such as Antonio Lieto have argued that the current research on both AI and cognitive modelling are perfectly aligned with the weak AI hypothesis  that should not be confused with the  general  vs  narrow  AI distinction  and that the popular assumption that cognitively inspired AI systems espouse the strong AI hypothesis is ill posed and problematic since  artificial models of brain and mind can be used to understand mental phenomena without pretending that that they are the real phenomena that they are modelling               as  on the other hand  implied by the strong AI assumption
