Censorship and moderation
Main article  Censorship by TikTok
TikTok s and Douyin s censorship policies have been criticized as non transparent  Internal guidelines against the promotion of violence  separatism  and  demonization of countries  could be used to prohibit content related to the      Tiananmen Square protests and massacre  Falun Gong  human rights in Tibet  Taiwan  Chechnya  Northern Ireland  the Cambodian genocide  the      Indonesian riots  Kurdish nationalism  ethnic conflicts between blacks and whites  or between different Islamic sects  A more specific list banned criticisms against world leaders  including past and present ones from Russia  the United States  Japan  North and South Korea  India  Indonesia  and Turkey                            In       The Guardian reported that TikTok had censored videos of topics not favored by the Chinese government               That year  TikTok took down a video about human rights abuses in the Xinjiang internment camps against Uyghurs but restored it after    minutes as well as the creator s account  saying that the action was a mistake and triggered by a brief  satirical  image of Osama bin Laden in another post                            Other human rights activists have also said that their TikTok videos discussing human rights violations of the Uyghurs have been taken down              
TikTok moderators were instructed to suppress posts from  For You  recommendations if the users shown were deemed  too ugly  poor  or disabled                             The consumption of alcohol  full or partial nudity  LGBT  and intersex contents were restricted even in places where they are legal               TikTok has since apologized and instituted a ban against anti LGBTQ ideology  but censorship continues on Douyin due to regulations in China                            Douyin guidelines also forbid live broadcasting by unregistered foreigners   feudal superstition    money worship   smoking and drinking  competitive eating by the  already obese    toxic  slime   pornographic  ASMR such as ear licking  and female anchors wearing revealing clothes              
ByteDance said its early guidelines were global and aimed at reducing online harassment and divisiveness when its platforms were still growing  They have been replaced by versions customized by local teams for users in different regions               A March      study by the Citizen Lab found that TikTok did not censor searches politically but was inconclusive about whether posts are                          A      paper by the Internet Governance Project at Georgia Institute of Technology concluded that TikTok is  not exporting censorship  either directly by blocking material  or indirectly via its recommendation algorithm               
After increased scrutiny  TikTok said it is granting some outside experts access to the platform s anonymized data sets and protocols  including filters  keywords  criteria for heating  and source code                            A December      study by the Network Contagion Research Institute  NCRI  found a  strong possibility that content on TikTok is either amplified or suppressed based on its alignment with the interests of the Chinese government                According to its director  the NCRI is an independent non profit research organization funded by Rutgers University  the British government  and private donors               The New York Times commented that   a lready  there is evidence that China uses TikTok as a propaganda tool  Posts related to subjects that the Chinese government wants to suppress   like Hong Kong protests and Tibet   are strangely missing from the platform                TikTok subsequently restricted the number of hashtags that can be searched under its Creative Center  saying it was  misused to draw inaccurate conclusions                            
A historian from the Cato Institute said that there were  basic errors  in the Rutgers University study and criticized the uncritical news coverage that followed  The study compares data from before TikTok even existed to show the app has fewer hashtags about historically sensitive topics  distorting the findings                           
In August       the NCRI released a subsequent report based on user journey data from    accounts that they created across TikTok  Instagram  and YouTube                            By searching for four keywords Uyghur  Xinjiang  Tibet  and Tiananmen  the researchers found that TikTok returned a higher percentage of positive  neutral  or irrelevant content related to human rights in China  For example  more than     of results for  Tiananmen  on TikTok were considered pro China by the researchers  compared to     on Instagram and    on YouTube  In other cases  however  Instagram and YouTube showed higher rates of pro China content than TikTok  For example      of searches about  Uyghur  and  Xinjiang  on YouTube were considered positive  compared to less than     on TikTok  The researchers said this is because some YouTube accounts are linked to state actors               According to their survey  people who use TikTok more than three hours daily are significantly more positive about China s human rights record compared to those who do not use the app  TikTok pushed back against the NCRI  saying that making  accounts that interact with the app in a prescribed manner  is not the same as the experience of real users and some of the events being compared happened before TikTok existed

In September       Sky News reported that clips of Adolf Hitler s speeches with added music were attracting high levels of engagement on TikTok  Although they were removed by TikTok after the report  mixing audio remains an effective way to evade content moderation on many platforms

On   August       U S  President Donald Trump signed an order                           which would ban TikTok transactions in    days if it was not sold by ByteDance                            On    August       Trump issued another order              giving ByteDance    days to sell or spin off its U S  TikTok business               In the order  Trump said that there is  credible evidence  that leads him to believe that ByteDance  might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States               
In June       U S  President Joe Biden signed an executive order revoking the Trump administration ban on TikTok  and instead ordered the Secretary of Commerce to investigate the app to determine if it poses a threat to U S  national security               On    December       the Chief Administrative Officer of the United States House of Representatives banned TikTok from all devices managed by the House of Representatives               On    December       President Joe Biden signed the No TikTok on Government Devices Act  prohibiting the use of the app on devices owned by the federal government  with some exceptions              
On    March       the United States House of Representatives passed H R        which would ban TikTok completely unless it is divested from ByteDance               In April  the House of Representatives included a modified version of the bill in a foreign aid package which was passed by the Senate on    April       and signed the next day by Biden                                         The law was challenged in TikTok  Inc  v  Garland but upheld by the courts as constitutional  while many users signed up for an  alternative  Chinese app Xiaohongshu  known internationally as REDnote               On    January       hours before the bill went into effect  TikTok became unavailable across the country                            The next day  TikTok restored access to their service after re elected U S  President Donald Trump assured TikTok he would not enforce the law                           President Donald Trump signed an executive order on    January       delaying the enforcement of the TikTok ban by    days                            In April       President Donald Trump signed another executive order further delaying the enforcement of the TikTok ban by    days              

State level
As of February       at least     of     states have announced or enacted bans on state government agencies  employees  and contractors using TikTok on government issued devices  State bans only affect government employees and do not prohibit civilians from having or using the app on their personal devices                           

Observations
Critics say the United States itself surveils individuals abroad via tech companies under FISA laws               Data collected by TikTok and other social networks can already be purchased through other means                            Some theorize that  if passed  H R       could  embolden authoritarian censorship  of American Internet companies and affect U S  interests  reputation  and online speech               They have also labeled a potential ban on the app an assault on freedom of speech  including Republican congressmen Rand Paul and Thomas Massie                           
Observers have argued that the national security concerns raised are largely hypothetical                                         There is insufficient public evidence to show that American user data has been accessed by or shared with the PRC government                                         with some claims reportedly exaggerated               Biden himself was on TikTok as the president  while Trump has reversed his previous position               According to computer security specialist Bruce Schneier  which company owns TikTok may not matter  as Russia had interfered in the      US elections using Facebook without owning it              

Partnerships
In April       the Abu Dhabi Department of Culture and Tourism partnered with TikTok to promote tourism for the city               It came following the January      winter campaign with the United Arab Emirates Government Media Office              
In June       The New Zealand Herald reported that TikTok  working in cooperation with both New Zealand and Australian police  deleted     accounts and       videos associated with criminal gangs including the Mongrel Mob  Black Power  Killer Beez  the Comancheros  Mongols  and Rebels  TikTok had earlier drawn criticism for hosting content by organized crime groups promoting the gang lifestyle and fights  A TikTok spokesperson reiterated the platform s efforts to countering  violent  and  hateful  organizations  content and cooperating with police  New Zealand Police Commissioner Andrew Coster praised the platform for taking a  socially responsible stance  against gangs              
TikTok has partnered with the Hispanic Heritage Foundation to support small Latino businesses  setting aside       each for    grant recipients based on entrepreneurship               After digital advertising rules for the Olympics were relaxed  TikTok and Team GB signed a sponsorship deal to help UK athletes connect with new audiences for the      Summer Olympics              
Starting in       TikTok became the primary sponsor partner of the English Football League club Wrexham A F C  located in Wrexham  Wales  A large version of the TikTok logo was emblazoned on the front of the player s red coloured home and away uniforms below the Wrexham A F C  crest as well as on shirts sold by Wrexham s brick and mortar and virtual fan stores  the partnership ended in      when Wrexham was promoted to the EFL League Two after which U S  airline United took over the partnership sponsorship
