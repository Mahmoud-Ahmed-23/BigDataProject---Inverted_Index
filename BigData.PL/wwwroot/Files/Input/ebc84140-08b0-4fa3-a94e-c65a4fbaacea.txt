Philosophy   love of wisdom  in Ancient Greek  is a systematic study of general and fundamental questions concerning topics like existence  reason  knowledge  value  mind  and language  It is a rational and critical inquiry that reflects on its methods and assumptions 
Historically  many of the individual sciences  such as physics and psychology  formed part of philosophy  However  they are considered separate academic disciplines in the modern sense of the term  Influential traditions in the history of philosophy include Western  Arabic Persian  Indian  and Chinese philosophy  Western philosophy originated in Ancient Greece and covers a wide area of philosophical subfields  A central topic in Arabic Persian philosophy is the relation between reason and revelation  Indian philosophy combines the spiritual problem of how to reach enlightenment with the exploration of the nature of reality and the ways of arriving at knowledge  Chinese philosophy focuses principally on practical issues about right social conduct  government  and self cultivation 
Major branches of philosophy are epistemology  ethics  logic  and metaphysics  Epistemology studies what knowledge is and how to acquire it  Ethics investigates moral principles and what constitutes right conduct  Logic is the study of correct reasoning and explores how good arguments can be distinguished from bad ones  Metaphysics examines the most general features of reality  existence  objects  and properties  Other subfields are aesthetics  philosophy of language  philosophy of mind  philosophy of religion  philosophy of science  philosophy of mathematics  philosophy of history  and political philosophy  Within each branch  there are competing schools of philosophy that promote different principles  theories  or methods 
Philosophers use a great variety of methods to arrive at philosophical knowledge  They include conceptual analysis  reliance on common sense and intuitions  use of thought experiments  analysis of ordinary language  description of experience  and critical questioning  Philosophy is related to many other fields  including the sciences  mathematics  business  law  and journalism  It provides an interdisciplinary perspective and studies the scope and fundamental concepts of these fields  It also investigates their methods and ethical implications 


Etymology
The word philosophy comes from the Ancient Greek words        philos   love  and        sophia   wisdom                  a      Some sources say that the term was coined by the pre Socratic philosopher Pythagoras  but this is not certain            

Physics was originally part of philosophy  like Isaac Newton s observation of how gravity affects falling apples 
The word entered the English language primarily from Old French and Anglo Norman starting around      CE  The French philosophie is itself a borrowing from the Latin philosophia  The term philosophy acquired the meanings of  advanced study of the speculative subjects  logic  ethics  physics  and metaphysics     deep wisdom consisting of love of truth and virtuous living    profound learning as transmitted by the ancient writers   and  the study of the fundamental nature of knowledge  reality  and existence  and the basic limits of human understanding             
Before the modern age  the term philosophy was used in a wide sense  It included most forms of rational inquiry  such as the individual sciences  as its subdisciplines             For instance  natural philosophy was a major branch of philosophy             This branch of philosophy encompassed a wide range of fields  including disciplines like physics  chemistry  and biology             An example of this usage is the      book Philosophi  Naturalis Principia Mathematica by Isaac Newton  This book referred to natural philosophy in its title  but it is today considered a book of physics            
The meaning of philosophy changed toward the end of the modern period when it acquired the more narrow meaning common today  In this new sense  the term is mainly associated with disciplines like metaphysics  epistemology  and ethics  Among other topics  it covers the rational study of reality  knowledge  and values  It is distinguished from other disciplines of rational inquiry such as the empirical sciences and mathematics             

Conceptions of philosophy
See also  Metaphilosophy
General conception
The practice of philosophy is characterized by several general features  it is a form of rational inquiry  it aims to be systematic  and it tends to critically reflect on its own methods and presuppositions              It requires attentively thinking long and carefully about the provocative  vexing  and enduring problems central to the human condition             
The philosophical pursuit of wisdom involves asking general and fundamental questions  It often does not result in straightforward answers but may help a person to better understand the topic  examine their life  dispel confusion  and overcome prejudices and self deceptive ideas associated with common sense              For example  Socrates stated that  the unexamined life is not worth living  to highlight the role of philosophical inquiry in understanding one s own existence                          And according to Bertrand Russell   the man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense  from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation  and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the cooperation or consent of his deliberate reason              

Academic definitions
Main article  Definitions of philosophy
Attempts to provide more precise definitions of philosophy are controversial             and are studied in metaphilosophy              Some approaches argue that there is a set of essential features shared by all parts of philosophy  Others see only weaker family resemblances or contend that it is merely an empty blanket term              Precise definitions are often only accepted by theorists belonging to a certain philosophical movement and are revisionistic according to S ren Overgaard et al  in that many presumed parts of philosophy would not deserve the title  philosophy  if they were true             
Some definitions characterize philosophy in relation to its method  like pure reasoning  Others focus on its topic  for example  as the study of the biggest patterns of the world as a whole or as the attempt to answer the big questions              Such an approach is pursued by Immanuel Kant  who holds that the task of philosophy is united by four questions   What can I know     What should I do     What may I hope    and  What is the human being               Both approaches have the problem that they are usually either too wide  by including non philosophical disciplines  or too narrow  by excluding some philosophical sub disciplines             
Many definitions of philosophy emphasize its intimate relation to science              In this sense  philosophy is sometimes understood as a proper science in its own right  According to some naturalistic philosophers  such as W  V  O  Quine  philosophy is an empirical yet abstract science that is concerned with wide ranging empirical patterns instead of particular observations              Science based definitions usually face the problem of explaining why philosophy in its long history has not progressed to the same extent or in the same way as the sciences              This problem is avoided by seeing philosophy as an immature or provisional science whose subdisciplines cease to be philosophy once they have fully developed              In this sense  philosophy is sometimes described as  the midwife of the sciences              
Other definitions focus on the contrast between science and philosophy  A common theme among many such conceptions is that philosophy is concerned with meaning  understanding  or the clarification of language              According to one view  philosophy is conceptual analysis  which involves finding the necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of concepts              Another definition characterizes philosophy as thinking about thinking to emphasize its self critical  reflective nature              A further approach presents philosophy as a linguistic therapy  According to Ludwig Wittgenstein  for instance  philosophy aims at dispelling misunderstandings to which humans are susceptible due to the confusing structure of ordinary language             
Phenomenologists  such as Edmund Husserl  characterize philosophy as a  rigorous science  investigating essences              They practice a radical suspension of theoretical assumptions about reality to get back to the  things themselves   that is  as originally given in experience  They contend that this base level of experience provides the foundation for higher order theoretical knowledge  and that one needs to understand the former to understand the latter             
An early approach found in ancient Greek and Roman philosophy is that philosophy is the spiritual practice of developing one s rational capacities              This practice is an expression of the philosopher s love of wisdom and has the aim of improving one s well being by leading a reflective life              For example  the Stoics saw philosophy as an exercise to train the mind and thereby achieve eudaimonia and flourish in life             

History 
Main article  History of philosophy
As a discipline  the history of philosophy aims to provide a systematic and chronological exposition of philosophical concepts and doctrines              Some theorists see it as a part of intellectual history  but it also investigates questions not covered by intellectual history such as whether the theories of past philosophers are true and have remained philosophically relevant              The history of philosophy is primarily concerned with theories based on rational inquiry and argumentation  some historians understand it in a looser sense that includes myths  religious teachings  and proverbial lore             
Influential traditions in the history of philosophy include Western  Arabic Persian  Indian  and Chinese philosophy  Other philosophical traditions are Japanese philosophy  Latin American philosophy  and African philosophy             

Western
Main article  Western philosophy
Aristotle was a major figure in ancient philosophy and developed a comprehensive system of thought including metaphysics  logic  ethics  politics  and natural science             
Western philosophy originated in Ancient Greece in the  th century BCE with the pre Socratics  They attempted to provide rational explanations of the cosmos as a whole              The philosophy following them was shaped by Socrates          BCE   Plato          BCE   and Aristotle          BCE   They expanded the range of topics to questions like how people should act  how to arrive at knowledge  and what the nature of reality and mind is              The later part of the ancient period was marked by the emergence of philosophical movements  for example  Epicureanism  Stoicism  Skepticism  and Neoplatonism              The medieval period started in the  th century CE  Its focus was on religious topics and many thinkers used ancient philosophy to explain and further elaborate Christian doctrines                         
The Renaissance period started in the   th century and saw a renewed interest in schools of ancient philosophy  in particular Platonism  Humanism also emerged in this period              The modern period started in the   th century  One of its central concerns was how philosophical and scientific knowledge are created  Specific importance was given to the role of reason and sensory experience              Many of these innovations were used in the Enlightenment movement to challenge traditional authorities              Several attempts to develop comprehensive systems of philosophy were made in the   th century  for instance  by German idealism and Marxism              Influential developments in   th century philosophy were the emergence and application of formal logic  the focus on the role of language as well as pragmatism  and movements in continental philosophy like phenomenology  existentialism  and post structuralism              The   th century saw a rapid expansion of academic philosophy in terms of the number of philosophical publications and philosophers working at academic institutions              There was also a noticeable growth in the number of female philosophers  but they still remained underrepresented             

Arabic Persian
Main articles  Islamic philosophy and Iranian philosophy
Portrait of Avicenna  one of the most influential philosophers of the Islamic Golden Age 
Arabic Persian philosophy arose in the early  th century CE as a response to discussions in the Islamic theological tradition  Its classical period lasted until the   th century CE and was strongly influenced by ancient Greek philosophers  It employed their ideas to elaborate and interpret the teachings of the Quran             
Al Kindi          CE  is usually regarded as the first philosopher of this tradition  He translated and interpreted many works of Aristotle and Neoplatonists in his attempt to show that there is a harmony between reason and faith              Avicenna           CE  also followed this goal and developed a comprehensive philosophical system to provide a rational understanding of reality encompassing science  religion  and mysticism              Al Ghazali            CE  was a strong critic of the idea that reason can arrive at a true understanding of reality and God  He formulated a detailed critique of philosophy and tried to assign philosophy a more limited place besides the teachings of the Quran and mystical insight              Following Al Ghazali and the end of the classical period  the influence of philosophical inquiry waned              Mulla Sadra            CE  is often regarded as one of the most influential philosophers of the subsequent period              The increasing influence of Western thought and institutions in the   th and   th centuries gave rise to the intellectual movement of Islamic modernism  which aims to understand the relation between traditional Islamic beliefs and modernity             

Indian
Main article  Indian philosophy
Adi Shankara developed the monistic view of Advaita Vedanta  stating that the existence of a plurality of distinct entities is an illusion 
One of the distinguishing features of Indian philosophy is that it integrates the exploration of the nature of reality  the ways of arriving at knowledge  and the spiritual question of how to reach enlightenment              It started around     BCE when the Vedas were written  They are the foundational scriptures of Hinduism and contemplate issues concerning the relation between the self and ultimate reality as well as the question of how souls are reborn based on their past actions              This period also saw the emergence of non Vedic teachings  like Buddhism and Jainism              Buddhism was founded by Gautama Siddhartha          BCE   who challenged the Vedic idea of a permanent self and proposed a path to liberate oneself from suffering              Jainism was founded by Mahavira          BCE   who emphasized non violence as well as respect toward all forms of life             
The subsequent classical period started roughly     BCE     b      and was characterized by the emergence of the six orthodox schools of Hinduism  Ny y   Vai e ika  S  khya  Yoga  M m  s   and Vedanta              The school of Advaita Vedanta developed later in this period  It was systematized by Adi Shankara  c                CE   who held that everything is one and that the impression of a universe consisting of many distinct entities is an illusion              A slightly different perspective was defended by Ramanuja            CE       c      who founded the school of Vishishtadvaita Vedanta and argued that individual entities are real as aspects or parts of the underlying unity              He also helped to popularize the Bhakti movement  which taught devotion toward the divine as a spiritual path and lasted until the   th to   th centuries CE              The modern period began roughly      CE and was shaped by encounters with Western thought              Philosophers tried to formulate comprehensive systems to harmonize diverse philosophical and religious teachings  For example  Swami Vivekananda            CE  used the teachings of Advaita Vedanta to argue that all the different religions are valid paths toward the one divine             

Chinese
Main article  Chinese philosophy
The teachings of Confucius on ethics and society shaped subsequent Chinese philosophy 
Chinese philosophy is particularly interested in practical questions associated with right social conduct  government  and self cultivation              Many schools of thought emerged in the  th century BCE in competing attempts to resolve the political turbulence of that period  The most prominent among them were Confucianism and Daoism              Confucianism was founded by Confucius          BCE   It focused on different forms of moral virtues and explored how they lead to harmony in society              Daoism was founded by Laozi   th century BCE  and examined how humans can live in harmony with nature by following the Dao or the natural order of the universe              Other influential early schools of thought were Mohism  which developed an early form of altruistic consequentialism              and Legalism  which emphasized the importance of a strong state and strict laws             
Buddhism was introduced to China in the  st century CE and diversified into new forms of Buddhism              Starting in the  rd century CE  the school of Xuanxue emerged  It interpreted earlier Daoist works with a specific emphasis on metaphysical explanations              Neo Confucianism developed in the   th century CE  It systematized previous Confucian teachings and sought a metaphysical foundation of ethics              The modern period in Chinese philosophy began in the early   th century and was shaped by the influence of and reactions to Western philosophy  The emergence of Chinese Marxism which focused on class struggle  socialism  and communism resulted in a significant transformation of the political landscape              Another development was the emergence of New Confucianism  which aims to modernize and rethink Confucian teachings to explore their compatibility with democratic ideals and modern science             

Other traditions
Traditional Japanese philosophy assimilated and synthesized ideas from different traditions  including the indigenous Shinto religion and Chinese and Indian thought in the forms of Confucianism and Buddhism  both of which entered Japan in the  th and  th centuries  Its practice is characterized by active interaction with reality rather than disengaged examination              Neo Confucianism became an influential school of thought in the   th century and the following Edo period and prompted a greater focus on language and the natural world              The Kyoto School emerged in the   th century and integrated Eastern spirituality with Western philosophy in its exploration of concepts like absolute nothingness  zettai mu   place  basho   and the self             
Latin American philosophy in the pre colonial period was practiced by indigenous civilizations and explored questions concerning the nature of reality and the role of humans              It has similarities to indigenous North American philosophy  which covered themes such as the interconnectedness of all things              Latin American philosophy during the colonial period  starting around       was dominated by religious philosophy in the form of scholasticism  Influential topics in the post colonial period were positivism  the philosophy of liberation  and the exploration of identity and culture             
Early African philosophy was primarily conducted and transmitted orally  It focused on community  morality  and ancestral ideas  encompassing folklore  wise sayings  religious ideas  and philosophical concepts like Ubuntu              Systematic African philosophy emerged at the beginning of the   th century  It discusses topics such as ethnophilosophy  n gritude  pan Africanism  Marxism  postcolonialism  the role of cultural identity  relativism  African epistemology  and the critique of Eurocentrism             

Core branches
See also  Outline of philosophy        Branches of philosophy  and Outline of philosophy        Philosophical schools of thought
Philosophical questions can be grouped into several branches  These groupings allow philosophers to focus on a set of similar topics and interact with other thinkers who are interested in the same questions  Epistemology  ethics  logic  and metaphysics are sometimes listed as the main branches              There are many other subfields besides them and the different divisions are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive  For example  political philosophy  ethics  and aesthetics are sometimes linked under the general heading of value theory as they investigate normative or evaluative aspects              Furthermore  philosophical inquiry sometimes overlaps with other disciplines in the natural and social sciences  religion  and mathematics             

Epistemology
Main article  Epistemology
Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies knowledge  It is also known as theory of knowledge and aims to understand what knowledge is  how it arises  what its limits are  and what value it has  It further examines the nature of truth  belief  justification  and rationality              Some of the questions addressed by epistemologists include  By what method s  can one acquire knowledge     How is truth established    and  Can we prove causal relations              
Epistemology is primarily interested in declarative knowledge or knowledge of facts  like knowing that Princess Diana died in       But it also investigates practical knowledge  such as knowing how to ride a bicycle  and knowledge by acquaintance  for example  knowing a celebrity personally             
One area in epistemology is the analysis of knowledge  It assumes that declarative knowledge is a combination of different parts and attempts to identify what those parts are  An influential theory in this area claims that knowledge has three components  it is a belief that is justified and true  This theory is controversial and the difficulties associated with it are known as the Gettier problem              Alternative views state that knowledge requires additional components  like the absence of luck  different components  like the manifestation of cognitive virtues instead of justification  or they deny that knowledge can be analyzed in terms of other phenomena             
Another area in epistemology asks how people acquire knowledge  Often discussed sources of knowledge are perception  introspection  memory  inference  and testimony               According to empiricists  all knowledge is based on some form of experience  Rationalists reject this view and hold that some forms of knowledge  like innate knowledge  are not acquired through experience               The regress problem is a common issue in relation to the sources of knowledge and the justification they offer  It is based on the idea that beliefs require some kind of reason or evidence to be justified  The problem is that the source of justification may itself be in need of another source of justification  This leads to an infinite regress or circular reasoning  Foundationalists avoid this conclusion by arguing that some sources can provide justification without requiring justification themselves               Another solution is presented by coherentists  who state that a belief is justified if it coheres with other beliefs of the person              
Many discussions in epistemology touch on the topic of philosophical skepticism  which raises doubts about some or all claims to knowledge  These doubts are often based on the idea that knowledge requires absolute certainty and that humans are unable to acquire it              

Ethics
Main article  Ethics
 The utilitarian doctrine is  that happiness is desirable  and the only thing desirable  as an end  all other things being only desirable as means to that end     John Stuart Mill  Utilitarianism                    
Ethics  also known as moral philosophy  studies what constitutes right conduct  It is also concerned with the moral evaluation of character traits and institutions  It explores what the standards of morality are and how to live a good life               Philosophical ethics addresses such basic questions as  Are moral obligations relative     Which has priority  well being or obligation    and  What gives life meaning               
The main branches of ethics are meta ethics  normative ethics  and applied ethics               Meta ethics asks abstract questions about the nature and sources of morality  It analyzes the meaning of ethical concepts  like right action and obligation  It also investigates whether ethical theories can be true in an absolute sense and how to acquire knowledge of them               Normative ethics encompasses general theories of how to distinguish between right and wrong conduct  It helps guide moral decisions by examining what moral obligations and rights people have  Applied ethics studies the consequences of the general theories developed by normative ethics in specific situations  for example  in the workplace or for medical treatments              
Within contemporary normative ethics  consequentialism  deontology  and virtue ethics are influential schools of thought               Consequentialists judge actions based on their consequences  One such view is utilitarianism  which argues that actions should increase overall happiness while minimizing suffering  Deontologists judge actions based on whether they follow moral duties  such as abstaining from lying or killing  According to them  what matters is that actions are in tune with those duties and not what consequences they have  Virtue theorists judge actions based on how the moral character of the agent is expressed  According to this view  actions should conform to what an ideally virtuous agent would do by manifesting virtues like generosity and honesty              

Logic
Main article  Logic
Logic is the study of correct reasoning  It aims to understand how to distinguish good from bad arguments               It is usually divided into formal and informal logic  Formal logic uses artificial languages with a precise symbolic representation to investigate arguments  In its search for exact criteria  it examines the structure of arguments to determine whether they are correct or incorrect  Informal logic uses non formal criteria and standards to assess the correctness of arguments  It relies on additional factors such as content and context              
Logic examines a variety of arguments  Deductive arguments are mainly studied by formal logic  An argument is deductively valid if the truth of its premises ensures the truth of its conclusion  Deductively valid arguments follow a rule of inference  like modus ponens  which has the following logical form   p  if p then q  therefore q   An example is the argument  today is Sunday  if today is Sunday then I don t have to go to work today  therefore I don t have to go to work today               
The premises of non deductive arguments also support their conclusion  although this support does not guarantee that the conclusion is true               One form is inductive reasoning  It starts from a set of individual cases and uses generalization to arrive at a universal law governing all cases  An example is the inference that  all ravens are black  based on observations of many individual black ravens               Another form is abductive reasoning  It starts from an observation and concludes that the best explanation of this observation must be true  This happens  for example  when a doctor diagnoses a disease based on the observed symptoms              
Logic also investigates incorrect forms of reasoning  They are called fallacies and are divided into formal and informal fallacies based on whether the source of the error lies only in the form of the argument or also in its content and context              

Metaphysics
Main article  Metaphysics
The beginning of Aristotle s Metaphysics in an incunabulum decorated with hand painted miniatures 
Metaphysics is the study of the most general features of reality  such as existence  objects and their properties  wholes and their parts  space and time  events  and causation               There are disagreements about the precise definition of the term and its meaning has changed throughout the ages               Metaphysicians attempt to answer basic questions including  Why is there something rather than nothing     Of what does reality ultimately consist    and  Are humans free               
Metaphysics is sometimes divided into general metaphysics and specific or special metaphysics  General metaphysics investigates being as such  It examines the features that all entities have in common  Specific metaphysics is interested in different kinds of being  the features they have  and how they differ from one another              
An important area in metaphysics is ontology  Some theorists identify it with general metaphysics  Ontology investigates concepts like being  becoming  and reality  It studies the categories of being and asks what exists on the most fundamental level               Another subfield of metaphysics is philosophical cosmology  It is interested in the essence of the world as a whole  It asks questions including whether the universe has a beginning and an end and whether it was created by something else              
A key topic in metaphysics concerns the question of whether reality only consists of physical things like matter and energy  Alternative suggestions are that mental entities  such as souls and experiences  and abstract entities  such as numbers  exist apart from physical things  Another topic in metaphysics concerns the problem of identity  One question is how much an entity can change while still remaining the same entity               According to one view  entities have essential and accidental features  They can change their accidental features but they cease to be the same entity if they lose an essential feature               A central distinction in metaphysics is between particulars and universals  Universals  like the color red  can exist at different locations at the same time  This is not the case for particulars including individual persons or specific objects               Other metaphysical questions are whether the past fully determines the present and what implications this would have for the existence of free will              

Other major branches
See also  List of philosophies
There are many other subfields of philosophy besides its core branches  Some of the most prominent are aesthetics  philosophy of language  philosophy of mind  philosophy of religion  philosophy of science  and political philosophy              
Aesthetics in the philosophical sense is the field that studies the nature and appreciation of beauty and other aesthetic properties  like the sublime               Although it is often treated together with the philosophy of art  aesthetics is a broader category that encompasses other aspects of experience  such as natural beauty               In a more general sense  aesthetics is  critical reflection on art  culture  and nature                A key question in aesthetics is whether beauty is an objective feature of entities or a subjective aspect of experience               Aesthetic philosophers also investigate the nature of aesthetic experiences and judgments  Further topics include the essence of works of art and the processes involved in creating them              
The philosophy of language studies the nature and function of language  It examines the concepts of meaning  reference  and truth  It aims to answer questions such as how words are related to things and how language affects human thought and understanding  It is closely related to the disciplines of logic and linguistics               The philosophy of language rose to particular prominence in the early   th century in analytic philosophy due to the works of Frege and Russell  One of its central topics is to understand how sentences get their meaning  There are two broad theoretical camps  those emphasizing the formal truth conditions of sentences     d      and those investigating circumstances that determine when it is suitable to use a sentence  the latter of which is associated with speech act theory              
The philosophy of mind studies the nature of mental phenomena and how they are related to the physical world               It aims to understand different types of conscious and unconscious mental states  like beliefs  desires  intentions  feelings  sensations  and free will               An influential intuition in the philosophy of mind is that there is a distinction between the inner experience of objects and their existence in the external world  The mind body problem is the problem of explaining how these two types of thing mind and matter are related  The main traditional responses are materialism  which assumes that matter is more fundamental  idealism  which assumes that mind is more fundamental  and dualism  which assumes that mind and matter are distinct types of entities  In contemporary philosophy  another common view is functionalism  which understands mental states in terms of the functional or causal roles they play               The mind body problem is closely related to the hard problem of consciousness  which asks how the physical brain can produce qualitatively subjective experiences              
The philosophy of religion investigates the basic concepts  assumptions  and arguments associated with religion  It critically reflects on what religion is  how to define the divine  and whether one or more gods exist  It also includes the discussion of worldviews that reject religious doctrines               Further questions addressed by the philosophy of religion are   How are we to interpret religious language  if not literally                  Is divine omniscience compatible with free will                 and   Are the great variety of world religions in some way compatible in spite of their apparently contradictory theological claims                It includes topics from nearly all branches of philosophy               It differs from theology since theological debates typically take place within one religious tradition  whereas debates in the philosophy of religion transcend any particular set of theological assumptions              
The philosophy of science examines the fundamental concepts  assumptions  and problems associated with science  It reflects on what science is and how to distinguish it from pseudoscience  It investigates the methods employed by scientists  how their application can result in knowledge  and on what assumptions they are based  It also studies the purpose and implications of science               Some of its questions are  What counts as an adequate explanation                  Is a scientific law anything more than a description of a regularity                 and  Can some special sciences be explained entirely in the terms of a more general science                It is a vast field that is commonly divided into the philosophy of the natural sciences and the philosophy of the social sciences  with further subdivisions for each of the individual sciences under these headings  How these branches are related to one another is also a question in the philosophy of science  Many of its philosophical issues overlap with the fields of metaphysics or epistemology              
Political philosophy is the philosophical inquiry into the fundamental principles and ideas governing political systems and societies  It examines the basic concepts  assumptions  and arguments in the field of politics  It investigates the nature and purpose of government and compares its different forms               It further asks under what circumstances the use of political power is legitimate  rather than a form of simple violence               In this regard  it is concerned with the distribution of political power  social and material goods  and legal rights               Other topics are justice  liberty  equality  sovereignty  and nationalism               Political philosophy involves a general inquiry into normative matters and differs in this respect from political science  which aims to provide empirical descriptions of actually existing states               Political philosophy is often treated as a subfield of ethics               Influential schools of thought in political philosophy are liberalism  conservativism  socialism  and anarchism              

Methods
Main article  Philosophical methodology
Methods of philosophy are ways of conducting philosophical inquiry  They include techniques for arriving at philosophical knowledge and justifying philosophical claims as well as principles used for choosing between competing theories               A great variety of methods have been employed throughout the history of philosophy  Many of them differ significantly from the methods used in the natural sciences in that they do not use experimental data obtained through measuring equipment               The choice of one s method usually has important implications both for how philosophical theories are constructed and for the arguments cited for or against them               This choice is often guided by epistemological considerations about what constitutes philosophical evidence              
Methodological disagreements can cause conflicts among philosophical theories or about the answers to philosophical questions  The discovery of new methods has often had important consequences both for how philosophers conduct their research and for what claims they defend               Some philosophers engage in most of their theorizing using one particular method while others employ a wider range of methods based on which one fits the specific problem investigated best              
Conceptual analysis is a common method in analytic philosophy  It aims to clarify the meaning of concepts by analyzing them into their component parts               Another method often employed in analytic philosophy is based on common sense  It starts with commonly accepted beliefs and tries to draw unexpected conclusions from them  which it often employs in a negative sense to criticize philosophical theories that are too far removed from how the average person sees the issue               It is similar to how ordinary language philosophy approaches philosophical questions by investigating how ordinary language is used              

The trolley problem is a thought experiment that investigates the moral difference between doing and allowing harm  This issue is explored in an imaginary situation in which a person can sacrifice a single person by redirecting a trolley to save a group of people              
Various methods in philosophy give particular importance to intuitions  that is  non inferential impressions about the correctness of specific claims or general principles               For example  they play an important role in thought experiments  which employ counterfactual thinking to evaluate the possible consequences of an imagined situation  These anticipated consequences can then be used to confirm or refute philosophical theories               The method of reflective equilibrium also employs intuitions  It seeks to form a coherent position on a certain issue by examining all the relevant beliefs and intuitions  some of which often have to be deemphasized or reformulated to arrive at a coherent perspective              
Pragmatists stress the significance of concrete practical consequences for assessing whether a philosophical theory is true               According to the pragmatic maxim as formulated by Charles Sanders Peirce  the idea a person has of an object is nothing more than the totality of practical consequences they associate with this object  Pragmatists have also used this method to expose disagreements as merely verbal  that is  to show they make no genuine difference on the level of consequences              
Phenomenologists seek knowledge of the realm of appearance and the structure of human experience  They insist upon the first personal character of all experience and proceed by suspending theoretical judgments about the external world  This technique of phenomenological reduction is known as  bracketing  or epoch   The goal is to give an unbiased description of the appearance of things              
Methodological naturalism places great emphasis on the empirical approach and the resulting theories found in the natural sciences  In this way  it contrasts with methodologies that give more weight to pure reasoning and introspection              

Relation to other fields
Philosophy is closely related to many other fields  It is sometimes understood as a meta discipline that clarifies their nature and limits  It does this by critically examining their basic concepts  background assumptions  and methods  In this regard  it plays a key role in providing an interdisciplinary perspective  It bridges the gap between different disciplines by analyzing which concepts and problems they have in common  It shows how they overlap while also delimiting their scope               Historically  most of the individual sciences originated from philosophy              
The influence of philosophy is felt in several fields that require difficult practical decisions  In medicine  philosophical considerations related to bioethics affect issues like whether an embryo is already a person and under what conditions abortion is morally permissible  A closely related philosophical problem is how humans should treat other animals  for instance  whether it is acceptable to use non human animals as food or for research experiments               In relation to business and professional life  philosophy has contributed by providing ethical frameworks  They contain guidelines on which business practices are morally acceptable and cover the issue of corporate social responsibility              
Philosophical inquiry is relevant to many fields that are concerned with what to believe and how to arrive at evidence for one s beliefs               This is a key issue for the sciences  which have as one of their prime objectives the creation of scientific knowledge  Scientific knowledge is based on empirical evidence but it is often not clear whether empirical observations are neutral or already include theoretical assumptions  A closely connected problem is whether the available evidence is sufficient to decide between competing theories               Epistemological problems in relation to the law include what counts as evidence and how much evidence is required to find a person guilty of a crime  A related issue in journalism is how to ensure truth and objectivity when reporting on events              
In the fields of theology and religion  there are many doctrines associated with the existence and nature of God as well as rules governing correct behavior  A key issue is whether a rational person should believe these doctrines  for example  whether revelation in the form of holy books and religious experiences of the divine are sufficient evidence for these beliefs              

Judith Butler is one of the philosophers responsible for the cultural influence of philosophy on the feminist movement 
Philosophy in the form of logic has been influential in the fields of mathematics and computer science               Further fields influenced by philosophy include psychology  sociology  linguistics  education  and the arts               The close relation between philosophy and other fields in the contemporary period is reflected in the fact that many philosophy graduates go on to work in related fields rather than in philosophy itself              
In the field of politics  philosophy addresses issues such as how to assess whether a government policy is just               Philosophical ideas have prepared and shaped various political developments  For example  ideals formulated in Enlightenment philosophy laid the foundation for constitutional democracy and played a role in the American Revolution and the French Revolution               Marxist philosophy and its exposition of communism was one of the factors in the Russian Revolution and the Chinese Communist Revolution               In India  Mahatma Gandhi s philosophy of non violence shaped the Indian independence movement              
An example of the cultural and critical role of philosophy is found in its influence on the feminist movement through philosophers such as Mary Wollstonecraft  Simone de Beauvoir  and Judith Butler  It has shaped the understanding of key concepts in feminism  for instance  the meaning of gender  how it differs from biological sex  and what role it plays in the formation of personal identity  Philosophers have also investigated the concepts of justice and equality and their implications with respect to the prejudicial treatment of women in male dominated societies              
The idea that philosophy is useful for many aspects of life and society is sometimes rejected  According to one such view  philosophy is mainly undertaken for its own sake and does not make significant contributions to existing practices or external goals

Notes


  The Ancient Greek philosophos   philosopher   was itself possibly borrowed from the Ancient Egyptian term mer rekh  mr r   meaning  lover of wisdom             

  The exact periodization is disputed with some sources suggesting it started as early as     BCE  while others argue it began as late as     CE             

  These dates are traditionally cited but some recent scholars suggest that his life ran from      to                  

  The truth conditions of a sentence are the circumstances or states of affairs under which the sentence would be true
