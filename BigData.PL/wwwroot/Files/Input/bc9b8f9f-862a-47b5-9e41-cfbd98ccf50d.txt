In philosophy  self awareness is the awareness and reflection of one s own personality or individuality  including traits  feelings  and behaviors                        It is not to be confused with consciousness in the sense of qualia  While consciousness is being aware of one s body and environment  self awareness is the recognition of that consciousness             Self awareness is how an individual experiences and understands their own character  feelings  motives  and desires 


Biology edit 
Mirror neurons edit 
Main article  Neural basis of self
Researchers are investigating which part of the brain allows people to be self aware and how people are biologically programmed to be self aware  V S  Ramachandran speculates that mirror neurons may provide the neurological basis of human self awareness             In an essay written for Edge org in       Ramachandran gave the following explanation of his theory    T hese neurons can not only help simulate other people s behavior but can be turned  inward  as it were to create second order representations or meta representations of your own earlier brain processes  This could be the neural basis of introspection  and of the reciprocity of self awareness and other awareness  There is obviously a chicken or egg question here as to which evolved first  but    The main point is that the two co evolved  mutually enriching each other to create the mature representation of self that characterizes modern humans             

Body edit 
Bodily  self  awareness is related to proprioception and visualization             In health and medicine  body awareness refers to a person s ability to direct their focus on various internal sensations accurately  Both proprioception and interoception allow individuals to be consciously aware of multiple sensations             Proprioception allows individuals and patients to focus on sensations in their muscles and joints  posture  and balance  while interoception is used to determine sensations of the internal organs  such as fluctuating heartbeat  respiration  lung pain  or satiety  Over acute body awareness  under acute body awareness  and distorted body awareness are symptoms present in a variety of health disorders and conditions  such as obesity  anorexia nervosa  and chronic joint pain             For example  a distorted perception of satiety is present in a patient suffering from anorexia nervosa 

Psychology edit 
Self awareness has been called  arguably the most fundamental issue in psychology  from both a developmental and an evolutionary perspective             
Self awareness theory  developed by Duval and Wicklund in their      landmark book A theory of objective self awareness  states that when we focus on ourselves  we evaluate and compare our current behavior to our internal standards and values  This elicits a state of objective self awareness  We become self conscious as objective evaluators of ourselves              Self awareness should not be confused with self consciousness              Various emotional states are intensified by self awareness  However  some people may seek to increase their self awareness through these outlets     specify       People are more likely to align their behavior with their standards when they are made self aware  People are negatively affected     how       if they do not live up to their personal standards  Various environmental cues and situations induce awareness of the self  such as mirrors  an audience  or being videotaped or recorded  These cues also increase the accuracy of personal memory             
In one of Andreas Demetriou s neo Piagetian theories of cognitive development  self awareness develops systematically from birth through the life span and it is a major factor for the development of     clarification needed      general inferential processes              Self awareness about cognitive processes contributes to general intelligence on a par with     ambiguous      processing efficiency functions  such as working memory  processing speed  and reasoning             
Albert Bandura s theory of self efficacy describes  the belief in one s capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations   A person s belief in their ability to succeed sets the stage for how they think  behave  and feel  Someone with a strong self efficacy  for example  views challenges as tasks to engage in  and is not easily discouraged by setbacks  Such a person is aware of their flaws and abilities and chooses to utilize these qualities to the best of their ability  Someone with a weak sense of self efficacy evades challenges and quickly feels discouraged by setbacks  They may not be aware of these negative reactions and therefore  may not be prompted to change their attitude  This concept is central to Bandura s social cognitive theory   which emphasizes the role of observational learning  social experience  and reciprocal determinism in the development of personality                   unreliable source      

Human development edit 
Developmental stages edit 
Individuals become conscious of themselves through the development of self awareness             This particular type of self development pertains to becoming conscious of one s body and one s state of mind including thoughts  actions  ideas  feelings  and interactions with others               Self awareness does not occur suddenly through one particular behavior  it develops gradually through a succession of different behaviors all of which relate to the self               The monitoring of one s mental states is called metacognition and is considered to be an indicator that there is some concept of the self              
According to Philippe Rochat  there are five levels of self awareness that unfold in early human development and six potential prospects ranging from  Level     having no self awareness  advancing complexity to  Level     explicit self awareness             

Level   Confusion  The person is unaware of any mirror reflection or the mirroring itself  they perceive a mirror image as an extension of their environment 
Level   Differentiation  The individual realizes the mirror is able to reflect things  They see that what is in the mirror is of a different nature from what is surrounding them  At this level they can differentiate between their own movement in the mirror and the movement of the surrounding environment 
Level   Situation  The individual can link the movements on the mirror to what is perceived within their own body 
Level   Identification  An individual can now see that what s in the mirror is not another person but actually them 
Level   Permanence  The individual is able to identify the self in previous pictures looking different or younger  A  permanent self  is now experienced 
Level   Self consciousness or  meta  self awareness  At this level not only is the self seen from a first person view but it is realized that it is also seen from a third person s view  A person who develops self consciousness begins to understand they can be in the mind of others  for instance  how they are seen from a public standpoint 
Infancy and early childhood edit 
When a human infant comes into the world  they have no concept of what is around them  nor the significance of others around them                                   At first  the infant cannot recognize its own face                                    At only a few months old  infants know the relationship between the proprioceptive and visual information they receive              This is called  first person self awareness   
By the time an average toddler reaches       months  they discover themselves and recognize their own reflection in the mirror                          however the exact age varies with differing socioeconomic levels and differences relating to culture and parenting              Those who reach this level of awareness recognize that they see themselves  for instance  seeing dirt on their face in the reflection and then touching their face to wipe it off  Soon after toddlers become reflectively self aware  they begin to recognize their bodies as physical objects in time and space that interact and impact other objects  For instance  a toddler placed on a blanket  when asked to hand someone the blanket  will recognize that they need to get off it to be able to lift it              This is the final stage of body self awareness and is called objective self awareness 
By    months of age  an infant can communicate their name to others  and upon being shown a picture they are in  they can identify themselves  By two years old  they also usually acquire gender category and age categories  saying things such as  I am a girl  not a boy  and  I am a baby or child  not a grownup   As an infant moves to middle childhood and onwards to adolescence  they develop more advanced levels of self awareness and self description              By the age of    months  the toddler will observe and relate their own actions to actions of other people and the surrounding environment             
As a preschooler  they begin to give much more specific details about things  instead of generalizing  At this age      specify      the child is in what Jean Piaget names the pre operational stage of development  The infant is very inaccurate at judging themselves  For example  an infant at this stage will not associate that they are strong with their ability to cross the jungle gym at their school  nor will they associate the fact that they can solve a math problem with their ability to count             
Around school age  a child s awareness of their memory transitions into a sense of their self  At this stage  a child begins to develop interests  likes  and dislikes  This transition enables a person s awareness of their past  present  and future to grow as they remember their conscious experiences more often              

Adolescence edit 
One becomes conscious of one s emotions during adolescence  Most children are aware of emotions such as shame  guilt  pride  and embarrassment by the age of two  but do not fully understand how those emotions affect their life                  page      needed      By age     children become more in touch with these emotions and begin to apply them to their lives  Many adolescents display happiness and self confidence around friends  but hopelessness and anger around parents due to the fear of being a disappointment  Teenagers may feel intelligent and creative around teachers  while they may feel shy  uncomfortable  and nervous around people they are not familiar with             
As children reach adolescence  their acute sense of emotion has widened into a meta cognitive state in which mental health issues can become more prevalent due to heightened emotional and social development              Self awareness training may reduce anger management issues and reduce aggressive tendencies in adolescents             
In adolescent development  self awareness has a more complex emotional context than in the early childhood phase  Elements can include self image  self concept  and self consciousness among other traits that relate to Rochat s final level of self awareness  however self awareness remains a distinct concept             

Measurement edit 
There are two common methods used to measure how severe an individual s lack of self awareness is  The Patient Competency Rating Scale  PCRS  evaluates self awareness in patients who have endured a traumatic brain injury              PCRS is a    item self report instrument which asks the subject to use a   point Likert scale to rate his or her degree of difficulty in a variety of tasks and functions  Independently  relatives or significant others who know the patient well are also asked to rate the patient on each of the same behavioral items  The difference between the relatives  and patient s perceptions is considered an indirect measure of impaired self awareness  The limitations of this experiment rest on the answers of the relatives  Results of their answers can lead to a bias  In addition  in terms of treatment effectiveness  this experimental method works better for individuals with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury  but less effectively for those with mild brain injury  This is because  although individuals with mild brain injury fall within the normal range in psychological test results  they may still experience cognitive difficulties  Therefore  these everyday difficulties are more apparent in subjective assessments and behavioral observations              These two limitations prompted a second method of testing a patient s self awareness  Simply asking a patient why they are in the hospital or what is wrong with their body can give compelling answers as to what they see and are analyzing             

Disorders edit 
Anosognosia edit 
Main article  Anosognosia
The medical term for not being aware of one s deficits is anosognosia  or more commonly known as a lack of insight  Having a lack of awareness raises the risks of treatment and service nonadherence              A wide variety of disorders are associated with anosognosia  For example  patients who are blind from cortical lesions might in fact be unaware that they are blind and may state that they do not suffer from any visual disturbances  Individuals with aphasia may be unaware of certain speech errors              Individuals who suffer from Alzheimer s disease lack awareness  this deficiency becomes more intense throughout their disease              A key issue with this disorder is that people who do have anosognosia and suffer from certain illnesses may not be aware of them  which ultimately leads them to put themselves in dangerous positions             

Autism spectrum disorder edit 
Major brain structures implicated in autism
A      study suggested that self awareness in autistic individuals is primarily lacking in social situations  but when in private they are more self aware and present  It is in the company of others while engaging in interpersonal interaction that the self awareness mechanism seems to fail              Higher functioning individuals on the autism spectrum disorder scale have reported that they are more self aware when alone unless they are in sensory overload or immediately following social exposure              Self awareness dissipates when an autistic is faced with a demanding social situation  possibly due to the behavioral inhibitory system which is responsible for self preservation              A      study of individuals with Asperger syndrome  demonstrated impairment in the  self as object  and  self as subject  domains of the Self understanding Interview              

Schizophrenia edit 
Schizophrenia as a disease state is characterized by severe cognitive dysfunction and it is uncertain to what extent patients are aware of this deficiency  Medalia and Lim        investigated patients  awareness of their cognitive deficit in the areas of attention  nonverbal memory  and verbal memory              Results from this study  N      revealed large discrepancy in patients  assessment of their cognitive functioning relative to the assessment of their clinicians  Though it is impossible to access one s consciousness and truly understand what a schizophrenic believes  regardless in this study  patients were not aware of their cognitive dysfunctional reasoning  
A      study suggests a correlation exists between patient insight  compliance  and disease progression  Patients with poor insight are less likely to be compliant with treatment and are more likely to have a poorer prognosis  Patients with hallucinations sometimes experience positive symptoms  which can include delusions of reference  thought insertion withdrawal  thought broadcast  delusions of persecution  and grandiosity             

Non human animals edit 
Main article  Animal consciousness
The mirror test is a simple measure of self awareness  Mirror tests  have been done on chimpanzees  elephants  dolphins and magpies  During the test  the experimenter looks for the animals to undergo four stages             
social response  behaving toward the reflection as they would toward another animal of their species 
physical mirror inspection
repetitive mirror testing behavior  and
the mark test  which involves the animals spontaneously touching a mark on their body that would have been difficult to see without the mirror
The red spot technique  created by Gordon G  Gallup              studies self awareness in primates  This technique places a red odorless spot on an anesthetized primate s forehead  The spot is placed on the forehead so it can only be seen through a mirror  Once the primate awakens  its independent movements toward the spot after it sees its reflection in a mirror are observed 
David DeGrazia identifies three types of self awareness which animals may share with humans  Bodily self awareness allows animals to understand that they are different from the rest of the environment  It explains why animals do not eat themselves  Bodily awareness also includes proprioception and sensation  Social self awareness  seen in highly social animals  allows animals to interact with each other  Introspective self awareness is how animals might sense feelings  desires  and beliefs              

Apes edit 
Chimpanzees and other apes extensively studied species are most similar to humans  with the most convincing findings and straightforward evidence of self awareness in animals              During the red spot technique  after looking in the mirror  chimpanzees used their fingers to touch the red dot on their forehead and  after touching the red dot they would smell their fingertips               Animals that can recognize themselves in mirrors can conceive of themselves   says Gallup 

Dolphins edit 
Dolphins were put to a similar test and achieved the same results  Diana Reiss  a psycho biologist at the New York Aquarium discovered that bottlenose dolphins can recognize themselves in mirrors             

Elephants edit 
In a      study  one elephant out of three passed the mirror test             

Magpies edit 
Researchers also used the mark or mirror tests to study the magpie s self awareness              As a majority of birds are blind below the beak  Prior et al  marked the birds  neck with three different colors  red  yellow  and black  as an imitation  as magpies are originally black   When placed in front of a mirror  the birds with red and yellow spots began scratching at their necks  signaling the understanding of something different being on their bodies  During one trial with a mirror and a mark  three of the five magpies showed at least one example of self directed behavior  The magpies explored the mirror by moving toward it and looking behind it  One of the magpies  Harvey  during several trials would pick up objects  pose  do some wing flapping  all in front of the mirror with the objects in his beak  This represents a sense of self awareness  knowing what is going on within himself and in the present  The authors suggest that self recognition in birds and mammals may be a case of convergent evolution  where similar evolutionary pressures result in similar behaviors or traits  although they arrive at them via different routes             
A few slight occurrences of behavior towards the magpie s own body happened in the trial with the black mark and the mirror  The authors of this study suggest that the black mark may have been slightly visible on the black feathers   This is an indirect support for the interpretation that the behavior towards the mark region was elicited by seeing the own body in the mirror in conjunction with an unusual spot on the body              
There was a clear contrast between the behaviors of the magpies when a mirror was present versus absent  In the no mirror trials  a non reflective gray plate was swapped in the same size and position as the mirror  There were not any mark directed self behaviors when the mark was present  in color or in black              The results show that magpies understand that a mirror image represents their own body  magpies have self awareness 

Other uses edit 
Plants edit 
Self discrimination in plants is found within their roots  tendrils and flowers that avoid themselves but not others in their environment             

Science fiction edit 
In science fiction  self awareness describes an essential human property that often  depending on the circumstances of the story  bestows personhood onto a non human  If a computer  alien or other object is described as  self aware   the reader may assume that it will be treated as a completely human character  with similar rights  capabilities and desires to a normal human being              The words  sentience    sapience  and  consciousness  are used in similar ways in science fiction 

Collective self awareness edit 
Alongside self awareness seen as a personal capability  the same term may be applied to the self awareness of groups or organisations  Steffens et al  note the  importance of both personal and collective dimensions of selfhood  when looking at leadership              Pope Paul VI  in his first encyclical letter  Ecclesiam Suam         refers to  an increased self awareness on the part of the  Catholic  Church  as a fundamental requirement to ensure the church survived with a clear mission in the face of the changing secular context in which it operated             

Robotics edit 
Main article  Artificial consciousness
It has been proposed that robots which use internal models to simulate their own actions could be classified as functionally self aware  This definition does not concern itself with the philosophical question of whether these robots really are self aware
