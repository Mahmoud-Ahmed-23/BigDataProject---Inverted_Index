History
Main article  History of Apple Inc 
           Founding and incorporation
In       Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak co founded Apple in Jobs s parents  home on Crist Drive in Los Altos  California             Wozniak called the popular belief that the company was founded in the garage  a bit of a myth              although they moved some operations to the garage when the bedroom became too crowded             
The Apple I is Apple s first product  designed by Wozniak and sold as an assembled circuit board without the required keyboard  monitor  power supply  and the optional case 
Apple Computer Company was founded on April          by Steve Jobs  Steve Wozniak  and Ronald Wayne as a partnership                         The company s first product is the Apple I  a computer designed and hand built entirely by Wozniak              To finance its creation  Jobs sold his Volkswagen Bus  and Wozniak sold his HP    calculator                                   Neither received the full selling price but in total earned             equivalent to        in        Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July                   The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU  RAM  and basic textual video chips a base kit concept which was not yet marketed as a complete personal computer              It was priced soon after debut for              equivalent to        in                                                      Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number      and that he came up with the price because he liked  repeating digits              
Apple Computer  Inc  was incorporated in Cupertino  California             on January                                  without Wayne  who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for      only twelve days after having co founded it              Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of               equivalent to            in       to Jobs and Wozniak during the incorporation of Apple              During the first five years of operations  revenues grew exponentially  doubling about every four months  Between September      and September       yearly sales grew from          to US          million  an average annual growth rate of                  
The Apple II  also designed by Wozniak  was introduced on April           at the first West Coast Computer Faire              It differs from its major rivals  the TRS    and Commodore PET  because of its character cell based color graphics and open architecture  The Apple I and early Apple II models use ordinary audio cassette tapes as storage devices  which were superseded by the             inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II in                              

The Apple II  introduced in      and designed primarily by Wozniak  was the company s first major success 
The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first killer application of the business world  VisiCalc  a spreadsheet program released in                   VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II  compatibility with the office              but Apple II market share remained behind home computers made by competitors such as Atari  Commodore  and Tandy                         
On December           Apple went public with an initial public offering  IPO  on the fully electronic NASDAQ Stock Market  selling     million shares at     per share       per share when adjusting for stock splits as of September                      update                    generating over           million  which was more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in                   By the end of the day  around          millionaires were created  including Jobs and Wozniak  from a stock price of     per share             and a market cap of             billion                         

           Success with Macintosh

Steve Jobs in      with the Macintosh  the first mass market personal computer to feature an integral graphical user interface and mouse
In December       Steve Jobs and Apple employees  including Jef Raskin  visited Xerox PARC  where they observed the Xerox Alto  featuring a graphical user interface  GUI   Apple subsequently negotiated access to PARC s technology  leading to Apple s option to buy shares at a preferential rate  This visit influenced Jobs to implement a GUI in Apple s products  starting with the Apple Lisa  Despite being pioneering as a mass marketed GUI computer  the Lisa suffered from high costs and limited software options  leading to commercial failure 
Jobs  angered by being pushed off the Lisa team  took over the company s Macintosh division  Wozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as a low cost computer with a text based interface like the Apple II  but a plane crash in      forced Wozniak to step back from the project  Jobs quickly redefined the Macintosh as a graphical system that would be cheaper than the Lisa  undercutting his former division              Jobs was also hostile to the Apple II division  which at the time  generated most of the company s revenue             
In       Apple launched the Macintosh  the first personal computer without a bundled programming language              Its debut was signified by         a US          million television advertisement directed by Ridley Scott that aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January                       This was hailed as a watershed event for Apple s success             and was called a  masterpiece  by CNN             and one of the greatest TV advertisements of all time by TV Guide             
The advertisement created great interest in Macintosh  and sales were initially good  but began to taper off dramatically after the first three months as reviews started to come in  Jobs had required     kilobytes of RAM  which limited its speed and software in favor of aspiring for a projected price point of             equivalent to        in        The Macintosh shipped for             equivalent to        in        a price panned by critics due to its slow performance                                    In early       this sales slump triggered a power struggle between Steve Jobs and CEO John Sculley  who had been hired away from Pepsi two years earlier by Jobs             saying   Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world               Sculley removed Jobs as the head of the Macintosh division  with unanimous support from the Apple board of directors             
The board of directors instructed Sculley to contain Jobs and his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products  Rather than submit to Sculley s direction  Jobs attempted to oust him from leadership              Jean Louis Gass e informed Sculley that Jobs had been attempting to organize a boardroom coup and called an emergency meeting at which Apple s executive staff sided with Sculley and stripped Jobs of all operational duties              Jobs resigned from Apple in September      and took several Apple employees with him to found NeXT              Wozniak had also quit his active employment at Apple earlier in      to pursue other ventures  expressing his frustration with Apple s treatment of the Apple II division and stating that the company had  been going in the wrong direction for the last five years                                       Wozniak remained employed by Apple as a representative              receiving a stipend estimated to be          per year              Jobs and Wozniak remained Apple shareholders following their departures             
After the departures of Jobs and Wozniak in       Sculley launched the Macintosh    K that year with quadruple the RAM  and introduced the LaserWriter  the first reasonably priced PostScript laser printer  PageMaker  an early desktop publishing application taking advantage of the PostScript language  was also released by Aldus Corporation in July                   It has been suggested that the combination of Macintosh  LaserWriter  and PageMaker was responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market             
This dominant position in the desktop publishing market             allowed the company to focus on higher price points  the so called  high right policy  named for the position on a chart of price vs  profits  Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin  and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in speed  Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market  the high right policy was in full force by the mid     s  due to Jean Louis Gass e s slogan of  fifty five or die   referring to the     profit margins of the Macintosh II                                     
This policy began to backfire late in the decade as desktop publishing programs appeared on IBM PC compatibles with some of the same functionality of the Macintosh at far lower price points  The company lost its dominant position in the desktop publishing market and estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford Apple products  The Christmas season of      was the first in the company s history to have declining sales  which led to a     drop in Apple s stock price                                        During this period  the relationship between Sculley and Gass e deteriorated  leading Sculley to effectively demote Gass e in January      by appointing Michael Spindler as the chief operating officer              Gass e left the company later that year to set up a rival  Be Inc             

           Decline and restructuring
Macintosh LC II
The company pivoted strategy and  in October       introduced three lower cost models  the Macintosh Classic  the Macintosh LC  and the Macintosh IIsi  all of which generated significant sales due to pent up demand              In       Apple introduced the hugely successful PowerBook with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops  The same year  Apple introduced System    a major upgrade to the Macintosh operating system  adding color to the interface and introducing new networking capabilities 

The success of the lower cost Macs and PowerBook brought increasing revenue              For some time  Apple was doing very well  introducing fresh new products at increasing profits  The magazine MacAddict named the period between      and      as the  first golden age  of the Macintosh             The PenLite is Apple s first tablet computer prototype  created in      to bring the Mac OS to a tablet  It was canceled in favor of the Newton             
The success of lower cost consumer Macs  especially the LC  cannibalized higher priced machines  To address this  management introduced several new brands  selling largely identical machines at different price points  for different markets  the high end Quadra series  the mid range Centris series  and the consumer marketed Performa series  This led to significant consumer confusion between so many models             
In       the Apple II series was discontinued  It was expensive to produce  and the company decided it was still absorbing sales from lower cost Macintosh models  After the launch of the LC  Apple encouraged developers to create applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II  and authorized salespersons to redirect consumers from Apple II and toward Macintosh              The Apple IIe was discontinued in                  
Apple experimented with several other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the     s  including QuickTake digital cameras  PowerCD portable CD audio players  speakers  the Pippin video game console  the eWorld online service  and Apple Interactive Television Box  Enormous resources were invested in the problematic Newton tablet division  based on John Sculley s unrealistic market forecasts             
Throughout this period  Microsoft continued to gain market share with Windows by focusing on delivering software to inexpensive personal computers  while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience              Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response  it sued Microsoft for making a GUI similar to the Lisa in Apple Computer  Inc  v  Microsoft Corp              The lawsuit dragged on for years and was finally dismissed  The major product flops and the rapid loss of market share to Windows sullied Apple s reputation  and in      Sculley was replaced as CEO by Michael Spindler             

The Power Macintosh       introduced in       was Apple s first new home computer model after the switch to PowerPC processors 
Under Spindler  Apple  IBM  and Motorola formed the AIM alliance in      to create a new computing platform  the PowerPC Reference Platform or PReP   with IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software  The AIM alliance hoped that PReP s performance and Apple s software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter the dominance of Windows  That year  Apple introduced the Power Macintosh  the first of many computers with Motorola s PowerPC processor             
In the wake of the alliance  Apple opened up to the idea of allowing Motorola and other companies to build Macintosh clones  Over the next two years     distinct Macintosh clone models were introduced  However  by       Apple executives were worried that the clones were cannibalizing sales of its own high end computers  where profit margins were highest             
In       Spindler was replaced as CEO by Gil Amelio  who was hired for his reputation as a corporate rehabilitator  Amelio made deep changes  including extensive layoffs and cost cutting             
This period was also marked by numerous failed attempts to modernize the Macintosh operating system  MacOS   The original Macintosh operating system  System    was not built for multitasking  running several applications at once   The company attempted to correct this by introducing cooperative multitasking in System    but still decided it needed a more modern approach              This led to the Pink project in       A UX that same year  Copland in       and evaluated the purchase of BeOS in       Talks with Be stalled when the CEO  former Apple executive Jean Louis Gass e  demanded           million in contrast to Apple s           million offer              Only weeks away from bankruptcy              Apple s board preferred NeXTSTEP and purchased NeXT in late      for           million  retaining Steve Jobs             

           Return to profitability
The NeXT acquisition was finalized on February                      and the board brought Jobs back to Apple as an advisor  On July          Jobs staged a boardroom coup that resulted in Amelio s resignation after overseeing a three year record low stock price and crippling financial losses  The board named Jobs as interim CEO and he immediately reviewed the product lineup  Jobs canceled     of models  ending       jobs and paring to the core of its computer offerings             
The next month  in August       Steve Jobs convinced Microsoft to make a           million investment in Apple and a commitment to continue developing Mac software              This was seen as an  antitrust insurance policy  for Microsoft which had recently settled with the Department of Justice over anti competitive practices in the United States v  Microsoft Corp  case              Around then  Jobs donated Apple s internal library and archives to Stanford University  to focus more on the present and the future rather than the past                          He ended the Mac clone deals and in September       purchased the largest clone maker  Power Computing              On November           the Apple Store website launched  which was tied to a new build to order manufacturing model similar to PC manufacturer Dell s success              The moves paid off for Jobs  at the end of his first year as CEO  the company had a           million profit             

iMaciBookPower Macintosh G PowerBook G 
On May          Apple introduced a new all in one computer reminiscent of the original Macintosh  the iMac  The iMac was a huge success  with         units sold in its first five months              and ushered in major shifts in the industry by abandoning legacy technologies like the             inch diskette  being an early adopter of the USB connector  and coming pre installed with Internet connectivity  the  i  in iMac              via Ethernet and a dial up modem  Its striking teardrop shape and translucent materials were designed by Jonathan Ive  who had been hired by Amelio  and who collaborated with Jobs for more than a decade to reshape Apple s product design                         
A little more than a year later on July           Apple introduced the iBook consumer laptop  It culminated Jobs s strategy to produce only four products  refined versions of the Power Macintosh G  desktop and PowerBook G  laptop for professionals  and the iMac desktop and iBook laptop for consumers  Jobs said the small product line allowed for a greater focus on quality and innovation             
Around then  Apple also completed numerous acquisitions to create a portfolio of digital media production software for both professionals and consumers  Apple acquired Macromedia s Key Grip digital video editing software project which was launched as Final Cut Pro in April                   Key Grip s development also led to Apple s release of the consumer video editing product iMovie in October                   Apple acquired the German company Astarte in April       which had developed the DVD authoring software DVDirector  which Apple repackaged as the professional oriented DVD Studio Pro  and reused its technology to create iDVD for the consumer market              In       Apple purchased the SoundJam MP audio player software from Casady  amp  Greene  Apple renamed the program iTunes  and simplified the user interface and added CD burning             

In       Apple changed course with three announcements  First  on March           Apple announced the release of a new modern operating system  Mac OS X  This was after numerous failed attempts in the early     s  and several years of development  Mac OS X is based on NeXTSTEP  OpenStep  and BSD Unix  to combine the stability  reliability  and security of Unix with the ease of use of an overhauled user interface  Second  in May       the first two Apple Store retail locations opened in Virginia and California  offering an improved presentation of the company s products                                      At the time  many speculated that the stores would fail  but they became highly successful  and the first of more than     stores around the world                         Third  on October           the iPod portable digital audio player debuted  The product was first sold on November           and was extremely successful  with over          million units sold within six years             The iTunes Store was highly successful in shaping the legal music downloading industry  chart shows the number of songs sold from      to      
In       the iTunes Store was introduced with music downloads for     a song and iPod integration  It quickly became the market leader in online music services  with over        billion downloads by June                       Two years later  the iTunes Store was the world s largest music retailer             
In       Apple purchased Nothing Real for its advanced digital compositing application Shake              and Emagic for the music productivity application Logic  The purchase of Emagic made Apple the first computer manufacturer to own a music software company  The acquisition was followed by the development of Apple s consumer level GarageBand application              The release of iPhoto that year completed the iLife suite             

The MacBook Pro is Apple s first laptop with an Intel microprocessor  introduced in      
At the Worldwide Developers Conference keynote address on June          Jobs announced that Apple would move away from PowerPC processors  and the Mac would transition to Intel processors in                   On January           the new MacBook Pro and iMac became the first Apple computers to use Intel s Core Duo CPU  By August          Apple made the transition to Intel chips for the entire Mac product line over one year sooner than announced              The Power Mac  iBook  and PowerBook brands were retired during the transition  the Mac Pro  MacBook  and MacBook Pro became their respective successors              Apple also introduced Boot Camp in      to help users install Windows XP or Windows Vista on their Intel Macs alongside Mac OS X             
Apple s success during this period was evident in its stock price  Between early      and       the price of Apple s stock increased more than tenfold  from around    per share  split adjusted  to over                   When Apple surpassed Dell s market cap in January                    Jobs sent an email to Apple employees saying Dell s CEO Michael Dell should eat his words               Nine years prior  Dell had said that if he ran Apple he would  shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders               

           Success with mobile devices
The newly announced first generation iPhone was on display at the      MacWorld Expo 
During his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January          Jobs announced the renaming of Apple Computer  Inc  to Apple Inc   because the company had broadened its focus from computers to consumer electronics               This event also saw the announcement of the iPhone              and the Apple TV               The company sold         first generation iPhones during the first    hours of sales               and the device was called  a game changer for the industry               
In an article posted on Apple s website on February          Jobs wrote that Apple would be willing to sell music on the iTunes Store without digital rights management  thereby allowing tracks to be played on third party players if record labels would agree to drop the technology               On April          Apple and EMI jointly announced the removal of DRM technology from EMI s catalog in the iTunes Store  effective in May                    Other record labels eventually followed suit and Apple published a press release in January      to announce that all songs on the iTunes Store are available without their FairPlay DRM

However  Apple has aided law enforcement in criminal investigations by providing iCloud backups of users  devices               and the company s commitment to privacy has been questioned by its efforts to promote biometric authentication technology in its newer     when       iPhone models  which do not have the same level of constitutional privacy as a passcode in the United States              
With Apple s release of an update to iOS     Apple required all developers of iPhone  iPad  and iPod Touch applications to directly ask iPhone users permission to track them  The feature  called  App Tracking Transparency   received heavy criticism from Facebook  whose primary business model revolves around the tracking of users  data and sharing such data with advertisers so users can see more relevant ads  a technique commonly known as targeted advertising  After Facebook s measures  including purchasing full page newspaper advertisements protesting App Tracking Transparency  Apple released the update in early       A study by Verizon subsidiary Flurry Analytics reported only    of iOS users in the United States and     worldwide have opted into tracking              
Prior to the release of iOS     Apple announced new efforts at combating child sexual abuse material on iOS and Mac platforms  Parents of minor iMessage users can now be alerted if their child sends or receives nude photographs  Additionally  on device hashing would take place on media destined for upload to iCloud  and hashes would be compared to a list of known abusive images provided by law enforcement  if enough matches were found  Apple would be alerted and authorities informed  The new features received praise from law enforcement and victims rights advocates  However  privacy advocates  including the Electronic Frontier Foundation  condemned the new features as invasive and highly prone to abuse by authoritarian governments              
Ireland s Data Protection Commission launched a privacy investigation to examine whether Apple complied with the EU s GDPR law following an investigation into how the company processes personal data with targeted ads on its platform              
In December       security researcher Brian Krebs discovered that the iPhone    Pro would still show the arrow indicator  signifying location services are being used  at the top of the screen while the main location services toggle is enabled  despite all individual location services being disabled  Krebs was unable to replicate this behavior on older models and when asking Apple for comment  he was told by Apple that  It is expected behavior that the Location Services icon appears in the status bar when Location Services is enabled  The icon appears for system services that do not have a switch in Settings               
Apple later further clarified that this behavior was to ensure compliance with ultra wideband regulations in specific countries  a technology Apple started implementing in iPhones starting with iPhone    Pro  and emphasized that  the management of ultra wideband compliance and its use of location data is done entirely on the device and Apple is not collecting user location data   Will Strafach  an executive at security firm Guardian Firewall  confirmed the lack of evidence that location data was sent off to a remote server  Apple promised to add a new toggle for this feature and in later iOS revisions Apple provided users with the option to tap on the location services indicator in Control Center to see which specific service is using the device s location                           
According to published reports by Bloomberg News on March           Apple turned over data such as phone numbers  physical addresses  and IP addresses to hackers posing as law enforcement officials using forged documents  The law enforcement requests sometimes included forged signatures of real or fictional officials  When asked about the allegations  an Apple representative referred the reporter to a section of the company policy for law enforcement guidelines  which stated   We review every data request for legal sufficiency and use advanced systems and processes to validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse

Corporate culture
Co founder Steve Wozniak and Macintosh engineer Andy Hertzfeld attended the Apple User Group Connection club in      
These universities produced the most alumni who became Apple employees 
Apple is one of several highly successful companies founded in the     s that bucked the traditional notions of corporate culture  Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune     company  By the time of the        television advertisement  Apple s informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors               According to a      report in Fortune  this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation               In a      interview  Wozniak credited watching Star Trek and attending Star Trek conventions in his youth as inspiration for co founding Apple              
As the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives  some media have suggested that it has lost some of its original character                                                      Nonetheless  it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers  particularly after Jobs returned               Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobs s involvement often took longer than others              
The Apple Fellows program awards employees for extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing  Recipients include Bill Atkinson               Steve Capps               Rod Holt               Alan Kay                            Guy Kawasaki                            Al Alcorn               Don Norman               Rich Page               Steve Wozniak               and Phil Schiller              
Jobs intended that employees were to be specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise  For instance  Ron Johnson Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November         was responsible for site selection  in store service  and store layout  yet had no control of the inventory in his stores  This was done by Tim Cook  who had a background in supply chain management               Apple is known for strictly enforcing accountability  Each project has a  directly responsible individual  or  DRI  in Apple jargon                            Unlike other major U S  companies  Apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other CEOs like country club fees or private use of company aircraft  The company typically grants stock options to executives every other year              
In       Apple had              full time employees  This increased to              full time employees the next year  a notable hiring decrease  largely due to its first revenue decline  Apple does not specify how many of its employees work in retail  though its      SEC filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base               In September       Apple announced that it had over         full time employees              
Apple has a strong culture of corporate secrecy  and has an anti leak Global Security team that recruits from the National Security Agency  the Federal Bureau of Investigation  and the United States Secret Service               In December       Glassdoor said Apple was the   th best place to work  having originally entered at rank    in       peaking at rank    in       and falling down the ranks in subsequent years               In       Bloomberg     s Mark Gurman revealed the existence of Apple s Exploratory Design Group  XDG   which was working to add glucose monitoring to the Apple Watch  Gurman compared XDG to Alphabet s X  moonshot factory

Taxes
Apple has created subsidiaries in low tax places such as Ireland  the Netherlands  Luxembourg  and the British Virgin Islands to cut the taxes it pays around the world  According to The New York Times  in the     s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low tax subsidiaries on other continents  sidestepping income taxes  In the late     s  Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the  Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich   which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean                           
British Conservative Party Member of Parliament Charlie Elphicke published research on October                        which showed that some multinational companies  including Apple Inc   were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK  but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only   percent  well below standard corporate tax rates  He followed this research by calling on the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to force these multinationals  which also included Google and The Coca Cola Company  to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues  Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax

Energy and resources
In       Climate Counts  a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies  gave Apple a score of    points out of a possible      which puts Apple in their top category  Striding                This was an increase from May       when Climate Counts only gave Apple    points out of      which placed the company last among electronics companies  at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a  stuck icon   adding that Apple at the time was  a choice to avoid for the climate conscious consumer               
Following a Greenpeace protest  Apple released a statement on April           committing to ending its use of coal and shifting to      renewable clean energy                            By       Apple was using      renewable energy to power their data centers  Overall      of the company s power came from clean renewable sources              
In May       Greenpeace evaluated the state of the Green Internet and commended Apple on their environmental practices saying   Apple s commitment to renewable energy has helped set a new bar for the industry  illustrating in very concrete terms that a      renewable Internet is within its reach  and providing several models of intervention for other companies that want to build a sustainable Internet               
As of          update       Apple states that      of its U S  operations run on renewable energy       of Apple s data centers run on renewable energy and     of Apple s global operations run on renewable energy               However  the facilities are connected to the local grid which usually contains a mix of fossil and renewable sources  so Apple carbon offsets its electricity use               The Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool  EPEAT  allows consumers to see the effect a product has on the environment  Each product receives a Gold  Silver  or Bronze rank depending on its efficiency and sustainability  Every Apple tablet  notebook  desktop computer  and display that EPEAT ranks achieves a Gold rating  the highest possible  Although Apple s data centers recycle water    times               the increased activity in retail  corporate and data centers also increase the amount of water use to          million      US      gal           million      m   in

Apple announced on August           that Lens Technology  one of its major suppliers in China  has committed to power all its glass production for Apple with     percent renewable energy by       The commitment is a large step in Apple s efforts to help manufacturers lower their carbon footprint in China               Apple also announced that all    of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL s Zero Waste to Landfill validation  The standard  which started in January       certifies that all manufacturing waste is reused  recycled  composted  or converted into energy  when necessary   Since the program began  nearly         metric tons of waste have been diverted from landfills              
On July           Apple announced its plan to become carbon neutral across its entire business  manufacturing supply chain  and product life cycle by       In the next    years  Apple will try to lower emissions with a series of innovative actions  including  low carbon product design  expanding energy efficiency  renewable energy  process and material innovations  and carbon removal              
In June       the United States Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  published a report about an electronic computer manufacturing facility leased by Apple in      in Santa Clara  California  code named Aria                            The EPA report stated that Apple was potentially in violation of federal regulations under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act  RCRA                According to a report from Bloomberg in       the facility is used to develop microLED screens under the code name T                                            The inspection found that Apple was potentially mistreating waste as only subject to California regulations and that they had potentially miscalculated the effectiveness of Apple s activated carbon filters  which filter volatile organic compounds  VOCs  from the air  The EPA inspected the facility in August      due to a tip from a former Apple employee who posted the report on X              

Toxins
Following further campaigns by Greenpeace               in       Apple became the first electronics manufacturer to eliminate all polyvinyl chloride  PVC  and brominated flame retardants  BFRs  in its complete product line               In June       Apple began replacing the cold cathode fluorescent lamp  CCFL  backlit LCD displays in its computers with mercury free LED backlit LCD displays and arsenic free glass  starting with the upgraded MacBook Pro                                                      Apple offers comprehensive and transparent information about the CO e  emissions  materials  and electrical usage concerning every product they currently produce or have sold in the past  and which they have enough data needed to produce the report   in their portfolio on their homepage  Allowing consumers to make informed purchasing decisions on the products they offer for sale               In June       Apple s iPhone  GS was free of PVC  arsenic  and BFRs                            Since       all Apple products have mercury free LED backlit LCD displays  arsenic free glass  and non PVC cables               All Apple products have EPEAT Gold status and beat the latest Energy Star guidelines in each product s respective regulatory category                           
In November       Apple was featured in Greenpeace s Guide to Greener Electronics  which ranks electronics manufacturers on sustainability  climate and energy policy  and how  green  their products are  The company ranked fourth of fifteen electronics companies  moving up five places from the previous year  with a score of                      Greenpeace praised Apple s sustainability  noting that the company exceeded its     global recycling goal in       Apple continues to score well on product ratings  with all of their products now being free of PVC plastic and BFRs  However  the guide criticized Apple on the Energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data  and for not setting any targets to reduce emissions               In January       Apple requested that its cable maker  Volex  begin producing halogen free USB and power cables              

Green bonds

Supply chain
Main article  Apple supply chain
Apple products were made in the United States in Apple owned factories until the late     s  however  as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the     s  almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad  According to a report by The New York Times  Apple insiders  believe the vast scale of overseas factories  as well as the flexibility  diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers  have so outpaced their American counterparts that  Made in the U S A   is no longer a viable option for most Apple products               
The company s manufacturing  procurement  and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large  profit sapping inventories  In       Apple s profit margins were    percent  compared with between    and    percent for most other hardware companies  Cook s catchphrase to describe his focus on the company s operational arm is   Nobody wants to buy sour milk                            
In May       the company announced a    billion funding project for  advanced manufacturing  in the United States               and subsequently invested           million in Corning Inc   a manufacturer of toughened Gorilla Glass technology used in Apple s iPhones               The following December  Apple s chief operating officer  Jeff Williams  told CNBC that the     billion  amount was  absolutely not  the final limit on its spending  elaborating that  We re not thinking in terms of a fund limit    We re thinking about  where are the opportunities across the U S  to help nurture companies that are making the advanced technology   and the advanced manufacturing that goes with that   that quite frankly is essential to our innovation               
During the Mac s early history  Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware  instead creating their own               This trend was largely reversed in the late     s  beginning with Apple s adoption of the PCI bus in the                Power Macs  Apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as USB  AGP  HyperTransport  Wi Fi  NVMe  PCIe and others in its products  FireWire is an Apple originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as IEEE      and is a legally mandated port in all cable TV boxes in the United States              
Apple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the Indian market  In July       during a conference call with investors  CEO Tim Cook said that he   loves  India   but that Apple saw larger opportunities outside the region               India s requirement that     of products sold be manufactured in the country was described as  really adds cost to getting product to market                In May       Apple opened an iOS app development center in Bangalore and a maps development office for       staff in Hyderabad               In March  The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple would begin manufacturing iPhone models in India  over the next two months                and in May  the Journal wrote that an Apple manufacturer had begun production of the iPhone SE in the country               while Apple told CNBC that the manufacturing was for a  small number  of units               In April       Apple initiated manufacturing of the iPhone   at its Bengaluru facility  keeping in mind demand from local customers even as they seek more incentives from the government of India               At the beginning of       Tim Cook announced that Apple schedules the opening of its first physical outlet in India for       while an online store is to be launched by the end of the year               The opening of the Apple Store was postponed  and finally took place in April                    while the online store was launched in September

Apple directly employs         workers including        corporate employees in Apple Park and across Silicon Valley                            The vast majority of its employees work at the over     retail Apple Stores globally               Apple relies on a larger  outsourced workforce for manufacturing  particularly in China where Apple directly employs        workers across its retail and corporate divisions  In addition  one further million workers are contracted by Apple s suppliers to assemble Apple products  including Foxconn and Pegatron               Zhengzhou Technology Park alone employs         Chinese workers in Zhengzhou to exclusively work on the iPhone               As of          update       Apple uses hardware components from    different countries               The majority of assembling is done by Taiwanese original design manufacturer firms Foxconn  Pegatron  Wistron and Compal Electronics in factories primarily located inside China               and  to a lesser extent  Foxconn plants in Brazil               and India              
Apple workers around the globe have been involved in organizing since the     s               Apple unions are made up of retail  corporate  and outsourced workers  Apple employees have joined trade unions or formed works councils in Australia               France               Germany               Italy               Japan               the United Kingdom              and the United States               In       Apple Together  a solidarity union  sought to bring together the company s global worker organizations               The majority of industrial labor disputes  including union recognition  involving Apple occur indirectly through its suppliers and contractors  notably Foxconn plants in China              and  to a lesser extent  in Brazil              and India              

Democratic Republic of the Congo
In       Apple was named as a defendant in a forced labour and child slavery lawsuit by Congolese families of children injured and killed in cobalt mines owned by Glencore and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt  which supply battery materials to Apple and other companies              
In April       lawyers representing the Democratic Republic of the Congo notified Apple of evidence that Apple may be sourcing minerals from conflict areas of eastern Congo               Apple policies and documentation describe mitigation efforts against conflict minerals  however the lawyers identify discrepancies in supplier reporting as well as a Global Witness report describing a lack of  meaningful mitigation  on Apple s part               In December       DRC filed a lawsuit against Apple s European subsidiaries
