							The Giza Criminal Court decided to lift the travel ban and asset freeze against former prime minister Ahmed Nazif and his family on Monday 
The court notified the Illicit Gains Authority and the Public Prosecution of its decision 
This comes upon a request filed by Nazif s defence lawyer  Wageeh Abdel Malak  following the acquittal of the former from all charges in early May  Nazif  who was a prime minister in former president Hosni Mubarak       s era  was charged with exploiting his position to make illicit gains 
In its decision  the court relied on Article     of the criminal procedures code which stipulates terminating the asset freeze once there is a final acquittal granted to the defendant 
In July       the court sentenced Nazif to five years in prison and a fine of EGP    m  before he appealed the court ruling  The court also declined the case filed against his dead wife 
The court had earlier stated that it was not  confident  about the documents filed by the Administrative Prosecution and the Public Funds Investigative Authority  as the documents contradict one another 
In October       Egypt s Illicit Gains Authority started receiving applications from figures affiliated with Mubarak to reconcile with the state by paying back the money they had illicitly gained  in return of dropping the charges against them  Then justice minister Ahmed Al Zind said this is the only way to retain frozen assets and money that was smuggled abroad during the Mubarak era
