 History
Main article  History of Facebook
Mark Zuckerberg  co creator of Facebook  in his Harvard dorm room  November     
The history of Facebook traces its growth from a college networking site to a global social networking service             
While attending Phillips Exeter in the early     s  Zuckerberg met Kris Tillery  Tillery  a one time project collaborator with Zuckerberg  would create a school based social networking project called Photo Address Book  Photo Address Book was a digital face book  created through a linked database composed of student information derived from the official records of the Exeter student council  The database contained linkages such as name  dorm specific landline numbers  and student headshots             
Mark Zuckerberg built a website called  Facemash  in      while attending Harvard University  The site was comparable to Hot or Not and used photos from online face books  asking users to choose the  hotter  person               Zuckerberg was reported and faced expulsion  but the charges were dropped             
A  face book  is a student directory featuring photos and personal information  In January       Zuckerberg coded a new site known as  TheFacebook   stating   It is clear that the technology needed to create a centralized Website is readily available     the benefits are many   Zuckerberg met with Harvard student Eduardo Saverin  and each agreed to invest                     On February          Zuckerberg launched  TheFacebook              
Membership was initially restricted to students of Harvard College  Dustin Moskovitz  Andrew McCollum  and Chris Hughes joined Zuckerberg to help manage the growth of the site              It became available successively to most universities in the US and Canada                          In       Napster co founder Sean Parker became company president             and the company moved to Palo Alto  California              PayPal co founder Peter Thiel gave Facebook its first investment                          In       the company dropped  the  from its name after purchasing the domain name Facebook com             
In       Facebook opened to everyone at least    years old with a valid email address                                      Facebook introduced key features like the News Feed  which became central to user engagement  By late       Facebook had         pages on which companies promoted themselves              Facebook had surpassed MySpace in global traffic and became the world s most popular social media platform  Microsoft announced that it had purchased a      share of Facebook for           million            million in      dollars               giving Facebook an implied value of around          billion             billion in      dollars               Facebook focused on generating revenue through targeted advertising based on user data  a model that drove its rapid financial growth  In       Facebook went public with one of the largest IPOs in tech history  Acquisitions played a significant role in Facebook s dominance  In       it purchased Instagram  followed by WhatsApp and Oculus VR in       extending its influence beyond social networking into messaging and virtual reality  Mark Zuckerberg announces     billion investment in Meta AI according to Mashable 
The Facebook Cambridge Analytica data scandal in      revealed misuse of user data to influence elections  sparking global outcry and leading to regulatory fines and hearings  Facebook s role in global events  including its use in organizing movements like the Arab Spring and its impact on events like the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar  highlighted its dual nature as a tool for empowerment and harm  In       Facebook rebranded as Meta  reflecting its shift toward building the  metaverse  and focusing on virtual reality and augmented reality technologies

Technical aspects
The site s primary color is blue as Zuckerberg is red green colorblind  a realization that occurred after a test taken around                               Facebook was initially built using PHP  a popular scripting language designed for web development              PHP was used to create dynamic content and manage data on the server side of the Facebook application  Zuckerberg and co founders chose PHP for its simplicity and ease of use  which allowed them to quickly develop and deploy the initial version of Facebook  As Facebook grew in user base and functionality  the company encountered scalability and performance challenges with PHP  In response  Facebook engineers developed tools and technologies to optimize PHP performance  One of the most significant was the creation of the HipHop Virtual Machine  HHVM   This significantly improved the performance and efficiency of PHP code execution on Facebook s servers 
The site upgraded from HTTP to the more secure HTTPS in January                  

     architecture
Facebook is developed as one monolithic application  According to an interview in      with Facebook build engineer Chuck Rossi  Facebook compiles into a          GB binary blob which is then distributed to the servers using a custom BitTorrent based release system  Rossi stated that it takes about    minutes to build and    minutes to release to the servers  The build and release process has zero downtime  Changes to Facebook are rolled out daily             
Facebook used a combination platform based on HBase to store data across distributed machines  Using a tailing architecture  events are stored in log files  and the logs are tailed  The system rolls these events up and writes them to storage  The user interface then pulls the data out and displays it to users  Facebook handles requests as AJAX behavior  These requests are written to a log file using Scribe  developed by Facebook              
Data is read from these log files using Ptail  an internally built tool to aggregate data from multiple Scribe stores  It tails the log files and pulls data out  Ptail data are separated into three streams and sent to clusters in different data centers  Plugin impression  News feed impressions  Actions  plugin   news feed    Puma is used to manage periods of high data flow  Input Output or IO   Data is processed in batches to lessen the number of times needed to read and write under high demand periods   A hot article generates many impressions and news feed impressions that cause huge data skews   Batches are taken every     seconds  limited by memory used when creating a hash table             
Data is then output in PHP format  The backend is written in Java  Thrift is used as the messaging format so PHP programs can query Java services  Caching solutions display pages more quickly  The data is then sent to MapReduce servers where it is queried via Hive  This serves as a backup as the data can be recovered from Hive             

Content delivery network  CDN 
Facebook uses its own content delivery network or  edge network  under the domain fbcdn net for serving static data                          Until the mid     s  Facebook also relied on Akamai for CDN services                                     

Hack programming language
Main article  Hack  programming language 
On March           Facebook announced a new open source programming language called Hack  Before public release  a large portion of Facebook was already running and  battle tested  using the new language

In February       Facebook expanded the gender setting  adding a custom input field that allows users to choose from a wide range of gender identities  Users can also set which set of gender specific pronoun should be used in reference to them throughout the site                                      In May       Facebook introduced a feature to allow users to ask for information not disclosed by other users on their profiles  If a user does not provide key information  such as location  hometown  or relationship status  other users can use a new  ask  button to send a message asking about that item to the user in a single click                         

News Feed
Further information  News Feed
News Feed appears on every user s homepage and highlights information including profile changes  upcoming events and friends  birthdays              This enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause              Initially  the News Feed caused dissatisfaction among Facebook users  some complained it was too cluttered and full of undesired information  others were concerned that it made it too easy for others to track individual activities  such as relationship status changes  events  and conversations with other users               Zuckerberg apologized for the site s failure to include appropriate privacy features  Users then gained control over what types of information are shared automatically with friends  Users are now able to prevent user set categories of friends from seeing updates about certain types of activities  including profile changes  Wall posts and newly added friends             
On February           Facebook was granted a patent             on certain aspects of its News Feed  The patent covers News Feeds in which links are provided so that one user can participate in the activity of another user              The sorting and display of stories in a user s News Feed is governed by the EdgeRank algorithm              The Photos application allows users to upload albums and photos              Each album can contain          photos              Privacy settings apply to individual albums  Users can  tag   or label  friends in a photo  The friend receives a notification about the tag with a link to the photo              This photo tagging feature was developed by Aaron Sittig  now a Design Strategy Lead at Facebook  and former Facebook engineer Scott Marlette back in      and was only granted a patent in

Privacy policy
Facebook s data policy outlines its policies for collecting  storing  and sharing user s data               Facebook enables users to control access to individual posts and their profile              through privacy settings               The user s name and profile picture  if applicable  are public 
Facebook s revenue depends on targeted advertising  which involves analyzing user data to decide which ads to show each user  Facebook buys data from third parties  gathered from both online and offline sources  to supplement its own data on users  Facebook maintains that it does not share data used for targeted advertising with the advertisers themselves               The company states 

 We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing  but we don t share information that personally identifies you  information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are  unless you give us permission  For example  we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers  for example  that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of    and    who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering  to help them better understand their audience  We also confirm which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser               
As of October          update       Facebook claims it uses the following policy for sharing user data with third parties 

Apps  websites  and third party integrations on or using our Products 
When you choose to use third party apps  websites  or other services that use  or are integrated with  our Products  they can receive information about what you post or share  For example  when you play a game with your Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website  the game developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook  Also  when you download or use such third party services  they can access your public profile on Facebook  and any information that you share with them  Apps and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them  But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive any other information about your Facebook friends from you  or information about any of your Instagram followers  although your friends and followers may  of course  choose to share this information themselves   Information collected by these third party services is subject to their own terms and policies  not this one 
Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram  i e  where we have not developed our own first party apps  will have access to all information you choose to share with them  including information your friends share with you  so they can provide our core functionality to you 

Note  We are in the process of restricting developers  data access even further to help prevent abuse  For example  we will remove developers  access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven t used their app in   months  and we are changing Login  so that in the next version  we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only name  Instagram username and bio  profile photo and email address  Requesting any other data will require our approval              
Facebook will also share data with law enforcement if needed to              
Facebook s policies have changed repeatedly since the service s debut  amid a series of controversies covering everything from how well it secures user data  to what extent it allows users to control access  to the kinds of access given to third parties  including businesses  political campaigns and governments  These facilities vary according to country  as some nations require the company to make data available  and limit access to services   while the European Union s GDPR regulation mandates additional privacy protections              

Bug Bounty Program
A Facebook  White Hat  debit card  given to researchers who report security bugs  May

Reception
Userbase
Facebook s rapid growth began as soon as it became available and continued through       before beginning to decline  Facebook passed          million registered users in                    and          million in July                    According to the company s data at the July      announcement  half of the site s membership used Facebook daily  for an average of    minutes  while          million users accessed the site by mobile              
In October       Facebook s monthly active users passed one billion                            with          million mobile users           billion photo uploads  and          billion friend connections               The        billion user mark was crossed in June                                 In November       after skepticism about the accuracy of its  monthly active users  measurement  Facebook changed its definition to a logged in member who visits the Facebook site through the web browser or mobile app  or uses the Facebook Messenger app  in the    day period prior to the measurement  This excluded the use of third party services with Facebook integration  which was previously counted              
From      to       the percentage of the U S  population over the age of    who use Facebook has declined  from     to      a decline of some         million U S  users   with a higher drop off among younger Americans  a decrease in the percentage of U S      to    year olds who are users from     in      to     in                                  The decline coincided with an increase in the popularity of Instagram  which is also owned by Meta                            The number of daily active users experienced a quarterly decline for the first time in the last quarter of       down to       billion from       billion               but increased again the next quarter despite being banned in Russia              
Historically  commentators have offered predictions of Facebook s decline or end  based on causes such as a declining user base               the legal difficulties of being a closed platform  inability to generate revenue  inability to offer user privacy  inability to adapt to mobile platforms  or Facebook ending itself to present a next generation replacement               or Facebook s role in Russian interference in the      United States elections

Privacy concerns

Details of information collected via PRISM
Facebook has experienced a steady stream of controversies over how it handles user privacy  repeatedly adjusting its privacy settings and policies               Since       Facebook has been participating in the PRISM secret program  sharing with the US National Security Agency audio  video  photographs  e mails  documents and connection logs from user profiles  among other social media services                           
On November           Facebook settled Federal Trade Commission charges that it deceived consumers by failing to keep privacy promises               In August      High Tech Bridge published a study showing that links included in Facebook messaging service messages were being accessed by Facebook               In January      two users filed a lawsuit against Facebook alleging that their privacy had been violated by this practice              
On June          Facebook announced that a bug had resulted in about         million Facebook users having their default sharing setting for all new posts set to  public                Its data sharing agreement with Chinese companies such as Huawei came under the scrutiny of US lawmakers  although the information accessed was not stored on Huawei servers and remained on users  phones               On April          half a billion records of Facebook users were found exposed on Amazon cloud servers  containing information about users  friends  likes  groups  and checked in locations  as well as names  passwords and email addresses              
The phone numbers of at least     million Facebook users were found to be exposed on an open online database in September       They included          million US users          million from the UK  and         million from users in Vietnam  After removing duplicates  the     million records have been reduced to          million  The database went offline after TechCrunch contacted the web host  It is thought the records were amassed using a tool that Facebook disabled in April      after the Cambridge Analytica controversy  A Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement   The dataset is old and appears to have information obtained before we made changes last year   There is no evidence that Facebook accounts were compromised               
Facebook s privacy problems resulted in companies like Viber Media and Mozilla discontinuing advertising on Facebook s platforms                            A January      study by Consumer Reports found that among a self selected group of volunteer participants  each user is monitored or tracked by over two thousand companies on average  LiveRamp  a San Francisco based data broker  is responsible for    per cent of the data  Other companies such as Home Depot  Macy s  and Walmart are involved as well              
In March       a court in California released documents detailing Facebook s       Project Ghostbusters   The project was aimed at helping Facebook compete with Snapchat and involved Facebook trying to develop decryption tools to collect  decrypt  and analyze traffic that users generated when visiting Snapchat and  eventually  YouTube and Amazon  The company eventually used its tool Onavo to initiate man in the middle attacks and read users  traffic before it was encrypted              

Racial bias
Facebook was accused of committing  systemic  racial bias by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission based on the complaints of three rejected candidates and a current employee of the company  The three rejected employees along with the Operational Manager at Facebook as of March      accused the firm of discriminating against Black people  The EEOC initiated an investigation into the case in March                   

Shadow profiles
A  shadow profile  refers to the data Facebook collects about individuals without their explicit permission  For example  the  like  button that appears on third party websites allows the company to collect information about an individual s internet browsing habits  even if the individual is not a Facebook user                            Data can also be collected by other users  For example  a Facebook user can link their email account to their Facebook to find friends on the site  allowing the company to collect the email addresses of users and non users alike               Over time  countless data points about an individual are collected  any single data point perhaps cannot identify an individual  but together allows the company to form a unique  profile  
This practice has been criticized by those who believe people should be able to opt out of involuntary data collection  Additionally  while Facebook users have the ability to download and inspect the data they provide to the site  data from the user s  shadow profile  is not included  and non users of Facebook do not have access to this tool regardless  The company has also been unclear whether or not it is possible for a person to revoke Facebook s access to their  shadow profile               

Cambridge Analytica
Main article  Facebook Cambridge Analytica data scandal
Facebook customer Global Science Research sold information on over         million Facebook users to Cambridge Analytica  a political data analysis firm led by Alexander Nix               While approximately         people used the app  Facebook s API permitted data collection from their friends without their knowledge               At first Facebook downplayed the significance of the breach  and suggested that Cambridge Analytica no longer had access  Facebook then issued a statement expressing alarm and suspended Cambridge Analytica  Review of documents and interviews with former Facebook employees suggested that Cambridge Analytica still possessed the data               This was a violation of Facebook s consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission  This violation potentially carried a penalty of                  in      dollars              per occurrence  totalling trillions of dollars              
According to The Guardian  both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica threatened to sue the newspaper if it published the story  After publication  Facebook claimed that it had been  lied to   On March           the English High Court granted an application by the Information Commissioner s Office for a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica s London offices  ending a standoff between Facebook and the Information Commissioner over responsibility              
On March     Facebook published a statement by Zuckerberg in major UK and US newspapers apologizing over a  breach of trust               

You may have heard about a quiz app built by a university researcher that leaked Facebook data of millions of people in       This was a breach of trust  and I m sorry we didn t do more at the time  We re now taking steps to make sure this doesn t happen again 
We ve already stopped apps like this from getting so much information  Now we re limiting the data apps get when you sign in using Facebook 
We re also investigating every single app that had access to large amounts of data before we fixed this  We expect there are others  And when we find them  we will ban them and tell everyone affected 
Finally  we ll remind you which apps you ve given access to your information   so you can shut off the ones you don t want anymore 

Thank you for believing in this community  I promise to do better for you 
On March     the Federal Trade Commission opened an investigation into the matter               The controversy led Facebook to end its partnerships with data brokers who aid advertisers in targeting users              
On April           Facebook said it could face a fine between         billion             billion in      dollars              to         billion             billion in      dollars              as the result of an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission               On July           the FTC fined Facebook    billion  the largest penalty ever imposed on a company for violating consumer privacy  Additionally  Facebook had to implement a new privacy structure  follow a    year settlement order  and allow the FTC to monitor Facebook               Cambridge Analytica s CEO and a developer faced restrictions on future business dealings and were ordered to destroy any personal information they collected  Cambridge Analytica filed for bankruptcy               Facebook also implemented additional privacy controls and settings              in part to comply with the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR   which took effect in May               Facebook also ended its active opposition to the California Consumer Privacy Act              
Some  such as Meghan McCain  have drawn an equivalence between the use of data by Cambridge Analytica and the Barack Obama s      campaign  which  according to Investor s Business Daily   encouraged supporters to download an Obama      Facebook app that  when activated  let the campaign collect Facebook data both on users and their friends                                          Carol Davidsen  the Obama for America  OFA  former director of integration and media analytics  wrote that  Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph  but they didn t stop us once they realised that was what we were doing                             PolitiFact has rated McCain s statements  Half True   on the basis that  in Obama s case  direct users knew they were handing over their data to a political campaign  whereas with Cambridge Analytica  users thought they were only taking a personality quiz for academic purposes  and while the Obama campaign only used the data  to have their supporters contact their most persuadable friends   Cambridge Analytica  targeted users  friends and lookalikes directly with digital ads               

DataSpii
In July       cybersecurity researcher Sam Jadali exposed a catastrophic data leak known as DataSpii involving data provider DDMR and marketing intelligence company Nacho Analytics  NA                             Branding itself as the  God mode for the internet   NA through DDMR  provided its members access to private Facebook photos and Facebook Messenger attachments including tax returns               DataSpii harvested data from millions of Chrome and Firefox users through compromised browser extensions               The NA website stated it collected data from millions of opt in users  Jadali  along with journalists from Ars Technica and The Washington Post  interviewed impacted users  including a Washington Post staff member  According to the interviews  the impacted users did not consent to such collection 
DataSpii demonstrated how a compromised user exposed the data of others  including the private photos and Messenger attachments belonging to a Facebook user s network of friends              
DataSpii exploited Facebook s practice of making private photos and Messenger attachments publicly accessible via unique URLs  To bolster security in this regard  Facebook appends query strings in the URLs so as to limit the period of accessibility               Nevertheless  NA provided real time access to these unique URLs  which were intended to be secure  This allowed NA members to access the private content within the restricted time frame designated by Facebook 
The Washington Post     s Geoffrey Fowler  in collaboration with Jadali  opened Fowler s private Facebook photo in a browser with a compromised browser extension               Within minutes  they anonymously retrieved the  private  photo  To validate this proof of concept  they searched for Fowler s name using NA  which yielded his photo as a search result  In addition  Jadali discovered Fowler s Washington Post colleague  Nick Mourtoupalas  was directly impacted by DataSpii  Jadali s investigation elucidated how DataSpii disseminated private data to additional third parties  including foreign entities  within minutes of the data being acquired  In doing so  he identified the third parties who were scraping  storing  and potentially enabling the facial recognition of individuals in photos being furnished by DataSpii              

Breaches
On September           Facebook experienced a major breach in its security  exposing the data of         million users  The data breach started in July      and was discovered on September                  Facebook notified users affected by the exploit and logged them out of their accounts                            In March       Facebook confirmed a password compromise of millions of Facebook lite application users also affected millions of Instagram users  The reason cited was the storage of password as plain text instead of encryption which could be read by its employees              
On December           security researcher Bob Diachenko discovered a database containing more than          million Facebook user IDs  phone numbers  and names that were left exposed on the web for anyone to access without a password or any other authentication               In February       Facebook encountered a major security breach in which its official Twitter account was hacked by a Saudi Arabia based group called  OurMine   The group has a history of actively exposing high profile social media profiles  vulnerabilities              
In April       The Guardian reported approximately half a billion users  data had been stolen including birthdates and phone numbers  Facebook alleged it was  old data  from a problem fixed in August      despite the data s having been released a year and a half later only in       it declined to speak with journalists  had apparently not notified regulators  called the problem  unfixable   and said it would not be advising users               In September       Meta paid a      million fine for storing up to     million passwords of Facebook and Instagram users in plain text  The practice was initially discovered in       though reports indicate passwords were stored in plain text since                   

Phone data and activity
Facebook acquired Onavo s virtual private network to harvest usage data on its competitors 
After acquiring Onavo in       Facebook used its Onavo Protect virtual private network  VPN  app to collect information on users  web traffic and app usage  This allowed Facebook to monitor its competitors  performance  and motivated Facebook to acquire WhatsApp in                                              Media outlets classified Onavo Protect as spyware                                         In August       Facebook removed the app in response to pressure from Apple  who asserted that it violated their guidelines                            The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission sued Facebook on December           for  false  misleading or deceptive conduct  in response to the company s unauthorized use of personal data obtained from Onavo for business purposes in contrast to Onavo s privacy oriented marketing                           
In       Facebook Research launched Project Atlas  offering some users between the ages of    and    up to     per month         in      dollars              in exchange for their personal data  including their app usage  web browsing history  web search history  location history  personal messages  photos  videos  emails and Amazon order history                            In January       TechCrunch reported on the project  This led Apple to temporarily revoke Facebook s Enterprise Developer Program certificates for one day  preventing Facebook Research from operating on iOS devices and disabling Facebook s internal iOS apps                                        
Ars Technica reported in April      that the Facebook Android app had been harvesting user data  including phone calls and text messages  since                                              In May       several Android users filed a class action lawsuit against Facebook for invading their privacy                            In January       Facebook launched the Off Facebook Activity page  which allows users to see information collected by Facebook about their non Facebook activities               The Washington Post columnist Geoffrey A  Fowler found that this included what other apps he used on his phone  even while the Facebook app was closed  what other web sites he visited on his phone  and what in store purchases he made from affiliated businesses  even while his phone was completely off              
In November       a report was published by Fairplay  Global Action Plan and Reset Australia detailing accusations that Facebook was continuing to manage their ad targeting system with data collected from teen users               The accusations follow announcements by Facebook in July      that they would cease ad targeting children                           

Public apologies
The company first apologized for its privacy abuses in                   
Facebook apologies have appeared in newspapers  television  blog posts and on Facebook               On March           leading US and UK newspapers published full page ads with a personal apology from Zuckerberg  Zuckerberg issued a verbal apology on CNN               In May       he apologized for discrepancies in privacy settings              
Previously  Facebook had its privacy settings spread out over    pages  and has now put all of its privacy settings on one page  which makes it more difficult for third party apps to access the user s personal information               In addition to publicly apologizing  Facebook has said that it will be reviewing and auditing thousands of apps that display  suspicious activities  in an effort to ensure that this breach of privacy does not happen again               In a      report regarding privacy  a research project stated that not a lot of information is available regarding the consequences of what people disclose online so often what is available are just reports made available through popular media               In       a former Facebook executive went on the record to discuss how social media platforms have contributed to the unraveling of the  fabric of society               

 Content disputes and moderation

Facebook relies on its users to generate the content that bonds its users to the service  The company has come under criticism both for allowing objectionable content  including conspiracy theories and fringe discourse               and for prohibiting other content that it deems inappropriate 

Misinformation and fake news
Criticism of Facebook during the Hands Off protests in Minneapolis on April        
Facebook has been criticized as a vector for fake news  and has been accused of bearing responsibility for the conspiracy theory that the United States created ISIS               false anti Rohingya posts being used by Myanmar s military to fuel genocide and ethnic cleansing                            enabling climate change denial                                        and Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting conspiracy theorists               and anti refugee attacks in Germany                                         The government of the Philippines has also used Facebook as a tool to attack its critics

Facebook has used several initiatives to encourage its users to register to vote and vote  An experiment in      involved showing Facebook users pictures of their friends who reported that they had voted  users who were shown the pictures were about    more likely to report that they had also voted compared to the control group  which was not encouraged to vote               In       Facebook announced the goal of helping four million voters register in the US  saying that it had registered          million by September
