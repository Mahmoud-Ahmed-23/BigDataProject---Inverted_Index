Embodied cognition represents a diverse group of theories which investigate how cognition is shaped by the bodily state and capacities of the organism  These embodied factors include the motor system  the perceptual system  bodily interactions with the environment  situatedness   and the assumptions about the world that shape the functional structure of the brain and body of the organism  Embodied cognition suggests that these elements are essential to a wide spectrum of cognitive functions  such as perception biases  memory recall  comprehension and high level mental constructs  such as meaning attribution and categories  and performance on various cognitive tasks  reasoning or judgment   
The embodied mind thesis challenges other theories  such as cognitivism  computationalism  and Cartesian dualism                        It is closely related to the extended mind thesis  situated cognition  and enactivism  The modern version depends on understandings drawn from up to date research in psychology  linguistics  cognitive science  dynamical systems  artificial intelligence  robotics  animal cognition  plant cognition  and neurobiology 


Theory edit 
The classical Cartesian model of the mind under which body   world  perception and action are understood as independent
Proponents of the embodied cognition thesis emphasize the active and significant role the body plays in the shaping of cognition and in the understanding of an agent s mind and cognitive capacities  In philosophy  embodied cognition holds that an agent s cognition  rather than being the product of mere  innate  abstract representations of the world  is strongly influenced by aspects of an agent s body beyond the brain itself                        An embodied model of cognition opposes the disembodied Cartesian model  according to which all mental phenomena are non physical and  therefore  not influenced by the body  With this opposition the embodiment thesis intends to reintroduce an agent s bodily experiences into any account of cognition  It is a rather broad thesis and encompasses both weak and strong variants of embodiment                                                         In an attempt to reconcile cognitive science with human experience  the enactive approach to cognition defines  embodiment  as follows             

By using the term embodied we mean to highlight two points  first that cognition depends upon the kinds of experience that come from having a body with various sensorimotor capacities  and second  that these individual sensorimotor capacities are themselves embedded in a more encompassing biological  psychological and cultural context         The Embodied Mind  Cognitive Science and Human Experience by Francisco J  Varela  Evan Thompson  and Eleanor Rosch  pages         
This double sense attributed to the embodiment thesis emphasizes the many aspects of cognition that researchers in different fields such as philosophy  cognitive science  artificial intelligence  psychology  and neuroscience are involved with  This general characterization of embodiment faces some difficulties  a consequence of this emphasis on the body  experience  culture  context  and the cognitive mechanisms of an agent in the world is that often distinct views and approaches to embodied cognition overlap  The theses of extended cognition and situated cognition  for example  are usually intertwined and not always carefully separated  And since each of the aspects of the embodiment thesis is endorsed to different degrees  embodied cognition should be better seen  as a research program rather than a well defined unified theory             
Some authors explain the embodiment thesis by arguing that cognition depends on an agent s body and its interactions with a determined environment  From this perspective  cognition in real biological systems is not an end in itself  it is constrained by the system s goals and capacities  Such constraints do not mean cognition is set by adaptive behavior  or autopoiesis  alone  but instead that cognition requires  some kind of information processing    the transformation or communication of incoming information   The acquiring of such information involves the agent s  exploration and modification of the environment              

It would be a mistake  however  to suppose that cognition consists simply of building maximally accurate representations of input information   the gaining of knowledge is a stepping stone to achieving the more immediate goal of guiding behavior in response to the system s changing surroundings         Marcin Mi kowski  Explaining the Computational Mind  p    
The embodied cognitive model of the mind under which body  world  perception and action are dynamically related with each other
Another approach to understanding embodied cognition comes from a narrower characterization of the embodiment thesis  The following narrower view of embodiment avoids any compromises to external sources other than the body and allows differentiating between embodied cognition  extended cognition  and situated cognition  Thus  the embodiment thesis can be specified as follows             

Many features of cognition are embodied in that they are deeply dependent upon characteristics of the physical body of an agent  such that the agent s beyond the brain body plays a significant causal role  or a physically constitutive role  in that agent s cognitive processing         RA Wilson and L Foglia  Embodied Cognition in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy 
This thesis points out the core idea that an agent s body plays a significant role in shaping different features of cognition  such as perception  attention  memory  reasoning among others  Likewise  these features of cognition depend on the kind of body an agent has  The thesis omits direct mention of some aspects of the  more encompassing biological  psychological and cultural context  included in the enactive definition  making it possible to separate embodied cognition  extended cognition  and situated cognition 
In contrast to the embodiment thesis  the extended mind thesis limits cognitive processing neither to the brain nor even to the body  it extends it outward into the agent s world                                   Situated cognition emphasizes that this extension is not just a matter of including resources outside the head but stressing the role of probing and changing interactions with the agent s world              Cognition is situated in that it is inherently dependent upon the cultural and social contexts within which it takes place             
This conceptual reframing of cognition as an activity influenced by the body has had significant implications  For instance  the view of cognition inherited by most contemporary cognitive neuroscience is internalist in nature  An agent s behavior along with its capacity to maintain  accurate  representations of the surrounding environment were considered as the product of  powerful brains that can maintain the world models and devise plans               From this perspective  cognizing was conceived as something that an isolated brain did  In contrast  accepting the role the body plays during cognitive processes allows us to account for a more encompassing view of cognition  This shift in perspective within neuroscience suggests that successful behavior in real world scenarios demands the integration of several sensorimotor and cognitive  as well as affective  capacities of an agent  Thus  cognition emerges in the relationship between an agent and the affordances provided by the environment rather than in the brain alone 
In       a collection of positive characterizations summarizing what the embodiment thesis entails for cognition were offered  Professor of Cognitive Psychology Margaret Wilson argues that the general outlook of embodied cognition  displays an interesting co variation of multiple observations and houses a number of different claims      cognition is situated      cognition is time pressured      we off load cognitive work onto the environment      the environment is part of the cognitive system      cognition is for action      offline cognition is bodily based               According to Wilson  the first three and the fifth claim appear to be at least partially true  while the fourth claim is deeply problematic in that all things that have an impact on the elements of a system are not necessarily considered part of the system              The sixth claim has received the least attention in the literature on embodied cognition  yet it might be the most significant of the six claims as it shows how certain human cognitive capabilities  that previously were thought to be highly abstract  now appear to be leaning towards an embodied approach for their explanation              Wilson also describes at least five main  abstract  categories that combine both sensory and motor skills  or sensorimotor functions   The first three are working memory  episodic memory  and implicit memory  the fourth is mental imagery  and finally  the fifth concerns reasoning and problem solving 

History edit 
A timeline graph reconstructing historically relevant developments and key contributions that influenced the growth of embodied cognition  To the left are the years in descending order  The legend on the top right corner indicates how to interpret the connections made 
The theory of embodied cognition  along with the multiple aspects it comprises  can be regarded as the imminent result of an intellectual skepticism towards the flourishment of the disembodied theory of mind put forth by Ren  Descartes in the   th century  According to Cartesian dualism  the mind is entirely distinct from the body and can be successfully explained and understood without reference to the body or to its processes             
Research has been done to identify the set of ideas that would establish what could be considered as the early stages of embodied cognition around inquiries regarding the mind body soul relation and vitalism in the German tradition from      to                   The modern approach and definition of embodied cognition has a relatively short history              Intellectual underpinnings of embodied cognition can be traced back to the influence of philosophy and  more specifically  the phenomenological tradition  psychology  and connectionism in the   th century 

Phenomenologists such as Edmund Husserl              Martin Heidegger              and Maurice Merleau Ponty             served as a source of inspiration for what would later be known as the embodiment thesis  They stood up against the mechanistic and disembodied approach to the explanation of the mind by emphasizing the fact that there are aspects of human experiences  consciousness  cognition  that cannot simply be explained by a model of the mind as computation of inner symbols  From a phenomenological standpoint  such aspects remain unaccountable if  as in Cartesian dualism  they are not  deeply rooted in the physical nuts and bolts of the interacting agent               Maurice Merleau Ponty in his Phenomenology of Perception     transl          for example  rejects the Cartesian idea that people s primary mode of being in the world is thinking     transl             transl         and proposes corporeity     transl          that is  the body itself as the primary site for knowing the world  and perception as the medium and the pre reflective foundation of experience  The body is the vehicle of being in the world  and having a body is  for a living creature  to be intervolved in a definite environment  to identify oneself with certain projects and be continually committed to them             So stated  the body is the primary condition for experience since it comprises a collection of active meanings about the world and its objects  The body also provides the first person perspective  a point of view  with which one experiences the world and opens up multiple possibilities for being             
The appreciation of the phenomenological mindset allows us to not overlook the influence that phenomenology s speculative but systematic reflection on the mind body world relation had in the growth and development of the core ideas which embodied cognition comprises  From a phenomenological perspective  all cognition is embodied  interactive  and embedded in dynamically changing environments               These constitute the set of beliefs which proponents of embodied cognition such as cognitive scientists Francisco Varela  Eleonor Rosch  and Evan Thompson will revise later on and seek to reintroduce in the scientific study of cognition under the name of enaction             Enactivism reclaims the importance of considering the biodynamics of the living organism to understand cognition by gathering ideas from fields such as biology  psychoanalysis  Buddhism  and phenomenology  According to this enactive approach  organisms obtain knowledge or develop their cognitive capacities through a perception action relationship with a mutually determining environment 
This basic idea of  qualitative  experience as the product of an individual s active perception action interactions with its surrounding is also traceable to the American contextualist or pragmatist tradition in works such as Art As Experience by American psychologist John Dewey  For Dewey  experiences affect people s personal lives as they are the by product of continuous and commutative interactions of a biological and organic self  an incarnated body  with the world  These lived  corporeal  experiences should serve as the foundation to build upon             
On the bases of empirical grounds  and in opposition to those philosophical traditions that belittled the importance of the body to understand cognition  research on embodiment have demonstrated the relationship between cognition and bodily process  Thus  understanding cognition requires one to consider and investigate the sensory and motor mechanism that enables it  Cognitive scientist George Lakoff  for example  holds that reasoning and language arise from the nature of bodily experiences and  thus  even people s own metaphors have bodily references             
Since the     s  encouraged by progress in informatics  researchers began to create digital models of the processes by which sensory input is selected by the brain  stored in the memory  connected to existing knowledge and used for elaboration              These traditional computationalists views of cognition that were typical in the     s     s are now considered implausible because there is no continuity with the cognitive skills that would have been demanded and developed by the ancestors of the human species              
The earlier version of the concept of embodiment in cognition was offered in           by Irina Trofimova who called the experimentally proven effects of embodiment in meaning attribution as  projection through capacities                                      Some researchers indeed argue that this algorithmic focus on mental activities ignores the fact that human beings engage with evolutionary pressures using their entire bodies                          Margaret Wilson considers the embodied cognition perspective as fundamentally an evolutionary one  viewing cognition as a set of abilities that built upon  and still reflects  the structure of physical bodies and how human brains evolved to manage those bodies              The theory of evolution emphasises that thanks to their bipedal gait  early humans did not need their  forepaws  for locomotion  facilitating them to manipulate the environment with the aid of tools  One researcher goes even further  positing that the multiple opportunities provided by human hands shape people s concepts of the mind              One example is that people often conceive cognitive processes in manual terms  such as  grasping an idea  
J J  Gibson             developed his theory on ecological psychology that entirely contradicted the computationalist idea of understanding the mind as information processing which by that time had permeated psychology both in theory and practice  Gibson particularly disagreed with the way his contemporaries understood the nature of perception  Computationalist perspectives  for example  consider perceptual objects as an unreliable source of information upon which the mind must do some sort of inference  Gibson view perceptual processes as the product of the relation between a moving agent and its relationship with a specific environment              Similarly  Varela and colleague s argue that both cognition and the environment are not pre given  instead  they are enacted or brought forth by the agent s history of sensorimotor and structurally coupled activities            
Connectionism also put forth a critique to the computationalist commitments yet granting the possibility of some sort of non symbolic computational processes to take place              According to the connectionist thesis  cognition as a biological phenomenon can be explained and understood through the interaction and dynamics of artificial neural networks  ANNs                           Given the traces of abstraction that remain in the inputs and outputs through which connectionist neural networks carry its computations  connectionism is said to be not so far from computationalism and unable to cope with both the challenge of dealing with the details involved during perceiving and acting and explaining higher level cognition                          Likewise  connectionism s take on cognition is biologically inspired by the behavior and interaction of single neurons  yet its connections to the embodiment thesis in general  and to perception action interactions in particular  are not clearly outlined or straightforward 

By early       O Regan  J  K  and No   A  provided empirical evidence against the computationalist mindset arguing that although cortical maps exist in the brain and their patterns of activation give rise to perceptual experiences  they alone are unable to fully explain the subjective character of experience  Namely  it is unclear how internal representations generate conscious perception  Given this ambiguity  O Regan  J  K  and N e  A  put forth what would later be known as  sensorimotor contingencies   SMCs  in an attempt to understand the changing character of sensations as actors act in the world  According to the SMC theory  The experience of seeing occurs when the organism masters what we call the governing laws of sensorimotor contingency             
Ever since the late   th century and recognizing the significant role the body plays for cognition  the embodied cognition theory has gained  an ever increasing  popularity  it has been the subject of multiple articles in different research areas  and the mainstream approach to what Shapiro and Spaulding call the  embodied make over               A consequence of this widespread acceptance of the embodiment thesis is the emergence of  E features of cognition  embodied  embedded  enacted  and extended cognition   Under  E  cognition is no longer thought of as being instantiated in or by a single organism  rather It assumes that cognition is shaped and structured by dynamic interactions between the brain  body  and both the physical and social environments             
Scope edit 
The scope of embodied cognition and the intertwined relationship that arise between the sciences
Embodied cognition argues that several factors both internal and external  such as the body and the environment  play a role in the development of an agent s cognitive capacities  just as mental constructs  such as thoughts and desires  are said to influence an agent s bodily actions  For this reason  embodied cognition is considered as a wide ranging research program  rather than a well defined and unified theory              A scientific approach to embodied cognition reaches  inspires  and brings together ideas from several research areas  each with its own take on embodiment yet in a joint effort to  methodically  investigate embodied cognition 
Research on embodied cognition comprises a variety of fields within the sciences such as linguistics  neuroscience   cognitive  psychology  philosophy  artificial intelligence  robotics  etc  For this reason  contemporary developments on embodied cognition can be regarded as the embodied make over of cognitive science offering new ways to look at the nature  structure  and mechanisms of cognition             Embodying cognition requires the different features of cognition such as perception  language  memory  learning  reasoning  emotion  self regulation  and its social aspects to be revisited and investigated through the lens of embodiment in order to ground its theoretical and methodological underpinnings             
Embodied cognition has gained the attention and interest of classical cognitive science  along with all sciences it comprises  to incorporate embodiment ideas into its research  In linguistics  George Lakoff  a cognitive scientist and linguist  and his collaborators Mark Johnson  Mark Turner  and Rafael E  N  ez have promoted and expanded the embodiment thesis based on developments within the field of cognitive science                                                              Their research has provided evidence suggesting that people use their understanding of familiar physical objects  actions  and situations to understand other domains  All cognition is based on the knowledge that comes from the body and other disciplines are mapped onto humans  embodied knowledge using a combination of conceptual metaphor  image schema and prototypes 
The conceptual metaphors research have argued that people use metaphors all over              to be in charge of the conceptual level  in other words  they map one conceptual state into another one  Therefore  research has stated that there is a single metaphor behind various definitions  Several examples of conceptual metaphors from different fields were collected to explain how metaphors relate to other metaphors and often refer to body aspects                          The most common example given to this explanation is when people describe the concept of love  associating this love metaphor with physically embodied journey experiences  Another example of the language and embodiment of Lakoff and Mark Turner is visual metaphors  Accordingly  they argue that the positioning of these visual metaphors for upright and forward moving creatures depends on body type and the characteristics of the body s interaction with the environment             
Another study from      focused on the  image schema  to investigate how people understand abstract concepts              Accordingly  abstract concepts are understood by considering basic physical situations  Abstract concepts  whose basic physical states are considered  are then interpreted by using sensory motor and perceptual skills  Thus  it is shown that there is a spatial reasoning process that requires using the body even in reasoning over abstract concepts  In this context  the image schema is seen as a conceptual metaphor form  For example  spatial reasoning skills and the visual cortex tend to be used to understand a mathematical concept consisting of imaginary numbers that are purely abstract              Thus  it has been shown how important the body plays in the image schema as in the conceptual metaphor in the interpretation of concepts 
Another important factor in understanding linguistic categories is prototypes  Eleanor Rosch argued that prototypes play an important role in people s cognition  According to her research  prototypes are the most typical members of a category  and she explains this with an example from birds  The robin  for example  is a prototypical bird while the penguin is not a prototypical bird which shows that objects that are prototypical are more easily categorized  and therefore  people can find answers by reasoning about the categories they encounter through these prototypes              Another study identified basic level categories that exemplify this situation in a more structured way  Accordingly  basic level categories are categories that can be associated with basic physical motions  they are made up of prototypes that can be easily visualized  These prototypes are used for reasoning about general categories              On the other hand  Lakoff emphasizes that what is important in prototype theory  rather than class or type characteristics  is that the feature of the categories people use is a bodily experience              Thus  as seen in the general of these approaches  it can be said that the most basic feature in understanding and interpreting linguistic concepts and categories is whether the concept or category has been experienced bodily 
Neuroscientists Gerald Edelman  Ant nio Dam sio and others have outlined the connection between the body  individual structures in the brain and aspects of the mind such as consciousness  emotion  self awareness and will                          Biology has also inspired Gregory Bateson  Humberto Maturana  Francisco Varela  Eleanor Rosch and Evan Thompson to develop a closely related version of the idea  which they call enactivism                         The motor theory of speech perception proposed by Alvin Liberman and colleagues at the Haskins Laboratories argues that the identification of words is embodied in perception of the bodily movements by which spoken words are made                                                              
In related work at Haskins  Paul Mermelstein  Philip Rubin  Louis Goldstein  and colleagues developed articulatory synthesis tools for computationally modeling the physiology and aeroacoustics of the vocal tract  demonstrating how cognition and perception of speech can be shaped by biological constraints  This was extended into the audio visual domain by the  talking heads  approach of Eric Vatikiotis Bateson  Rubin  and other colleagues 
The concept of embodiment has been inspired by research in cognitive neuroscience  such as the proposals of Gerald Edelman concerning how mathematical and computational models such as neuronal group selection and neural degeneracy result in emergent categorization  From a neuroscientific perspective  the embodied cognition theory examines the interaction of sensorimotor  cognitive  and affective neurological systems  The embodied mind thesis is compatible with some views of cognition promoted in neuropsychology  such as the theories of consciousness of Vilayanur S  Ramachandran  Gerald Edelman  and Antonio Damasio  It is also supported by a broad and ever increasing collection of empirical studies within neuroscience  By examining brain activity with neuroimaging techniques  researchers have found indications of embodiment  In an Electroencephalography  EEG  study researchers showed that in line with the embodied cognition  sensorimotor contingency and common coding theses  sensory and motor processes in the brain are not sequentially separated  they are strongly coupled              Considering the interaction of the sensorimotor and cognitive system  a study from      stresses how crucial sensorimotor cortices are for semantic comprehension of body action terms and sentences              A functional magnetic resonance imaging  fMRI  study from      showed that passively read action words  such as lick  pick or kick  led to a somatotopic neuronal activity in or adjacent to brain regions associated with actual movement of the respective body parts              Using transcranial magnetic stimulation  TMS   a study in      stated that the activity of the motor system is coupled to auditory action related sentences  When the participants listened to hand or foot related sentences  the motor evoked potentials  MEPs  recorded from the hand and foot muscles were reduced              These two exemplary studies indicate a relationship between cognitively understanding words referring to sensorimotor concepts and activation of sensorimotor cortices  Along the lines of embodiment  neuroimaging techniques serve to show interactions of the sensory and motor system 
Next to neuroimaging studies  behavioral studies also provides evidence supporting the embodied cognition theory  Abstract higher cognitive concepts such as the  importance  of an object or an issue also seem to stand in relation to the sensorimotor system  People estimate objects to be heavier when they are told that they are important or hold important information in contrast to unimportant information              Similarly  weight affects the way people invest physical and cognitive effort when dealing with concrete or abstract issues  For example  more importance is assigned to decision making procedures when holding heavier clipboards              What this suggest is that the physical effort invested in concrete objects leads to more cognitive effort when dealing with abstract concepts 
The work of cognitive neuroscientists such as Francisco Varela and Walter Freeman seeks to explain embodied and situated cognition in terms of dynamical systems theory and neurophenomenology  rejecting the idea that the brain merely uses representations to cognise  a position also espoused by Gerhard Werner   There are several neuroscientific approaches to explain cognition from an embodied perspective as well as multiple methods such as neuroimaging techniques  behavioral experiments  and dynamical models that can be employed to support and further investigate embodied cognition 
In the field of Robotics researchers such as Rodney Brooks  Hans Moravec and Rolf Pfeifer have argued that true artificial intelligence can only be achieved by machines that have sensory and motor skills and are connected to the world through a body                                     The insights of these robotics researchers have in turn inspired philosophers like Andy Clark and Hendriks Jansen                         
In the light of these  a body is essential for cognition and  therefore  for intelligent behavior since the interaction between the body and the environment is fundamental for developing cognitive abilities              This type of knowledge is grounded in physical embodiment       the relationship humans have with their bodies  It is the concept of  the idea that the mind is not only connected to the body but that the body influences the mind               Embodied artificial intelligence and robotics is a method of applying this principle to artificial systems 

The applications of embodied cognition and artificial intelligence
Traditional artificial intelligence involves a computational approach  This primary computational paradigm evolved to the embodied perspective with embodied cognition studies and brought more interdisciplinary research topics to artificial intelligence  Embodied perspective brings a necessity of working with the physical world and systems which came alongside robotics  Robotics are essential for the embodied artificial perspective due to their differing capabilities from computers  computers define the inputs  robots can interact with the physical world via their own body              Researchers working on embodied AI are moving away from an algorithm driven approach to robots interacting with the physical world              Embodied Artificial intelligence tries to figure out how biological systems work first  then construct basic rules of intelligent behavior  and finally apply that knowledge to create artificial systems  robots  or intelligent devices              Embodied artificial intelligence has a large scale of applications and research  For instance  the embodied artificial approach can be seen in micro  and nano mechatronic systems and evolvable hardware  top down bio synthetic systems research  bottom up chemo synthetic systems  and biochemical systems              The majority of embodied artificial intelligence focuses on robot training and autonomous vehicle technologies  Autonomous vehicles have a significant interest in embodied artificial intelligence applications because this technology allows driving and making possible judgments based on what they see as humans do             

Perception edit 
Example of the  change blindness  illusion  These two alternating images contain several differences that most people struggle to find right away  It emphasizes the fact that perception is active and demands attention 
Traditional neuropsychological research widely acknowledged that when an internal representation of the outside world is activated somewhere in the brain  it leads to a perceptual experience  Embodied cognition challenges this claim by stating that the existence of cortical maps in the brain fails to explain and account for the subjective character of people s perceptual experiences              For example  they cannot sufficiently explain the apparent stability of the visual world despite eye movements  the filling in of the blind spot  or visual illusions such as  change blindness  which reveal apparent imperfections in the visual system              From an embodied cognition perspective  perception is not a passive reception of  incomplete  sensory inputs for which the brain must compensate to provide us with a coherent picture  The brain interprets the outside world based on an individual s intentions  memories  and emotions  as well as the environment and the specific situation the individual is in  Perception involves more complex processes than simply receiving inputs  or visual stimuli  from the external world to output actions in response to them  Perception is an active process conducted by a perceiving agent  a perceiver               it entails an engaged perceiver and is influenced by the agent s experiences and intentions  its bodily states  and the interaction between the agent s body and the environment around it 
One example of such active interaction between perception and the body is the case that distance perception can be influenced by bodily states  The way people view the outside world can differ depending on the physical resources that individuals have such as fitness  age  or glucose levels  For instance  in one study  people with chronic pain who are less capable of moving around perceived given distances as further than healthy people did              Another study shows that intended actions can affect processing in visual search  with more orientation errors for pointing than for grasping              Because orientation is important when grasping an object  the plan to grasp an object is thought to improve orientation accuracy              This shows how actions  the body s interaction with the environment  can contribute to the visual processing of task relevant information 
Perception also influences the perspective individuals to take on a particular situation and the type of judgments they make  For instance  researchers have shown that people will significantly more likely take the perspective of another person  e g   a person in a picture  instead of their own when making judgements about objects in a photograph              This means that the presence of people  as compared to only objects  in a visual scene affects the perspective a viewer takes when making judgements on  for example  relations between objects in the scene  Some researchers state that these results suggest a  disembodied  cognition given the fact that people take the perspective of others instead of their own and make judgments accordingly              

Language edit 
See also  Embodied language processing
Embodied cognition views on language describes how when humans comprehend words  sensorimotor areas are involved in interacting with the objects and entities the words refer to              
First experimental studies of the impact of body s sex  age and constitution  temperament  on language perception and use emerged in         and expanded from     s             
           
            
The embodiment effect initially was called  projection through capacities  and emerged as a tendency of people attribute meaning to common adjectives and abstract and neutral nouns depending on their endurance  tempo  plasticity  emotionality  sex or age                                     For example  in these studies males with stronger motor physical endurance estimated abstractions describing people   work reality  and time related concepts in more positive terms than males with a weaker endurance  Females with stronger social or physical endurance estimated social attractors in more positive terms than weaker females  Both male and female temperament groups with higher sociability showed a universal positive bias in their estimations of social concepts  in comparison to participants with lower sociability 
Over the last years  behavioral and neural evidence has shown that the process of language comprehension activates motor simulations             and involves motor systems                                      Some researchers have investigated mirror neurons to illustrate the link between the mirror neuron systems and language suggesting that some aspects of language  such as part of semantics and phonology  can be embodied in the sensorimotor system represented by mirror neurons             
It is well known that language has a multi component structure  one of which is language comprehension  Research on embodied cognition shows that language comprehension involves the motor system                          In addition  various studies explain that understanding linguistic explanations of actions is based on a simulation of the action described              These action simulations also include evaluation of the motor system              A study in which university students evaluated language comprehension and motor system with a pendulum swinging task while performing a  sentence judgment task  found significant changes in functions containing performable sentences 
Another study used the mirror neurons perspective to illustrate the relationship between the motor system and several language components  Because mirror neurons are one of the essential parts of the motor system  researchers compared monkeys and humans in an anatomical framework  specifically  they made the comparison with respect to Broca s area              Another study concerning the role of mirror neurons during learning via language usage stated that activations occurred in Broca s area even when participants watched other people s conversations without hearing the sounds              An fMRI study examining the relationship of mirror neurons in humans with linguistic materials has shown that there are activations in the premotor cortex and Broca s area when reading or listening to sentences associated with actions              According to these findings  researchers state that there is a connection between the motor system and language  They also argue that the motor system together with mirror neurons mechanisms can process certain aspects of language             
As of          update       literature mainly focuses on the relation between language and embodied cognition on a motor system  more precisely by mirror neuron explanations  This relationship also extends to cognitive capabilities which involve a variety of language components  Studies have examined how embodied and extended cognition can help to reconceptualize and ground second language acquisition              The nature of language acquisition extends cognitive capability itself due to the fact that it has multiple components which have embodied representations associated with language processing and provide a ground concept for language             

Memory edit 
The body has an essential role in shaping the mind  So  the mind must be understood in the context of its relationship with a physical body that interacts in the world  These interactions can also be cognitive activities in everyday life  such as driving  chatting  and imagining the placement of items in a room  These cognitive activities are limited by memory capacity              The relationships between memory and embodied cognition have been demonstrated in studies in different fields and through various tasks  In general  studies on embodied cognition and memory investigate how manipulations on the body cause changes in memory performance  or vice versa  manipulations through memory tasks subsequently lead to bodily changes              Researchers have drawn attention to the relationship between memory and action from an embodied cognition approach where memory is defined as integrated patterns of actions limited by the body              On the one hand  embodied cognition sees action preparation as a fundamental function of cognition  On the other hand  memory plays a role in tasks that do not occur in the present but involve remembering actions and information from the past and imagining events that may or may not happen in the future  Glenberg blurs this apparent dichotomy by arguing that there is a reciprocal relationship between memory  action  and perception  Accordingly  manipulations that can take place in the body or movement can lead to changes in memory                         
Researchers have also investigated the influence of body position on ease of recall in an autobiographical memory study to examine the effect of embodied cognition on memory performance                          Participants were asked to take positions compatible or incompatible with their original body position of the remembered event during a recall event  Researchers found out that participants given compatible body positions compared to incompatible body positions showed faster responses in recalling memories during the experiment  Thus  they concluded that body position facilitates access to autobiographical memories              The relationship between memory and body has also emphasised that memory systems depend on the body s experiences with the world  This is particularly evident in episodic memory because this type of memories in the episodic memory system are defined by their content and are remembered as experienced by the person who is remembering              Research has also investigated the relationship between embodiment and memory by recalling collective and personal memories indicating how embodiment enriches the understanding of memory              Embodied memory research through the recalling of personal traumas and violent memories has reported that people who have experienced trauma or violence re feel their experiences in their narratives throughout their lives  In addition  memories that threaten a person s life by directly affecting the body  such as injury and physical violence  recreate similar reactions again in the body while remembering the event  For example  people can report feeling smells  sounds  and movements when remembering childhood trauma memories  A proper evaluation of those memories and the corresponding physical and physiological phenomena associated with them could describe how those set of recalled memories are embodied             
New perspectives on the neural structure and memory processes underlying embodied cognition  episodic memory  recall  and recognition have also been explored                          As experiences are received  neural states are reenacted in action  perception  and introspection systems  Perception includes sensory modalities  motor modalities include movement  and introspection includes emotional  mental  and motivational states  All of these modalities altogether constitute different aspects that shape experiences  Therefore  cognitive processes applied to memory support the action that is appropriate for a particular situation  not by remembering what the situation is  but by remembering the relationship of the action to that situation              For example  remembering and identifying the party one attended the previous day is said to be related to the body because the sensory motor aspects of the event that is being recalled  i e   the party   along with the details of what happened  are being reconstructed                         

Learning edit 
Research on embodied cognition and learning suggests that learning could occur and be triggered by perception action interactions of the body with the surrounding environment  An embodied cognitive approach to child development provides insights into how infants attain spatial knowledge and develop spatial skills that allow them to  successfully  interact with the world around them              Most infants learn to walk in the first    months of life  which draws on ample new opportunities for exploring things around them  In this exploration  infants learn spatial relations  and by carrying objects from one place to another  they may also learn affordances such as  transportability               Thereafter  new phases in exploration may occur through which infants can discover other even more elaborate affordances              According to Eleanor Gibson  exploration takes an essential place in cognitive development  For example  infants explore whatever is in their vicinity by seeing  mouthing  or touching it before learning to reach objects nearby  Then  infants learn to crawl  which enables them to seek out objects beyond reaching distance  learn basic spatial relations between themselves  objects  and others  and get an understanding of depth and distance              This development of motor skills through the exploration of the physical and social world seems to play a central role in visual spatial cognition             
Embodied perception action experience may serve as a tool for learning that extends across the life span  from infancy to adulthood              Research on the role of action in early as well as educational learning contexts demonstrates the importance of embodiment for learning  In one experiment  three month old infants who were not skilled in reaching were trained to reach for objects with velcro covered mittens instead  Afterward  the assessments and comparison with the control group showed that infants can rapidly form goal based action representations and view others  actions as goal directed              Further research indicates that mere observational experience by infants does not produce these results              Similarly  research has shown how action and bodily movements can be used as scaffolds for learning  A study investigating whether infants at high risk for developing autism spectrum disorders  ASD  could benefit from action scaffolded interventions  reaching experiences  during early development indicates an increase in grasping activity following training  And thus  it provides evidence about the possibility for high risk of ASD infants to learn and respond to action based treatment interventions              Another study investigates how teaching methods can benefit from embodiment and proposes that a professor s movements and gestures contribute to learning by growing students  embodied experiences in the classroom  leading to an increased capacity to recall             
The action based language theory  ABL  states that aspects of embodiment are also relevant for language learning and acquisition  ABL proposes that the brain exploits the same mechanisms used in motor control for language learning  When adults  for example  call attention to an object and an infant follows the lead and attends to said object  canonical neurons are activated and affordances of an object become available to the infant  Simultaneously  hearing the articulation of the object s name leads to the activation of speech mirror mechanisms in infants  This chain of events allows for Hebbian learning of the meaning of verbal labels by linking the speech and action controllers  which get activated in this scenario             
The role of gestures in learning is another example of the importance of embodiment for cognition  Gestures can aid  facilitate and enhance learning performance                                         or compromise it when the gestures are restricted              or meaningless to the content that is being transmitted               In a study using the Tower of Hanoi  TOH  puzzle  participants were divided into two groups  In the first part of the experiment  the smallest disks used in TOH were the lightest and could be moved using just one hand  For the second part  this was reversed for one group  switch group  so that the smallest disks were the heaviest  and participants needed both hands to move them  The disks remained the same for the other group  no switch group   After the experiment ended  participants were asked to explain their solution while researchers monitored their gestures when describing their solution  The results showed that using gestures affected the performance of the switch group in the second part of the experiment  The more they used one handed gestures to depict their solution in the first part of the experiment  the worse they performed in the second part              
A study investigating the role of gestures in second language learning states that learning the vocabulary with self performed gestures increases learning outcomes  The enduring benefits continued even after two and six months post learning  In addition  the same study also investigated the neural correlates of learning a second language with gestures  The results indicate that left premotor areas and the superior temporal sulcus  a brain region responsible for visual processing of biological motion  were activated during learning with gestures               Similarly  an fMRI study showed that children who learned to solve mathematical problems using a speech and gesture strategy were more likely to have activation in motor regions of the brain  The activation of motor regions occurred during scans in which children were not using gestures to solve the problems  These findings indicate that learning with gestures creates a neural trace of the motor system that goes beyond the learning phase and activates when children engage with problems they learned to solve with gestures              
Embodied cognition has also been linked to both reading and writing  Research shows that physical and perceptual engagements congruent with the content of the reading material can boost reading comprehension  Findings also suggest that the benefits accrued from handwriting as compared to typing in letter recognition and written communication result from the more embodied nature of handwriting              

Reasoning edit 
Experiments investigating the relation between motor processes and high level reasoning have suggested that bodily action and sensorimotor experience are linked to various aspects of reasoning  A study indicated that even though most individuals recruit visual processes when presented with spatial problems such as mental rotation tasks               motor experts  such as wrestlers  favor motor processes over visual encoding to manipulate the objects mentally  showing higher overall performance  Results indicate that motor experts  performance drops once the  hand  movement is inhibited               A related study showed that motor experts use similar processes for the mental rotation of body parts and polygons  whereas non experts treated these stimuli differently               These results were not due to underlying confounds  as demonstrated by a training study that showed mental rotation improvements after a one year motor training compared with controls               Similar patterns were also found in working memory tasks  with the ability to remember movements being significantly disrupted by a secondary verbal task in controls and by a motor task in motor experts  suggesting the involvement of different mechanisms to encode movements based on either verbal or on motor processes              

Demonstration of dynamic depictive gestures for the Triangle conjecture
The role of motor experience in reasoning has also been investigated through gestures  The Gesture as Simulated Action theory  GSA  provides a framework for understanding how gestures manifest their connection               According to GSA  gestures result from the embodied simulation of actions and sensorimotor states  Consequently  gesturing while expressing or reasoning ideas shows that embodied processes are involved in producing them  More significantly  gesturing heightens focus and increases activation of motor and perceptual information  Gestures are said to have a casual role in reasoning as gesturing leads to increased motor and perceptual information flow during the reasoning process  This does not necessarily translate into more effective reasoning  as such information is sometimes irrelevant for a specific problem               The effects of gestures on reasoning are not limited only to speakers  they convey information that also affects listeners  reasoning  For example  listeners could produce similar simulations to those of the speaker by attending to the speaker s gestures              
More evidence for the embodied role of gestures during reasoning comes from studies on mathematical and geometric reasoning  Studies indicate that gestures and  more particularly  dynamic depictive gestures  i e   gestures used to represent and show the transformation of objects  are linked to better performance in snap judgment  intuition   insight  and mathematical reasoning for proof               Additionally  the use of dynamic depictive gestures are associated with better mathematical reasoning  and thus  directing learners to use such gestures facilitates justification and proof activities 
Embodied cognition theory has been applied in behavioral law and economics theory to enlighten reasoning and decision making processes involving risk and time  decisions  and judgment  Research has shown that the idea that mental processes are grounded in bodily states is not being captured in the standard view of human rationality and the link between them could be useful for understanding and predicting human actions that seem irrational  The concept of  embodied rationality  results from expanding such ideas into law and highlights how findings stemming from embodied cognition offer a more encompassing insight into human behavior and rationality              

Emotion edit 
Response times for the positive  negative  and neutral valence conditions in the approach and avoidance experiment  Participants were significantly faster for the  positive toward  condition regardless of the central word s valence 
Embodied cognition theories have provided rigorous accounts of emotion and the processing of information about emotion                            In this respect  experiencing and re experiencing an emotion involve overlapping mental processes  Research has shown that one re experiences emotion through the interconnections of the neurons that were active during the original experience  During the re experience process  a partial multimodal reenactment of the experience is produced                            One reason why only parts of the original neural populations are reactivated is that attention is selectively focused on certain aspects of the experience that are most salient and important for the individual 
The first theory of embodiment effect on emotions is known as James Lange theory  after   th century scientists William James and Carl Lange  They pointed out that physiological arousal prior events generates a disposition to experience emotions  and so emotions are not just reactions to these events but are also reflections of dispositional body s states              
Re experience of emotion is produced in the originally implicated sensory motor systems as if the individual were there  in the very situation  the very emotional state  or with the very object of thought               For example  the embodiment of anger might involve muscle tension used to strike  the enervation of certain facial muscles to frown  etc               Such simulation is backed by a specialized mirror neuron or a  mirror neuron system   which maps the correspondences between the observed and performed actions               A remaining issue is the lack of consensus about the exact location of the mirror neurons  whether they constitute a system  and whether there actually are mirror neurons 
Theories of embodiment propose that the processing of emotional states and the concepts used to refer to them are partly based on one s own perceptual  motor  and somatosensory systems               Research has shown  through manipulations of facial expressions and posture under controlled laboratory settings  how the embodiment of a person s emotion casually affects the way emotional information is processed                            Similar studies have evidenced that nodding the head while listening to persuasive messages led to more positive attitudes toward the message than when shaking the head               When people are led to adopt certain bodily positions indirectly associated with different feelings such as fear  anger  and sadness  these corporeal postures are said to modulate the experienced affect               In a series of experiments on the neurobiological basis of language  researchers investigated the role of embodiment in emotional language through electromyographic  EMG  measurements of specific muscle regions  They found that action verbs that refer to positive emotional expressions  e g   to smile  elicit smile muscle activation as compared to mere positive adjectives unrelated to actions  e g   funny   Further research found that action verb stimuli also yield muscle activation and shape judgment only when muscle activation is not inhibited  Thus  these results suggest that language is embodied rather than symbolic              
Given the significant role emotions  e g   fear and hope  play in an individual s life  research has been done linking embodiment  motivation  and behavior to investigate the intrinsic tendencies to act towards or away from a given stimulus                            The approach and avoidance conflict  AAC  or approach and avoidance task  AAT  describes a natural behavioral bias to approach pleasant stimuli and avoid unpleasant ones  congruent response  faster than approaching unpleasant stimuli and avoiding pleasant ones  incongruent responses  

The approach and avoidance task  The top image depicts the zooming out effect for avoidance and the bottom image the zooming in effect for approach  as indicated by the arrows on the computer screen   The smaller images exemplify the approach and avoidance task performed by participants when using either the response pad or the joystick The approach avoidance distinction is fundamental and basic to motivation  so much that it may be used as a conceptual lens through which to view the structure and function of self regulation             
The AAT has been investigated in different scenarios and with different types of stimuli such as words and images  A study focusing on the AAT on embodied cognition  for example  examined people s response to positive and negative words presented on the center of a screen by moving them away or towards the center  The study concludes that participants moved the given positive words towards the center of the screen while moving the negative words away from the center of the screen  In conformity with the AAT  participants showed an approach effect for positive words and avoidance effects for negative words               In a      study on emotional or affective priming  the AAT was used to demonstrate the interaction between emotions and visual exploration  Pictures of news pages were presented on the computer screen and eye movements were measured  Researchers found out that the participants  harmonious bodily interaction during the emotional preparation process shows that their interest in the image s content displayed on the computer screen increased  These findings demonstrate the effect of emotional priming in the approach and avoidance behavior               A study on the behavioral aspects of the AAT suggests that there is an embodied component that is crucial to it               To investigate the role of gestures in AAT  participants were asked to react to positive and negative stimuli by either pressing a  far or near  button on a response pad  or by pushing forward or pulling backward a joystick   Researchers reported a significant response time advantage for the congruent responses when performed with the joystick and none when performed with the response pad  The fact that participants are faster at responding to the stimuli with the joystick seems to suggest the role of a crucial embodied component  In contrast to the response pad  the joystick couples more naturally with the body  hand  for the performance of the action and facilitates the gesture of approaching or avoiding positive or negative stimuli 
Evolutionary psychologists view emotion as an important self regulatory aspect of embodied cognition  and emotion as a motivator towards goal relevant action               Emotion helps drive adaptive behavior   The evolutionary perspective considers both spoken and written language as forms of embodied cognition               Pacing and non verbal communication reflect embodied cognition in spoken language  Technical aspects of written language  such as italics  all caps  and emoticons  promote an inner voice and thereby a sense of feeling rather than thinking about a written message               At least some abstract words are said to be semantically grounded in emotional knowledge  they are  embodied   Whereas the meanings of the words  eye  and  grasp  can be explained to a degree  by pointing to objects and actions  those of  beauty  and  freedom  can not   Abstract terms show a strong tendency to be semantically linked to knowledge about emotions                            In addition  abstract words strongly activate the anterior cingulate cortex  a site known to be relevant for emotion processing  Motor system activation for emotion expressing body parts was found when adults processed abstract emotion words               indicating that  for one important class of abstract concepts  semantic grounding in emotion expressing action can partly explain the meaning symbol link              

Self regulation edit 
The basic idea underlying findings on embodied cognition is that cognition is composed of experiences that are multimodal and spread throughout the body  not in a way that amodal semantic nodes are stored purely in the mind  In line with this idea of embodied cognition  the body itself can also be involved in self regulation              
Self regulation can be defined as the capacity of organisms to successfully implement goal consistent responses despite distracting or countervailing influences               Most people undergo a dilemma when they encounter immediate pains to gain long term benefits                             When facing this dilemma  the body can help augment willpower by evoking nonconscious willpower strengthening goals that boost people s ongoing conscious attempts to facilitate their pursuit of long term goals              
In a study  the effect of muscle firming on donating money to Haiti was investigated  The participants either held the pen to fill out the donation sheet in their fingers   control conditions   or in their hands   muscle firming  condition   Significantly  more participants of the  muscle firming  group donated money than of the control group  One can therefore deduce that firming one s muscles can help to get over their physical aversion to viewing the devastation in Haiti and spending money               Similarly  physical or environmental cues signal the energetic costs of action and  subsequently  influence willingness to engage in additional volitional action               Studies have also shown that exposure to physical or conceptual thirst or dryness related cues reduces perceived energy and  successively  decreases self regulation  These studies suggest that embodied cognition can play a role in self regulation              
Some suggest that the embodied mind serves self regulatory processes by combining movement and cognition to reach a goal  Thus  the embodied mind has a facilitative effect  To navigate the social world  one must approach helpful resources such as friends and avoid dangers like foes  Facial expression can be a signal for evaluation of whether a person is desirable or dangerous  Embodied cognition can aid in clarifying others  emotions when emotional signals may be ambiguous               In a study  participants were able to identify expression shifts faster when they mimicked them in contrast to participants holding a pen in their mouths that froze their facial muscles  therefore  unable to mimic facial expressions               Other goal relevant actions may be encouraged by embodied cognition  as evidenced by the automated approach and avoidance of certain environmental cues  Embodied cognition is also influenced by the situation  If one moves in a way previously associated with danger  the body may require a higher level of information processing than if the body moves in a way associated with a benign situation  The studies above may suggest that embodied cognition could serve a functional purpose by assisting in self regulatory processes 

Social cognition edit 
Results from a social embodied cognition study that illustrate the relationship between positive emotions  observed behavioral synchrony  and embodied rapport             
In social psychology  and more specifically in social cognition  research focuses on how people interact and influence one another  In the context of embodiment  research in social cognition investigates how the presence of people and interactions between them affects each other s thoughts  feelings  and behavior               More precisely  social cognition proposes that thoughts  feelings  and behavior are grounded in sensorimotor experiences and bodily states              

Visual Perspective Taking  VDP   From his perspective  the ball is not visible  VDP   The woodpile is on the left of the tree              
In the field of phenomenology  Merleau Ponty s intercorporeity     transl         means that when meeting a person  one initially experiences the other person via their bodily expressions  which has an impact before cognitive reflections               This phenomenon is investigated in social psychology and is known as nonverbal synchrony               Synchrony during social interaction arises spontaneously and is often independent of conscious information processing              
In a dyadic social interaction study from       same sex participants interacted verbally in  cooperative    competitive   and  fun task  conditions  The focus of this study was to investigate the connection between the participants  affectivity and nonverbal synchrony  Results showed that positive emotions were associated with positive synchrony while negative emotions were associated negatively  Other findings describe a causal relation between synchrony and emotions with synchrony leading to affect rather than vice versa               In a similar study  same sex participant pairs were instructed to alternate asking certain questions and to progressively self disclose  Results show that people spontaneously move together in space and synchronize their movement  enhancing the quality of interaction  embodied rapport   Self disclosure and behavioral synchrony correlate with positive emotions towards another person               These two exemplary studies describe how nonverbal  behavioral synchrony of bodily movements influences the psychological experience of the interaction between people  These findings support the embodiment thesis idea of bodily experiences affecting people s psychological and emotional states 
One aspect of social cognition concerns perspective taking  which consists in perceiving a situation from another person s point of view  Two categories of perspective taking include visual and spatial perspective taking  Visual perspective taking  VPT  is defined as viewing a situation from another person s point of view and understanding how they see the world  Spatial perspective taking  SPT  involves the ability to access what spatial information another viewer is perceiving  such as the orientation of objects in relation to each other               Accordingly  VPT has two different levels  VPT  refers to understanding what is in someone else s point of view  VPT  entails adopting this point of view and understanding how the world is represented from this point of view  Both levels are grounded and situated  yet it is only VPT  that is embodied  it is only VPT  that relies on deliberate movement simulation               In the case of SPT  research has shown that not only the presence of another person in the position of potential actions on objects leads to SPT in participants  but also phrasing the query in terms of actions increases the number of people who participate in SPT               The embodiment of SPT is also dependent on sex and social skills  Males and people with lower social skills are said to have lower levels of embodiment in SPT as compared to females and people with higher social skills              
Research suggests that aging affects social cognition and perspective taking  In one study  four experiments evaluated implicit and explicit VPT as well as executive and social cognition measures in healthy young and older adults  Congruency effect  the detrimental effect of congruency of the alternative perspective on response time and accuracy  was detected in both egocentric and allocentric conditions in explicit VPT  and VPT   Incongruencies in VPT  less influenced older adults  In VPT   older adults showed a more significant congruency effect and influence of allocentric perspective during egocentric judgment  These results could explain the impairment of older adults in social tasks that rely on perspective taking                     

Sensorimotor contingencies edit 
As a part of the embodied cognition theory  proponents suggest that an organism s sensory and the motor systems are dynamically integrated  This idea is known as sensorimotor coupling which allows sensory information to be efficiently used during action  Similarly  the concept of sensorimotor contingencies  SMCs  states that the quality of perception is determined by the knowledge of how sensory information changes when one acts in the world  As an example  to look underneath an object  one has to bend down  shift one s head  and change the gaze direction               Proponents of the SMCs theory argue that every stimulus modality   sensory modality such as light  sound pressure  etc  follow specific rules  i e  sensorimotor contingencies  that govern those changes of sensory information  Consequentially  since those rules differ between modalities  also the qualitative experience of them differs              There are multiple examples that highlight the distinction between SMCs of different modalities  An instance of an SMC distinct for the visual percept is the expansion of the flow pattern on the retina when the body moves forward and the analogous contraction when the body moves backward              In contrast  auditory SMCs are affected by head rotations which change the temporal asynchrony of a received signal between the right and the left ear  This movement mainly affects the amplitude and not the frequency of the sensory input             
Support for the SMCs theory is brought forward by studies on sensory substitution and research on the field of robotics  Research on sensory substitution and sensory substitution devices investigates the replacement of one modality by another  e g  visual information replaced by tactile information                The core idea is that sensorimotor contingencies of one modality are transmitted via another modality  Sensory augmentation aims for the perception of a new sense via already existing perceptual channels  In this case  sensory augmentation allows for new sensorimotor contingencies to be formed  In the field of robotics  researchers investigate  for example  how visual SMCs are learned on a neural level with the help of a robotic arm and dynamic neural fields              

Applications edit 
Over the past years  embodied cognition research has gradually redeemed the scientific study of bodily experiences and simultaneously laid a theoretical and empirical foundation across multiple disciplines               Principles and findings underlying embodied cognition have begun to be transferred and applied in several fields ranging from education  robotics  clinical settings  social psychology  sports  to music 

Education edit 
Energy Theater  A learning activity for energy dynamics that relies on embodied cognition 
Embodied cognition findings have been translated into an overhaul of educational and teaching practices in favor of embodied learning and teaching methods  In particular  such embodied practices feature prominently in science education               For example  Energy Theater is a method for teaching about energy dynamics based on the embodied interaction theory  In this method  participants each play the role of a unit of energy  and together  they enact the transformation and transfer of energy in specific scenarios              
The Human Orrery is another embodied educational method in which students learn about the Solar System through enactment  In this method  the position of the planets is marked by disks  and the participants enact the role of the planets by moving on their orbits

In a survey from       researchers analyzed several frameworks that bring embodied cognition theory into clever classroom practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics               The embodied design based research program identifies and classifies at least two forms of embodied designs  perception and action based designs  In perception based designs  the target is a b concepts such as likelihood  slope  and proportional equivalence in geometrical similitude  The first step in this design involves asking students to use their na ve worldview to judge a set of material presented to them by their teacher  which affirms their na ve worldview  Afterward  teachers provide students with appropriate media and attempt to guide them to build models by following the formal procedure  In action based designs  learners are presented with sensorimotor problems  Abrahamson and colleagues developed the  Mathematical Imagery Trainer  platform to explore this design  In one particular version of this platform  designed to teach proportions to learners  they moved two cursors with both hands to turn a screen green  The screen would only turn green when the height of right and left hands from the base had a particular ratio  Once learners discovered the strategy to solve this problem  the grid and numerals are added to the screen to shift learners from a qualitative to a quantitative understanding of the concept at hand              
Overall  embodied cognition has served as a new framework for exploring the learning process and developing new educational practices  The older educational methods are slowly being replaced or complemented by the new approaches inspired by embodied cognition theory              

AI and robotics edit 
Embodied cognition has significantly impacted artificial intelligence  AI  and robotics  it has contributed to the drastic changes AI has been through over the last years               Insights from embodied cognition have allowed researchers to build more dynamic robots with more fluid and more expressive motions facilitating better performance in complex scenarios 
Shakey the robot is a well known milestone in AI  it was one of the first approaches to building mobile robots capable of reasoning about their own actions and performing specific tasks in a determined environment  Shakey had a relatively simple body and followed commands by itself  melding logical reasoning with physical action to navigate in a room  A limitation was that Shakey s architecture  Lisp  relied heavily on symbolic computational principles that  consequently  demanded that it iterate through long command sequences to perform a particular action  Thus  Shakey was slow and could take days to complete particular tasks  Besides  Shakey s performance was constrained by a highly controlled environment

Embodied AI tries not to overlook or underestimate the  body  when creating AI systems  It poses that future research should move towards systems that incorporate embodied perspectives               The body as a contributor to states of the mind is seen as more than a mere follower of  algorithmic  instructions  Embodiment is said to shape intelligent information processing because  intelligence is fundamentally a result of embodied interaction which exploits structure in the world               
Embodied AI gave birth to situated robotic perspectives that included more versatile AI architectures  Situated robotics are based on an incremental approach to AI and reliance on parallel activity producers that interface effectively with action and perception               Unlike traditional robots  situated robots perform better in complex and dynamic environments that create unpredictable situations for robots most of the time               The behavior of these robots changes according to their environment so that they can deal with incredibility in various situations               For instance  social situations are rife with unpredictability  and social robots need to be able to predict all sorts of behaviors human or otherwise  In this vein  Jun Tani s lab has introduced an abstract brain model called PV RNN  based on the principle of free energy  and has incorporated a meta prior in it  While a high meta prior leads to a confident behavior generation in robots and ignores the behavior of other robots  robots with a low meta prior adapt to the behaviour of other robots and avoid generating their own behavioral pattern              
Instances of situated robots include aerial robots developed by companies such as senseFly  which produces fixed wing autonomous drones for professional use  owned by Parrot SA  and Flyability  which builds drones for the inspection and exploration of indoor and confined spaces  They rely on the research of Dario Floreano s laboratory on mini robots and evolutionary robotics              
Another example of situated robots is Atlas  Built in      by Boston Dynamics  Atlas is an anthropomorphic robot with a height of     m and a weight of         kg that can move with agility and diversity in various situations  The algorithms of Atlas allow for the complex and dynamic interaction between its body and the environment  The movement of Atlas is driven by perception and has evolved over time from on fly adjustment to perceiving its environment              

Clinical settings edit 
The experience of the phantom limb illusion  which occurs after a limb has been amputated
The procedures and methods of investigation in clinical neuropsychology have been directly influenced by localization and computational approaches to cognition  These techniques have made numerous contributions to the development of clinical practice  Embodied cognition broadens the scope of clinical practice by providing a more comprehensive view of cognitive processes under both normal and pathological conditions by highlighting the role of the body and sensory motor experience in cognition  Thereby  challenging the integration of embodied cognitive practices in clinical assessment and diagnosis processes               For instance  there exist a number of interventions and therapies which are incorporating the ability of the body to influence cognitive states to aid individuals with psychological difficulties               An example is the already established use of behavioral treatments for children s disorders such as autism                                         Another example of embodied integrative therapies involves sensorimotor retraining as well as stimulation techniques to prevent  reduce  or release pain associated with phantom limbs               Also  fields of psychotherapy  body oriented psychotherapy and somatic psychology   which are prominent in Europe and encompasses embodied interventions such as dance and movement therapy  have begun to receive more empirical support               Vittorio Guidano s post rationalist cognitive therapy builds on Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela s theory of autopoiesis and postulates that human knowledge is emotional and embodied  One of the most common integrative treatments of mental illness to the western psychosocial sphere is via mindfulness practices and exercise                           

Sport edit 
Embodied cognitive perspectives can inform and impact motor skill research in the fields of sport and sport psychology               Studies have shown that the embodiment thesis comes into action through many ways in sport such as sport related action specific perception  understanding  prediction  judgement                                         training               and language comprehension                            From an embodied cognition perspective  a study examined the relationship between previous motor and visual experience and the current officiating experience of expert judges and referees               It was reported that sports judges who had performed the judged tasks and or had experience observing others perform the specific tasks would achieve better in judging a specific sport activity compared to someone without this motor and observational experience  In another study  reading comprehension and memory were shown to be improved if the subject would simultaneously read the description of certain physical activity  e g  basketball actions  and perform physical manipulations that were consistent with them               The action based theory of reading comprehension states that the sensory system and motor system are involved during the process of understanding  imagining  and remembering an action described in a story  as if the reader was actually perceiving or executing that action               These and similar studies show the influence of embodied cognition in sport and sport psychology 

Music edit 
Main article  Embodied music cognition
Embodied music cognition is a paradigm that puts forward the idea that bodily interactions with music significantly affect music cognition               Researchers proposed that musical emotions  meaning  and the feelings evoked by listening to music  are the vehicle for the embodiment of abstract thoughts  Thus music has a specific cognitive function that allows for this possibility               Researcher have suggested embodied music cognition occurs at two levels  the surface level and the primary level  The surface level includes psychomotor activities of a music performer  visible bodily reactions to music  and rhythmic entrainment  The primary level of embodied music cognition is the tonal temporal encoding of it  it commands the surface level              
The research on embodied music cognition focuses on two main trends  exploring embodiment and expanding the concept of embodiment in music  The first trend includes studies investigating bodily articulation and gesturing in relation to music               Embodied music cognition considers musical experiences from an action and perception viewpoint               One can observe that many people move when they listen to music  in many cultures there is no clear distinction between music and dance  Through the different movements of the body  it is assumed that people are able to give meaning to music  This perspective is different from the traditional approach to music cognition  which bases musical meaning on merely perception based analysis of musical structure  Through the measurement of sounds  movement  human physiology  and computational modeling  embodied music cognition is constantly building up reliable knowledge about the role of the human body in musical meaning formation  Embodied music cognition is potentially applicable to better understand the role of music in social interactions  Multiple studies show that children move more synchronously with music when they dance as a group              
The second trend includes studies that strive to connect embodied music cognition to other research fields such as neurology and psychology               For example  a study showed that people who have Parkinson s disease and are primed by music instead of metronomes beeps are capable of both entrainment and control  The study suggests that using the body to produce timed sequences of action  particularly when music is used as a pacing cue  allows people who have Parkinson s disease to achieve similar performance levels as healthy individuals              

Social psychology edit 
The embodiment has also important potential applications in social psychology  where researchers have studied how people s own bodily states influence their understanding and interaction with others  Researchers have provided evidence demonstrating the influence of bodily states on social judgments and social behavior  They described that people s experiences with physical temperature per se can influence their perceptions of and prosocial behavior toward other people  without their awareness               When people engage in motor movements that symbolized a particular social category  it primes the use of such category in social judgment              
Activists have tried to combine social psychology research with principles of embodiment to further their goals  For instance  virtual reality  VR  has been used in what is called virtual reality therapy to invoke empathy in viewers  The New York Times created a VR project to display the experience of child refugees called  The Displaced   By grounding users in the experience of child refugees from different countries  this project triggered strong empathy in viewers               In the    x    project  Guardian has used VR to replicate the experience of solitary confinement in American prisons                Notes on Blindness  Into Darkness  released in        an exploration of the sensory  emotional  psychological experience of blindness using VR              

Controversy edit 
Research on embodied cognition is extremely broad  covering a wide range of concepts  Methods to study how human cognition is embodied vary from experiment to experiment based on the operational definition used by researchers  The evidence supporting embodiment abounds within the different sciences  yet the interpretation of results and their significance are still disputed and researchers continue looking for appropriate ways to study and explain embodied cognition              
Interbrain neuroscience research                                                     in adults and growing evidence of goal directed behavior in fetuses                                                                                            raise doubts regarding independence and self sufficiency of the embodied cognition position               Indeed  there are severe concerns about this viewpoint as the only possible way to explain cognitive development in organisms at an early stage  it seems that the complex process of emerging cognition requires complementary views              

Binding problem edit 
The binding problem is the viewpoint on how organisms at the simple reflexes stage of development overcome the threshold of the environmental chaos of sensory stimuli               Using mathematical tools of communication theory  it shows the insuperable high threshold of the cacophony of environmental stimuli  the stimuli noise  for young organisms at the onset of life  While young organisms need to combine objects  backgrounds  and abstract or emotional features into a single experience to build a surrounding reality  they cannot independently distinguish relevant sensory stimuli  Even the embodied dynamical system approach cannot get around the cue to noise problem               This ability requires categorizing the environment into objects that come into being through  and only after  perception and intentionality                            Embodied cognition position does not solve this problem 

Research with preverbal infants edit 
Researchers have suggested that pre verbal infants may be considered an ideal and naturalistic case for studying embodied cognition  especially embodied social cognition since they utilise symbols less than adults do               Some researchers have criticised this notion since it may be impossible to know which stage of a preverbal infant is supposed to be the  ideal model  for embodied social cognition  as infant cognition changes dramatically throughout the preverbal period  A   month old has reached a different developmental stage than a   month old              
Another major issue is whether or not a particular ability reflects an embodied mode of processing  Looking time  for example  is said to likely be a better measure of embodied cognition than reaching because infants that age lack certain fine motor skills  Infants may first develop a passive mode of embodied cognition before they develop the active mode involving fine motor movements  Researchers have described how this is problematic in that there is no apparent reason to suppose that the abilities described through looking time paradigm reflect embodied processing               For the distinction between embodied and symbolic modes of processing to be useful in generating testable experimental hypotheses  it must be clear what sort of evidence could  at least in principle  allow a researcher to determine whether or not any particular ability is embodied              

Replication crisis and misinterpretation edit 
A methodological phenomenon in the sciences is the replication crisis  Inside the field of embodied cognition  it indicates that certain findings have failed to be reproduced with the same results as the originals  Such studies have in common the embodiment idea that bodily experiences influence cognitive processes that are typically considered as mental  For  example  power posing which is classified under embodied cognition because it states that having a person physically expand their body increases their confidence  failed to be replicated in several cases               Similarly  studies indicating that weight sensations activate concepts of importance               which in turn may affect morality related variables  has also failed to be replicated               Researchers also could not replicate the previous findings claiming that holding a warm cup creates a sense of interpersonal warmth              
Researchers failing to replicate the same results does not prove cognition is unaffected uninfluenced by the body  There are still plenty of findings within the topic of embodied cognition that are scientifically sound  Some researchers state that many of the failed attempts to replicate embodiment findings are due to priming               And many cases of facilitative movements of the body due to priming may be incorrectly labeled as evidence of embodied cognition  The pencil in teeth study evidencing embodied cognition may be considered the result of priming               Researchers could have deduced that the quicker responses to positive sentences by participants engaging their smiling muscles indicated embodied cognition  Opponents argue that the effects obtained during this experiment were primed or facilitated by the engagement of certain facial muscles  Priming  pencil in teeth  lips  may causally induce certain perceptual motor activity that  in turn  induces certain cognitive processes  without the perceptual motor activity constituting cognitive processing
