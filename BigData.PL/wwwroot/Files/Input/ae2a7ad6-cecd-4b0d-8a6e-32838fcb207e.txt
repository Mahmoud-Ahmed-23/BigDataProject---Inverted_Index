Computer programming paradigm
In computer programming  symbolic programming is a programming paradigm in which the program can manipulate its own formulas and program components as if they were plain data            
Through symbolic programming  complex processes can be developed that build other more intricate processes by combining smaller units of logic or functionality   Thus  such programs can effectively modify themselves and appear to  learn   which makes them better suited for applications such as artificial intelligence  expert systems  natural language processing  and computer games 
Languages that support symbolic programming include homoiconic languages such as Wolfram Language             Lisp  Prolog             and Julia
