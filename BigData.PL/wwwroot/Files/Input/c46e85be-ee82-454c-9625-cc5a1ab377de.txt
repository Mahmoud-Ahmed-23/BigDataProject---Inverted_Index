Finnish mathematician and computer scientist
Seppo Ilmari Linnainmaa  born    September       is a Finnish mathematician and computer scientist known for creating the modern version of backpropagation 


Biography edit 
He was born in Pori             He received his MSc in      and introduced a reverse mode of automatic differentiation in his MSc thesis                        In      he obtained the first doctorate ever awarded in computer science at the University of Helsinki             In       he became Assistant Professor  From      to      he was Visiting Professor at the University of Maryland  USA  From      to      he was Chairman of the Finnish Artificial Intelligence Society  From      to       he was Research Professor at the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland  He retired in      

Backpropagation edit 
Explicit  efficient error backpropagation in arbitrary  discrete  possibly sparsely connected  neural networks like networks was first described in Linnainmaa s      master s thesis                        albeit without reference to NNs             when he introduced the reverse mode of automatic differentiation  AD   in order to efficiently compute the derivative of a differentiable composite function that can be represented as a graph  by recursively applying the chain rule to the building blocks of the function                                   Linnainmaa published it first  following Gerardi Ostrowski who had used it in the context of certain process models in chemical engineering some five years earlier  but didn t publish
