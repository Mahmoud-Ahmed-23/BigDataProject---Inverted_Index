History edit 
Bloomberg News was founded by Michael Bloomberg and Matthew Winkler in      to deliver financial news reporting to Bloomberg Terminal subscribers            
The agency was established in      with a team of six people             Winkler was first editor in chief             In       Bloomberg News included more than       editors and reporters in    countries and     news bureaus worldwide                       

Beginnings             edit 
Bloomberg Business News was created to expand the services offered through the terminals  According to Matthew Winkler  then a writer for The Wall Street Journal  Michael Bloomberg telephoned him in November      and asked   What would it take to get into the news business             
In his book  The Bloomberg Way  Winkler recalls a conversation with Bloomberg about a hypothetical ethical dilemma which could have arisen from Bloomberg s interest in creating a newspaper 

 You have just published a story that says the chairman and I mean chairman of your biggest customer has taken    million from the corporate till  He is with his secretary at a Rio de Janeiro resort  and the secretary s spurned boyfriend calls to tip you off  You get an independent verification that the story is true  Then the phone rings  The customer s public relations person says   Kill the story or we will return all the terminals we currently rent from you   
 What would you do   Winkler asked 

 Go with the story   Bloomberg replied   Our lawyers will love the fees you generate                         
Winkler recalls this as his  deciding moment   the time at which he became willing to help Bloomberg build his news organization                        
The publication was created to provide concise  timely financial news              As a new company in       Bloomberg hoped that the news service would spread the company name  sell more Bloomberg Terminals and end Bloomberg s reliance on the Dow Jones News Services            
The creation of Bloomberg Business News required Winkler to open a Bloomberg office in Washington  D C   to report about political effects on the business world  However  the Standing Committee of Correspondents  SCC  in Washington required Bloomberg News be formally accredited to act as a legitimate news source  a title that Bloomberg Business News only accomplished after agreeing to provide free terminals to major newspapers in exchange for news space in the publications             During this growth period Bloomberg News opened a small television station in New York  purchased New York radio station WNEW  launched fifteen minute weekday business news programs for broadcast on PBS  and opened offices in Hong Kong and Frankfurt  Germany            

          edit 
The initial goal of Bloomberg Business News to increase terminal sales was met by the mid     s and the company refocused the scope of its news service to rival the profitability of other media groups such as Reuters and Dow Jones  This led to the creation of Bloomberg s magazine  Bloomberg Personal  in       which was carried in the Sunday edition of    U S  papers              In       Bloomberg launched a    hour financial news service through Bloomberg Information Television  which was broadcast on DirecTV  Bloomberg also launched a web site to provide the audio feed of its radio broadcasts             Bloomberg Business News was renamed Bloomberg News in           citation needed     

          edit 
In      Bloomberg News and The Washington Post launched a global news service known as The Washington Post News Service with Bloomberg News  to provide economic and political news             
In April       Bloomberg News launched the Bloomberg Luxury lifestyle section of its paper              The section s content covers topics including travel  wine news  dining  auto news  gadgets  technology news  and more  It also highlights content from Bloomberg s quarterly lifestyle and luxury magazine  Pursuits      citation needed     

Business in China edit 
In       Bloomberg News published investigative series titled  Revolution to Riches   which focused on China s political elite  The series won that year s George Polk Award for International Reporting                          One story in the series delved into the family wealth of Chinese leader Xi Jinping              However  before publishing the Xi story  Bloomberg executives and senior editors met with Chinese diplomats twice  without informing the journalists working on the story              Zhang Yesui  the Chinese ambassador to the United States  reportedly threatened Bloomberg with consequences for its Chinese operations if it published the story              Bloomberg s editor in chief  Matthew Winkler  reportedly refused to stop the story from being published  Then CEO Daniel Doctoroff also reportedly defended the investigation and insisted on publishing it  although he insisted on changes to soften the story s impact              After the story was published in June       the Chinese government ordered state enterprises not to subscribe to Bloomberg News  The company s website was also blocked on Chinese servers  and it was unable to obtain visas for journalists it wanted to send to China             
The following year  Bloomberg shut down an ongoing investigation into the financial ties between a wealthy Chinese businessman and top Chinese leaders  families  Another planned article  about the children of senior Chinese officials employed by foreign banks  was also killed  according to Bloomberg employees              At least five journalists and editors  including the lead writer on the Xi story              left the company after news reports about the decision appeared              One of the journalists said Bloomberg had disparaged  the team that worked so hard to execute an incredibly demanding story  and claimed it threatened the journalists who worked on the story with legal action if they discussed the incident publicly                         
Bloomberg s top editors  including the senior editor on the stories  Laurie Hays  and editor in chief Matthew Winkler denied that the stories were killed              However  this was contradicted by several anonymous Bloomberg employees  According to one employee  Winkler had said   If we run the story  we ll be kicked out of China                           Michael Bloomberg  founder of the company  also denied the accusation  but noted that he had recused himself from the company s operations as he was mayor of New York             
After the incidents  Bloomberg set about trying to repair its relationship with the Chinese government  By       Bloomberg s reporters began receiving visas again              Bloomberg Chairman Peter Grauer told the staff at the Bloomberg Hong Kong bureau that the company s sales team had done a  heroic job  of mending relations with Chinese officials who had indicated their displeasure about the publication of the Xi revelations  He also warned that if Bloomberg  were to do anything like  the Xi story again  the company would  be straight back in the shit box              
Bloomberg was widely criticized for how it handled the controversy  Howard French  a professor of journalism  wrote that Bloomberg had  tainted its corporate identity and journalism brand to a degree that could last for years              

     refocus edit 
In       an internal memo written by editor in chief John Micklethwait was leaked to the public  This memo indicated an intent to refocus the agency to better target its core audience   the clever customer who is short of time   and better achieve the goal of being  the definitive  chronicle of capitalism               This change led to a reduction in reporting on general interest topics in favor of content related to business and economics            

     redesign and paywall edit 
In       Micklethwait announced a new digital design for Bloomberg News  Bloomberg uses a metered paywall to charge visitors for content  limiting users to view    free articles per month with unlimited re read option  and    minutes of Bloomberg Television watch per day with reset at local midnight time                         
In       Bloomberg Businessweek  a subsidiary of Bloomberg News  published an article alleging that the Chinese government had hacked several American companies  including Apple Inc  and Amazon  by placing secret integrated circuits into their computers  Apple and Amazon strongly denied the report  The incident became a long running dispute between Bloomberg  the U S  Department of Homeland Security and the U K  National Cyber Security Centre both issues statements supporting the companies  denials of the story              In       Bloomberg published a follow up article standing by its allegations                         
In       Bloomberg published a news release claiming to be from Vinci SA  a French construction company  that it had discovered accounting irregularities and had to revise its earnings reports  The news release turned out to be a hoax  Vinci s stock briefly fell by     when Bloomberg published it  although it quickly recovered once it became clear it was not true  In       France s stock markets regulator  the Autorit  des march s financiers  fined Bloomberg    million for publishing the report  stating that it should have known it was false              An appeals court reduced the fine to    million in                  

Michael Bloomberg presidential campaign edit 
In November       as Michael Bloomberg announced his presidential campaign  editor in chief John Micklethwait ordered his staff not to investigate their boss  nor any other Democratic candidates  while investigations into Donald Trump would continue   as the government of the day               Subsequent reporting said Micklethwait was referring to a team of specialized investigative reporters  as opposed to the overall political team  but he would not elaborate or issue a public clarification despite newsroom staff wishing for him to do so  Investigative journalists and political reporters operate separately but reporting indicates this distinction would not be clear to the general public             
Following Bloomberg s announcement  the Houston Chronicle dropped Bloomberg as a source for the      Presidential campaign  saying that  journalists should not choose targets based on their political affiliation               Former Bloomberg News DC Bureau Chief Megan Murphy also criticized the decision  saying it bars  talented reporters and editors from covering massive  crucial aspects of one of the defining elections of our time  and calling the decision to avoid coverage  not journalism               Responding to the controversy  Michael Bloomberg told CBS News   We just have to learn to live with some things   He added that his reporters  get a paycheck  But with your paycheck comes some restrictions and responsibilities              
Bloomberg suspended his campaign on March          the day after Super Tuesday 

     Russian prisoner exchange edit 
While the      Russian prisoner exchange was still in progress  Bloomberg News broke a news embargo by reporting information provided by the White House  Other publications  including the Wall Street Journal  criticized Bloomberg for breaking the embargo  potentially jeopardizing the exchange  and for a Bloomberg editor s apparent boasting for being the one to first publish a breaking news story
