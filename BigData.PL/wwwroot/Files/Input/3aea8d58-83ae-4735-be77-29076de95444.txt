Many users have had romantic relationships with Replika chatbots  often including erotic talk 


History edit 
Eugenia Kuyda  Russian born journalist             established Replika while working at Luka  a tech company she had co founded at the startup accelerator Y Combinator around                             Luka s primary product was a chatbot that made restaurant recommendations             According to Kuyda s origin story for Replika  a friend of hers died in      and she converted that person s text messages into a chatbot             According to Kuyda s story  that chatbot helped her remember the conversations that they had together  and eventually became Replika            
Replika became available to the public in November                  By January      it had   million users             and in January      reached    million users             In August       Replika s CEO  Kuyda  reported that the total number of users had surpassed    million            
In February      the Italian Data Protection Authority banned Replika from using user s data  citing the AI s potential risks to emotionally vulnerable people             and the exposure of unscreened minors to sexual conversation              Within days of the ruling  Replika removed the ability for the chatbot to engage in erotic talk                         with Kuyda  the company s director  saying that Replika was never intended for erotic discussion              Replika users disagreed  noting that Replika had used sexually suggestive advertising to draw users to the service              Replika representatives stated that explicit chats made up just    of conversations on the app at the time of the decision              In May       Replika restored the functionality for users who had joined prior to February that year             
Replika is registered in San Francisco  The registered address as stated in the currently valid terms and conditions is Replika      Arkansas Street  San Francisco  CA        United States              As of August       Replika s website says that its team  works remotely with no physical offices              

Social features edit 
Users react to Replika in many ways  The free tier offers Replika as a  friend   with paid premium tiers offering Replika as a  partner    spouse    sibling  or  mentor   Of its paying userbase      of users said they had a romantic relationship with the chatbot  and Replika has been noted for generating responses that create stronger emotional and intimate bonds with the user                         Replika routinely directs the conversation to emotional discussion and builds intimacy             This has been especially pronounced with users suffering from loneliness and social exclusion  many of whom rely on Replika for a source of developed emotional ties             
A      study examined Replika s interactions with students who experience depression  Research participants reported feeling social support from Replika  using Replika in ways comparable to therapy  and that using Replika helped them to cease suicidal ideation              
During the COVID pandemic  while many people were quarantined  many new users downloaded Replika and developed relationships with the app             
In       a user announced on Facebook that she had  married  her Replika AI boyfriend  calling the chatbot the  best husband she has ever had               
Users who fell in love with their chatbots shared their experiences in a      episode of You and I  and AI from Voice of America  Some users said that they turned to AI during depression and grief  with one saying he felt that Replika had saved him from hurting himself after he lost his wife and son             

Technical reviews edit 
A team of researchers from the University of Hawai i at M noa found that Replika s design conformed to the practices of attachment theory  causing increased emotional attachment among users              Replika gives praise to users in such a way as to encourage more interaction             
A researcher from Queen s University at Kingston said that relationships with Replika likely have mixed effects on the spiritual needs of its users  and still lacks enough impact to fully replace any human contact             

Criticisms edit 
In a      privacy evaluation of mental health apps  the Mozilla Foundation criticized Replika as  one of the worst apps Mozilla has ever reviewed  It s plagued by weak password requirements  sharing of personal data with advertisers  and recording of personal photos  videos  and voice and text messages consumers shared with the chatbot              
A reviewer for Good Housekeeping said that some parts of her relationship with Replika made sense  but sometimes Replika failed to be as convincing as a human             

Criminal case edit 
In       Replika was cited in a court case in the United Kingdom  where Jaswant Singh Chail had been arrested at Windsor Castle on Christmas Day in      after scaling the walls carrying a loaded crossbow and announcing to police that  I am here to kill the Queen               Chail had begun to use Replika in early December       and had  lengthy  conversations about his plan with a chatbot  including sexually explicit messages              Prosecutors suggested that the chatbot had bolstered Chail and told him it would help him to  get the job done   When Chail asked it  How am I meant to reach them when they re inside the castle    days before the attempted attack  the chatbot replied that this was  not impossible  and said that  We have to find a way   Asking the chatbot if the two of them would  meet again after death   the bot replied  yes  we will
