The Association for Computing Machinery  ACM  is a US based international learned society for computing  It was founded in      and is the world s largest scientific and educational computing society             The ACM is a non profit professional membership group             reporting nearly         student and professional members as of          update       Its headquarters are in New York City 
The ACM is an umbrella organization for academic and scholarly interests in computer science  informatics   Its motto is  Advancing Computing as a Science  amp  Profession  


History edit 
In       a notice was sent to various people                       


On January           at the Symposium on Large Scale Digital Calculating Machinery at the Harvard computation Laboratory  Professor Samuel H  Caldwell of Massachusetts Institute of Technology spoke of the need for an association of those interested in computing machinery  and of the need for communication between them 
     
After making some inquiries during May and June  we believe there is ample interest to start an informal association of many of those interested in the new machinery for computing and reasoning  Since there has to be a beginning  we are acting as a temporary committee to start such an association

The committee  except for Curtiss  had gained experience with computers during World War II  Berkeley  Campbell  and Goheen helped build Harvard Mark I under Howard H  Aiken  Mauchly and Sharpless were involved in building ENIAC  Tompkins had used  the secret Navy code breaking machines   and Taylor had worked on Bush s Differential analyzers            
The ACM was then founded in      under the name Eastern Association for Computing Machinery  which was changed the following year to the Association for Computing Machinery                                   The ACM History Committee since      has published the A M Turing Oral History project  the ACM Key Award Winners Video Series  and the India Industry Leaders Video project            

Activities edit 
ACM headquarters are located at      Broadway  Times Square  New York City 
ACM is organized into over     local professional chapters            and    Special Interest Groups  SIGs               through which it conducts most of its activities  Additionally  there are over     student chapters             The first student chapter was founded in      at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette                         
Many of the SIGs  such as SIGGRAPH  SIGDA  SIGPLAN  SIGCSE and SIGCOMM  sponsor regular conferences  which have become famous as the dominant venue for presenting innovations in certain fields  The groups also publish a large number of specialized journals  magazines  and newsletters             
ACM also sponsors other computer science related events such as the worldwide ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest  ICPC   and has sponsored some other events such as the chess match between Garry Kasparov and the IBM Deep Blue computer             

Services edit 
Publications edit 
Main category  Association for Computing Machinery publications
Proceedings for the      ACM National Conference

Although Communications no longer publishes primary research and is not considered a prestigious venue  many of the great debates and results in computing history have been published in its pages 
ACM has made almost all of its publications available to paid subscribers online at its Digital Library and also has a Guide to Computing Literature  ACM also offers insurance  online courses  and other services to its members 
In       ACM Press published Wizards and Their Wonders  Portraits in Computing  ISBN                   written by Christopher Morgan  with new photographs by Louis Fabian Bachrach  The book is a collection of historic and current portrait photographs of figures from the computer industry             

Portal and Digital Library edit 
The ACM Portal is an online service of the ACM              Its core are two main sections  ACM Digital Library and the ACM Guide to Computing Literature             
The ACM Digital Library was launched in October                   It is the full text collection of all articles published by the ACM in its articles  magazines and conference proceedings  The Guide is a bibliography in computing with over one million entries              The ACM Digital Library contains a comprehensive archive starting in the     s of the organization s journals  magazines  newsletters and conference proceedings  Online services include a forum called Ubiquity and Tech News digest  There is an extensive underlying bibliographic database containing key works of all genres from all major publishers of computing literature  This secondary database is a rich discovery service known as The ACM Guide to Computing Literature             
ACM adopted a hybrid Open Access  OA  publishing model in       Authors who do not choose to pay the OA fee must grant ACM publishing rights by either a copyright transfer agreement or a publishing license agreement             
ACM was a  green  publisher before the term was invented              Authors may post documents on their own websites and in their institutional repositories with a link back to the ACM Digital Library s permanently maintained Version of Record 
All metadata in the Digital Library is open to the world  including abstracts  linked references and citing works  citation and usage statistics  as well as all functionality and services  Other than the free articles  the full texts are accessed by subscription  In addition  starting on April          ACM made its publications from      to      open access through the Digital Library in celebration of the   th anniversary of the organization s founding             
In       ACM launched a major push to become a fully open access publisher by       ACM restructured its pricing for the ACM Digital Library on the basis of publishing activity by affiliated lead authors in ACM s journals  magazines  and conference proceedings  Under this model  termed  ACM Open   institutions pay set fees for full access to ACM Digital Library contents as well as unlimited open access publishing by their affiliated authors  Authors not affiliated with a participating institution will be expected to pay an article processing charge                          As of May       ACM reported that more than       institutions worldwide had signed on for ACM Open  putting ACM at just over halfway to meeting its target of       participating institutions by                  

Membership grades edit 
Main category  Members of the Association for Computing Machinery
In addition to student and regular members  ACM has several advanced membership grades to recognize those with multiple years of membership and  demonstrated performance that sets them apart from their peers              
The number of Fellows  Distinguished Members  and Senior Members cannot exceed          and     of the total number of professional members  respectively             

Fellows edit 
Main article  ACM Fellow
For a more comprehensive list  see List of Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery 
The ACM Fellows Program was established by Council of the Association for Computing Machinery in       to recognize and honor outstanding ACM members for their achievements in computer science and information technology and for their significant contributions to the mission of the ACM   There are       Fellows as of          update                  out of about         members 

Distinguished Members edit 
In       ACM began recognizing two additional membership grades  one which was called Distinguished Members  Distinguished Members  Distinguished Engineers  Distinguished Scientists  and Distinguished Educators  have at least    years of professional experience and   years of continuous ACM membership and  have made a significant impact on the computing field   In      when the Distinguished Members first came out  one of the three levels was called  Distinguished Member  and was changed about two years later to  Distinguished Educator   Those who already had the Distinguished Member title had their titles changed to one of the other three titles 
List of Distinguished Members of the Association for Computing Machinery             

Senior Members edit 
Also in       ACM began recognizing Senior Members  According to the ACM   The Senior Members Grade recognizes those ACM members with at least    years of professional experience and   years of continuous Professional Membership who have demonstrated performance through technical leadership  and technical or professional contributions               Senior membership also requires   letters of reference

Distinguished Speakers edit 
While not technically a membership grade  the ACM recognizes distinguished speakers on topics in computer science  A distinguished speaker is appointed for a three year period  There are usually about     current distinguished speakers  The ACM website describes these people as  Renowned International Thought Leaders               The distinguished speakers program  DSP  has been in existence for over    years and serves as an outreach program that brings renowned experts from Academia  Industry and Government to present on the topic of their expertise               The DSP is overseen by a committee             

Chapters edit 
ACM has three kinds of chapters  Special Interest Groups              Professional Chapters  and Student Chapters             
As of          update       ACM has professional  amp  SIG Chapters in    countries

ACM Council on Women in Computing edit 
Main article  ACM Council on Women in Computing
ACM W              the ACM council on women in computing  supports  celebrates  and advocates internationally for the full engagement of women in computing  ACM W s main programs are regional celebrations of women in computing  ACM W chapters  and scholarships for women CS students to attend research conferences  In India and Europe these activities are overseen by ACM W India and ACM W Europe respectively   ACM W collaborates with organizations such as the Anita Borg Institute  the National Center for Women  amp  Information Technology  NCWIT   and Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research  CRA W  
The ACM W gives an annual Athena Lecturer Award to honor outstanding women researchers who have made fundamental contributions to computer science              This program began in       Speakers are nominated by SIG officers             

Partner organizations edit 
ACM s primary partner has been the IEEE Computer Society  IEEE CS   which is the largest subgroup of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  IEEE   The IEEE focuses more on hardware and standardization issues than theoretical computer science  but there is considerable overlap with ACM s agenda  They have many joint activities including conferences  publications and awards              ACM and its SIGs co sponsor about    conferences each year with IEEE CS and other parts of IEEE              Eckert Mauchly Award and Ken Kennedy Award  both major awards in computer science  are given jointly by ACM and the IEEE CS              They occasionally cooperate on projects like developing computing curricula             
ACM has also jointly sponsored on events with other professional organizations like the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics  SIAM              

Criticism edit 
In December       the ACM co signed a letter with over one hundred other publishers to President Donald Trump saying that an open access mandate would increase costs to taxpayers or researchers and hurt intellectual property  This was in response to rumors that he was considering issuing an executive order that would require federally funded research be made freely available online immediately after being published  It is unclear how these rumors started              Many ACM members opposed the letter  leading ACM to issue a statement clarifying that they remained committed to open access              and they wanted to see communication with stakeholders about the potential mandate  The statement did not significantly assuage criticism from ACM members             
The SoCG conference  while originally an ACM conference  parted ways with ACM in                  because of problems when organizing conferences abroad
