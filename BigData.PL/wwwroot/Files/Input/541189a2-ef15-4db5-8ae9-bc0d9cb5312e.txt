vte
The Build Back Better Plan was a legislative framework proposed by United States President Joe Biden between      and       Generally viewed as ambitious in size and scope  it sought to make the largest nationwide public investments in social  infrastructural  and environmental programs since the     s Great Depression fighting policies of the New Deal             
The plan was divided into three parts  one of them  the American Rescue Plan  a COVID    relief spending bill  was signed into law in March                   The other two parts were reworked into different bills over the course of extensive negotiations within and among Congressional entities  The American Jobs Plan  AJP  was a proposal to address long neglected infrastructure needs and reduce America s contributions to climate change s destructive effects              the American Families Plan  AFP  was a proposal to fund a variety of social policy initiatives  some of which  e g  paid family leave  had never before been enacted nationally in the U S             
The Build Back Better Act was a bill introduced in the    th Congress to fulfill aspects of the Build Back Better Plan  It was spun off from the American Jobs Plan  alongside the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act  as a           trillion Democratic reconciliation package that included provisions related to climate change in the United States  centered around Senator Ron Wyden s technology neutral  tax incentive first approach                          and social policy  lowered to approximately           trillion  The bill was passed         by the House of Representatives on November          
In December       amidst negotiations and parliamentary procedures  Senator Joe Manchin publicly pulled his support from the bill citing its cost and a too aggressive transition to clean energy              then retracted support for his own compromise legislation  This effectively killed the bill as it needed    senators to pass via reconciliation  and all    Republican senators opposed it 
In the summer of       Manchin and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer engaged in negotiations over a revised reconciliation bill with about    trillion in revenue from tax reform       billion in climate and health care spending  and      billion in deficit reduction              However  Manchin announced abruptly on July          that he would not support new climate spending or tax reform due to his fear that the bill would worsen inflation              He later stated that he would be open to revisiting those elements a few months later  provided that inflation slowed meaningfully              Biden nonetheless conceded defeat on a climate bill  urging Congress to pass whatever Manchin would agree to  a slim       billion health care bill that would acquire its revenue from allowing Medicare to negotiate prices and spend     billion on Affordable Care Act subsidies                          
Unbeknownst to nearly everyone in Washington  Manchin and Schumer reengaged in secret negotiations on July                       On July     hours after the Senate passed the CHIPS and Science Act             the two men released a statement announcing the      billion Inflation Reduction Act of       which included climate spending and tax reform             
The sudden deal was widely regarded as a  shocker   as Democrats had voiced little hope for a revival of their climate and tax priorities  in addition to Manchin himself being rather pessimistic on the prospect of an expanded bill             
As the revised bill made its way through the chambers of Congress  the new reality of Biden unexpectedly having a clear path to enacting substantial portions of his domestic agenda into law led to a wide reevaluation of the success of the Biden presidency thus far and was expected to give the President and his party a boost in the      midterm elections                                     

Legislative history edit 
President Joe Biden signing the bill into law in the State Dining Room of the White House on August            L R  Senator Joe Manchin  D WV   Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer  D NY   Rep  Jim Clyburn  D SC   Rep  Frank Pallone  D NJ   and Rep  Kathy Castor  D FL  
The Build Back Better Act  which passed the House on September           was used by the Senate as the legislative vehicle for this legislation  On August         Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer proposed an amendment which would replace the text of the previously passed bill with the text of the Inflation Reduction Act of       This substitute amendment was later adopted             
Schumer s lead staffer  Gerry Petrella  recalled the surprise phone call came from Senator Joe Manchin s office just prior to the August recess and the breakthrough negotiations occurred on the final summer weekend              Some of the many experts  lobbyists and organizers who worked to refine the bill s provisions included Leah C  Stokes  Adrian Deveny  Katherine Hamilton  Ari Appel  Mike Carr  Danielle Deiseroth  Ari Mathusiak  Camila Thorndike  Jamal Raad  Topher Spiro  and Yogin Kothari                                      the overall approach was shaped by Manchin and Senators Ron Wyden  Mark Warner and Chris Coons  while Representative Scott Peters worked to add pro pharmaceutical industry limits to the Medicare drug pricing provisions  Bernie Sanders contributed the basis for the Solar for All program  and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kyrsten Sinema negotiated on shaping an alternative minimum tax for corporate book income                                      
On August          following the vote a rama  an unlimited marathon voting session on amendments  that lasted nearly    hours  the Senate passed the bill  as amended  on a       vote  with all Democrats voting in favor  all Republicans voting against  and Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie             On August           the bill was passed by the House on a         vote  with all Democrats voting in favor and all Republicans voting against it             On August           the bill was signed into law by President Joe Biden             

Provisions edit 
Over a period of    years  the law is estimated to raise revenue from                                     

Prescription drug price reform to lower prices  including Medicare negotiation of drug prices for certain drugs  starting at    new ones per year by       increasing to more than    additional ones per year             by                               and rebates from drug makers who price gouge             billion                                   
Imposing a selective     corporate minimum tax rate for companies with higher than         billion of annual financial statement income             billion
Increased tax enforcement             billion                       
Imposing a    excise tax on stock buybacks            billion
  year extension of the limitation on excess business losses       billion           
In the same time period  it would spend this revenue on                         

Addressing domestic energy security and climate change  including funding for drought resiliency in western states             billion           
Continuing for three more years the expansion of Affordable Care Act subsidies originally expanded under the American Rescue Plan Act of                 billion
Changes to Medicare Part D  low income subsidies  vaccine coverage  and insulin       billion           
Increased funding for the IRS for modernization and increased tax enforcement  including the hiring of up to        new IRS employees            billion                        
     billion of the law s climate action investments are embedded in the federal tax code              Of these  McKinsey  amp  Company estimates that roughly half the tax savings will go to corporations              As part of the overall investment into clean energy  the law created a green bank                                      extended the solar investment tax credit for    years             and invested     billion in nuclear power  including      million for high assay low enrichment uranium  HALEU  fuel source research and development and      million for new Office of Nuclear Energy research              and      million in facilitating electric power transmission siting reform              It also invests     billion in electric vehicle incentives      billion in home energy efficiency upgrades      billion in home energy supply improvements  and     billion in advanced manufacturing                           The latter amount includes       billion for a DOE program for zero emissions industrial tech demonstrations                              billion for the renewed   C tax credit              and more than    billion to the USDOT and GSA to lower embedded emissions in procurement                     billion goes to investments in climate smart agriculture  more than    billion goes to revising remediation programs for those affected by discriminatory USDA lending practices     billion goes to forest protection and urban heat island reductions  and nearly    billion goes to coastal habitat protection                                      Lastly  the Act gives        billion to various agencies to increase staffing levels and kickstart permitting reform  particularly of environmental reviews             
Alternatively  the Act s climate investments can be summarized as follows           billion in energy          billion in manufacturing         billion in building retrofits and energy efficiency          billion in transportation         billion in environmental justice  land use  air pollution reduction and or resilience  and       billion in agriculture                                                                         
However  the law also requires that for federal lands  oil and gas auctions take place before wind and solar leasing  even as it provides for the Interior Department to raise royalty rates on oil and gas projects from       to                               
The law contains provisions that cap insulin costs at     month and will cap out of pocket drug costs at        for people on Medicare  among other provisions                                      The law also extends Affordable Care Act health insurance exchange subsidies  preventing people making above four times the poverty line from ineligibility for the exchanges 
Several provisions in the initial deal between Schumer and Manchin were changed after negotiations with Senator Sinema  a provision narrowing the carried interest loophole was dropped  a    excise tax on stock buybacks was added  manufacturing exceptions were added to the corporate minimum tax  itself having been crafted by Elizabeth Warren and refined by Lawrence Summers and Natasha Sarin                            and funding for drought relief for western states was added                                     

Projected impacts edit 
Economic edit 
Short term inflation edit 
The Congressional Budget Office             and others                         estimated that the Act would have no statistically significant effect on inflation in      and       

Medium term inflation edit 
Inflation Reduction Act summary graphic from the White House
The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget              alongside the Swiss business lobbying group World Economic Forum             analyzed the Act and concluded that the  deficit reduction  along with other elements of the bill  is likely to reduce inflationary pressures and thus reduce the risk of a possible recession   It further estimates that the Act would reduce the federal deficit by           trillion over a    year period                  non primary source needed      
Writing in Vox  Rebecca Leber cites economists who predict that the Act will make the US less exposed to fossilflation  which is inflation caused by reliance on volatile commodity markets like the ones for fossil fuels             
Gernot Wagner argues that the benefits of the Act will likely not be felt before the      election  but that the Act is a great long term strategy to decouple from volatile energy markets that drive inflation and that the Act will reduce inflation over the medium to long term                                     

Deficit reduction estimates edit 
The World Economic Forum estimates that the Act would prevent the federal debt from growing by           trillion over a    year period             
Former Biden administration staffers Natasha Sarin and Mark Mazur found that the Act s investment in IRS tax collection would have increased revenues by      billion over    years before the Fiscal Responsibility Act s changes  and would increase revenues by      billion after them instead  though both findings were still much more than the CBO s projections             

Jobs estimates edit 
A University of Massachusetts study projects that the law will generate         jobs per year             
Modeling by the group Energy Innovation  a nonpartisan energy and climate think tank  estimated that the law would lead to the creation of     million to     million additional jobs and increase the GDP            by                  
The climate think tank Rocky Mountain Institute estimated that if businesses and consumers take sufficient advantage of the Act s provisions to meet national climate goals  Texas would see investments of      billion creating         jobs  California would see      billion creating         jobs  Florida     billion creating        jobs and Illinois     billion creating        jobs                  non primary source needed      The same analysis notes that the states seeing the four largest per capita investments from the Act  ranging between roughly        and          would be Wyoming  North Dakota  West Virginia  and Louisiana  all Republican states                         
E  projects        jobs and an estimated                 in investments  That will entail     projects in    states                  non primary source needed       

Energy and climate change edit 
Climate action s fiscal impact edit 
The Inflation Reduction Act is the largest piece of federal legislation ever to address climate change              According to the CBO and JCT  it will invest      billion in provisions relating to energy security and climate change             This includes      billion in tax incentives  and     billion for a green bank created by amending the Clean Air Act                                      However  other forecasts differ from the CBO s and JCT s reports  A report by Credit Suisse projects that the total climate spending in the Act would be      billion                                      Goldman Sachs predicts a total of      trillion  the Penn Wharton Budget Model predicts        trillion  and an analysis by the Brookings Institution finds a central case of      billion                                     

Assessments of spending by area edit 
The summary provided by Senate Democrats identifies primary goals as driving down consumer energy costs  increasing energy security  and reducing greenhouse gas emissions  with an emphasis on neutral treatment of technology choice for the energy tax credits  as described by Senator Ron Wyden                          According to science communicator Hank Green  the largest allocation areas are       billion for renewable energy and grid energy storage      billion for nuclear power      billion for electric vehicle incentives      billion for home energy efficiency upgrades      billion for home energy supply improvements  and     billion for advanced manufacturing               The latter amount includes       billion for a DOE program for zero emissions industrial tech demonstrations                              billion for the renewed   C tax credit  and more than    billion to the USDOT and GSA to lower embedded emissions in procurement               An assortment of additional measures includes     billion for investments in rural economies  racial justice in farming  forestlands and coastal habitats     billion in tax incentives for installing carbon capture and storage at existing power plants     billion to electrify the USPS fleet     billion to reconnect neighborhoods harmed by infrastructure potentially via freeway removal  investments in direct air capture  sustainable aviation fuel  grants for high voltage electric power transmission and decarbonization of port equipment  garbage trucks  school buses and local government fleets  and purchases of rural electric cooperative debt alongside other assistance to cooperatives                                                                          Finally  over    billion is allotted to internal reform of agencies  particularly the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council  established by the FAST Act in       and Council on Environmental Quality  established by the National Environmental Policy Act in        to speed up environmental reviews for select climate friendly projects             
Climate scientist Miriam Nielsen s alternative summary of the Act s climate provisions  using much broader categories and rough estimates from Ben Beachy of the BlueGreen Alliance              is as follows       billion in energy      billion in manufacturing      billion in building retrofits and energy efficiency      billion in transportation      billion in environmental justice  land use and resilience  and     billion in agriculture              Wharton s estimates  however  yield      billion in energy       billion in manufacturing      billion in building retrofits and energy efficiency       billion in transportation      billion in air pollution reduction  and    billion in agriculture              Boston Consulting Group s executives project      billion from the Act will be used for clean energy      billion will be used for transportation      billion for  clean technology  aimed at hard to abate emissions  and     billion for clean manufacturing  as well as     billion for other purposes              Credit Suisse projects at least      billion in advanced manufacturing tax credits and      billion in energy tax credits will be used                         
In the specific area of direct cash payments from      to       the Joint Committee on Taxation forecast that of the Section   X advanced manufacturing credit s total cost of       billion  direct cash payments would make up       billion  Of the     billion Section   U nuclear power credit              direct pay would make up       billion  Of the       Section   V hydrogen credit  direct pay would make up      billion  of the      billion Section   Q carbon sequestration credit       billion  and of the       billion Section   Y clean electricity production credit      million             
In April       investment bank Evercore projected that over the next decade from that year  the share of production to investment tax credits would be          that credit market sizes for clean energy and for manufacturing would reach rough parity in      before the former would outgrow the latter  and that the overall transferable tax credit market would jump from     billion a year in      to over      billion a year in the           period  for a cumulative total of around      billion by                   

Home energy assistance edit 
The Act aims to decrease residential energy costs by focusing on improvements to home energy efficiency  Measures include    billion in home energy rebate programs that focus on improving access to energy efficient technologies  and    years of consumer tax credits for the use of heat pumps  rooftop solar  and high efficiency electric heating  ventilation  air conditioning and water heating 
The Act includes a     tax credit         to        per year  and different types of rebates  reaching          for homeowners who will increase the energy efficiency of their homes  In some cases  all upgrade expenses will be returned                           
The Act expands select current incentives in a tier based system  beginning in                    The Act specifies that commercial buildings must update efficiency by      compared to a reference building  to qualify for       per square foot of tax credit for the first tier  increasing to a maximum of       per square foot for the final tier               The tax credits also extend to single and multi family housing  requiring     less annual energy consumption compared to similar units               Vincent Barnes  a senior vice president from Alliance to Save Energy in Washington  D C  stated that these policies were meant to reduce energy costs and demand on the power grid              

Energy production edit 
There are also funds allocated to national clean energy production  This includes the continuation of the production tax credits  at least     billion               and investment tax credit      billion               toward clean energy manufacturing  including solar power  wind power  and grid energy storage  Modifications to these credits effectively allow the federal government to predictably and directly pay utility cooperatives  state and local governments  nonprofits and publicly owned utilities without them needing to attract investment firms  in a manner similar to the Earned Income Tax Credit                          

Hydrogen edit 
The Act changes the Section   V tax credit to offer increased percentages to green hydrogen and pink hydrogen producers for each kilogram produced via electrolysis of water  allowing     percent coverage for very low carbon methods  thus potentially enabling more than      billion                          in forgone revenue to go toward building the hydrogen economy  On December           the Treasury Department released its proposed guidance on eligibility  It mandates that most of these electrolyzers must be placed near new clean energy production sites  the principles of  geographic correlation   deliverability  and  additionality   new supply    and run at the same time as peak supply periods  the principle of  hourly matching

The Act extends the        Section   D tax credit              for the purchase of new electric vehicles while also providing the        Section   E tax credit              toward the purchase of used electric vehicles  in an effort to increase low  and middle income access to this technology               This is projected to lead to an average of      in savings on energy spending for every family that receives the maximal benefit of these incentives                            It offers        for commercial vehicles weighing under        pounds and         weighing over              
The Act allocates    billion for helping disadvantaged communities with sustainable transportation matters  including reconnecting communities separated by transport infrastructure  assuring safe and affordable transportation  and community engagement activities                This should improve transit oriented development               Projects improving connectivity and walkability in these neighborhoods can get grants reaching         of the overall cost               The Act also supports biking              
The Act encourages sustainable aviation fuel producers to make more  through the Section   B and      tax credits              that give them       to       per gallon of fuel produced through December       The Act also includes a replacement credit called Section   Z  to run from January      through December                                

Agriculture  forests  marine and rural development edit 
Some     billion of the clean energy package will go to rural areas  and include building biofuel infrastructure                           This includes      billion for a new grant program called Empowering Rural America  with cooperatives encouraged to apply during a window from July    to September                       
The Act also allocates funds for rural communities  racial and economic justice in farming  marine ecosystems and forestland  including       billion to invest in climate smart agriculture  split into       billion for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program        billion for the Regional Conservation Partnership Program        billion for the Conservation Stewardship Program  and       billion for the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program     billion for conservation technical assistance       million for a carbon sequestration and emission inventory program  and      million in administrative expenses      billion to invest in forest conservation and urban tree planting  split into       billion for the National Forest System and       billion for other forests including in urban areas        billion to help farmers with high risk operations caused by USDA backed loans       billion to protect and restore coastal habitats  and      billion to redress proven claims from socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers of discrimination by the USDA s lending programs  as well as       million for technical assistance  outreach  and mediation       million for land loss assistance  such as heirs  property and fractionated land       million for agricultural education emphasizing scholarships and career development at historically Black  tribal  and Hispanic colleges  and     million for equity commissions at USDA                                                               

Novel financing methods edit 
One     billion competitive grant program is a green bank called the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund  intended to capitalize smaller regional green banks               The Act established it by amending the Clean Air Act  The Fund has awarded     billion to a select few green banks nationwide for a broad variety of decarbonization investments     billion to green banks in low income and historically disadvantaged communities for similar investments  and    billion to state and local energy funds for decentralized solar power in communities with no financing alternatives                                                              The EPA set the deadline to apply for the first two award initiatives for October                       and the Solar for All initiative for September                        
McKinsey  amp  Company estimated in April      that the GGRF would leverage about      billion in private investments with its first     billion  They also made five recommendations on project governance and impact tracking to ensure the Fund s success              
The nonprofit group Clean Energy States Alliance  which serves as a knowledge clearinghouse for state energy programs  extrapolated from funding applications for Solar for All in    states  DC and Puerto Rico  and projected the projects could add     gigawatts in power and deliver    billion in savings to         low income households     percent of the    billion would likely go to community solar projects     percent to single family housing  and    percent to multi family housing  The CESA also noted that many states had planned wide variations in their implementation of Solar for All

The Act provides funds toward the decarbonization of the economy in other areas  providing various tax credits  grants and loans toward decarbonizing the industrial sector  Among these is a program to reduce methane emissions from production and transportation of natural gas  The Act also provides for a focus on communities and environmental justice by providing several grants targeting historically marginalized and disadvantaged communities that have been disproportionally impacted by environmental pollution and climate change              
The Act should cut the global greenhouse gas emissions by a level similar to  eliminating the annual planet warming pollution of France and Germany combined  and may help to limit the warming of the planet to     degrees Celsius   the target of the Paris Agreement                            With the Act and additional federal and state measures  the USA can fulfill its pledge in the Paris Agreement      greenhouse gas emissions reductions by the year                                             
An assessment by the Rhodium Group  an independent research firm  estimated it would reduce national greenhouse gas emissions        below      levels by       compared to        under current policy while reducing household energy costs and improving energy security               Furthermore  Rhodium Group projects that the nuclear provisions in the Act are likely to  keep much  if not all  of the nation s nuclear reactors that are at risk of retiring  estimated to be        of the fleet  online through the     s              
A preliminary analysis by the REPEAT Project of Princeton University estimated that the investments made by the law would reduce net emissions     below      levels  compared to     under current policies  including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act                            
The Energy Innovation group estimated the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions at        below      levels in       compared to     without the Act                            This estimate of the greenhouse gas emission reduction lines up with the figure provided by the Act s authors which is a     reduction in carbon emissions relative to      levels              
Modeling from the nonpartisan research institution Resources for the Future indicates the Act would decrease retail power costs by          over a ten year period  resulting in savings of          per year for the average U S  household  The modeling also predicts that the Act would tend to stabilize electricity prices                            The Act would help foster a tripling in the size of the American solar power industry and provide unprecedented investment security  according to a September      report by the trade group Solar Energy Industries Association              
In reaction to the Supreme Court case West Virginia v  EPA  which limited the EPA s authority to institute a program such as the Obama era Clean Power Plan  Title VI of the IRA amended the Clean Air Act to explicitly designate carbon dioxide  hydrofluorocarbons  methane  nitrous oxide  perfluorocarbons  and sulfur hexafluoride as air pollutants to unambiguously provide the EPA congressional authorization to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases  as well as to promote renewable energy                           

Drug prices edit 
One of the most consequential aspects of this act is the increased negotiating power granted to Medicare  Before the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act  Medicare was notably restricted in its ability to negotiate drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies  This limitation often resulted in higher costs for both the program and its beneficiaries  With the new rule  Medicare now engages directly with drug manufacturers  aiming to secure more favorable pricing agreements  This development has the potential to significantly alter the landscape of drug pricing  especially for high cost medications under Medicare Part D               The Congressional Budget Office projects the Medicare drug price negotiations will save the government       billion over the next decade                           The savings will be used to increase Medicare Part D benefits                                        Together  these drugs amounted to more than     billion in Medicare Part D spending from June      to May                   

First selected drugs edit 
In September       Medicare announced the first    drugs selected for negotiations under the agency s drug price negotiation program  This list includes treatments for 

Diabetes  Farxiga  Fiasp NovoLog  Januvia  Jardiance
Blood diseases  Eliquis  Xarelto  Imbruvica
Heart failure  Entresto  Farxiga
Psoriasis  Stelara  Enbrel
Rheumatoid arthritis  Enbrel
Crohn s disease  Stelara                          
Taxes and distributional impact edit 
U S  Treasury Department estimates of unpaid taxes indicate that over half of all unpaid taxes are attributable to the top    of earners              
Excerpts from the nonpartisan JCT indicated that the legislation might lead to increased payments on personal taxes for Americans of all incomes  an increase in            billion for taxpayers earning less than          a year             billion for taxpayers earning between          and           and            billion for taxpayers earning over            This calculation was based on the assumption that companies would indirectly pass on parts of the minimum corporate tax to employees  an assumption that was criticized by Steven M  Rosenthal  a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center  TPC                Economist William G  Gale  who is also co director of the TPC  comments that it is important to consider that the calculations by the JCT did not take into account the provisions in the Act that would extend premium tax credits for health plans for low  and middle income taxpayers  provide households with tax credits for making their property more energy efficient  and lower the price of prescription drugs              
The Tax Policy Center estimated that the bottom     tax filers by income would receive a net benefit  if ACA premium tax credits  subsidies  are included  The   th   th percentile would incur a small cost         increase in average federal tax rate  while the top    would incur a      increase  The costs mainly are imposed indirectly as corporations facing higher taxes may reduce the wage increases or levels for workers  individual tax rates were not changed              

Implementation and results edit 
The Biden administration s main overseer of the Act s implementation has been identified as John Podesta                            From      to       Podesta headed the White House Office on Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation  established by Executive  Order       to implement the Act              

Economy edit 
Research from climate policy analyst Jack Conness has revealed that      billion worth of     climate friendly tech manufacturing investments within the United States  have been announced by companies since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act  creating        projected jobs as of November                       update       when considered together with CHIPS Act investments  the total comes out to     projects worth      billion creating         jobs                   needs update      Conness found that due to the Act s incentives  North Carolina would receive the individual project with the most money        billion from Toyota in battery plants   while Georgia would host the most projects       the most new jobs overall           and the largest dollar amount in overall investments      billion  followed by North Carolina s       billion   and South Carolina would receive the individual project with the most jobs created        from Scout Motors   More of the Act s dollars went to congressional districts with Republican winners in           billion  than those with Democratic winners      billion      percent of the Act s investments were in batteries  while electric vehicle investments made up    percent and solar investments made up    percent                                         Conness found that of the top    job creating IRA linked projects  only five had faced delays  and a majority would begin production by summer                   
In a November      report the interest group Environmental Entrepreneurs and the research firm BW found     announced projects directly linked to the Inflation Reduction Act  in the first year since its signing  They stated that the projects would create nearly         jobs  more than         of which would be permanent               According to editor in chief Jeff St  John of Canary Media   During the projects  construction phases  assumed to last five years from project announcement to completion  the report estimates the creation of         direct jobs         indirect jobs  and         jobs induced by the direct and indirect workers spending their wages   More than         of these jobs would be in electric vehicles         would be in battery storage         would be in solar and wind power         would be in clean fuels  and nearly       would be in electric power transmission and distribution               The authors project that the Act would bring about       billion added to U S  GDP       billion in new wages for workers  and more than     billion generated in tax revenue for federal  state  and local governments                Environmental Entrepreneurs later found in August      that        billion had been invested due to the Act  and     new projects and         jobs had been created         jobs had been created in electric vehicles         in batteries and storage         in solar and wind        in clean fuels  and       in transmission and distribution              
In a video dated December          the Financial Times found the IRA and CaSA together catalyzed over      billion in investments and over         new jobs by the preceding July              
The next day  the Rhodium Group Massachusetts Institute of Technology partnership Clean Investment Monitor put the July      September      investment total at      billion  most of it in electric vehicle supply  though it did not explicitly mention the Act  Clean investment grew by    percent across that period  As a share of nationwide private investment  it grew from     percent to      The states that benefited the most were Nevada  South Carolina  Arizona  Tennessee  and Montana               Its second anniversary report found the total from July      to June      was      billion  with EV supply taking a large share but solar and storage catching up  and much of it due to the Act  Clean investment grew by    percent during that period  As a share of nationwide investment  it grew from     percent to      The states that benefited the most were Nevada  Wyoming  Arizona  Tennessee  and Montana  the reporters found clean investment made up above   percent of Tennessee and Kentucky s respective GDPs               In March of that year  Treasury Department researchers used the Monitor s data to confirm that the Act had spurred a monthly average of      billion in investments in  energy communities  formerly dependent on fossil fuel extraction     billion more than the average in the rest of the nation  and that    percent of the Act s investments went to communities under the national median income              
Wellesley College professor of environmental studies Jay Turner said that as of July                       update      the Act fostered       billion in     new investments in the electric vehicle supply chain  creating a projected        new jobs across the United States  Canada and Mexico  The number of new mines the Act incentivized in      was      the amount of battery manufacturing capacity brought up to     GWh  and EV manufacturing capacity brought up to           vehicles              
The research firm Climate Power estimated that the Act spurred       billion of investments in over    new projects creating         predicted clean energy related jobs in    states  between August          and January           and that while Georgia  Michigan  and Texas saw eight new IRA linked projects each  the most of any states  Georgia  Idaho and Tennessee would see the largest overall investments by dollar amount  ranging from       billion to       billion   and Kansas  Georgia and Tennessee would see the most jobs created                            In its August         update  Climate Power had found at least         new clean energy jobs were created to date  across     projects and      billion in investments across    states and Puerto Rico  Georgia  Michigan and Texas saw the most projects and money  while the former two and New York State saw the most jobs at                         The firm s January          update found the numbers increased to at least         new jobs across     projects and      billion in investments across    states and Puerto Rico  Georgia  New York  and Texas saw the most jobs at            Michigan saw the most projects at     and New York saw the most money at         billion              
In August       the Solar Energy Industries Association reported that the Act had created more than        jobs and incentivized     billion in new solar power tech manufacturing and     gigawatts of generating capacity in the law s first year  and projected it would incentivize      billion more in such investments by      than under a no Act scenario               In September       the SEIA reported that the Act had helped quadruple solar manufacturing capacity in the U S  to    gigawatts since its passage  It also reported that in the first half of      solar installations represented    percent of all new energy capacity in the U S   and forecasted a   percent annual solar market growth rate through       buoyed by the Act s Solar for All initiative              
The trade group American Clean Power s January      assessment of business announcements of IRA linked investments in renewables and battery plants  during the period between the Act s signing and November           yielded a figure of over     billion creating       jobs     percent of these investments are in Republican held districts  mostly in the Great Plains or South                           Its August      update recorded a total of    manufacturing investments worth      billion spurred by the Act between the August    enactment date and July              with defined locations  with the majority of these being solar power tech plants  American Clean Power estimates these investments are worth more than all those made in the previous eight years combined  and will create        new jobs and      billion in customer savings              
In June       CNN found nearly    percent of the Act s new jobs were created in Republican held House districts  consistent with earlier projections               as well as a later Bloomberg Opinion article that found      billion of clean investments had gone to those districts and     billion to Democratic held districts since Biden took office in January                   
According to the New Democrat linked think tank Center for American Progress  the Act  the CHIPS and Science Act  and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act have together catalyzed over        public and private investments                Economists Noah Smith and Joseph Politano credited the three acts together for spurring booms in factory construction and utility jobs  as well as limiting geographic concentrations of key industries to ensure more dispersed job creation nationwide  though they raised issues of whether the three would serve to limit project delays and significantly increase labor productivity in the long term                            The Biden administration itself claimed that as of January                       update       the IIJA  CaSA  and IRA together catalyzed    trillion in private investment  including      billion in electronics and semiconductors       billion in electric vehicles and batteries       billion in clean power      billion in clean energy tech manufacturing and infrastructure  and     billion in heavy industry  and over        billion in public infrastructure spending  including     billion in energy aside from tax credits in the IRA                    needs update      

Labor impact edit 
In October       Lee Harris of The American Prospect covered one example of synergies between the Act and the growth of an organizing model known as sectoral bargaining  three unions in solar power construction agreed to a nationwide deal to divide work on future projects  California being exempt because of a similar five union agreement                On August           the United Steelworkers announced it had successfully reached an electoral neutrality agreement with solar panel manufacturer Convalt  making it easier to form a union at IRA linked project sites in Pennsylvania and New York              
On June           the IRS finalized the guidance on prevailing wage and apprenticeship bonuses for the most important of the Act s tax credits              
In an article marking the law s second anniversary  reporter Emily Pontecorvo of Heatmap News found that the law increased construction union membership in areas with mostly non union labor markets  especially in solar power  Due to the investment tax credits  rules on Project Labor Agreements  prevailing wages and apprenticeships  the law also set up a new dynamic where energy developers have started to negotiate with unions early in their project planning  and fostered the growth of a new tax credit compliance industry  Pontecorvo also found  however  that wide disparities remained between union and non union apprenticeships and wages  and that non union apprenticeships were still poorly regulated               She later analyzed an August    Energy Department report that found that even with growth in the fossil fuel workforce  unionization in clean energy grew faster than in the overall energy sector  and that unionized firms had an easier time hiring job applicants than non unionized firms  for which she credited the Act  the DOE found that clean energy job numbers grew     percent in       twice the national rate for all employers  and up     percent from the previous year  Pontecorvo also reported that the energy workforce continued to suffer from a lack of diversity  particularly of gender              

Fiscal impact edit 
The law significantly enlarged the tax credit market  It includes significant tax credits for companies making products considered environmentally friendly  but small companies tend not to pay enough taxes  so the law does not help them  The law allows such companies to sell their tax credits to larger companies              The market is expected to reach     billion per year and help those large companies              
In February      The New York Times and Energy Storage News reported that it was clear that companies were using the credits accorded by the law far more than was predicted  According to government officials they interviewed  the increase of revenue from improved Internal Revenue Service tax enforcement will be more than enough to cover the losses  so the deficit will still be reduced               The tax credits with the highest market value are for grid energy storage               The next month  the Times reported that the IRS had received from about     companies registrations of more than        projects attached to direct pay or possible small business sales of the IRA s energy tax credits  up from only about       in January              

Environment edit

According to Rhodium Group and the World Economic Forum  in the first year of implementation  the Act had a significant impact on the environment  The Rhodium Group s expectations for GHG emissions reductions by the year       relative to the level of       moved from        to         and to a        decline by the year       More than         green jobs were created 
The sales of heat pumps exceeded the sales of gas boilers for the first time in history      of households now use a heat pump as a primary source of heating  The United States Environmental Protection Agency used dozens of millions of dollars to improve air quality and hundreds of millions for environmental justice and local climate plans  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration spent hundreds of millions for protecting coastal communities and ecosystems from the impact of climate change  More than    billion is allocated to equitable access to urban trees                                        
The governors of four states  Florida  South Dakota  Iowa  and Kentucky  refused to accept decarbonization money from the Act s Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program  The Act allows the forfeited money     million per state  to go to the three largest metropolitan areas in each state instead  though cities such as Davenport  Iowa  and Sioux Falls  South Dakota  have still refused the money                           
From June      to February       the EPA awarded      million from the CPRG  Climate Pollution Reduction Grants  program to    cities and    states to update their climate action plans               On July           the EPA awarded from the same program      billion to    cities  states  tribal governments  and coalitions of the three for implementing community driven solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by     million metric tons by      and by     million tons by       The solutions mainly belong to the domains of energy  buildings  agriculture  industry  waste  and ecosystems  The largest recipient  at              for vehicle decarbonization  is the South Coast Air Quality Management District in California                           

Energy and industry edit 
The Act deals extensively with trade flows of clean energy and their effects on domestic manufacturing  As an example  the Treasury Department clarified on May           that in order to be eligible for the Sections       Y     and   E tax credits               solar panel manufacturers and installers need to source at least    percent of their components in total from within the U S   regardless of solar cell origin  thereby creating a compromise between solar panel installers who favored keeping Chinese imports cheap and domestic solar cell manufacturers who want to build more factories in America

In May       multiple solar companies told Bloomberg News that they had faced borderline dumping of solar panels from China  and criticized the Act for not providing enough tax credits to help with manufacturing upstream  including the ingots and wafers of polycrystalline silicon needed to make the cells  as well as for unclear guidance that does not say whether domestic panel content incentives can go to them  as a result  several US solar manufacturers have slowed their timelines on plant construction and pressed the Biden administration to build up tariffs while they wait for better guidance               On May     the Department of Energy announced a loan guarantee of       billion under the Act s expansion of the Title    Clean Energy Financing Program  to Plug Power to scale up clean hydrogen production in six of its facilities              
On July          the DOE s Grid Deployment Office announced it was awarding      million to    projects across    states for speeding up high voltage transmission line approvals              
In August       the Treasury Department had found that in the      tax year      million households had claimed more than    billion against their federal income tax for home energy improvements  about     million had claimed    billion in credits for home clean energy  while     million had claimed    billion in credits for home energy efficiency improvements  The average benefit was estimated at      per family              
Based on the report  E amp E News and The Guardian found households with annual incomes above          claimed energy tax credits such as the home production and efficiency credits at higher rates among their cohort  about       percent of all such filers  compared to those earning below  at about         percent of all such filers  Wealthier families received about    percent of the total      billion in credits in       with households earning over          claiming    billion  By contrast  the poorest    percent received only     million in credits  In addition  E amp E News noted that many states have yet to administer rebate programs meant for low income households  which could further address wealth imbalances                           
Around that time  the Biden administration claimed successful implementation of a bonus credit for solar installer firms  not households  in low income communities and Tribal country in its first year  According to Pontecorvo  the program steered nearly        solar projects to low income areas and Tribal lands  with an estimated      million a year in energy savings  and    Tribal projects approved  no wind projects were supported  The law caps the amount of power the program can support per year at     gigawatts total  with certain types of recipients getting different subtotals  Pontecorvo found that while the program s data gathering process is difficult to assess     percent of the money was allocated based mostly on installers  locations  without requirements to ensure that the savings reach low income residents  The distribution of funds was uneven  with higher demand than expected from recipient subcategories like community solar projects  while other projects  like those on Tribal lands  generated lower demand  this unevenness continued to hold in      even with some power caps being raised  The bonus credit is set to expire in       though changes such as expansion to other clean energy technologies like small scale hydroelectric and geothermal are set to take effect in                   
The IRS is set     needs update      to finalize the   Q tax credit s              rules to empower carbon dioxide flooding  a method of using the captured greenhouse gas to improve oil extraction in nearly depleted fields  at a level of between     and      per metric ton of carbon dioxide sequestered  Notably  Vicki Hollub  CEO of Occidental Petroleum  praised the Inflation Reduction Act in a      earnings call for enabling the company to expand its operations  while ExxonMobil and Eneos have started reviving production in certain oil fields because of the Act  Critics note the IRS relies on self reported data from companies  verified with EPA resources not intended for tax purposes  Verifying the amount of carbon dioxide stored versus what leaks out is problematic due to gaps in data and oversight  A lack of interagency coordination between the IRS and EPA complicates accurate monitoring and reporting  investigations have revealed that significant portions of tax credits awarded under   Q did not meet EPA s reporting requirements  raising questions about the program s integrity              
On September    the USDA announced that      billion in funding for    rural electric cooperative projects curbing    million tons in emissions would be approved under the Act s New ERA program              
In October       Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo revealed to Pontecorvo that he and his staff were planning to finalize the tax credit rules for clean hydrogen  advanced manufacturing  and tech neutral clean power by December  and that bioenergy remained a sticking point for the latter  the reasons behind the Treasury s slow pace  he claimed  were understaffing and the review backlog of        comments on the clean hydrogen draft rule               Jael Holzman reported that soon after  experts in energy markets pointed to a lack of coordination between the IIJA s Hydrogen Hubs program and the IRA s clean hydrogen tax credits  price increases for electrolyzers  and the historically low cost of natural gas as additional reasons for the withdrawal of investment in Hub projects              
On November           the Biden administration announced the parameters of its first ever methane fee for oil and gas companies  the Waste Emissions Charge  which the Act mandated  The Charge was to be set at      per metric ton in       rising to        per metric ton in       and was forecasted to remove     million tons of methane     million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent  by       with a net benefit of    billion  The rule was finalized early in       and believed to be difficult to overturn                                         However  the incoming Congress overturned the regulation on March          via resolution  effectively abolishing the charge                           
In December       the clean power investment tax credit s rules were finalized  which clarify what qualifies as an energy project  what assets an offshore wind farm  geothermal heat pump or biogas plant owner can use to claim the credit  and what credit qualifying stored hydrogen can be used for               On December     the DOE used the Section      Program to fund Pacific Gas and Electric Company s hydropower and energy storage expansions and enable experiments in virtual power plants               On January           the DOE used the program to lend       billion to six utility companies  the three largest recipients being DTE Electric Company  PacificCorp  and Consumers Energy  for similar purposes              
On January          the Treasury Department finalized the   V clean hydrogen tax credit  keeping the overall approach of the  three pillars  of hourly matching  additionality incrementality  and deliverability  Major exemptions  however  were introduced  concerning such environmentalists as Conrad Schneider of the Clean Air Task Force and Dan Esposito of the Energy Innovation think tank  These included delaying the hourly matching requirement to       advantaging nuclear power plants  at the risk of retirement   and allowing hydrogen producers more leeway to claim natural gas with carbon capture counted towards the credit  though the new rules also emphasized some exemptions only apply in states with a clean energy standard and binding emissions cap  Most environmental groups praised the rules  while industry groups were more cautious in doing so               On the   th  the USDA finalized       billion in New ERA grants and loans to    projects by rural electric cooperatives  and      million in PACE loans to    projects by solar nonprofits                           
In total        billion in clean energy grants under the Act  or    percent of the energy grants  were finalized by the Biden administration by the   th  leaving     billion to be handed out by the incoming president after the   th              

Transportation edit

Health insurance subsidies edit 
The Inflation Reduction Act extended the American Rescue Plan s modifications to the Affordable Care Act s health insurance subsidies  namely the Advanced Payment for Premium Tax Credit  through       The Centers for Medicare  amp  Medicaid Services attributed increases in ACA health insurance enrollment after the      enrollment period in part to the IRA  The      Open Enrollment period  the first one under the IRA  saw an increase in new consumers of            compared to the previous year s increase of            The CMS saw an increase in approvals for financial aid from the Act      of consumers compared to      s      meaning the Act and ARP helped roughly       million people in calendar year       and estimated national averages of      per year and     in IRA savings on premiums  in addition to finding that     million people making up to four times the poverty line were still able to access subsidies thanks to the ARP and IRA               The      Open Enrollment period saw           new consumers sign up for the exchanges  an increase of     from the previous year s                of consumers  roughly       million people  received aid from the Act  The average annual premium savings figure now stood at      and      the ARP and IRA had now helped     million people avoid subsidy ineligibility              

IRS reform edit 
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen directed IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to not use the new funding allocated in the Act to increase the rate of audits of those making less than          a year above historical levels  but to instead focus on  high end noncompliance                A Treasury report indicated that half of the funding would be allocated to preventing tax evasion from large corporations and wealthy individuals              
Due to larger than expected use of the Act s tax credits  the administration of Joe Biden has begun to reevaluate how much in unpaid taxes the IRS can collect to cover the costs               According to its new findings  full reorganization of the IRS will result in      billion in new revenue from           without having to add tax burdens to those who earn annual incomes less than           it notes that  the top    percent of the income distribution is responsible for    percent of unpaid taxes

Florida edit 
The state received       million for urban forests and nature conservation           for fighting pollution  and       million to protect the state from climate change impacts  the third amount is from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act combined  
However  the governor  Ron DeSantis  refused to accept      million for rebates to homeowners who will want to retrofit their houses for energy efficiency     million to fight pollution  a program for helping low income people buy solar panels as well as     million from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act for improving sewage systems in rural areas                DeSantis later reversed course and attempted to reclaim some of the rejected home energy rebate funds              
The money can go to local cities and authorities  Three cities in Florida accepted some amounts  Other states want to take the money forfeited by Florida for themselves  namely Rhode Island and Kentucky              
The funds for the rebates were requested by the Florida state energy office and the legislature  but DeSantis vetoed them  He is the only governor who did so  The program was intended to help people to lower their energy bills and create jobs  Half of the money would have gone to low income households               Making a house more energy efficient can cut utility bills by     for an average family in Florida               Part of the money would have gone to weatherization of houses              

Texas edit 
Some aspects of the law are the same as in other states  while some are specific to Texas  Considerable tax credits and tax rebates are afforded  House weatherization  solar energy  electric vehicles  are advanced  House weatherization can save around      per year for an average family in Texas  while raising the value of the property and reducing air pollution in the same time  Some improvements can be made for free to low income households  The cost of an energy audit is reduced by     and some can even get it for free              
A third of Texas households can get a      rebate for installing a heat pump  generally costing US                      Forest protection is advanced  and farms that adopt climate friendly practices get economic incentives              

Alaska edit 
In February          million was delivered to Alaska remote communities  The aim is to strengthen resilience and food security  improve cooperation with indigenous tribes  and use their knowledge              

Reactions edit 
Senator Joe Manchin  D WV  issued a statement for his support of the bill               President Joe Biden also stated his support for the proposed bill               On August    Senator Kyrsten Sinema  D AZ  issued a statement indicating that she would support the bill after striking a deal with fellow Democrats to change several tax provisions              
Congressional Republicans voiced unanimous opposition to the bill  claiming the legislation would do little to combat inflation  or would exacerbate it  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell  R KY  denounced the legislation as  reckless spending  and Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee Lindsey Graham  R SC  called it  insanity       citation needed     
In a letter sent to congressional leadership and touted by Senate Democrats      economists including Robert Rubin  Jack Lew  Jason Furman  Lawrence Summers  Mark Zandi  and Joseph Stiglitz  wrote that the bill is more than fully paid for  lowers prices for consumers and will lower inflation                           
In a letter sent to congressional leadership      economists including Vernon Smith  Robert Heller  Kevin Hassett  and Jim Miller  wrote that the bill will increase prices for consumers and will increase inflation                           
Tom Philpott  an agriculture journalist writing in Wired  praised the bill s investments in climate smart agriculture and remedies for USDA loan discrimination  but heavily criticized Sinema s deletion of the carried interest loophole modification and the lack of provisions to expand funding for the National School Lunch Act and improvements to child nutrition  as expressed in the original Build Back Better Act  and for soil erosion prevention programs  which enhance small scale carbon farming and encourage a shift away from monoculture dependent farming for ethanol fuel in the United States              

Public organizations edit 
Darren Woods  the CEO of oil and gas energy giant ExxonMobil  called the bill  a step in the right direction  and endorsed its provisions related to oil and gas               Multiple coal industry groups  including the West Virginia Coal Association  criticized the bill for   obviating  any need to innovate coal assets  and doing  nothing for coal or coal generation               
Many mainstream environmental organizations supported the bill  such as the Nature Conservancy  the National Wildlife Federation  and American Forests                            The director of North America policy for the Nature Conservancy  Tom Cors  called the legislation  historic   while Aviva Glaser of the NWF called the infusion of spending  transformative   The Natural Resources Defense Council argued that despite continued acceptance of fossil fuels in the IRA  its climate mitigation policies would outweigh their impact ten times over               Health and environmental justice organizations like Earthjustice have welcomed the law              
However  not all environmental groups expressed unqualified support  Some environmentalists noted that the bill contained more  carrots   or incentives for positive behavior  than  sticks   or new regulations                            Several groups argued that as the legislation did not seek to eliminate fossil fuels entirely  it was inadequate to meet the threat of climate change  Jean Su  the energy justice program director at the Center for Biological Diversity  called the legislation  a backdoor take it or leave it deal between a coal baron and Democratic leaders in which any opposition from lawmakers or frontline communities was quashed                The Climate Justice Alliance criticized the IRA  saying that  the strengths of the IRA are outweighed by the bill s weaknesses and threats posed by the expansion of fossil fuels and unproven technologies such as carbon capture and hydrogen generation               
The heads of the National Cooperative Business Association  National Rural Electric Cooperative Association  National Farmers Union  and National Council of Farming Cooperatives praised the IRA for its provisions assisting cooperatives in energy and agriculture  particularly direct grants and debt forgiveness  Cornelius Blanding  head of the U S  Federation of Southern Cooperatives  also praised the IRA  but expressed concern that its revisions of the American Rescue Plan s debt relief programs for minority farmers would worsen racial discrimination in agriculture             
Cycling organizations criticized the IRA for removing the incentives for electric bicycles in the original Build Back Better Act  having a better energy per incentive ratio and reaching a wider demographic  than for electric cars remaining in the IRA               Sean Jeans Gail  Vice President of Government Affairs and Policy at the Rail Passengers Association  criticized the IRA saying   It s a bitter pill in terms of rail and transit  which is the one clearly established  low carbon emission transportation systems we have going   He also criticized the bill for being car centric              

Relationship with foreign policy edit 
Biden s National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has been identified as the staffer in charge of ensuring the Act does not conflict with American foreign policy interests              
Among American foreign policy analysts and officials  Anna McGinn of the think tank Environmental and Energy Study Institute praised the Act for helping the U S  meet its commitments to the Paris Agreement  but criticized the Act for lacking commitments to loss and damage and other forms of climate related foreign aid as well as to creating a cohesive national climate strategy               Jason Bordoff  writing on the International Monetary Fund s website  cautioned that it could expose the U S  to the beginnings of trade war  but if implemented deftly  the Act could strengthen diplomacy with Europe and help create special rules to advance the trade of clean energy               Commentators at the Center for Strategic International Studies and in The Diplomat  along with United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai and John Podesta himself have acknowledged increased economic competition with China as one of many motivators behind the Act                                                      
Internationally  reactions were mixed  Fatih Birol  the head of the International Energy Agency  called it  the single most important climate action since the Paris Agreement in        However  some were concerned about the law s provisions favoring American industry  In an interview with Time Amitabh Kant  the chairman of the      G   meeting in India  called it  the most protectionist act ever drafted in the world   asking American officials   You believed in market forces and now you do this   Other countries have begun to create their own similar laws               China requested WTO dispute consultations with the United States              
   European Union finance ministers have expressed  serious concerns  about the financial incentives of the Inflation Reduction Act  and are considering challenging it  They have listed at least nine points in the legislation  which they say could be in breach of World Trade Organization rules  They were opposed to the subsidies for consumers to buy North American assembled electric cars  as EU officials believe the subsidies discriminate against European carmakers  One EU official told CNBC that   there is a political consensus  among the    ministers  that this plan threatens the European industry                                         and its supply of raw materials               In February       the European Commission announced it would propose the  Net Zero Industrial Act   similar to the IRA               in turn putting pressure on the United Kingdom                           and South Korea              
On March           President Biden and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen announced they would be initiating top level talks to mitigate issues of subsidy competition                                        
Representatives from South Korea have also voiced similar concerns to Europe  given that the legislation can also restrict Hyundai s and other South Korean carmakers  business in the American market                                                     

Implementation criticisms  concerns edit 
Relationship with asset managers edit 
Geographer and political writer Brett Christophers pointed out  after a renewables project was funded by Brookfield Corporation upon the Act s passage  that asset management companies would likely see the Act as a windfall for taking over public works  citing their poor track records with British and South Korean infrastructure and American housing              

Labor rules edit 
Some members of the trade union United Auto Workers  including former vice president Cindy Estrada  have obliquely commented to The American Prospect that the Inflation Reduction Act s implementation regarding prevailing wage requirements and collective bargaining rights  particularly at electric vehicle factories owned by startup companies  may be weakened  and if not properly implemented  the Act could be linked to poor hiring practices and working conditions               Other labor union representatives  from the AFL CIO  Southwest Laborers District Council  Ironworkers Local     and United Steelworkers  told Reuters in March      that investments announced due to the Act have not improved labor unions  ability to organize particularly in right to work law states  but that they were hopeful in pushing ahead              

Environmental justice concerns edit 
Climate activists Miriam Nielsen  Raya Salter and Heather Tanana examined the Act s effects eight months after passage  and raised questions on whether the Act would provide tax credits and grants equitably  mentioning the home energy upgrade grants and the Biden administration s Justice   initiative for racial justice  whether the Act would disproportionately help larger environmental groups with more resources rather than smaller ones  and how it would implement    billion in Western drought resilience grants and make accessing them easier              

EV rules edit 
The Prospect     s editor  Robert Kuttner  commented in January      that the Treasury Department s interpretation of the Act regarding electric vehicle leasing could also potentially undermine the Act s U S  domestic supply provisions in favor of European or Chinese suppliers               Manchin expressed disappointment with the Treasury s new guidance and its more lenient provisions for foreign trading partners upon its release on March                  On December     he wrote a letter to Gene Dodaro  head of the Government Accountability Office  asking for a legal opinion on if Congress can overturn the Treasury guidance on Section   D  on the basis that it is technically a proposal and not finalized  but is being enforced as the latter                           

Clean hydrogen rules edit 
On December           Manchin also expressed his disappointment with the Biden administration s implementation of his Section   V tax credit              for clean hydrogen after the draft guidelines were leaked  claiming it was  horrible  and too stringent beyond his intent for the credit               Manchin later said he would bring a lawsuit against the Biden administration upon release of the guidelines  Constellation Energy  the United States  largest nuclear power plant operator  said it would pull back on green and pink hydrogen projects if the guidelines were released               Staffers for Governor Gavin Newsom  D CA  also asked the Treasury Department in May      for an  alternative compliance pathway  that lifted emissions restrictions on the state s hydrogen hub  ostensibly to better align with their      renewable energy adoption goal                Lobbying against the proposed Treasury rules has only intensified since then  according to Pontecorvo               In her interview with Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo  Adeyemo promised a  middle of the road  approach between environmentalists  and Manchin and lobbyists  concerns  in the run up to the tax credit s finalization  then expected by December                   
On January          the Treasury Department finalized the   V credit s rules  Most environmental groups that commented  and Governor Newsom s administration  praised them  though expressed concern about its new exemptions and delaying of the hourly matching provision  while industry groups were more cautious in welcoming them              

Sustainable aviation fuel rules edit 
In April       the Section   B tax credit guidance was released  While biofuel producers  trade groups and United and American Airlines fully welcomed the guidance  farmers and lower level ethanol producers said the guidance was too prescriptive and did not reflect the full range of agricultural approaches to climate policy  while environmentalists criticized the guidance for not going far enough to account for all lifecycle emissions from ethanol fuel                           

Trump administration actions and the courts edit 
This section needs expansion  You can help by adding to it    April      
Under the second Trump administration  IRA funding was paused that applied to electric vehicles               President Trump also froze EPA  Energy and Interior Department funding for a wide variety of other IRA  and IIJA related priorities  as part of a long line of executive actions that have been characterized as climate skeptic policymaking 
On April           Trump appointed federal judge Mary McElroy of Rhode Island ruled in a case brought by local conservation groups that some of the Act s funding had to be unfrozen nationwide               On the same day  District of Columbia federal judge Tanya Chutkan issued a preliminary injunction forcing the EPA and the Treasury Department s designated distributor  Citibank  to unfreeze the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund              
In a court filing for another case involving New England conservation groups  the EPA indicated it would plan to cut     further environmental justice grants related to the IRA and other Biden era policies
