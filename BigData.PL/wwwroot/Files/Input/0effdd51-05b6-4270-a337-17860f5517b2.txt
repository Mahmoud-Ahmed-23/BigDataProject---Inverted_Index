Life
Childhood           
Chomsky was born on December          in the East Oak Lane neighborhood of Philadelphia  Pennsylvania              His parents  William Chomsky and Elsie Simonofsky  were Jewish immigrants              William had fled the Russian Empire in      to escape conscription and worked in Baltimore sweatshops and Hebrew elementary schools before attending university              After moving to Philadelphia  William became principal of the Congregation Mikveh Israel religious school and joined the Gratz College faculty  He placed great emphasis on educating people so that they would be  well integrated  free and independent in their thinking  concerned about improving and enhancing the world  and eager to participate in making life more meaningful and worthwhile for all   a mission that shaped and was subsequently adopted by his son              Elsie  who also taught at Mikveh Israel  shared her leftist politics and care for social issues with her sons             
Noam s only sibling  David Eli Chomsky              was born five years later  and worked as a cardiologist in Philadelphia                          The brothers were close  though David was more easygoing while Noam could be very competitive  They were raised Jewish  being taught Hebrew and regularly involved with discussing the political theories of Zionism  the family was particularly influenced by the Left Zionist writings of Ahad Ha am              He faced antisemitism as a child  particularly from Philadelphia s Irish and German communities             
Chomsky attended the independent  Deweyite Oak Lane Country Day School             and Philadelphia s Central High School  where he excelled academically and joined various clubs and societies  but was troubled by the school s hierarchical and domineering teaching methods              He also attended Hebrew High School at Gratz College  where his father taught             
Chomsky has described his parents as  normal Roosevelt Democrats  with center left politics  but relatives involved in the International Ladies  Garment Workers  Union exposed him to socialism and far left politics              He was substantially influenced by his uncle and the Jewish leftists who frequented his New York City newspaper stand to debate current affairs              Chomsky himself often visited left wing and anarchist bookstores when visiting his uncle in the city  voraciously reading political literature              He became absorbed in the story of the      fall of Barcelona and suppression of the Spanish anarchosyndicalist movement  writing his first article on the topic at the age of                 That he came to identify with anarchism first rather than another leftist movement  he described as a  lucky accident               Chomsky was firmly anti Bolshevik by his early teens             

University           
In       at the age of     Chomsky began a general program of study at the University of Pennsylvania  where he explored philosophy  logic  and languages and developed a primary interest in learning Arabic              Living at home  he funded his undergraduate degree by teaching Hebrew              Frustrated with his experiences at the university  he considered dropping out and moving to a kibbutz in Mandatory Palestine              but his intellectual curiosity was reawakened through conversations with the linguist Zellig Harris  whom he first met in a political circle in       Harris introduced Chomsky to the field of theoretical linguistics and convinced him to major in the subject              Chomsky s BA honors thesis   Morphophonemics of Modern Hebrew   applied Harris s methods to the language              Chomsky revised this thesis for his MA  which he received from the University of Pennsylvania in       it was subsequently published as a book              He also developed his interest in philosophy while at university  in particular under the tutelage of Nelson Goodman             
From      to       Chomsky was a member of the Society of Fellows at Harvard University  where he undertook research on what became his doctoral dissertation              Having been encouraged by Goodman to apply              Chomsky was attracted to Harvard in part because the philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine was based there  Both Quine and a visiting philosopher  J  L  Austin of the University of Oxford  strongly influenced Chomsky              In       Chomsky published his first academic article in The Journal of Symbolic Logic              Highly critical of the established behaviorist currents in linguistics  in       he presented his ideas at lectures at the University of Chicago and Yale University              He had not been registered as a student at Pennsylvania for four years  but in      he submitted a thesis setting out his ideas on transformational grammar  he was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree for it  and it was privately distributed among specialists on microfilm before being published in      as part of The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory              Harvard professor George Armitage Miller was impressed by Chomsky s thesis and collaborated with him on several technical papers in mathematical linguistics              Chomsky s doctorate exempted him from compulsory military service  which was otherwise due to begin in                  
In       Chomsky began a romantic relationship with Carol Doris Schatz  whom he had known since early childhood  They married in                   After Chomsky was made a Fellow at Harvard  the couple moved to the Allston area of Boston and remained there until       when they relocated to the suburb of Lexington              The couple took a Harvard travel grant to Europe in                   He enjoyed living in Hashomer Hatzair s HaZore a kibbutz while in Israel  but was appalled by his interactions with Jewish nationalism  anti Arab racism and  within the kibbutz s leftist community  Stalinism              On visits to New York City  Chomsky continued to frequent the office of the Yiddish anarchist journal Fraye Arbeter Shtime and became enamored with the ideas of Rudolf Rocker  a contributor whose work introduced Chomsky to the link between anarchism and classical liberalism              Chomsky also read other political thinkers  the anarchists Mikhail Bakunin and Diego Abad de Santill n  democratic socialists George Orwell  Bertrand Russell  and Dwight Macdonald  and works by Marxists Karl Liebknecht  Karl Korsch  and Rosa Luxemburg              His politics were reaffirmed by Orwell s depiction of Barcelona s functioning anarchist society in Homage to Catalonia                     Chomsky read the leftist journal Politics  which furthered his interest in anarchism              and the council communist periodical Living Marxism  though he rejected the Marxist orthodoxy of its editor  Paul Mattick             

Early career           
Chomsky befriended two linguists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  MIT  Morris Halle and Roman Jakobson the latter of whom secured him an assistant professor position there in       At MIT  Chomsky spent half his time on a mechanical translation project and half teaching a course on linguistics and philosophy              He described MIT as open to experimentation where he was free to pursue his idiosyncratic interests              MIT promoted him to the position of associate professor in       and over the next year he was also a visiting professor at Columbia University              The Chomskys had their first child  Aviva  that same year              He also published his first book on linguistics  Syntactic Structures  a work that radically opposed the dominant Harris Bloomfield trend in the field              Responses to Chomsky s ideas ranged from indifference to hostility  and his work proved divisive and caused  significant upheaval  in the discipline              The linguist John Lyons later asserted that Syntactic Structures  revolutionized the scientific study of language               From      to      Chomsky was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton  New Jersey

Chomsky s provocative critique of B  F  Skinner  who viewed language as learned behavior  and that critique s challenge to the dominant behaviorist paradigm thrust Chomsky into the limelight  Chomsky argued that behaviorism underplayed the role of human creativity in learning language and overplayed the role of external conditions in influencing verbal behavior              He proceeded to found MIT s graduate program in linguistics with Halle  In       Chomsky received tenure and became a full professor in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics              He was appointed plenary speaker at the Ninth International Congress of Linguists  held in      in Cambridge  Massachusetts  which established him as the de facto spokesperson of American linguistics              Between      and      he consulted on a military sponsored project to teach computers to understand natural English commands from military generals             
Chomsky continued to publish his linguistic ideas throughout the decade  including in Aspects of the Theory of Syntax         Topics in the Theory of Generative Grammar         and Cartesian Linguistics  A Chapter in the History of Rationalist Thought                     Along with Halle  he also edited the Studies in Language series of books for Harper and Row              As he began to accrue significant academic recognition and honors for his work  Chomsky lectured at the University of California  Berkeley  in                   These lectures were published as Language and Mind in                   In the late     s  a high profile intellectual rift later known as the linguistic wars developed between Chomsky and some of his colleagues and doctoral students including Paul Postal  John Ross  George Lakoff  and James D  McCawley who contended that Chomsky s syntax based  interpretivist linguistics did not properly account for semantic context  general semantics   A post hoc assessment of this period concluded that the opposing programs ultimately were complementary  each informing the other             

Anti war activism and dissent           


 I t does not require very far reaching  specialized knowledge to perceive that the United States was invading South Vietnam  And  in fact  to take apart the system of illusions and deception which functions to prevent understanding of contemporary reality  is  not a task that requires extraordinary skill or understanding  It requires the kind of normal skepticism and willingness to apply one s analytical skills that almost all people have and that they can exercise 


 Chomsky on the Vietnam War            

Chomsky joined protests against U S  involvement in the Vietnam War in       speaking on the subject at small gatherings in churches and homes              His      critique of U S  involvement   The Responsibility of Intellectuals   among other contributions to The New York Review of Books  debuted Chomsky as a public dissident              This essay and other political articles were collected and published in      as part of Chomsky s first political book  American Power and the New Mandarins              He followed this with further political books  including At War with Asia         The Backroom Boys         For Reasons of State         and Peace in the Middle East          published by Pantheon Books              These publications led to Chomsky s association with the American New Left movement              though he thought little of prominent New Left intellectuals Herbert Marcuse and Erich Fromm and preferred the company of activists to that of intellectuals              Chomsky remained largely ignored by the mainstream press throughout this period

Chomsky also became involved in left wing activism  Chomsky refused to pay half his taxes  publicly supported students who refused the draft  and was arrested while participating in an anti war teach in outside the Pentagon              During this time  Chomsky co founded the anti war collective RESIST with Mitchell Goodman  Denise Levertov  William Sloane Coffin  and Dwight Macdonald              Although he questioned the objectives of the      student protests              Chomsky regularly gave lectures to student activist groups and  with his colleague Louis Kampf  ran undergraduate courses on politics at MIT independently of the conservative dominated political science department              When student activists campaigned to stop weapons and counterinsurgency research at MIT  Chomsky was sympathetic but felt that the research should remain under MIT s oversight and limited to systems of deterrence and defense              Chomsky has acknowledged that his MIT lab s funding at this time came from the military              He later said he considered resigning from MIT during the Vietnam War              There has since been a wide ranging debate about what effects Chomsky s employment at MIT had on his political and linguistic ideas

Chomsky s anti war activism led to his arrest on multiple occasions and he was on President Richard Nixon s master list of political opponents              Chomsky was aware of the potential repercussions of his civil disobedience  and his wife began studying for her own doctorate in linguistics to support the family in the event of Chomsky s imprisonment or joblessness              Chomsky s scientific reputation insulated him from administrative action based on his beliefs              In      he visited southeast Asia to lecture at Vietnam s Hanoi University of Science and Technology and toured war refugee camps in Laos  In      he helped lead a committee commemorating the   th anniversary of the War Resisters League             
Chomsky s work in linguistics continued to gain international recognition as he received multiple honorary doctorates              He delivered public lectures at the University of Cambridge  Columbia University  Woodbridge Lectures   and Stanford University              His appearance in a      debate with French continental philosopher Michel Foucault positioned Chomsky as a symbolic figurehead of analytic philosophy              He continued to publish extensively on linguistics  producing Studies on Semantics in Generative Grammar                     an enlarged edition of Language and Mind                     and Reflections on Language                     In      Chomsky became a corresponding fellow of the British Academy

Chomsky in     
In the late     s and     s  Chomsky s linguistic publications expanded and clarified his earlier work  addressing his critics and updating his grammatical theory              His political talks often generated considerable controversy  particularly when he criticized the Israeli government and military               In the early     s Chomsky began collaborating with Edward S  Herman  who had also published critiques of the U S  war in Vietnam               Together they wrote Counter Revolutionary Violence  Bloodbaths in Fact  amp  Propaganda  a book that criticized U S  military involvement in Southeast Asia and the mainstream media s failure to cover it  Warner Modular published it in       but its parent company disapproved of the book s contents and ordered all copies destroyed              
While mainstream publishing options proved elusive  Chomsky found support from Michael Albert s South End Press  an activist oriented publishing company               In       South End published Chomsky and Herman s revised Counter Revolutionary Violence as the two volume The Political Economy of Human Rights               which compares U S  media reactions to the Cambodian genocide and the Indonesian occupation of East Timor  It argues that because Indonesia was a U S  ally  U S  media ignored the East Timorese situation while focusing on events in Cambodia  a U S  enemy               Chomsky s response included two testimonials before the United Nations  Special Committee on Decolonization  successful encouragement for American media to cover the occupation  and meetings with refugees in Lisbon               Marxist academic Steven Lukes most prominently publicly accused Chomsky of betraying his anarchist ideals and acting as an apologist for Cambodian leader Pol Pot               Herman said that the controversy  imposed a serious personal cost  on Chomsky               who considered the personal criticism less important than the evidence that  mainstream intelligentsia suppressed or justified the crimes of their own states               
Chomsky had long publicly criticized Nazism  and totalitarianism more generally  but his commitment to freedom of speech led him to defend the right of French historian Robert Faurisson to advocate a position widely characterized as Holocaust denial  Without Chomsky s knowledge  his plea for Faurisson s freedom of speech was published as the preface to the latter s      book M moire en d fense contre ceux qui m accusent de falsifier l histoire               Chomsky was widely condemned for defending Faurisson               and France s mainstream press accused Chomsky of being a Holocaust denier himself  refusing to publish his rebuttals to their accusations               Critiquing Chomsky s position  sociologist Werner Cohn later published an analysis of the affair titled Partners in Hate  Noam Chomsky and the Holocaust Deniers               The Faurisson affair had a lasting  damaging effect on Chomsky s career               especially in France

In       during the Nicaraguan Contra War in which the U S  supported the contra militia against the Sandinista government Chomsky traveled to Managua to meet with workers  organizations and refugees of the conflict  giving public lectures on politics and linguistics               Many of these lectures were published in      as On Power and Ideology  The Managua Lectures               In      he published The Fateful Triangle  which argued that the U S  had continually used the Israeli Palestinian conflict for its own ends               In       Chomsky visited the Palestinian territories to witness the impact of Israeli occupation              
Chomsky and Herman s Manufacturing Consent  The Political Economy of the Mass Media        outlines their propaganda model for understanding mainstream media  Even in countries without official censorship  they argued  the news is censored through five filters that greatly influence both what and how news is presented               The book received a      film adaptation               In       Chomsky published Necessary Illusions  Thought Control in Democratic Societies  in which he suggests that a worthwhile democracy requires that its citizens undertake intellectual self defense against the media and elite intellectual culture that seeks to control them               By the     s  Chomsky s students had become prominent linguists who  in turn  expanded and revised his linguistic theories              

Chomsky speaking in support of the Occupy movement in     
In the     s  Chomsky embraced political activism to a greater degree than before               Retaining his commitment to the cause of East Timorese independence  in      he visited Australia to talk on the issue at the behest of the East Timorese Relief Association and the National Council for East Timorese Resistance               The lectures he gave on the subject were published as Powers and Prospects in                    As a result of the international publicity Chomsky generated  his biographer Wolfgang Sperlich opined that he did more to aid the cause of East Timorese independence than anyone but the investigative journalist John Pilger               After East Timor attained independence from Indonesia in       the Australian led International Force for East Timor arrived as a peacekeeping force  Chomsky was critical of this  believing it was designed to secure Australian access to East Timor s oil and gas reserves under the Timor Gap Treaty              
Chomsky was widely interviewed after the September    attacks in      as the American public attempted to make sense of the attacks               He argued that the ensuing War on Terror was not a new development but a continuation of U S  foreign policy and concomitant rhetoric since at least the Reagan era               He gave the D T  Lakdawala Memorial Lecture in New Delhi in                    and in      visited Cuba at the invitation of the Latin American Association of Social Scientists               Chomsky s      Hegemony or Survival articulated what he called the United States   imperial grand strategy  and critiqued the Iraq War and other aspects of the War on Terror               Chomsky toured internationally with greater regularity during this period               
During the      Scottish independence referendum  Chomsky supported Scottish independence              

Retirement
Chomsky retired from MIT in                    but continued to conduct research and seminars on campus as an emeritus               That same year he visited Turkey to attend the trial of a publisher who had been accused of treason for printing one of Chomsky s books  Chomsky insisted on being a co defendant and amid international media attention  the Security Courts dropped the charge on the first day               During that trip Chomsky visited Kurdish areas of Turkey and spoke out in favor of the Kurds  human rights               A supporter of the World Social Forum  he attended its conferences in Brazil in both      and       also attending the Forum event in India

Chomsky supported the      Occupy movement  speaking at encampments and publishing on the movement  which he called a reaction to a    year class war               The      documentary Requiem for the American Dream summarizes his views on capitalism and economic inequality through a     minute teach in               
In      Chomsky and his wife purchased a residence in S o Paulo  Brazil  and began splitting their time between Brazil and the U S               Chomsky taught a short term politics course at the University of Arizona in                    He was later hired as a part time professor in its linguistics department with duties including teaching and public seminars               His salary was covered by philanthropic donations               After a stroke in June       Chomsky moved to Brazil full time              

Linguistic theory


What started as purely linguistic research          has led  through involvement in political causes and an identification with an older philosophic tradition  to no less than an attempt to formulate an overall theory of man  The roots of this are manifest in the linguistic theory          The discovery of cognitive structures common to the human race but only to humans  species specific   leads quite easily to thinking of unalienable human attributes 


 Edward Marcotte on the significance of Chomsky s linguistic theory             

The basis of Chomsky s linguistic theory lies in biolinguistics  the linguistic school that holds that the principles underpinning the structure of language are biologically preset in the human mind and hence genetically inherited               He argues that all humans share the same underlying linguistic structure  irrespective of sociocultural differences               In adopting this position Chomsky rejects the radical behaviorist psychology of B       F  Skinner  who viewed speech  thought  and all behavior as a completely learned product of the interactions between organisms and their environments  Accordingly  Chomsky argues that language is a unique evolutionary development of the human species and distinguished from modes of communication used by any other animal species                            Chomsky argues that his nativist  internalist view of language is consistent with the philosophical school of  rationalism  and contrasts with the anti nativist  externalist view of language consistent with the philosophical school of  empiricism                which contends that all knowledge  including language  comes from external stimuli               Historians have disputed Chomsky s claim about rationalism on the basis that his theory of innate grammar excludes propositional knowledge and instead focuses on innate learning capacities or structures              

Universal grammar
Main article  Universal grammar
Since the     s  Chomsky has maintained that syntactic knowledge is partially inborn  implying that children need only learn certain language specific features of their native languages  He bases his argument on observations about human language acquisition and describes a  poverty of the stimulus   an enormous gap between the linguistic stimuli to which children are exposed and the rich linguistic competence they attain  For example  although children are exposed to only a very small and finite subset of the allowable syntactic variants within their first language  they somehow acquire the highly organized and systematic ability to understand and produce an infinite number of sentences  including ones that have never before been uttered  in that language               To explain this  Chomsky proposed that the primary linguistic data must be supplemented by an innate linguistic capacity  Furthermore  while a human baby and a kitten are both capable of inductive reasoning  if they are exposed to exactly the same linguistic data  the human will always acquire the ability to understand and produce language  while the kitten will never acquire either ability  Chomsky referred to this difference in capacity as the language acquisition device  and suggested that linguists needed to determine both what that device is and what constraints it imposes on the range of possible human languages  The universal features that result from these constraints would constitute  universal grammar                                          Multiple researchers have challenged universal grammar on the grounds of the evolutionary infeasibility of its genetic basis for language               the lack of crosslinguistic surface universals               and the unproven link between innate universal structures and the structures of specific languages               Michael Tomasello has challenged Chomsky s theory of innate syntactic knowledge as based on theory and not behavioral observation               The empirical basis of poverty of the stimulus arguments has been challenged by Geoffrey Pullum and others  leading to back and forth debate in the language acquisition literature                            Recent work has also suggested that some recurrent neural network architectures can learn hierarchical structure without an explicit constraint              

Generative grammar
Main articles  Generative grammar  Transformational grammar  Chomsky hierarchy  and Minimalist program
Chomsky is generally credited with launching the research tradition of generative grammar  which aims to explain the cognitive basis of language by formulating and testing explicit models of humans  subconscious grammatical knowledge  Generative grammar proposes models of language consisting of explicit rule systems  which make testable falsifiable predictions  The goal of generative grammar is sometimes described as answering the question  What is that that you know when you know a language                            
Within generative grammar  Chomsky s initial model was called transformational grammar  Chomsky developed transformational grammar in the mid     s  whereupon it became the dominant syntactic theory in linguistics for two decades                Transformations  are syntactic rules that derive surface structure from deep structure  which was often considered to reflect the structure of meaning               Transformational grammar later developed into the     s government and binding theory and thence into the minimalist program               This research focused on the principles and parameters framework  which explained children s ability to learn any language by filling open parameters  a set of universal grammar principles  that adapt as the child encounters linguistic data               The minimalist program  initiated by Chomsky               asks which minimal principles and parameters theory fits most elegantly  naturally  and simply              

Set inclusions described by the Chomsky hierarchy
Chomsky is commonly credited with inventing transformational generative grammar  but his original contribution was considered modest when he first published his theory  In his      dissertation and his      textbook Syntactic Structures  he presented recent developments in the analysis formulated by Zellig Harris  who was Chomsky s PhD supervisor  and by Charles F  Hockett      c      Their method derives from the work of the structural linguist Louis Hjelmslev  who introduced algorithmic grammar to general linguistics      d      Based on this rule based notation of grammars   Chomsky grouped logically possible phrase structure grammar types into a series of four nested subsets and increasingly complex types  together known as the Chomsky hierarchy  This classification remains relevant to formal language theory              and theoretical computer science  especially programming language theory               compiler construction  and automata theory               Chomsky s Syntactic Structures became  beyond generative linguistics as such  a catalyst for connecting what in Hjelmslev s and Jespersen s time was the beginnings of structural linguistics  which has become cognitive linguistics              

Political views
Main article  Political positions of Noam Chomsky


The second major area to which Chomsky has contributed and surely the best known in terms of the number of people in his audience and the ease of understanding what he writes and says is his work on sociopolitical analysis  political  social  and economic history  and critical assessment of current political circumstance  In Chomsky s view  although those in power might and do try to obscure their intentions and to defend their actions in ways that make them acceptable to citizens  it is easy for anyone who is willing to be critical and consider the facts to discern what they are up to 


 James McGilvray                   

Chomsky is a prominent political dissident      e      His political views have changed little since his childhood               when he was influenced by the emphasis on political activism that was ingrained in Jewish working class tradition               He usually identifies as an anarcho syndicalist or a libertarian socialist               He views these positions not as precise political theories but as ideals that he thinks best meet human needs  liberty  community  and freedom of association               Unlike some other socialists  such as Marxists  Chomsky believes that politics lies outside the remit of science               but he still roots his ideas about an ideal society in empirical data and empirically justified theories              
In Chomsky s view  the truth about political realities is systematically distorted or suppressed by an elite corporatocracy  which uses corporate media  advertising  and think tanks to promote its own propaganda  His work seeks to reveal such manipulations and the truth they obscure               Chomsky believes this web of falsehood can be broken by  common sense   critical thinking  and understanding the roles of self interest and self deception               and that intellectuals abdicate their moral responsibility to tell the truth about the world in fear of losing prestige and funding               He argues that  as such an intellectual  it is his duty to use his social privilege  resources  and training to aid popular democracy movements in their struggles              
Although he has participated in direct action demonstrations joining protests  being arrested  organizing groups Chomsky s primary political outlet is education  i e   free public lessons               He is a longtime member of the Industrial Workers of the World international union               as was his father              

United States foreign policy
Chomsky at the      World Social Forum  a convention for counter hegemonic globalization  in Porto Alegre
Chomsky has been a prominent critic of  American imperialism                but is not a pacifist  believing World War II was justified as America s last defensive war               He believes that U S  foreign policy s basic principle is the establishment of  open societies  that are economically and politically controlled by the U S  and where U S  based businesses can prosper               He argues that the U S  seeks to suppress any movements within these countries that are not compliant with U S  interests and to ensure that U S  friendly governments are placed in power               When discussing current events  he emphasizes their place within a wider historical perspective               He believes that official  sanctioned historical accounts of U S  and British extraterritorial operations have consistently whitewashed these nations  actions in order to present them as having benevolent motives in either spreading democracy or  in older instances  spreading Christianity  by criticizing these accounts  he seeks to correct them               Prominent examples he regularly cites are the actions of the British Empire in India and Africa and U S  actions in Vietnam  the Philippines  Latin America  and the Middle East              
Chomsky s political work has centered heavily on criticizing the actions of the United States               He has said he focuses on the U S  because the country has militarily and economically dominated the world during his lifetime and because its liberal democratic electoral system allows the citizenry to influence government policy               His hope is that  by spreading awareness of the impact U S  foreign policies have on the populations affected by them  he can sway the populations of the U S  and other countries into opposing the policies               He urges people to criticize their governments  motivations  decisions  and actions  to accept responsibility for their own thoughts and actions  and to apply the same standards to others as to themselves              
Chomsky has been critical of U S  involvement in the Israeli Palestinian conflict  arguing that it has consistently blocked a peaceful settlement               He also criticizes the U S  s close ties with Saudi Arabia and involvement in Saudi Arabian led intervention in Yemen  highlighting that Saudi Arabia has  one of the most grotesque human rights records in the world               
Chomsky called the Russian invasion of Ukraine a criminal act of aggression and noted that Russia was committing major war crimes in the country  He considered support for Ukraine s self defense legitimate and said Ukraine should be given enough military aid to defend itself  but not enough to cause  an escalation                His criticism of the war focused on the United States               He alleged that the U S  rejected any compromise with Russia and that this might have provoked the invasion               According to Chomsky  the U S  was arming Ukraine only to weaken Russia  and Ukrainian requests for heavy weaponry were untrue  Western propaganda   despite Ukraine s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy repeatedly asking for them               More than a year into the invasion  Chomsky argued that Russia was waging the war  more humanely  than the U S  did the invasion of Iraq              

Capitalism and socialism
In his youth  Chomsky developed a dislike of capitalism and the pursuit of material wealth               At the same time  he developed a disdain for authoritarian socialism  as represented by the Marxist Leninist policies of the Soviet Union               Rather than accepting the common view among U S  economists that a spectrum exists between total state ownership of the economy and total private ownership  he instead suggests that a spectrum should be understood between total democratic control of the economy and total autocratic control  whether state or private                He argues that Western capitalist countries are not really democratic               because  in his view  a truly democratic society is one in which all persons have a say in public economic policy               He has stated his opposition to ruling elites  among them institutions like the IMF  World Bank  and GATT  precursor to the WTO               
Chomsky highlights that  since the     s  the U S  has become increasingly economically unequal as a result of the repeal of various financial regulations and the unilateral rescinding of the Bretton Woods financial control agreement by the U S               He characterizes the U S  as a de facto one party state  viewing both the Republican Party and Democratic Party as manifestations of a single  Business Party  controlled by corporate and financial interests               Chomsky highlights that  within Western capitalist liberal democracies  at least     of the population has no control over economic decisions  which are instead in the hands of a management class and ultimately controlled by a small  wealthy elite              
Noting the entrenchment of such an economic system  Chomsky believes that change is possible through the organized cooperation of large numbers of people who understand the problem and know how they want to reorganize the economy more equitably               Acknowledging that corporate domination of media and government stifles any significant change to this system  he sees reason for optimism in historical examples such as the social rejection of slavery as immoral  the advances in women s rights  and the forcing of government to justify invasions               He views violent revolution to overthrow a government as a last resort to be avoided if possible  citing the example of historical revolutions where the population s welfare has worsened as a result of upheaval              
Chomsky sees libertarian socialist and anarcho syndicalist ideas as the descendants of the classical liberal ideas of the Age of Enlightenment               arguing that his ideological position revolves around  nourishing the libertarian and creative character of the human being                He envisions an anarcho syndicalist future with direct worker control of the means of production and government by workers  councils  who would select temporary and revocable representatives to meet together at general assemblies               The point of this self governance is to make each citizen  in Thomas Jefferson s words   a direct participator in the government of affairs                He believes that there will be no need for political parties               By controlling their productive life  he believes that individuals can gain job satisfaction and a sense of fulfillment and purpose               He argues that unpleasant and unpopular jobs could be fully automated  specially remunerated  or communally shared              

Israeli Palestinian conflict
Chomsky has written prolifically about the Israeli Palestinian conflict  aiming to raise public awareness of it               A labor Zionist who later became what is today considered an anti Zionist  Chomsky has criticized the Israeli settlements in the Israeli occupied West Bank  which he likens to a settler colony               He has said that the      United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was a bad decision  but given the realpolitik of the situation  he has also considered a two state solution on the condition that the nation states exist on equal terms              
Chomsky has said that characterizing Israel s treatment of the Palestinians as apartheid  similar to the system that existed in South Africa  would be a  gift to Israel   as he has long held that  the Occupied Territories are much worse than South Africa                                          South Africa depended on its black population for labor  but Chomsky argues the same is not true of Israel  which in his view seeks to make the situation for Palestinians under its occupation unlivable  especially in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip  where  atrocities  take place every day               He also argues that  unlike South Africa  Israel has not sought the international community s approval  but rather relies solely on U S  support               Chomsky has said that the Israeli led blockade of the Gaza Strip has turned it into a  concentration camp  and expressed fears similar to Israeli intellectual Yeshayahu Leibowitz s     s warning that the continued occupation of the Palestinian territories could turn Israeli Jews into  Judeo Nazis   Chomsky has said that Leibowitz s warning  was a direct reflection of the continued occupation  the humiliation of people  the degradation  and the terrorist attacks by the Israeli government                He has also called the U S  a violent state that exports violence by supporting Israeli  atrocities  against the Palestinians and said that listening to American mainstream media  including CBS  is like listening to  Israeli propaganda agencies               
Chomsky was denied entry to the West Bank in      because of his criticisms of Israel  He had been invited to deliver a lecture at Bir Zeit University and was to meet with Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad                                                      An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman later said that Chomsky was denied entry by mistake              
In his      book The Fateful Triangle  Chomsky criticized the Palestine Liberation Organization for its  self destructiveness  and  suicidal character  and disapproved of its programs of  armed struggle  and  erratic violence   He also criticized the Arab governments as not  decent                             Given what he has described as his very Jewish upbringing with deeply Zionist activist parents  Chomsky s views have drawn controversy and criticism  They are rooted in the kibbutzim and socialist binational cooperation               In a      interview on Democracy Now    Chomsky said that the charter of Hamas  which calls for Israel s destruction   means practically nothing   having been created  by a small group of people under siege  under attack in        He compared it to the electoral program of the Likud party  which  he said   states explicitly that there can never be a Palestinian state west of the Jordan River  And they not only state it in their charter  that s a call for the destruction of Palestine  explicit call for it               

Mass media and propaganda
Main article  Propaganda model
External videos Chomsky on propaganda and the manufacturing of consent  June        
Chomsky s political writings have largely focused on ideology  social and political power  mass media  and state policy               One of his best known works  Manufacturing Consent  dissects the media s role in reinforcing and acquiescing to state policies across the political spectrum while marginalizing contrary perspectives  Chomsky asserts that this version of censorship  by government guided  free market  forces  is subtler and harder to undermine than was the equivalent propaganda system in the Soviet Union               As he argues  the mainstream press is corporate owned and thus reflects corporate priorities and interests               Acknowledging that many American journalists are dedicated and well meaning  he argues that the mass media s choices of topics and issues  the unquestioned premises on which that coverage rests  and the range of opinions expressed are all constrained to reinforce the state s ideology               although mass media will criticize individual politicians and political parties  it will not undermine the wider state corporate nexus of which it is a part               As evidence  he highlights that the U S  mass media does not employ any socialist journalists or political commentators               He also points to examples of important news stories that the U S  mainstream media has ignored because reporting on them would reflect badly upon the country  including the murder of Black Panther Fred Hampton with possible FBI involvement  the massacres in Nicaragua perpetrated by U S  funded Contras  and the constant reporting on Israeli deaths without equivalent coverage of the far larger number of Palestinian deaths in that conflict               To remedy this situation  Chomsky calls for grassroots democratic control and involvement of the media              
Chomsky considers most conspiracy theories fruitless  distracting substitutes for thinking about policy formation in an institutional framework  where individual manipulation is secondary to broader social imperatives               He separates his Propaganda Model from conspiracy in that he is describing institutions following their natural imperatives rather than collusive forces with secret controls               Instead of supporting the educational system as an antidote  he believes that most education is counterproductive               Chomsky describes mass education as a system solely intended to turn farmers from independent producers into unthinking industrial employees              

Reactions of critics and counter criticism      s present
In the      book The Anti Chomsky Reader  Peter Collier and David Horowitz accuse Chomsky of cherry picking facts to suit his theories               Horowitz has also criticized Chomsky s anti Americanism              

For    years Noam Chomsky has turned out book after book  pamphlet after pamphlet and speech after speech with one message  and one message alone  America is the Great Satan  it is the fount of evil in the world  In Chomsky s demented universe  America is responsible not only for its own bad deeds  but for the bad deeds of others  including those of the terrorists who struck the World Trade Center and the Pentagon  In this attitude he is the medium for all those who now search the ruins of Manhattan not for the victims and the American dead  but for the  root causes  of the catastrophe that befell them 
For the conservative public policy think tank the Hoover Institution  Peter Schweizer wrote in January        Chomsky favors the estate tax and massive income redistribution just not the redistribution of his income   Schweizer criticized Chomsky for setting up an estate plan and protecting his own intellectual property as it relates to his published works  as well as the high speaking fees that Chomsky received on a regular basis  around                per talk at that time                           

Chomsky has been accused of treating socialist or communist regimes with credulity and examining capitalist regimes with greater scrutiny or criticism              Chomsky s analysis of U S  actions plunged deep into dark U S  machinations  but when traveling among the Communists he rested content with appearances  The countryside outside Hanoi  he reported in The New York Review of Books  displayed  a high degree of democratic participation at the village and regional levels   But how could he tell  Chomsky did not speak Vietnamese  and so he depended on government translators  tour guides  and handlers for information  In  Communist  Vietnamese hands  the clear eyed skepticism turned into willing credulousness              According to Nikolas Kozloff  writing for Al Jazeera in September       Chomsky  has drawn the world s attention to the various misdeeds of the US and its proxies around the world  and for that he deserves credit  Yet  in seeking to avoid controversy at all costs Chomsky has turned into something of an ideologue  Scour the Chomsky web site and you won t find significant discussion of Belarus or Latin America s flirtation with outside authoritarian leaders  for that matter               
Political activist George Monbiot has argued that  Part of the problem is that a kind of cult has developed around Noam Chomsky and John Pilger  which cannot believe they could ever be wrong  and produces ever more elaborate conspiracy theories to justify their mistakes               
Anarchist and primitivist John Zerzan has accused Chomsky of not being a real anarchist  saying that he is instead  a liberal leftist politically  and downright reactionary in his academic specialty  linguistic theory  Chomsky is also  by all accounts  a generous  sincere  tireless activist which does not  unfortunately  ensure his thinking has liberatory value               
Defenders of Chomsky have countered that he has been censored or left out of public debate  Claims of this nature date to the Reagan era  Writing for The Washington Post in February       Saul Landau wrote   It is unhealthy that Chomsky s insights are excluded from the policy debate  His relentless prosecutorial prose  with a hint of Talmudic whine and the rationalist anarchism of Tom Paine  may reflect a justified frustration               

Philosophy
Chomsky has also been active in a number of philosophical fields  including philosophy of mind  philosophy of language  and philosophy of science               In these fields he is credited with ushering in the  cognitive revolution                a significant paradigm shift that rejected logical positivism  the prevailing philosophical methodology of the time  and reframed how philosophers think about language and the mind               Chomsky views the cognitive revolution as rooted in   th century rationalist ideals               His position the idea that the mind contains inherent structures to understand language  perception  and thought has more in common with rationalism than behaviorism               He named one of his key works Cartesian Linguistics  A Chapter in the History of Rationalist Thought                      This sparked criticism from historians and philosophers who disagreed with Chomsky s interpretations of classical sources and use of philosophical terminology      f      In the philosophy of language  Chomsky is particularly known for his criticisms of the notion of reference and meaning in human language and his perspective on the nature and function of mental representations              
Chomsky s famous      debate on human nature with the French philosopher Michel Foucault was a symbolic clash of the analytic and continental philosophy traditions  represented by Chomsky and Foucault  respectively              It showed what appeared to be irreconcilable differences between two moral and intellectual luminaries of the   th century  Foucault held that any definition of human nature is connected to our present day conceptions of ourselves  Chomsky held that human nature contained universals such as a common standard of moral justice as deduced through reason               Chomsky criticized postmodernism and French philosophy generally  arguing that the obscure language of postmodern  leftist philosophers gives little aid to the working classes               He has also debated analytic philosophers  including Tyler Burge  Donald Davidson  Michael Dummett  Saul Kripke  Thomas Nagel  Hilary Putnam  Willard Van Orman Quine  and John Searle              
Chomsky s contributions span intellectual and world history  including the history of philosophy               Irony is a recurring characteristic of his writing  such as rhetorically implying that his readers already know something to be true  which engages the reader more actively in assessing the veracity of his claims              

Personal life
Wasserman and Chomsky in     
Chomsky endeavors to separate his family life  linguistic scholarship  and political activism from each other               An intensely private person               he is uninterested in appearances and the fame his work has brought him               McGilvray suggests that Chomsky is not motivated by a desire for fame  but impelled to tell what he perceives as the truth and a desire to aid others in doing so               Chomsky acknowledges that his income affords him a privileged life compared to the majority of the world s population               nevertheless  he characterizes himself as a  worker   albeit one who uses his intellect as his employable skill               He reads four or five newspapers daily  in the U S   he subscribes to The Boston Globe  The New York Times  The Wall Street Journal  Financial Times  and The Christian Science Monitor               Chomsky is not religious but has expressed approval of forms of religion such as liberation theology              
Chomsky is known to use charged language   corrupt    fascist    fraudulent   when describing established political and academic figures  which can polarize his audience but is in keeping with his belief that much scholarship is self serving               His colleague Steven Pinker has said that Chomsky  portrays people who disagree with him as stupid or evil  using withering scorn in his rhetoric   and that this contributes to the extreme reactions he receives               Chomsky avoids academic conferences  including left oriented ones such as the Socialist Scholars Conference  preferring to speak to activist groups or hold university seminars for mass audiences               His approach to academic freedom has led him to support MIT academics whose actions he deplores  in       when Chomsky heard that Walt Rostow  a major architect of the Vietnam war  wanted to return to work at MIT  Chomsky threatened  to protest publicly  if Rostow were denied a position at MIT  In       when Pentagon adviser John Deutch applied to be president of MIT  Chomsky supported his candidacy  Later  when Deutch became head of the CIA  The New York Times quoted Chomsky as saying   He has more honesty and integrity than anyone I ve ever met           If somebody s got to be running the CIA  I m glad it s him               
Chomsky was married to Carol Doris  n e      Schatz  from      until her death in                    They had three children together  Aviva  b         Diane  b         and Harry  b                      In       Chomsky married Valeria Wasserman               They have owned a home in Wasserman s native country  Brazil  since                   
In       Chomsky suffered a massive stroke and was flown to a hospital in S o Paulo  Brazil  to recuperate               He can no longer walk or communicate  making his return to public life improbable               but he continues to follow current events such as the Gaza war               He was discharged in June      to continue his recovery at home               The same month  Chomsky trended on social media amid false reports of his death  Periodicals retracted premature obituaries              

Reception and influence


 Chomsky s  voice is heard in academia beyond linguistics and philosophy  from computer science to neuroscience  from anthropology to education  mathematics and literary criticism  If we include Chomsky s political activism then the boundaries become quite blurred  and it comes as no surprise that Chomsky is increasingly seen as enemy number one by those who inhabit that wide sphere of reactionary discourse and action 


 Sperlich                   

Chomsky has been a defining Western intellectual figure  central to the field of linguistics and definitive in cognitive science  computer science  philosophy  and psychology               In addition to being known as one of the most important intellectuals of his time      g      Chomsky has a dual legacy as a leader and luminary in both linguistics and the realm of political dissent               Despite his academic success  his political viewpoints and activism have resulted in his being distrusted by mainstream media  and he is regarded as being  on the outer margin of acceptability                Chomsky s public image and social reputation often color his work s public reception            

In academia
McGilvray observes that Chomsky inaugurated the  cognitive revolution  in linguistics               and that he is largely responsible for establishing the field as a formal  natural science               moving it away from the procedural form of structural linguistics dominant during the mid   th century               As such  some have called Chomsky  the father of modern linguistics       b      Linguist John Lyons further remarked that within a few decades of publication  Chomskyan linguistics had become  the most dynamic and influential  school of thought in the field               By the     s his work had also come to exert a considerable influence on philosophy               and a Minnesota State University Moorhead poll ranked Syntactic Structures as the single most important work in cognitive science               In addition  his work in automata theory and the Chomsky hierarchy have become well known in computer science  and he is much cited in computational linguistics                                        
Chomsky s criticisms of behaviorism contributed substantially to the decline of behaviorist psychology               in addition  he is generally regarded as one of the primary founders of the field of cognitive science                            Some arguments in evolutionary psychology are derived from his research results               Nim Chimpsky  a chimpanzee who was the subject of a study in animal language acquisition at Columbia University  was named after Chomsky in reference to his view of language acquisition as a uniquely human ability              
ACM Turing Award winner Donald Knuth credited Chomsky s work with helping him combine his interests in mathematics  linguistics  and computer science               IBM computer scientist John Backus  another Turing Award winner  used some of Chomsky s concepts to help him develop FORTRAN  the first widely used high level computer programming language               Chomsky s theory of generative grammar has also influenced work in music theory and analysis  such as Fred Lerdahl s and Ray Jackendoff s generative theory of tonal music                                        
Chomsky is among the most cited authors living or dead      h      He was cited within the Arts and Humanities Citation Index more often than any other living scholar from      to                    Chomsky was also extensively cited in the Social Sciences Citation Index and Science Citation Index during the same period  The librarian who conducted the research said that the statistics show that  he is very widely read across disciplines and that his work is used by researchers across disciplines          it seems that you can t write a paper without citing Noam Chomsky                As a result of his influence  there are dueling camps of Chomskyan and non Chomskyan linguistics  Their disputes are often acrimonious               Additionally  according to journalist Maya Jaggi  Chomsky is among the most quoted sources in the humanities  ranking alongside Marx  Shakespeare and the Bible              

In politics
Chomsky cautions against ignoring the threats of climate change and nuclear war in the wake of Donald Trump s election  in a      speech 
Chomsky s status as the  most quoted living author  is credited to his political writings  which vastly outnumber his writings on linguistics               Chomsky biographer Wolfgang B  Sperlich characterizes him as  one of the most notable contemporary champions of the people                journalist John Pilger has described him as a  genuine people s hero  an inspiration for struggles all over the world for that basic decency known as freedom  To a lot of people in the margins activists and movements he s unfailingly supportive                Arundhati Roy has called him  one of the greatest  most radical public thinkers of our time                and Edward Said thought him  one of the most significant challengers of unjust power and delusions                Fred Halliday has said that by the start of the   st century Chomsky had become a  guru  for the world s anti capitalist and anti imperialist movements               The propaganda model of media criticism that he and Herman developed has been widely accepted in radical media critiques and adopted to some level in mainstream criticism of the media               also exerting a significant influence on the growth of alternative media  including radio  publishers  and the Internet  which in turn have helped to disseminate his work              
Despite this broad influence  university departments devoted to history and political science rarely include Chomsky s work on their undergraduate syllabi               Critics have argued that despite publishing widely on social and political issues  Chomsky has no formal expertise in these areas  he has responded that such issues are not as complex as many social scientists claim and that almost everyone is able to comprehend them regardless of whether they have been academically trained to do so               Some have responded to these criticisms by questioning the critics  motives and their understanding of Chomsky s ideas  Sperlich  for instance  says that Chomsky has been vilified by corporate interests  particularly in the mainstream press               Likewise  according to McGilvray  many of Chomsky s critics  do not bother quoting his work or quote out of context  distort  and create straw men that cannot be supported by Chomsky s text               
Chomsky drew criticism for not calling the Bosnian War s Srebrenica massacre a  genocide                             While he did not deny the fact of the massacre               which he called  a horror story and major crime   he felt the massacre did not meet the definition of genocide               Critics have accused Chomsky of denying the Bosnian genocide              
Chomsky s far reaching criticisms of U S  foreign policy and the legitimacy of U S  power have raised controversy  A document obtained pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act  FOIA  request from the U S  government revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency  CIA  monitored his activities and for years denied doing so  The CIA also destroyed its files on Chomsky at some point  possibly in violation of federal law               He has often received undercover police protection at MIT and when speaking on the Middle East but has refused uniformed police protection               German news magazine Der Spiegel described Chomsky as  the Ayatollah of anti American hatred                while American conservative commentator David Horowitz called him  the most devious  the most dishonest and          the most treacherous intellect in America   whose work is infused with  anti American dementia  and evidences his  pathological hatred of his own country               
Chomsky s criticism of Israel has led to his being called a traitor to the Jewish people and an anti Semite               Criticizing Chomsky s defense of the right of individuals to engage in Holocaust denial on the grounds that freedom of speech must be extended to all viewpoints  Werner Cohn called Chomsky  the most important patron  of the neo Nazi movement               The Anti Defamation League  ADL  called him a Holocaust denier               describing him as a  dupe of intellectual pride so overweening that he is incapable of making distinctions between totalitarian and democratic societies  between oppressors and victims                In turn  Chomsky has claimed that the ADL is dominated by  Stalinist types  who oppose democracy in Israel               The lawyer Alan Dershowitz has called Chomsky a  false prophet of the left                Chomsky called Dershowitz  a complete liar  who is on  a crazed jihad  dedicating much of his life to trying to destroy my reputation                In early       President Recep Tayyip Erdo an of Turkey publicly rebuked Chomsky after he signed an open letter condemning Erdo an for his anti Kurdish repression and double standards on terrorism               Chomsky accused Erdo an of hypocrisy  noting that Erdo an supports al Qaeda s Syrian affiliate               the al Nusra Front

Smith       pp            Chomsky s early work was renowned for its mathematical rigor and he made some contribution to the nascent discipline of mathematical linguistics  in particular the analysis of  formal  languages in terms of what is now known as the Chomsky hierarchy  
Koerner       pp             Characteristically  Harris proposes a transfer of sentences from English to Modern Hebrew          Chomsky s approach to syntax in Syntactic Structures and several years thereafter was not much different from Harris s approach  since the concept of  deep  or  underlying structure  had not yet been introduced  The main difference between Harris        and Chomsky        appears to be that the latter is dealing with transfers within one single language only 

  
Koerner       pp         f   it is worth noting that Chomsky cites Hjelmslev s Prolegomena  which had been translated into English in       since the authors  theoretical argument  derived largely from logic and mathematics  exhibits noticeable similarities  
Seuren       pp             Both Hjelmslev and Harris were inspired by the mathematical notion of an algorithm as a purely formal production system for a set of strings of symbols           it is probably accurate to say that Hjelmslev was the first to try and apply it to the generation of strings of symbols in natural language
