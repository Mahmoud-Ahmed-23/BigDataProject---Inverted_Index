							Egypt has been preparing itself recently to be a regional centre for energy especially after recent natural gas discoveries  in addition to other efforts being conducted to deal with other petroleum and mineral resources 
In an exclusive interview with Daily News Egypt  former minister of petroleum and mineral resources  Osama Kamal  unveiled several facts about this sector  explaining the potential that Egypt has and what qualifies it to become the economic capital of the Middle East 
The transcript of the interview is below  lightly edited for clarity 
How do you evaluate the Egyptian economy and investment scene in recent years 
I can say that Egypt has all the potentials that qualify it to be an economic capital for the entire MENA region  My vision is based on that the biggest targeted markets in the world for trading are Europe and Africa which together include     billion inhabitants  At the same time  Egypt is linked with these two giant markets with vital agreements  such as avoiding double taxation treaties  DTTs  with Europe and Africa  In addition  Egypt plays a key role for the global trading movement thanks to the Suez Canal and its new extension 
Furthermore  Egypt has plenty of the technical qualified labour that is required for any project or investment to be established  Thus  Egypt has a competitive edge among other markets  especially when we know that all the previous potentials which I clarified make the product price of any project in Egypt lower by between          per tonne of products  compared to other projects established in other countries 
So  Egypt has an attractive investment market 
All these factors are reasons behind the already existing investments in Egypt now  although the presence of several negative issues like bureaucracy  slowness of registration procedures  and problems related to investment conflicts for instance  All these positive aspects are not available in other markets 
Then  how do you see the role played by the ministry of investment in this regard 
It plays an important role  but  let me point out the experience of a country like India which considers real investment attraction is the  practicing not the theory   and consequently cancelled the ministry of investment on the basis that investment needs a good atmosphere and practical procedures without devoting a portfolio to organise it  
In the same vein  Egypt needs the ministry of investment to ease the mission and stabilise investment policies before investors  and to play a regulatory role in which it introduces all facilities to them  paving the way and preparing the environment to a healthy business investment atmosphere 
But  big steps have been taken by the ministry of investment such as drafting a new Investment Law and opening new investments centres to deal with such troubles 
It is right that there is a new Investment Law and its regulatory frame  in addition to other efforts that are done  but  practicing is not that easy  it must do more to attract more foreign direct investments  FDIs   That is a key issue 
Do you mean that the value of FDIs is the point in this regard 
Exactly  The key factor here is the volume of FDIs that Egypt has attracted since the new law has been in effect  The volume of FDIs is seemingly not enough compared to the efforts that the state is introducing to attract more investments  especially through the president s visits to meet officials from all over the world  meeting with remarkable businesspersons in this regard Â 
Yet  what about Siemens in electricity generating and the new investments in the oil and petroleum field  Are these not considered as FDIs that Egypt has succeeded to recently attract 
In this regard  such investments are not subjected to the ministry of investment  These investments were attracted thanks to direct negotiations hold by President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi 
How do you see the role of the investment ministry in the future 
It certainly has an important role  they can only play a regulatory role  The investment need a suitable atmosphere that focuses on the payoff at the expense of regulations or laws  For instance  the Suez Canal economic zone is a good example 
Another important issue I want to mention  the ministry of investment is not doing business itself  but others do  When Egypt embarks on attracting new investments in the solar energy sector it offers three key incentives in this regard  including allowing the transfer of investor s profits outside Egypt  giving them the right of recourse to arbitration and getting a sovereign guarantee  But  investors were shocked when the final draft of the contract cancelled all these incentives  Such an action impeded the growth in this field  thus the result was that all these projects attracted only one domestic investor 
Therefore  what should be done 
Investment is related to policy stability  and economy and investment policies and strategies which cannot be changed when officials leave their posts  Investment is a normal response to stability 
Meanwhile  we need to track project and investment returns  not regulations as a solid structure  Obligation to regulations and legislations strictly curbs any effort to depend on the private sector or attract foreign investors to help the state benefit the most from its potentials  So  this situation is constraining the state from generating new job opportunities and  consequently  improve the living standard of all Egyptians 
In addition  we must turn into toward electronic system  cancelling any face to face contact  This is the followed system in all thriving countries all over the world  Countries like India  South Africa  Burundi  Ethiopia  and the UAE are all following this lead  The investor in these countries gets his project required permissions in just three days 
How can we follow these countries  experiences lead 
Egypt needs to adopt models of successful countries through establishing cities which represent the models of economic and investment successful countries such as the UAE  Singapore  and China to inspire their experiences in Egypt  This will help us to learn the methods and techniques that are followed there  and on the other hand attract new investments in an easy way 
Let s talk about the mining industry in Egypt  and how this sector is really suffering now 
Unfortunately  the terms that were set to explore gold ore in      didn t help a lot  This sector and its laws and regulations need to be totally restructured in way that can attract investors in similar countries like Australia  South Africa  and Morocco  
Is that relates to the report that the ministry of petroleum and mineral resources mandated to Mackenzie to draft  putting an integrated vision  and making use of mineral wealth in Egypt 
Yes  Mackenzie has already drafted its report and handed it to the ministry of petroleum  I guess the report assured the application of tax and royalty as the best way to explore gold ore and establish a real gold mining industry 
Is that due to the terms were set for exploring oil 
It is completely true  The mineral resources cannot be organised under a frame of oil and petroleum field  there is an vast difference between the two 
According to your experience  what are the benefits that our economy can reap from exploiting our neglected wealth of mineral resources 
Egypt has a wealth of mineral ores  According to a recent study the outcome of our mineral resources for the national economy ranges between an annual EGP    m and EGP    m  But  this average could jump to record    bn within five years  if this wealth started to be tapped 
What about our reserves of natural gas and its ability to cover our consumption and to be exported 
Egypt has   tn cubic feet of natural gas reserves after the Zohr field started to work  The volume of our consumption  including the local consumption and what is prepared for export  records about EGP  tn cubic feet as an outcome  Our reserves in the frame of our consumption now covers our needs for the coming    years 
From your perspective  how do the projected constitutional amendments overshadow the economy and investment scene in Egypt 
I expect that Egypt is to experience massive structural changes after the constitutional amendments are in effect  as it paves the way to more stability in the economic  political  and social aspects  causing the stability that the investment atmosphere requires
