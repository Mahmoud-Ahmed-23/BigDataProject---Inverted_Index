Machine learning model


An image conditioned on the prompt an astronaut riding a horse  by Hiroshige  generated by Stable Diffusion      a large scale text to image model first released in     
A text to image model is a machine learning model which takes an input natural language description and produces an image matching that description  
Text to image models began to be developed in the mid     s during the beginnings of the AI boom  as a result of advances in deep neural networks  In       the output of state of the art text to image models such as OpenAI s DALL E    Google Brain s Imagen  Stability AI s Stable Diffusion  and Midjourney began to be considered to approach the quality of real photographs and human drawn art 
Text to image models are generally latent diffusion models  which combine a language model  which transforms the input text into a latent representation  and a generative image model  which produces an image conditioned on that representation  The most effective models have generally been trained on massive amounts of image and text data scraped from the web            


History edit 
Before the rise of deep learning      when       attempts to build text to image models were limited to collages by arranging existing component images  such as from a database of clip art                       
The inverse task  image captioning  was more tractable  and a number of image captioning deep learning models came prior to the first text to image models

A stop sign is flying in blue skies by OpenAI s DALL E                DALL E                and GPT Image         
The first modern text to image model  alignDRAW  was introduced in      by researchers from the University of Toronto  alignDRAW extended the previously introduced DRAW architecture  which used a recurrent variational autoencoder with an attention mechanism  to be conditioned on text sequences             Images generated by alignDRAW were in small resolution        pixels  attained from resizing  and were considered to be  low in diversity   The model was able to generalize to objects not represented in the training data  such as a red school bus  and appropriately handled novel prompts such as  a stop sign is flying in blue skies   exhibiting output that it was not merely  memorizing  data from the training set                       
In       Reed  Akata  Yan et al  became the first to use generative adversarial networks for the text to image task                        With models trained on narrow  domain specific datasets  they were able to generate  visually plausible  images of birds and flowers from text captions like  an all black bird with a distinct thick  rounded bill   A model trained on the more diverse COCO  Common Objects in Context  dataset produced images which were  from a distance    encouraging   but which lacked coherence in their details             Later systems include VQGAN CLIP             XMC GAN  and GauGAN             
One of the first text to image models to capture widespread public attention was OpenAI s DALL E  a transformer system announced in January                   A successor capable of generating more complex and realistic images  DALL E    was unveiled in April                   followed by Stable Diffusion that was publicly released in August                   In August       text to image personalization allows to teach the model a new concept using a small set of images of a new object that was not included in the training set of the text to image foundation model  This is achieved by textual inversion  namely  finding a new text term that correspond to these images 
Following other text to image models  language model powered text to video platforms such as Runway  Make A Video              Imagen Video              Midjourney              and Phenaki             can generate video from text and or text image prompts

Text to image models have been built using a variety of architectures  The text encoding step may be performed with a recurrent neural network such as a long short term memory  LSTM  network  though transformer models have since become a more popular option  For the image generation step  conditional generative adversarial networks  GANs  have been commonly used  with diffusion models also becoming a popular option in recent years  Rather than directly training a model to output a high resolution image conditioned on a text embedding  a popular technique is to train a model to generate low resolution images  and use one or more auxiliary deep learning models to upscale it  filling in finer details 
Text to image models are trained on large datasets of  text  image  pairs  often scraped from the web  With their      Imagen model  Google Brain reported positive results from using a large language model trained separately on a text only corpus  with its weights subsequently frozen   a departure from the theretofore standard approach             

Datasets edit 
Examples of images and captions from three public datasets which are commonly used to train text to image models
Training a text to image model requires a dataset of images paired with text captions  One dataset commonly used for this purpose is the COCO dataset  Released by Microsoft in       COCO consists of around         images depicting a diversity of objects with five captions per image  generated by human annotators  Originally  the main focus of COCO was on the recognition of objects and scenes in images  Oxford     Flowers and CUB     Birds are smaller datasets of around        images each  restricted to flowers and birds  respectively  It is considered less difficult to train a high quality text to image model with these datasets because of their narrow range of subject matter            
One of the largest open datasets for training text to image models is LAION  B  containing more than   billion image text pairs  This dataset was created using web scraping and automatic filtering based on similarity to high quality artwork and professional photographs  Because of this  however  it also contains controversial content  which has led to discussions about the ethics of its use 
Some modern AI platforms not only generate images from text but also create synthetic datasets to improve model training and fine tuning  These datasets help avoid copyright issues and expand the diversity of training data             

Quality evaluation edit 
Evaluating and comparing the quality of text to image models is a problem involving assessing multiple desirable properties  A desideratum specific to text to image models is that generated images semantically align with the text captions used to generate them  A number of schemes have been devised for assessing these qualities  some automated and others based on human judgement            
A common algorithmic metric for assessing image quality and diversity is the Inception Score  IS   which is based on the distribution of labels predicted by a pretrained Inceptionv  image classification model when applied to a sample of images generated by the text to image model  The score is increased when the image classification model predicts a single label with high probability  a scheme intended to favour  distinct  generated images  Another popular metric is the related Fr chet inception distance  which compares the distribution of generated images and real training images according to features extracted by one of the final layers of a pretrained image classification model
