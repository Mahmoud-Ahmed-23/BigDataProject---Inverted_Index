Code used to identify references in certain astronomical data systems

The bibcode  also known as the refcode  is a compact identifier used by several astronomical data systems to uniquely specify literature references 


Adoption
The Bibliographic Reference Code  refcode  was originally developed to be used in SIMBAD and the NASA IPAC Extragalactic Database  NED   but it became a de facto standard and is now used more widely  for example  by the NASA Astrophysics Data System  which coined and prefers the term  bibcode                        

Format
The code has a fixed length of    characters and has the form

YYYYJJJJJVVVVMPPPPA
where YYYY is the four digit year of the reference and JJJJJ is a code indicating where the reference was published  In the case of a journal reference  VVVV is the volume number  M indicates the section of the journal where the reference was published  e g   L for a letters section   PPPP gives the starting page number  and A is the first letter of the last name of the first author  Periods     are used to fill unused fields and to pad fields out to their fixed length if too short  padding is done on the right for the publication code and on the left for the volume number and page number                        Page numbers greater than      are continued in the M column  The   digit article ID numbers  in lieu of page numbers  used by the Physical Review publications since the late     s are treated as follows  The first two digits of the article ID  corresponding to the issue number  are converted to a lower case letter       a  etc   and inserted into column M  The remaining four digits are used in the page field
