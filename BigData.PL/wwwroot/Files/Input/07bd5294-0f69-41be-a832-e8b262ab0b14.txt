Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that examines the nature  origin  and limits of knowledge  Also called  the theory of knowledge   it explores different types of knowledge  such as propositional knowledge about facts  practical knowledge in the form of skills  and knowledge by acquaintance as a familiarity through experience  Epistemologists study the concepts of belief  truth  and justification to understand the nature of knowledge  To discover how knowledge arises  they investigate sources of justification  such as perception  introspection  memory  reason  and testimony 
The school of skepticism questions the human ability to attain knowledge while fallibilism says that knowledge is never certain  Empiricists hold that all knowledge comes from sense experience  whereas rationalists believe that some knowledge does not depend on it  Coherentists argue that a belief is justified if it coheres with other beliefs  Foundationalists  by contrast  maintain that the justification of basic beliefs does not depend on other beliefs  Internalism and externalism debate whether justification is determined solely by mental states or also by external circumstances 
Separate branches of epistemology focus on knowledge in specific fields  like scientific  mathematical  moral  and religious knowledge  Naturalized epistemology relies on empirical methods and discoveries  whereas formal epistemology uses formal tools from logic  Social epistemology investigates the communal aspect of knowledge  and historical epistemology examines its historical conditions  Epistemology is closely related to psychology  which describes the beliefs people hold  while epistemology studies the norms governing the evaluation of beliefs  It also intersects with fields such as decision theory  education  and anthropology 
Early reflections on the nature  sources  and scope of knowledge are found in ancient Greek  Indian  and Chinese philosophy  The relation between reason and faith was a central topic in the medieval period  The modern era was characterized by the contrasting perspectives of empiricism and rationalism  Epistemologists in the   th century examined the components  structure  and value of knowledge while integrating insights from the natural sciences and linguistics 


Definition edit 
Epistemology is the philosophical study of knowledge and related concepts  such as justification  Also called theory of knowledge      a      it examines the nature and types of knowledge  It further investigates the sources of knowledge  like perception  inference  and testimony  to understand how knowledge is created  Another set of questions concerns the extent and limits of knowledge  addressing what people can and cannot know             Central concepts in epistemology include belief  truth  evidence  and reason             As one of the main branches of philosophy  epistemology stands alongside fields like ethics  logic  and metaphysics             The term can also refer specific positions of philosophers within this branch  as in Plato s epistemology and Immanuel Kant s epistemology            
Epistemology explores how people should acquire beliefs  It determines which beliefs or forms of belief acquisition meet the standards or epistemic goals of knowledge and which ones fail  thereby providing an evaluation of beliefs  The fields of psychology and cognitive sociology are also interested in beliefs and related cognitive processes  but examine them from a different perspective  Unlike epistemology  they study the beliefs people actually have and how people acquire them instead of examining the evaluative norms of these processes             In this regard  epistemology is a normative discipline      b      whereas psychology and cognitive sociology are descriptive disciplines                 c      Epistemology is relevant to many descriptive and normative disciplines  such as the other branches of philosophy and the sciences  by exploring the principles of how they may arrive at knowledge             
The word epistemology comes from the ancient Greek terms           episteme  meaning knowledge or understanding  and        logos  meaning study of or reason   literally  the study of knowledge  Despite its ancient roots  the word itself was only coined in the   th century to designate this field as a distinct branch of philosophy                  d     

Central concepts edit 
Epistemologists examine several foundational concepts to understand their essences and rely on them to formulate theories  Various epistemological disagreements have their roots in disputes about the nature and function of these concepts  like the controversies surrounding the definition of knowledge and the role of justification in it             

Knowledge edit 
Main article  Knowledge
Knowledge is an awareness  familiarity  understanding  or skill  Its various forms all involve a cognitive success through which a person establishes epistemic contact with reality              Epistemologists typically understand knowledge as an aspect of individuals  generally as a cognitive mental state that helps them understand  interpret  and interact with the world  While this core sense is of particular interest to epistemologists  the term also has other meanings  For example  the epistemology of groups examines knowledge as a characteristic of a group of people who share ideas              The term can also refer to information stored in documents and computers             
Knowledge contrasts with ignorance  often simply defined as the absence of knowledge  Knowledge is usually accompanied by ignorance because people rarely have complete knowledge of a field  forcing them to rely on incomplete or uncertain information when making decisions              Even though many forms of ignorance can be mitigated through education and research  certain limits to human understanding result in inevitable ignorance              Some limitations are inherent in the human cognitive faculties themselves  such as the inability to know facts too complex for the human mind to conceive              Others depend on external circumstances when no access to the relevant information exists             
Epistemologists disagree on how much people know  for example  whether fallible beliefs can amount to knowledge or whether absolute certainty is required  The most stringent position is taken by radical skeptics  who argue that there is no knowledge at all             

Types edit 
Bertrand Russell originated the distinction between propositional knowledge and knowledge by acquaintance             
Epistemologists distinguish between different types of knowledge              Their primary interest is in knowledge of facts  called propositional knowledge              It is theoretical knowledge that can be expressed in declarative sentences using a that clause  like  Ravi knows that kangaroos hop   For this reason  it is also called knowledge that                  e      Epistemologists often understand it as a relation between a knower and a known proposition  in the case above between the person Ravi and the proposition  kangaroos hop               It is use independent since it is not tied to one specific purpose  unlike practical knowledge  It is a mental representation that embodies concepts and ideas to reflect reality              Because of its theoretical nature  it is typically held that only creatures with highly developed minds  such as humans  possess propositional knowledge             
Propositional knowledge contrasts with non propositional knowledge in the form of knowledge how and knowledge by acquaintance              Knowledge how is a practical ability or skill  like knowing how to read or how to prepare lasagna              It is usually tied to a specific goal and not mastered in the abstract without concrete practice              To know something by acquaintance means to have an immediate familiarity with or awareness of it  usually as a result of direct experiential contact  Examples are  familiarity with the city of Perth    knowing the taste of tsampa   and  knowing Marta Vieira da Silva personally              

The analytic synthetic distinction has its roots in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant             
Another influential distinction in epistemology is between a posteriori and a priori knowledge                  f      A posteriori knowledge is knowledge of empirical facts based on sensory experience  like  seeing that the sun is shining  and  smelling that a piece of meat has gone bad               This type of knowledge is associated with the empirical science and everyday affairs  A priori knowledge  by contrast  pertains to non empirical facts and does not depend on evidence from sensory experience  like knowing that

  It belongs to fields such as mathematics and logic              The distinction between a posteriori and a priori knowledge is central to the debate between empiricists and rationalists regarding whether all knowledge depends on sensory experience             
A closely related contrast is between analytic and synthetic truths  A sentence is analytically true if its truth depends only on the meanings of the words it uses  For instance  the sentence  all bachelors are unmarried  is analytically true because the word  bachelor  already includes the meaning  unmarried   A sentence is synthetically true if its truth depends on additional facts  For example  the sentence  snow is white  is synthetically true because its truth depends on the color of snow in addition to the meanings of the words snow and white  A priori knowledge is primarily associated with analytic sentences  whereas a posteriori knowledge is primarily associated with synthetic sentences  However  it is controversial whether this is true for all cases  Some philosophers  such as Willard Van Orman Quine  reject the distinction  saying that there are no analytic truths             

Analysis edit 
Main article  Definitions of knowledge
The analysis of knowledge is the attempt to identify the essential components or conditions of all and only propositional knowledge states  According to the so called traditional analysis      g      knowledge has three components  it is a belief that is justified and true              In the second half of the   th century  this view was challenged by a series of thought experiments aiming to show that some justified true beliefs do not amount to knowledge              In one of them  a person is unaware of all the fake barns in their area  By coincidence  they stop in front of the only real barn and form a justified true belief that it is a real barn              Many epistemologists agree that this is not knowledge because the justification is not directly relevant to the truth              More specifically  this and similar counterexamples involve some form of epistemic luck  that is  a cognitive success that results from fortuitous circumstances rather than competence             

The so called traditional analysis says that knowledge is justified true belief  Edmund Gettier tried to show that some justified true beliefs do not amount to knowledge             
Following these thought experiments  philosophers proposed various alternative definitions of knowledge by modifying or expanding the traditional analysis              According to one view  the known fact has to cause the belief in the right way              Another theory states that the belief is the product of a reliable belief formation process              Further approaches require that the person would not have the belief if it was false              that the belief is not inferred from a falsehood              that the justification cannot be undermined              or that the belief is infallible              There is no consensus on which of the proposed modifications and reconceptualizations is correct              Some philosophers  such as Timothy Williamson  reject the basic assumption underlying the analysis of knowledge by arguing that propositional knowledge is a unique state that cannot be dissected into simpler components             

Value edit 
The value of knowledge is the worth it holds by expanding understanding and guiding action  Knowledge can have instrumental value by helping a person achieve their goals              For example  knowledge of a disease helps a doctor cure their patient              The usefulness of a known fact depends on the circumstances  Knowledge of some facts may have little to no uses  like memorizing random phone numbers from an outdated phone book              Being able to assess the value of knowledge matters in choosing what information to acquire and share  It affects decisions like which subjects to teach at school and how to allocate funds to research projects             
Epistemologists are particularly interested in whether knowledge is more valuable than a mere true opinion              Knowledge and true opinion often have a similar usefulness since both accurately represent reality  For example  if a person wants to go to Larissa  a true opinion about the directions can guide them as effectively as knowledge              Considering this problem  Plato proposed that knowledge is better because it is more stable              Another suggestion focuses on practical reasoning  arguing that people put more trust in knowledge than in mere true opinions when drawing conclusions and deciding what to do              A different response says that knowledge has intrinsic value in addition to instrumental value  This view asserts that knowledge is always valuable  whereas true opinion is only valuable in circumstances where it is useful             

Belief and truth edit 
Main articles  Belief and Truth
Beliefs are mental states about what is the case  like believing that snow is white or that God exists              In epistemology  they are often understood as subjective attitudes that affirm or deny a proposition  which can be expressed in a declarative sentence  For instance  to believe that snow is white is to affirm the proposition  snow is white   According to this view  beliefs are representations of what the universe is like  They are stored in memory and retrieved when actively thinking about reality or deciding how to act              A different view understands beliefs as behavioral patterns or dispositions to act rather than as representational items stored in the mind  According to this perspective  to believe that there is mineral water in the fridge is nothing more than a group of dispositions related to mineral water and the fridge  Examples are the dispositions to answer questions about the presence of mineral water affirmatively and to go to the fridge when thirsty              Some theorists deny the existence of beliefs  saying that this concept borrowed from folk psychology oversimplifies much more complex psychological or neurological processes              Beliefs are central to various epistemological debates  which cover their status as a component of propositional knowledge  the question of whether people have control over and responsibility for their beliefs  and the issue of whether beliefs have degrees  called credences             
As propositional attitudes  beliefs are true or false depending on whether they affirm a true or a false proposition              According to the correspondence theory of truth  to be true means to stand in the right relation to the world by accurately describing what it is like  This means that truth is objective  a belief is true if it corresponds to a fact              The coherence theory of truth says that a belief is true if it belongs to a coherent system of beliefs  A result of this view is that truth is relative since it depends on other beliefs              Further theories of truth include pragmatist  semantic  pluralist  and deflationary theories              Truth plays a central role in epistemology as a goal of cognitive processes and an attribute of propositional knowledge             

Justification edit 
Main article  Justification  epistemology 
In epistemology  justification is a property of beliefs that meet certain norms about what a person should believe              According to a common view  this means that the person has sufficient reasons for holding this belief because they have information that supports it              Another view states that a belief is justified if it is formed by a reliable belief formation process  such as perception              The terms reasonable  warranted  and supported are sometimes used as synonyms of the word justified              Justification distinguishes well founded beliefs from superstition and lucky guesses              However  it does not guarantee truth  For example  a person with strong but misleading evidence may form a justified belief that is false             
Epistemologists often identify justification as a key component of knowledge              Usually  they are not only interested in whether a person has a sufficient reason to hold a belief  known as propositional justification  but also in whether the person holds the belief because or based on     h      this reason  known as doxastic justification  For example  if a person has sufficient reason to believe that a neighborhood is dangerous but forms this belief based on superstition then they have propositional justification but lack doxastic justification             

Sources edit 
Sources of justification are ways or cognitive capacities through which people acquire justification  Often discussed sources include perception  introspection  memory  reason  and testimony  but there is no universal agreement to what extent they all provide valid justification              Perception relies on sensory organs to gain empirical information  Distinct forms of perception correspond to different physical stimuli  such as visual  auditory  haptic  olfactory  and gustatory perception              Perception is not merely the reception of sense impressions but an active process that selects  organizes  and interprets sensory signals              Introspection is a closely related process focused on internal mental states rather than external physical objects  For example  seeing a bus at a bus station belongs to perception while feeling tired belongs to introspection             
Rationalists understand reason as a source of justification for non empirical facts  explaining how people can know about mathematical  logical  and conceptual truths  Reason is also responsible for inferential knowledge  in which one or more beliefs serve as premises to support another belief              Memory depends on information provided by other sources  which it retains and recalls  like remembering a phone number perceived earlier              Justification by testimony relies on information one person communicates to another person  This can happen by talking to each other but can also occur in other forms  like a letter  a newspaper  and a blog             

Other concepts edit 
Rationality is closely related to justification and the terms rational belief and justified belief are sometimes used interchangeably  However  rationality has a wider scope that encompasses both a theoretical side  covering beliefs  and a practical side  covering decisions  intentions  and actions              There are different conceptions about what it means for something to be rational  According to one view  a mental state is rational if it is based on or responsive to good reasons  Another view emphasizes the role of coherence  stating that rationality requires that the different mental states of a person are consistent and support each other              A slightly different approach holds that rationality is about achieving certain goals  Two goals of theoretical rationality are accuracy and comprehensiveness  meaning that a person has as few false beliefs and as many true beliefs as possible             
Epistemologists rely on the concept of epistemic norms as criteria to assess the cognitive quality of beliefs  like their justification and rationality  They distinguish between deontic norms  which prescribe what people should believe  and axiological norms  which identify the goals and values of beliefs              Epistemic norms are closely linked to intellectual or epistemic virtues  which are character traits like open mindedness and conscientiousness  Epistemic virtues help individuals form true beliefs and acquire knowledge  They contrast with epistemic vices and act as foundational concepts of virtue epistemology                  i     
Epistemologists understand evidence for a belief as information that favors or supports it  They conceptualize evidence primarily in terms of mental states  such as sensory impressions or other known propositions  But in a wider sense  it can also include physical objects  like bloodstains examined by forensic analysts or financial records studied by investigative journalists              Evidence is often understood in terms of probability  evidence for a belief makes it more likely that the belief is true               A defeater is evidence against a belief or evidence that undermines another piece of evidence  For instance  witness testimony linking a suspect to a crime is evidence of their guilt  while an alibi is a defeater               Evidentialists analyze justification in terms of evidence by asserting that for a belief to be justified  it needs to rest on adequate evidence              
The presence of evidence usually affects doubt and certainty  which are subjective attitudes toward propositions that differ regarding their level of confidence  Doubt involves questioning the validity or truth of a proposition  Certainty  by contrast  is a strong affirmative conviction  indicating an absence of doubt about the proposition s truth  Doubt and certainty are central to ancient Greek skepticism and its goal of establishing that no belief is immune to doubt  They are also crucial in attempts to find a secure foundation of all knowledge  such as Ren  Descartes  foundationalist epistemology              
While propositional knowledge is the main topic in epistemology  some theorists focus on understanding instead  Understanding is a more holistic notion that involves a wider grasp of a subject  To understand something  a person requires awareness of how different things are connected and why they are the way they are  For example  knowledge of isolated facts memorized from a textbook does not amount to understanding  According to one view  understanding is a unique epistemic good that  unlike propositional knowledge  is always intrinsically valuable               Wisdom is similar in this regard and is sometimes considered the highest epistemic good  It encompasses a reflective understanding with practical applications  helping people grasp and evaluate complex situations and lead a good life              
In epistemology  knowledge ascription is the act of attributing knowledge to someone  expressed in sentences like  Sarah knows that it will rain today                According to invariantism  knowledge ascriptions have fixed standards across different contexts  Contextualists  by contrast  argue that knowledge ascriptions are context dependent  From this perspective  Sarah may know about the weather in the context of an everyday conversation even though she is not sufficiently informed to know it in the context of a rigorous meteorological debate               Contrastivism  another view  argues that knowledge ascriptions are comparative  meaning that to know something involves distinguishing it from relevant alternatives  For example  if a person spots a bird in the garden  they may know that it is a sparrow rather than an eagle  but they may not know that it is a sparrow rather than an indistinguishable sparrow hologram              

Major schools of thought edit 
Skepticism and fallibilism edit 
Main articles  Skepticism  Falliblism  and Epistemic relativism
Philosophical skepticism questions the human ability to attain knowledge by challenging the foundations upon which knowledge claims rest  Some skeptics limit their criticism to specific domains of knowledge  For example  religious skeptics say that it is impossible to know about the existence of deities or the truth of other religious doctrines  Similarly  moral skeptics challenge the existence of moral knowledge and metaphysical skeptics say that humans cannot know ultimate reality               External world skepticism questions knowledge of external facts               whereas skepticism about other minds doubts knowledge of the mental states of others              
Global skepticism is the broadest form of skepticism  asserting that there is no knowledge in any domain               In ancient philosophy  this view was embraced by academic skeptics  whereas Pyrrhonian skeptics recommended the suspension of belief to attain tranquility               Few epistemologists have explicitly defended global skepticism  The influence of this position stems from attempts by other philosophers to show that their theory overcomes the challenge of skepticism  For example  Ren  Descartes used methodological doubt to find facts that cannot be doubted              
One consideration in favor of global skepticism is the dream argument  It starts from the observation that  while people are dreaming  they are usually unaware of this  This inability to distinguish between dream and regular experience is used to argue that there is no certain knowledge since a person can never be sure that they are not dreaming                   j      Some critics assert that global skepticism is self refuting because denying the existence of knowledge is itself a knowledge claim  Another objection says that the abstract reasoning leading to skepticism is not convincing enough to overrule common sense              
Fallibilism is another response to skepticism               Fallibilists agree with skeptics that absolute certainty is impossible  They reject the assumption that knowledge requires absolute certainty  leading them to the conclusion that fallible knowledge exists               They emphasize the need to keep an open and inquisitive mind  acknowledging that doubt can never be fully excluded  even for well established knowledge claims like thoroughly tested scientific theories              
Epistemic relativism is related to skepticism but differs in that it does not question the existence of knowledge in general  Instead  epistemic relativists only reject the notion of universal epistemic standards or absolute principles that apply equally to everyone  This means that what a person knows depends on subjective criteria or social conventions used to assess epistemic status              

Empiricism and rationalism edit 
Main articles  Empiricism and Rationalism
John Locke and David Hume shaped the philosophy of empiricism              
The debate between empiricism and rationalism centers on the origins of human knowledge  Empiricism emphasizes that sense experience is the primary source of all knowledge  Some empiricists illustrate this view by describing the mind as a blank slate that only develops ideas about the external world through the sense data received from the sensory organs  According to them  the mind can attain various additional insights by comparing impressions  combining them  generalizing to form more abstract ideas  and deducing new conclusions from them  Empiricists say that all these mental operations depend on sensory material and do not function on their own              
Even though rationalists usually accept sense experience as one source of knowledge      k      they argue that certain forms of knowledge are directly accessed through reason without sense experience               like knowledge of mathematical and logical truths               Some forms of rationalism state that the mind possesses inborn ideas  accessible without sensory assistance  Others assert that there is an additional cognitive faculty  sometimes called rational intuition  through which people acquire nonempirical knowledge               Some rationalists limit their discussion to the origin of concepts  saying that the mind relies on inborn categories to understand the world and organize experience              

Foundationalism and coherentism edit 
Main articles  Foundationalism and Coherentism
Diagram of foundationalism  coherentism  and infinitism with arrows symbolizing support between beliefs  According to foundationalism  some basic beliefs are justified without support from other beliefs  According to coherentism  justification requires that beliefs mutually support each other  According to infinitism  justification requires that beliefs form infinite support chains              
Foundationalists and coherentists disagree about the structure of knowledge                   l      Foundationalism distinguishes between basic and non basic beliefs  A belief is basic if it is justified directly  meaning that its validity does not depend on the support of other beliefs      m      A belief is non basic if it is justified by another belief               For example  the belief that it rained last night is a non basic belief if it is inferred from the observation that the street is wet               According to foundationalism  basic beliefs are the foundation on which all other knowledge is built while non basic beliefs act as the superstructure resting on this foundation              
Coherentists reject the distinction between basic and non basic beliefs  saying that the justification of any belief depends on other beliefs  They assert that a belief must align with other beliefs to amount to knowledge  This occurs when beliefs are consistent and support each other  According to coherentism  justification is a holistic aspect determined by the whole system of beliefs  which resembles an interconnected web              
Foundherentism is an intermediary position combining elements of both foundationalism and coherentism  It accepts the distinction between basic and non basic beliefs while asserting that the justification of non basic beliefs depends on coherence with other beliefs              
Infinitism presents a less common alternative perspective on the structure of knowledge  It agrees with coherentism that there are no basic beliefs while rejecting the view that beliefs can support each other in a circular manner  Instead  it argues that beliefs form infinite justification chains  in which each link of the chain supports the belief following it and is supported by the belief preceding it              

Internalism and externalism edit 
Main article  Internalism and externalism  epistemology 
Alvin Goldman was an influential defender of externalism              
The disagreement between internalism and externalism is about the sources of justification                   n      Internalists say that justification depends only on factors within the individual  such as perceptual experience  memories  and other beliefs  This view emphasizes the importance of the cognitive perspective of the individual in the form of their mental states  It is commonly associated with the idea that the relevant factors are accessible  meaning that the individual can become aware of their reasons for holding a justified belief through introspection and reflection              
Evidentialism is an influential internalist view  asserting that justification depends on the possession of evidence               In this context  evidence for a belief is any information in the individual s mind that supports the belief  For example  the perceptual experience of rain is evidence for the belief that it is raining  Evidentialists suggest various other forms of evidence  including memories  intuitions  and other beliefs               According to evidentialism  a belief is justified if the individual s evidence supports it and they hold the belief on the basis of this evidence              
Externalism  by contrast  asserts that at least some relevant factors of knowledge are external to the individual               For instance  when considering the belief that a cup of coffee stands on the table  externalists are not primarily interested in the subjective perceptual experience that led to this belief  Instead  they focus on objective factors  like the quality of the person s eyesight  their ability to differentiate coffee from other beverages  and the circumstances under which they observed the cup               A key motivation of many forms of externalism is that justification makes it more likely that a belief is true  Based on this view  justification is external to the extent that some factors contributing to this likelihood are not part of the believer s cognitive perspective              
Reliabilism is an externalist theory asserting that a reliable connection between belief and truth is required for justification               Some reliabilists explain this in terms of reliable processes  According to this view  a belief is justified if it is produced by a reliable process  like perception  A belief formation process is deemed reliable if most of the beliefs it generates are true  An alternative view focuses on beliefs rather than belief formation processes  saying that a belief is justified if it is a reliable indicator of the fact it presents  This means that the belief tracks the fact  the person believes it because it is true but would not believe it otherwise              
Virtue epistemology  another type of externalism  asserts that a belief is justified if it manifests intellectual virtues  Intellectual virtues are capacities or traits that perform cognitive functions and help people form true beliefs  Suggested examples include faculties  like vision  memory  and introspection  and character traits  like open mindedness              

Branches and approaches edit 
Some branches of epistemology are characterized by their research methods  Formal epistemology employs formal tools from logic and mathematics to investigate the nature of knowledge                   o      For example  Bayesian epistemology represents beliefs as degrees of certainty and uses probability theory to formally define norms of rationality governing how certain people should be               Experimental epistemologists base their research on empirical evidence about common knowledge practices               Applied epistemology focuses on the practical application of epistemological principles to diverse real world problems  like the reliability of knowledge claims on the internet  how to assess sexual assault allegations  and how racism may lead to epistemic injustice                   p      Metaepistemologists study the nature  goals  and research methods of epistemology  As a metatheory  it does not directly advocate for specific epistemological theories but examines their fundamental concepts and background assumptions                   q     
Particularism and generalism disagree about the right method of conducting epistemological research  Particularists start their inquiry by looking at specific cases  For example  to find a definition of knowledge  they rely on their intuitions about concrete instances of knowledge and particular thought experiments  They use these observations as methodological constraints that any theory of general principles needs to follow  Generalists proceed in the opposite direction  They prioritize general epistemic principles  saying that it is not possible to accurately identify and describe specific cases without a grasp of these principles               Other methods in contemporary epistemology aim to extract philosophical insights from ordinary language or look at the role of knowledge in making assertions and guiding actions              
Phenomenological epistemology emphasizes the importance of first person experience  It distinguishes between the natural and the phenomenological attitudes  The natural attitude focuses on objects belonging to common sense and natural science  The phenomenological attitude focuses on the experience of objects and aims to provide a presuppositionless description of how objects appear to the observer              
Naturalized epistemology is closely associated with the natural sciences  relying on their methods and theories to examine knowledge  Arguing that epistemological theories should rest on empirical observation  it is critical of a priori reasoning               Evolutionary epistemology is a naturalistic approach that understands cognition as a product of evolution  examining knowledge and the cognitive faculties responsible for it through the lens of natural selection               Social epistemology focuses on the social dimension of knowledge  While traditional epistemology is mainly interested in the knowledge possessed by individuals  social epistemology covers knowledge acquisition  transmission  and evaluation within groups  with specific emphasis on how people rely on each other when seeking knowledge              
Pragmatist epistemology is a form of fallibilism that emphasizes the close relation between knowing and acting  It sees the pursuit of knowledge as an ongoing process guided by common sense and experience while always open to revision  This approach reinterprets some core epistemological notions  for example  by conceptualizing beliefs as habits that shape actions rather than representations that mirror the world               Motivated by pragmatic considerations  epistemic conservatism is a view about belief revision  It prioritizes pre existing beliefs  asserting that a person should only change their beliefs if they have a good reason to  One argument for epistemic conservatism rests on the recognition that the cognitive resources of humans are limited  making it impractical to constantly reexamine every belief              

The work of Elizabeth S  Anderson combines the perspectives of feminist  social  and naturalized epistemology              
Postmodern epistemology critiques the conditions of knowledge in advanced societies  This concerns in particular the metanarrative of a constant progress of scientific knowledge leading to a universal and foundational understanding of reality               Similarly  feminist epistemology adopts a critical perspective  focusing on the effect of gender on knowledge  Among other topics  it explores how preconceptions about gender influence who has access to knowledge  how knowledge is produced  and which types of knowledge are valued in society               Some postmodern and feminist thinkers adopt a constructivist approach  arguing that the way people view the world is not a simple reflection of external reality but a social construction  This view emphasizes the creative role of interpretation while undermining objectivity since social constructions can vary across societies               Another critical approach  found in decolonial scholarship  opposes the global influence of Western knowledge systems  It seeks to undermine Western hegemony and decolonize knowledge              
The decolonial outlook is also present in African epistemology  Grounded in African ontology  it emphasizes the interconnectedness of reality as a continuum between knowing subject and known object  It understands knowledge as a holistic phenomenon that includes sensory  emotional  intuitive  and rational aspects  extending beyond the limits of the physical domain              
Another epistemological tradition is found in ancient Indian philosophy  Its diverse schools of thought examine different sources of knowledge  called pram  a  Perception  inference  and testimony are sources discussed by most schools  Other sources only considered by some schools are non perception  which leads to knowledge of absences  and presumption                   r      Buddhist epistemology focuses on immediate experience  understood as the presentation of unique particulars without secondary cognitive processes  like thought and desire               Ny ya epistemology is a causal theory of knowledge  understanding sources of knowledge as reliable processes that cause episodes of truthful awareness  It sees perception as the primary source of knowledge and emphasizes its importance for successful action               M m  s  epistemology considers the holy scriptures known as the Vedas as a key source of knowledge  addressing the problem of their right interpretation               Jain epistemology states that reality is many sided  meaning that no single viewpoint can capture the entirety of truth              
Historical epistemology examines how the understanding of knowledge and related concepts has changed over time  It asks whether the main issues in epistemology are perennial and to what extent past epistemological theories are relevant to contemporary debates  It is particularly concerned with scientific knowledge and practices associated with it               It contrasts with the history of epistemology  which presents  reconstructs  and evaluates epistemological theories of philosophers in the past                   s     

Knowledge in particular domains edit 
Some branches of epistemology focus on knowledge within specific academic disciplines  The epistemology of science examines how scientific knowledge is generated and what problems arise in the process of validating  justifying  and interpreting scientific claims  A key issue concerns the problem of how individual observations can support universal scientific laws  Other topics include the nature of scientific evidence and the aims of science               The epistemology of mathematics studies the origin of mathematical knowledge  In exploring how mathematical theories are justified  it investigates the role of proofs and whether there are empirical sources of mathematical knowledge              
Distinct areas of epistemology are dedicated to specific sources of knowledge  Examples are the epistemology of perception               the epistemology of memory               and the epistemology of testimony               In the epistemology of perception  direct and indirect realists debate the connection between the perceiver and the perceived object  Direct realists say that this connection is direct  meaning that there is no difference between the object present in perceptual experience and the physical object causing this experience  According to indirect realism  the connection is indirect  involving mental entities  like ideas or sense data  that mediate between the perceiver and the external world  The contrast between direct and indirect realism is important for explaining the nature of illusions              
Epistemological issues are found in most areas of philosophy  The epistemology of logic examines how people know that an argument is valid  For example  it explores how logicians justify that modus ponens is a correct rule of inference or that all contradictions are false               Epistemologists of metaphysics investigate whether knowledge of the basic structure of reality is possible and what sources this knowledge could have               Knowledge of moral statements  like the claim that lying is wrong  belongs to the epistemology of ethics  It studies the role of ethical intuitions  coherence among moral beliefs  and the problem of moral disagreement               The ethics of belief is a closely related field exploring the intersection of epistemology and ethics  It examines the norms governing belief formation and asks whether violating them is morally wrong               Religious epistemology studies the role of knowledge and justification for religious doctrines and practices  It evaluates the reliability of evidence from religious experience and holy scriptures while also asking whether the norms of reason should be applied to religious faith              
Epistemologists of language explore the nature of linguistic knowledge  One of their topics is the role of tacit knowledge  for example  when native speakers have mastered the rules of grammar but are unable to explicitly articulate them               Epistemologists of modality examine knowledge about what is possible and necessary               Epistemic problems that arise when two people have diverging opinions on a topic are covered by the epistemology of disagreement               Epistemologists of ignorance are interested in epistemic faults and gaps in knowledge              

Related fields edit 
Epistemology and psychology were not defined as distinct fields until the   th century  earlier investigations about knowledge often do not fit neatly into today s academic categories               Both contemporary disciplines study beliefs and the mental processes responsible for their formation and change  One key contrast is that psychology describes what beliefs people have and how they acquire them  thereby explaining why someone has a specific belief  The focus of epistemology is on evaluating beliefs  leading to a judgment about whether a belief is justified and rational in a particular case               Epistemology also shares a close connection with cognitive science  which understands mental events as processes that transform information               Artificial intelligence relies on the insights of epistemology and cognitive science to implement concrete solutions to problems associated with knowledge representation and automatic reasoning              
Logic is the study of correct reasoning  For epistemology  it is relevant to inferential knowledge  which arises when a person reasons from one known fact to another               This is the case  for example  when inferring that it rained based on the observation that the streets are wet               Whether an inferential belief amounts to knowledge depends on the form of reasoning used  in particular  that the process does not violate the laws of logic               Another overlap between the two fields is found in the epistemic approach to fallacies               Fallacies are faulty arguments based on incorrect reasoning               The epistemic approach to fallacies explains why they are faulty  stating that arguments aim to expand knowledge  According to this view  an argument is a fallacy if it fails to do so               A further intersection is found in epistemic logic  which uses formal logical devices to study epistemological concepts like knowledge and belief              
Both decision theory and epistemology are interested in the foundations of rational thought and the role of beliefs  Unlike many approaches in epistemology  the main focus of decision theory lies less in the theoretical and more in the practical side  exploring how beliefs are translated into action               Decision theorists examine the reasoning involved in decision making and the standards of good decisions               identifying beliefs as a central aspect of decision making  One of their innovations is to distinguish between weaker and stronger beliefs  which helps them consider the effects of uncertainty on decisions              
Epistemology and education have a shared interest in knowledge  with one difference being that education focuses on the transmission of knowledge  exploring the roles of both learner and teacher               Learning theory examines how people acquire knowledge               Behavioral learning theories explain the process in terms of behavior changes  for example  by associating a certain response with a particular stimulus               Cognitive learning theories study how the cognitive processes that affect knowledge acquisition transform information               Pedagogy looks at the transmission of knowledge from the teacher s perspective  exploring the teaching methods they may employ               In teacher centered methods  the teacher serves as the main authority delivering knowledge and guiding the learning process  In student centered methods  the teacher primarily supports and facilitates the learning process  allowing students to take a more active role               The beliefs students have about knowledge  called personal epistemology  influence their intellectual development and learning success              
The anthropology of knowledge examines how knowledge is acquired  stored  retrieved  and communicated  It studies the social and cultural circumstances that affect how knowledge is reproduced and changes  covering the role of institutions like university departments and scientific journals as well as face to face discussions and online communications  This field has a broad concept of knowledge  encompassing various forms of understanding and culture  including practical skills  Unlike epistemology  it is not interested in whether a belief is true or justified but in how understanding is reproduced in society               A closely related field  the sociology of knowledge has a similar conception of knowledge  It explores how physical  demographic  economic  and sociocultural factors impact knowledge  This field examines in what sociohistorical contexts knowledge emerges and the effects it has on people  for example  how socioeconomic conditions are related to the dominant ideology in a society              

History edit 

Early reflections on the nature and sources of knowledge are found in ancient history  In ancient Greek philosophy  Plato          BCE  studied what knowledge is  examining how it differs from true opinion by being based on good reasons               He proposed that learning is a form of recollection in which the soul remembers what it already knew but had forgotten                   t      Plato s student Aristotle          BCE  was particularly interested in scientific knowledge  exploring the role of sensory experience and the process of making inferences from general principles               Aristotle s ideas influenced the Hellenistic schools of philosophy  which began to arise in the  th century BCE and included Epicureanism  Stoicism  and skepticism  The Epicureans had an empiricist outlook  stating that sensations are always accurate and act as the supreme standard of judgments               The Stoics defended a similar position but confined their trust to lucid and specific sensations  which they regarded as true               The skeptics questioned that knowledge is possible  recommending instead suspension of judgment to attain a state of tranquility               Emerging in the  rd century CE and inspired by Plato s philosophy               Neoplatonism distinguished knowledge from true belief  arguing that knowledge is infallible and limited to the realm of immaterial forms              

The Buddhist philosopher Dharmakirti developed a causal theory of knowledge              
The Upanishads  philosophical scriptures composed in ancient India between     and     BCE  examined how people acquire knowledge  including the role of introspection  comparison  and deduction               In the  th century BCE  the school of Aj ana developed a radical skepticism questioning the possibility and usefulness of knowledge               By contrast  the school of Nyaya  which emerged in the  nd century BCE  asserted that knowledge is possible  It provided a systematic treatment of how people acquire knowledge  distinguishing between valid and invalid sources               When Buddhist philosophers became interested in epistemology  they relied on concepts developed in Nyaya and other traditions               Buddhist philosopher Dharmakirti   th or  th century CE               analyzed the process of knowing as a series of causally related events              
Ancient Chinese philosophers understood knowledge as an interconnected phenomenon fundamentally linked to ethical behavior and social involvement  Many saw wisdom as the goal of attaining knowledge               Mozi          BCE  proposed a pragmatic approach to knowledge using historical records  sensory evidence  and practical outcomes to validate beliefs               Mencius  c                BCE  explored analogical reasoning as a source of knowledge and employed this method to criticize Mozi               Xunzi  c                BCE  aimed to combine empirical observation and rational inquiry  He emphasized the importance of clarity and standards of reasoning without excluding the role of feeling and emotion              
The relation between reason and faith was a central topic in the medieval period               In Arabic Persian philosophy  al Farabi  c                 and Averroes             discussed how philosophy and theology interact  debating which one is a better vehicle to truth               Al Ghazali  c                   criticized many core teachings of previous Islamic philosophers  saying that they relied on unproven assumptions that did not amount to knowledge               Similarly in Western philosophy  Anselm of Canterbury             proposed that theological teaching and philosophical inquiry are in harmony and complement each other               Formulating a more critical approach  Peter Abelard             argued against unquestioned theological authorities and said that all things are open to rational doubt               Influenced by Aristotle  Thomas Aquinas             developed an empiricist theory  stating that  nothing is in the intellect unless it first appeared in the senses                According to an early form of direct realism proposed by William of Ockham  c                    perception of mind independent objects happens directly without intermediaries               Meanwhile  in   th century India  Ga ge a developed a reliabilist theory of knowledge and considered the problems of testimony and fallacies               In China  Wang Yangming             explored the unity of knowledge and action  holding that moral knowledge is inborn and can be attained by overcoming self interest              

Ren  Descartes used methodological doubt to seek certain foundations for philosophy              
The course of modern philosophy was shaped by Ren  Descartes              who stated that philosophy must begin from a position of indubitable knowledge of first principles  Inspired by skepticism  he aimed to find absolutely certain knowledge by encountering truths that cannot be doubted  He thought that this is the case for the assertion  I think  therefore I am   from which he constructed the rest of his philosophical system               Descartes  together with Baruch Spinoza             and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz              belonged to the school of rationalism  which asserts that the mind possesses innate ideas independent of experience               John Locke             rejected this view in favor of an empiricism according to which the mind is a blank slate  This means that all ideas depend on experience  either as  ideas of sense   which are directly presented through the senses  or as  ideas of reflection   which the mind creates by reflecting on its own activities               David Hume             used this idea to explore the limits of what people can know  He said that knowledge of facts is never certain  adding that knowledge of relations between ideas  like mathematical truths  can be certain but contains no information about the world               Immanuel Kant             sought a middle ground between rationalism and empiricism by identifying a type of knowledge overlooked by Hume  For Kant  this knowledge pertains to principles that underlie and structure all experience  such as spatial and temporal relations and fundamental categories of understanding              
In the   th century and influenced by Kant s philosophy  Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel             rejected empiricism by arguing that sensory impressions alone cannot amount to knowledge since all knowledge is actively structured by the knowing subject               John Stuart Mill              by contrast  defended a wide sweeping form of empiricism and explained knowledge of general truths through inductive reasoning               Charles Peirce             thought that all knowledge is fallible  emphasizing that knowledge seekers should remain open to revising their beliefs in light of new evidence  He used this idea to argue against Cartesian foundationalism  which seeks absolutely certain truths              
In the   th century  fallibilism was further explored by J  L  Austin             and Karl Popper                           In continental philosophy  Edmund Husserl             applied the skeptical idea of suspending judgment to the study of experience  By not judging whether an experience is accurate  he tried to describe its internal structure instead               Influenced by earlier empiricists  logical positivists  like A  J  Ayer              said that all knowledge is either empirical or analytic  rejecting any form of metaphysical knowledge               Bertrand Russell             developed an empiricist sense datum theory  distinguishing between direct knowledge by acquaintance of sense data and indirect knowledge by description  which is inferred from knowledge by acquaintance               Common sense had a central place in G  E  Moore s             epistemology  He used trivial observations  like the fact that he has two hands  to argue against abstract philosophical theories that deviate from common sense               Ordinary language philosophy  as practiced by the late Ludwig Wittgenstein              is a similar approach that tries to extract epistemological insights from how ordinary language is used              
Edmund Gettier             conceived counterexamples against the idea that knowledge is justified true belief  These counterexamples prompted many philosophers to suggest alternative definitions of knowledge               Developed by philosophers such as Alvin Goldman              reliabilism emerged as one of the alternatives  asserting that knowledge requires reliable sources and shifting the focus away from justification               Virtue epistemologists  such as Ernest Sosa       present  and Linda Zagzebski       present   analyse belief formation in terms of the intellectual virtues or cognitive competencies involved in the process               Naturalized epistemology  as conceived by Willard Van Orman Quine              employs concepts and ideas from the natural sciences to formulate its theories               Other developments in late   th century epistemology were the emergence of social  feminist  and historical epistemology

  Less commonly  the term  gnoseology  is also used as a synonym            

  Normative disciplines study how things ought to be  focusing on norms of right and wrong or criteria of evaluation  They contrast with descriptive disciplines  which examine individual facts and general patterns of how things actually are            

  Despite this contrast  epistemologists may rely on insights from the empirical sciences in formulating their normative theories             According to one interpretation  the aim of naturalized epistemology is to answer descriptive questions  but this characterization is disputed             

  As a label for a branch of philosophy  the term  epistemology  was first employed in      by James E  Ferrier              In a different context  the word was used as early as      in New York s Eclectic Magazine              As the term had not been coined before the   th century  earlier philosophers did not explicitly label their theories as epistemology and often explored it in combination with psychology              According to philosopher Thomas Sturm  it is an open question how relevant the epistemological problems addressed by past philosophers are to contemporary philosophy             

  Other synonyms include declarative knowledge and descriptive knowledge             

  The distinction came to prominence in the   th century and acted as a crucial factor in the philosophies of David Hume and Immanuel Kant             

  The accuracy of the label traditional analysis is debated since it suggests widespread acceptance within the history of philosophy  an idea not shared by all scholars             

  The relation between a belief and the reason on which it rests is called basing relation             

  Interest in epistemic virtues has increased since Ernest Sosa s formulation of virtue epistemology in the     s             

  The brain in a vat is a similar thought experiment assuming that a person does not have a body but is merely a brain receiving electrical stimuli indistinguishable from the stimuli a brain in a body would receive  This argument also leads to the conclusion of global skepticism based on the claim that it is not possible to distinguish stimuli representing the actual world from simulated stimuli              

  Some forms of extreme rationalism  found in ancient Greek philosophy  see reason as the sole source of knowledge              

  Both can be understood as responses to the regress problem               In ancient philosophy  the underlying problem was discussed as Agrippa s trilemma  The trilemma distinguises three ways of providing reasons for a statement  finding a justification that needs no further reason  circular reasoning by repeating a justification stated earlier  or providing an infinite justification chain              

  The theory of classical foundationalism has a stronger requirement by saying that basic beliefs are self evident or indubitable              

  The internalist externalist debate in epistemology is different from the internalism externalism debate in philosophy of mind  which asks whether mental states depend only on the individual or also on their environment              

  It is closely related to computational epistemology  which examines the interrelation between knowledge and computational processes              

  Epistemic injustice happens  for example  when valid knowledge claims are dismissed or misrepresented              

  Nonetheless  metaepistemological insights can have various indirect effects on disputes in epistemology              

  While the discussion of different sources of knowledge is also found in other traditions  Indian epistemologists typically put special emphasis on the relation between knowledge and spiritual progress  understanding the acquisition of knowledge as part of the soteriological process              

  The precise characterization of the contrast is disputed              

  To argue for this point  Plato used the example of a slave boy  who manages to answer a series of geometry questions even though he never studied geometry
