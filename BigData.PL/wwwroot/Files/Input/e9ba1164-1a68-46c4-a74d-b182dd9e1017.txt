Cybercrime encompasses a wide range of criminal activities that are carried out using digital devices and or networks  It has been variously defined as  a crime committed on a computer network  especially the Internet    an array of criminal activity including offences against computer data and systems  computer related offences  content offenses and copyright offenses   and  criminal or harmful activities that are informational  global and networked and are to be distinguished from crimes that simply use computers              Cybercriminals may exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks to gain unauthorized access  steal sensitive information  disrupt services  and cause financial or reputational harm to individuals  organizations  and governments            
In       the tenth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders classified cyber crimes into five categories  unauthorized access  damage to computer data or programs  sabotage to hinder the functioning of a computer system or network  unauthorized interception of data within a system or network  and computer espionage            
Internationally  both state and non state actors engage in cybercrimes  including espionage  financial theft  and other cross border crimes  Cybercrimes crossing international borders and involving the actions of at least one nation state are sometimes referred to as cyberwarfare  Warren Buffett has stated that cybercrime is the  number one problem with mankind              and that it  poses real risks to humanity             
The World Economic Forum s  WEF       Global Risks Report highlighted that organized cybercrime groups are joining forces to commit criminal activities online  while estimating the likelihood of their detection and prosecution to be less than   percent in the US             There are also many privacy concerns surrounding cybercrime when confidential information is intercepted or disclosed  legally or otherwise 
The World Economic Forum s      Global Risks Report ranked cybercrime as one of the top    risks facing the world today and for the next    years             If viewed as a nation state  cybercrime would count as the third largest economy in the world             In numbers  cybercrime is predicted to cause over   trillion US dollars in damages worldwide in                        


Classification edit 
Computer crime encompasses a broad range of activities  including computer fraud  financial crimes  scams  cybersex trafficking  and ad fraud                       
A proposed taxonomy classifies cybercrime into two top level groups  pure technology cybercrime and cyber advanced crime  Pure technology cybercrime  targets or victimizes the computer technology ecosystem  to  disrupt the confidentiality  integrity  or availability of a computer technology ecosystem   while cyber advanced crime  uses computer technology to target or victimize natural persons  governments  business entities  or property  in order to  deprive  disrupt or damage entities or assets              

Computer fraud edit 
Main article  Computer fraud
Computer fraud is the act of using a computer to take or alter electronic data  or to gain unlawful access to a computer or system                  failed verification      Computer fraud that involves the use of the Internet is also called internet fraud  The legal definition of computer fraud varies by jurisdiction  but typically involves accessing a computer without permission or authorization 
Forms of computer fraud include hacking into computers to alter information  distributing malicious code such as computer worms or viruses  installing malware or spyware to steal data  phishing  and advance fee scams             
Other forms of fraud may be committed using computer systems  including bank fraud  carding  identity theft  extortion  and theft of classified information  These types of crimes often result in the loss of personal or financial information 

Digital arrest edit 
 
Digital arrest is a form of online fraud where perpetrators impersonate law enforcement officials to deceive victims  This scam typically involves contacting individuals via phone  falsely claiming they are implicated in criminal activity related to a parcel containing illegal goods  drugs  counterfeit documents  or other contraband  In some variations  scammers target the victim s relatives or friends  falsely stating the victim is in custody due to criminal involvement or an accident  Victims are then coerced into remaining on camera and isolating themselves  while the fraudsters extract personal and financial information under the guise of an official investigation  ultimately transferring the victim s assets to money mule accounts              
To detect and prevent the fraud  be wary of unsolicited calls from supposed law enforcement demanding immediate payment or personal information  Legitimate law enforcement agencies rarely conduct investigations in this manner  Verify the identity of the caller independently by contacting the relevant agency directly through official channels  Remember  the government agencies never put anyone under digital arrest  it s not permissible

Government officials and information technology  IT  security specialists have documented a significant increase in network problems and server scams since early       In the United States there is an increasing concern from agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI  and the Central Intelligence Agency  CIA              

Cyberextortion edit 
Cyberextortion occurs when a website  e mail server  or computer system is subjected to or threatened with attacks by malicious hackers  often through denial of service attacks  Cyber extortionists  demand money in return for promising to stop the attacks and provide  protection   According to the FBI  cyber extortionists are increasingly attacking corporate websites and networks  crippling their ability to operate  and demanding payments to restore their service  More than    cases are reported each month to the FBI  and many go unreported in order to keep the victim s name out of the public domain  Perpetrators often use a distributed denial of service attack              However  other cyberextortion techniques exist  such as doxing and bug poaching  An example of cyberextortion was the Sony Hack of                  

Ransomware edit 
Main article  Ransomware
Ransomware is a type of malware used in cyberextortion to restrict access to files  sometimes threatening permanent data erasure unless a ransom is paid  Ransomware is a global issue      countries were affected by this type of attack in                  The number of attacks is constantly growing  with       attacks in                    And this is the number of large and successful attacks with serious consequences  the total number of attacks and attempted attacks  including in automatic mode in      amounted to more than     million attacks worldwide              Nearly a third of the major attacks         in      targeted industrial enterprises  up     by        affecting critical infrastructure and services  causing severe losses              In some cases  attacks on medical facilities also resulted in human casualties  Between      and      ransomware caused the deaths of between    and    patients Medicare due to the treatment difficulties created              in      an attack on UK pathology provider Synnovis resulted in thousands of surgeries and appointments being canceled              Ransom amounts in attacks are also continuously and significantly increasing  According to the      Unit    Ransomware Threat Report  in       the average ransom demand in Norton cases was      million  up        and the number of victims whose personal data ended up in the dark web s information dumps increased by                  Losses in      and      are nearly      million              In       the average ransom amount is      million  with the two largest ransoms demanded from healthcare organizations        million from India s Regional Cancer Center  RCC  and     million from Synnovis             

Cybersex trafficking edit

There are an estimated     million victims of cybersex trafficking  according to a recent report by the International Labour Organization              This number includes about     million child victims  An example of cybersex trafficking is the           Nth room case in South Korea             

Cyberwarfare edit 
Main article  Cyberwarfare
According to the U S  Department of Defense  cyberspace has emerged as an arena for national security threats through several recent events of geostrategic importance  including the attack on Estonia s infrastructure in       allegedly by Russian hackers  In August       Russia again allegedly conducted cyberattacks against Georgia  Fearing that such attacks may become a normal part of future warfare among nation states  military commanders see a need to develop cyberspace operations             

Computers as a tool edit 
Main articles  Internet fraud  Spamming  Phishing  and Carding  fraud 
When an individual is the target of cybercrime  the computer is often the tool rather than the target  These crimes  which typically exploit human weaknesses  usually do not require much technical expertise  These are the types of crimes which have existed for centuries in the offline world  Criminals have simply been given a tool that increases their pool of potential victims and makes them all the harder to trace and apprehend             
Crimes that use computer networks or devices to advance other ends include 

Fraud and identity theft  although this increasingly uses malware  hacking or phishing  making it an example of  computer as target  as well as  computer as tool  
Information warfare
Phishing scams
Spam
Propagation of illegal  obscene  or offensive content  including harassment and threats
The unsolicited sending of bulk email for commercial purposes  spam  is unlawful in some jurisdictions 
Phishing is mostly propagated via email  Phishing emails may contain links to other websites that are affected by malware              Or they may contain links to fake online banking or other websites used to steal private account information 

Obscene or offensive content edit 
The content of websites and other electronic communications may be distasteful  obscene  or offensive for a variety of reasons  In some instances  it may be illegal  What content is unlawful varies greatly between countries  and even within nations  It is a sensitive area in which the courts can become involved in arbitrating between groups with strong beliefs 
One area of internet pornography that has been the target of the strongest efforts at curtailment is child pornography  which is illegal in most jurisdictions in the world      citation needed     

Ad fraud edit 
See also  Ad fraud and Click fraud
Ad frauds are particularly popular among cybercriminals  as such frauds are lucrative and unlikely to be prosecuted              Jean Loup Richet  a professor at the Sorbonne Business School  classified the large variety of ad frauds committed by cybercriminals into three categories  identity fraud  attribution fraud  and ad fraud services            
Identity fraud aims to impersonate real users and inflate audience numbers  The techniques used for identity fraud include traffic from bots  coming from a hosting company  a data center  or compromised devices   cookie stuffing  falsification of user characteristics  such as location and browser type  fake social traffic  misleading users on social networks into visiting the advertised website   and fake social media accounts that make a bot appear legitimate 
Attribution fraud impersonates the activities of real users  such as clicks and conversations  Many ad fraud techniques belong to this category  the use of hijacked and malware infected devices as part of a botnet  click farms  companies where low wage employees are paid to click or engage in conversations   incentivized browsing  video placement abuse  delivered in display banner slots   hidden ads  which will never be viewed by real users   domain spoofing  ads served on a fake website   and clickjacking  in which the user is forced to click on an ad 
Ad fraud services include all online infrastructure and hosting services that might be needed to undertake identity or attribution fraud  Services can involve the creation of spam websites  fake networks of websites that provide artificial backlinks   link building services  hosting services  or fake and scam pages impersonating a famous brand 

Online harassment edit

Whereas content may be offensive in a non specific way  harassment directs obscenities and derogatory comments at specific individuals  often focusing on gender  race  religion  nationality  or sexual orientation 
Committing a crime using a computer can lead to an enhanced sentence  For example  in the case of United States v  Neil Scott Kramer  the defendant was given an enhanced sentence according to the U S  Sentencing Guidelines Manual   G    b     for his use of a cell phone to  persuade  induce  entice  coerce  or facilitate the travel of  the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct   Kramer appealed the sentence on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to convict him under this statute because his charge included persuading through a computer device and his cellular phone technically is not a computer  Although Kramer tried to argue this point  the U S  Sentencing Guidelines Manual states that the term  computer  means  an electronic  magnetic  optical  electrochemical  or other high speed data processing device performing logical  arithmetic  or storage functions  and includes any data storage facility or communications facility directly related to or operating in conjunction with such device  
In the United States  at least    states have passed laws and regulations that regard extreme online harassment as a criminal act  These acts can also be prosecuted on the federal level  because of US Code    Section     A  which states that using computers to threaten or harass can lead to a sentence of up to    years             
Several countries besides the US have also created laws to combat online harassment  In China  a country with over    percent of the world s internet users  in response to the Human Flesh Search Engine bullying incident  the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council passed a strict law against cyberbullying                          The United Kingdom passed the Malicious Communications Act  which states that sending messages or letters electronically that the government deems  indecent or grossly offensive  and or language intended to cause  distress and anxiety  can lead to a prison sentence of six months and a potentially large fine                                Australia  while not directly addressing the issue of harassment  includes most forms of online harassment under the Criminal Code Act of       Using telecommunication to send threats  harass  or cause offense is a direct violation of this act             
Although freedom of speech is protected by law in most democratic societies  it does not include all types of speech  Spoken or written threats can be criminalized because they harm or intimidate  This applies to online or network related threats 
Cyberbullying has increased drastically with the growing popularity of online social networking  As of January          percent of adult internet users in the United States had  personally experienced online harassment               Online harassment of children often has negative and even life threatening effects  According to a      survey     percent of children develop social anxiety     percent develop depression  and    percent have suicidal thoughts             
The United Arab Emirates was found to have purchased the NSO Group s mobile spyware Pegasus for mass surveillance and a campaign of harassment of prominent activists and journalists  including Ahmed Mansoor  Princess Latifa  Princess Haya  and others  Ghada Owais was one of the many high profile female journalists and activists who were targeted  She filed a lawsuit against UAE ruler Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan along with other defendants  accusing them of sharing her photos online             

Drug trafficking edit 
Darknet markets are used to buy and sell recreational drugs online  Some drug traffickers use encrypted messaging tools to communicate with drug mules or potential customers  The dark web site Silk Road  which started operations in       was the first major online marketplace for drugs  It was permanently shut down in October      by the FBI and Europol  After Silk Road     went down  Silk Road   Reloaded emerged  However  it was just an older marketplace named Diabolus Market that used the Silk Road name in order to get more exposure from the Silk Road brand s earlier success             
Darknet markets have had a rise in traffic in recent years for many reasons  such as the anonymous purchases and often a system of reviews by other buyers              There are many ways in which darknet markets can financially drain individuals  Vendors and customers alike go to great lengths to keep their identities a secret while online  Commonly used tools for hiding their online presence include virtual private networks  VPNs   Tails  and the Tor Browser  Darknet markets entice customers by making them feel comfortable  Although people can easily gain access to a Tor browser  actually gaining access to an illicit market is not as simple as typing it in on a search engine  as one would with Google  Darknet markets have special links that change frequently  ending in  onion as opposed to the typical  com   net  and  org domain extensions  To add to privacy  the most prevalent currency on these markets is Bitcoin  which allows transactions to be anonymous             
A problem that marketplace users sometimes face is exit scamming              That is  a vendor with a high rating acts as if they are selling on the market and have users pay for products they never receive              The vendor then closes their account after receiving money from multiple buyers and never sending what was paid for  The vendors  all of whom are involved in illegal activities  have no reason not to engage in exit scamming when they no longer want to be a vendor  In       an entire market known as Wall Street Market allegedly exit scammed  stealing     million dollars in bitcoin             
The FBI has cracked down on these markets  In July       the FBI seized one of the biggest markets  commonly called Alphabay  which re opened in August      under the control of DeSnake  one of the original administrators                          Investigators pose as buyers and order products from darknet vendors in the hope that the vendors leave a trail the investigators can follow  In one case an investigator posed as a firearms seller  and for six months people purchased from them and provided home addresses              The FBI was able to make over a dozen arrests during this six month investigation              Another crackdown targeted vendors selling fentanyl and opiates  With thousands of people dying each year due to drug overdose  investigators have made internet drug sales a priority              Many vendors do not realize the extra criminal charges that go along with selling drugs online  such as money laundering and illegal use of the mail              In       a vendor was sentenced to    years in prison after selling cocaine and methamphetamine under the name JetSetLife              But despite the large amount of time investigators spend tracking down people  in      only    suspects who bought and sold illegal goods on some of the biggest markets were identified              Meanwhile  thousands of transactions take place daily on these markets

Combating computer crime edit 
Due to cybercriminals using the internet for cross border attacks and crimes  the process of prosecuting cybercriminals has been difficult  The number of vulnerabilities that a cybercriminal could use as points of opportunity to exploit has also increased over the years  From      to      alone  there has been a        increase in vulnerabilities across all online devices              The internet s expansive reach causes the damage inflicted to people to be magnified since many methods of cybercrime have the opportunity to reach many people  The availability of virtual spaces             has allowed cybercrime to become an everyday occurrence              In       the Internet Crime Complaint Center received         complaints of cybercrime  which led to      billion lost             

Investigation edit 
In a criminal investigation  a computer can be a source of evidence  see digital forensics   Even when a computer is not directly used for criminal purposes  it may contain records of value to criminal investigators in the form of a logfile  In many countries              Internet Service Providers are required by law to keep their logfiles for a predetermined amount of time 
There are many ways for cybercrime to take place  and investigations tend to start with an IP Address trace  however  that does not necessarily enable detectives to solve a case  Different types of high tech crime may also include elements of low tech crime  and vice versa  making cybercrime investigators an indispensable part of modern law enforcement  Methods of cybercrime detective work are dynamic and constantly improving  whether in closed police units or in the framework of international cooperation             

Senator Tommy Tuberville touring the National Computer Forensic Institute in Hoover  Alabama  in     
In the United States  the FBI             and the Department of Homeland Security  DHS              are government agencies that combat cybercrime  The FBI has trained agents and analysts in cybercrime placed in their field offices and headquarters              In the DHS  the Secret Service has a Cyber Intelligence Section that works to target financial cybercrimes  They combat international cybercrime and work to protect institutions such as banks from intrusions and information breaches  Based in Alabama  the Secret Service and the Alabama Office of Prosecution Services work together to train professionals in law enforcement at the National Computer Forensic Institute                                      The NCFI provides  state and local members of the law enforcement community with training in cyber incident response  investigation  and forensic examination in cyber incident response  investigation  and forensic examination              
Investigating cyber crime within the United States and globally often requires partnerships  Within the United States  cyber crime may be investigated by law enforcement  the Department of Homeland Security  among other federal agencies  However  as the world becomes more dependent on technology  cyber attacks and cyber crime are going to expand as threat actors will continue to exploit weaknesses in protection and existing vulnerabilities to achieve their end goals  often being data theft or exfiltration  To combat cybercrime  the United States Secret Service maintains an Electronic Crimes Task Force which extends beyond the United States as it helps to locate threat actors that are located globally and performing cyber related crimes within the United States  The Secret Service is also responsible for the National Computer Forensic Institute which allows law enforcement and people of the court to receive cyber training and information on how to combat cyber crime  The United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement is responsible for the Cyber Crimes Center  C   providing cyber crime related services for federal  state  local and international agencies  Finally  the United States also has resources relating to Law Enforcement Cyber Incident Reporting to allow local and state agencies to understand how  when  and what should be reported as a cyber incident to the federal government             
Because cybercriminals commonly use encryption and other techniques to hide their identity and location  it can be difficult to trace a perpetrator after a crime is committed  so prevention measures are crucial                         

Prevention edit 
The Department of Homeland Security also instituted the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation  CDM  Program              The CDM Program monitors and secures government networks by tracking network risks and informing system personnel so that they can take action  In an attempt to catch intrusions before the damage is done  the DHS created the Enhanced Cybersecurity Services  ECS               The Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency approves the private partners that provide intrusion detection and prevention services through the ECS                          
Cybersecurity professionals have been skeptical of prevention focused strategies               The mode of use of cybersecurity products has also been called into question  Shuman Ghosemajumder has argued that individual companies using a combination of products for security is not a scalable approach and has advocated for the use of cybersecurity technology primarily at the platform level               Law enforcement agencies often struggle with applying traditional policing methods to digital crimes  which evolve faster than investigative practices              
On a personal level  there are some strategies available to defend against cybercrime              

Keeping your software and operating system update to benefit from security patches
Using anti virus software that can detect and remove malicious threats
Use strong passwords with a variety of characters that aren t easy to guess
Refrain from opening attachments from spam emails
Do not click on links from scam emails
Do not give out personal information over the internet unless you can verify that the destination is safe
Contact companies about suspicious requests of your information
Legislation edit 
Because of weak laws  cybercriminals operating from developing countries can often evade detection and prosecution  In countries such as the Philippines  laws against cybercrime are weak or sometimes nonexistent  Cybercriminals can then strike from across international borders and remain undetected  Even when identified  these criminals can typically avoid being extradited to a country such as the US that has laws that allow for prosecution  For this reason  agencies such as the FBI have used deception and subterfuge to catch criminals  For example  two Russian hackers had been evading the FBI for some time  The FBI set up a fake computing company based in Seattle  Washington  They proceeded to lure the two Russian men into the United States by offering them work with this company  Upon completion of the interview  the suspects were arrested  Clever tricks like that are sometimes a necessary part of catching cybercriminals when weak laws and limited international cooperation make it impossible otherwise              
The first cyber related law in the United States was the Privacy Act of      which was only required for federal agencies to follow to ensure privacy and protection of personally identifiable information  PII   However  since       in the United States other laws and regulations have been drafted and implemented  but there is still a gap in responding to current cyber related crime  The most recent cyber related law  according to NIST  was the NIST Small Business Cybersecurity Act  which came out in       and provides guidelines to small businesses to ensure that cybersecurity risks are being identified and addressed accurately              
During President Barack Obama s presidency three cybersecurity related bills were signed into order in December       The first was the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of       the second was the National Cybersecurity Protection Act of       and the third was the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of       Although the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of      was just an update of an older version of the act  it focused on the practices federal agencies were to abide by relating to cybersecurity  While the National Cybersecurity Protection Act of      was aimed toward increasing the amount of information sharing that occurs across the federal and private sector to improve cybersecurity amongst the industries  Finally  the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of      relates to cybersecurity research and education              
In April       then President Barack Obama released an executive order that allows the US to freeze the assets of convicted cybercriminals and block their economic activity within the United States              
The European Union adopted cybercrime directive         EU  which was elaborated upon in the Council of Europe s Convention on Cybercrime              
It is not only the US and the European Union that have been introducing measures against cybercrime  On    May       China announced that its new cybersecurity law was taking effect              
In Australia  legislation to combat cybercrime includes the Criminal Code Act       the Telecommunications Act       and the Enhancing Online Safety Act      

Penalties edit 
Penalties for computer related crimes in New York State can range from a fine and a short period of jail time for a Class A misdemeanor  such as unauthorized use of a computer  up to   to    years in prison for a Class C felony  such as computer tampering in the first degree              
However  some former cybercriminals have been hired as information security experts by private companies due to their inside knowledge of computer crime  a phenomenon which theoretically could create perverse incentives  A possible counter to this is for courts to ban convicted hackers from using the internet or computers  even after they have been released from prison                  though as computers and the internet become more and more central to everyday life  this type of punishment becomes more and more draconian  Nuanced approaches have been developed that manage cyber offenders  behavior without resorting to total computer or internet bans               These approaches involve restricting individuals to specific devices which are subject to monitoring or searches by probation or parole officers               A      GAO report noted that the United States lacks coordination and sufficient resources to effectively counter growing cybercrime threats              

Awareness edit 
Cybercrime is becoming more of a threat in our society  According to Accenture s State of Cybersecurity  security attacks increased     from      to       The number of attacks per company increased from     to      Due to this rising threat  the importance of raising awareness about measures to protect information and the tactics criminals use to steal that information is paramount  However  despite cybercrime becoming a mounting problem  many people are not aware of the severity of this problem  This could be attributed to a lack of experience and knowledge of technological issues  There are     million cyber attacks annually  which means that there are over       attacks a day      attacks every hour  or nearly three attacks every minute  with studies showing that only    percent of victims had asked the people who were carrying out the attacks to stop               Comparitech s      study shows that cybercrime victims have peaked to    million annually  which means there is a cyberattack every    seconds               Anybody who uses the internet for any reason can be a victim  which is why it is important to be aware of how to be protected while online 

Intelligence edit 
As cybercrime proliferated  a professional ecosystem evolved to support individuals and groups seeking to profit from cybercrime activities  The ecosystem has become quite specialized  and includes malware developers  botnet operators  professional cybercrime groups  groups specializing in the sale of stolen content  and so forth  A few of the leading cybersecurity companies have the skills and resources to follow the activities of these individuals and groups               A wide variety of information that can be used for defensive purposes is available from these sources  for example  technical indicators such as hashes of infected files              and malicious IPs URLs               as well as strategic information profiling the goals and techniques of the profiled groups  Much of it is freely available  but consistent  ongoing access typically requires a subscription  Some in the corporate sector see a crucial role for artificial intelligence in the future development of cybersecurity                           
Interpol s Cyber Fusion Center began a collaboration with key cybersecurity players to distribute information on the latest online scams  cyber threats  and risks to internet users  Since       reports on social engineering frauds  ransomware  phishing  and other attacks have been distributed to security agencies in over     countries              

Spread of cybercrime edit 
The increasing prevalence of cybercrime has resulted in more attention to computer crime detection and prosecution 
Hacking has become less complex as hacking communities disseminate their knowledge through the internet      citation needed      Blogs and social networks have contributed substantially to information sharing  so that beginners can benefit from older hackers  knowledge and advice 
Furthermore  hacking is cheaper than ever  Before the cloud computing era  in order to spam or scam  one needed a variety of resources  such as a dedicated server  skills in server management  network configuration  and network maintenance  and knowledge of internet service provider standards  By comparison  a software as a service for mail is a scalable and inexpensive bulk e mail sending service for marketing purposes that could be easily set up for spam               Cloud computing could help cybercriminals leverage their attacks  whether brute forcing a password  improving the reach of a botnet  or facilitating a spamming campaign
