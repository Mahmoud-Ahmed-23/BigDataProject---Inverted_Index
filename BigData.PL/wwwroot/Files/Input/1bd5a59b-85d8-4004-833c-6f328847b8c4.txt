Discrimination is the process of making unfair or prejudicial distinctions between people based on the groups  classes  or other categories to which they belong or are perceived to belong             such as race  gender  age  class  religion  or sexual orientation             Discrimination typically leads to groups being unfairly treated on the basis of perceived statuses based on ethnic  racial  gender or religious categories                        It involves depriving members of one group of opportunities or privileges that are available to members of another group            
Discriminatory traditions  policies  ideas  practices and laws exist in many countries and institutions in all parts of the world  including some  where such discrimination is generally decried  In some places  countervailing measures such as quotas have been used to redress the balance in favor of those who are believed to be current or past victims of discrimination  These attempts have often been met with controversy  and sometimes been called reverse discrimination 


Etymology edit 
The term discriminate appeared in the early   th century in the English language  It is from the Latin discriminat   distinguished between   from the verb discriminare  from discrimen  distinction   from the verb discernere  corresponding to  to discern               Since the American Civil War the term  discrimination  generally evolved in American English usage as an understanding of prejudicial treatment of an individual based solely on their race  later generalized as membership in a certain socially undesirable group or social category             
Before this sense of the word became almost universal  it was a synonym for discernment  tact and culture as in  taste and discrimination   generally a laudable attribute  to  discriminate against  being commonly disparaged                            page      needed     

Definitions edit 
Moral philosophers     who       have defined     when       discrimination using a moralized definition  Under this approach  discrimination is defined as acts  practices  or policies that wrongfully impose a relative disadvantage or deprivation on persons based on their membership in a salient social group             This is a comparative definition  An individual need not be actually harmed in order to be discriminated against  They just needs to be treated worse than others for some arbitrary reason  If someone decides to donate to help orphan children  but decides to donate less  say  to children of a particular race out of a racist attitude  they will be acting in a discriminatory way even if they actually benefit the people they discriminate against by donating some money to them              Discrimination also develops into a source of oppression  the action of recognizing someone as  different  so much that they are treated inhumanly and degraded             
This moralized definition of discrimination is distinct from a non moralized definition in the former  discrimination is wrong by definition  whereas in the latter  this is not the case             
The United Nations stance on discrimination includes the statement   Discriminatory behaviors take many forms  but they all involve some form of exclusion or rejection               The United Nations Human Rights Council and other international bodies work towards helping ending discrimination around the world 

Types edit 
Age edit 
Main articles  Ageism and Adultism
Ageism or age discrimination is discrimination and stereotyping based on the grounds of someone s age              It is a set of beliefs  norms  and values which used to justify discrimination or subordination based on a person s age              Ageism is most often directed toward elderly people  or adolescents and children                         
Age discrimination in hiring has been shown to exist in the United States  Joanna Lahey  professor at The Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A amp M  found that firms are more than     more likely to interview a young adult job applicant than an older job applicant              In Europe  Stijn Baert  Jennifer Norga  Yannick Thuy and Marieke Van Hecke  researchers at Ghent University  measured comparable ratios in Belgium  They found that age discrimination is heterogeneous by the activity older candidates undertook during their additional post educational years  In Belgium  they are only discriminated if they have more years of inactivity or irrelevant employment             
In a survey for the University of Kent  England      of respondents stated that they had suffered from age discrimination  This is a higher proportion than for gender or racial discrimination  Dominic Abrams  social psychology professor at the university  concluded that ageism is the most pervasive form of prejudice experienced in the UK population             

Caste edit 
See also  Caste
According to UNICEF and Human Rights Watch  caste discrimination affects an estimated     million people worldwide and is mainly prevalent in parts of Asia  India  Sri Lanka  Bangladesh  Pakistan  Nepal  Japan  and Africa                          As of          update       there were     million Dalits or Scheduled Castes  formerly known as  untouchables   in India             

Class edit 
These paragraphs are an excerpt from Class discrimination  edit 
Class discrimination  also known as classism  is prejudice or discrimination on the basis of social class  It includes individual attitudes  behaviors  systems of policies and practices that are set up to benefit the upper class at the expense of the lower class             

Social class refers to the grouping of individuals in a hierarchy based on wealth  income  education  occupation  and social network 
Disability edit 
Main article  Disability discrimination
Discrimination against people with disabilities in favor of people who are not is called ableism or disablism  Disability discrimination  which treats non disabled individuals as the standard of  normal living   results in public and private places and services  educational settings  and social services that are built to serve  standard  people  thereby excluding those with various disabilities  Studies have shown that disabled people not only need employment in order to be provided with the opportunity to earn a living but they also need employment in order to sustain their mental health and well being  Work fulfils a number of basic needs for an individual such as collective purpose  social contact  status  and activity              A person with a disability is often found to be socially isolated and work is one way to reduce his or her isolation  In the United States  the Americans with Disabilities Act mandates the provision of equality of access to both buildings and services and is paralleled by similar acts in other countries  such as the Equality Act      in the UK 

Excellence edit 
These paragraphs are an excerpt from Discrimination of excellence  edit 
Discrimination of excellence             is the violation of formal equality of opportunity             and meritocracy              which reward merits of individuals and overachievement              Discrimination of excellence can be caused by different reasons  including legacy preferences              nepotism  substantive equality              affirmative action             or random luck             
Language edit 
Nationalists in Corsica sometimes spray paint or shoot traffic signs in French 
This section is an excerpt from Linguistic discrimination  edit 
Linguistic discrimination  also called glottophobia  linguicism and languagism  is the unfair treatment of people based upon their use of language and the characteristics of their speech  such as their first language  their accent  the perceived size of their vocabulary  whether or not the speaker uses complex and varied words   their modality  and their syntax              For example  an Occitan speaker in France will probably be treated differently from a French speaker              Based on a difference in use of language  a person may automatically form judgments about another person s wealth  education  social status  character or other traits  which may lead to discrimination  This has led to public debate surrounding localisation theories  likewise with overall diversity prevalence in numerous nations across the West 
Linguistic discrimination was at first considered an act of racism  In the mid     s  linguist Tove Skutnabb Kangas captured the idea of language based discrimination as linguicism  which was defined as  ideologies and structures used to legitimize  effectuate  and reproduce unequal divisions of power and resources  both material and non material  between groups which are defined on the basis of language               Although different names have been given to this form of discrimination  they all hold the same definition  Linguistic discrimination is culturally and socially determined due to preference for one use of language over others 
Scholars have analyzed the role of linguistic imperialism in linguicism  with some asserting that speakers of dominant languages gravitate toward discrimination against speakers of other  less dominant languages  while disadvantaging themselves linguistically by remaining monolingual              

According to scholar Carolyn McKinley  this phenomenon is most present in Africa  where the majority of the population speaks European languages introduced during the colonial era  African states are also noted as instituting European languages as the main medium of instruction  instead of indigenous languages              UNESCO reports have noted that this has historically benefitted only the African upper class  conversely disadvantaging the majority of Africa s population who hold varying level of fluency in the European languages spoken across the continent              Scholars have also noted impact of the linguistic dominance of English on academic discipline  scholar Anna Wierzbicka has described disciplines such as social science and humanities being  locked in a conceptual framework grounded in English  which prevents academia as a whole from reaching a  more universal  culture independent perspective              
Name edit 
Discrimination based on a person s name may also occur  with researchers suggesting that this form of discrimination is present based on a name s meaning  its pronunciation  its uniqueness  its gender affiliation  and its racial affiliation                                                              Research has further shown that real world recruiters spend an average of just six seconds reviewing each r sum  before making their initial  fit no fit  screen out decision and that a person s name is one of the six things they focus on most              France has made it illegal to view a person s name on a r sum  when screening for the initial list of most qualified candidates  Great Britain  Germany  Sweden  and the Netherlands have also experimented with name blind summary processes              Some apparent discrimination may be explained by other factors such as name frequency              The effects of name discrimination based on a name s fluency is subtle  small and subject to significantly changing norms             

Nationality edit 
Further information  Discrimination based on nationality
The Anti discrimination laws of most countries allow and make exceptions for discrimination based on nationality and immigration status              The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  CERD  does not prohibit discrimination by nationality  citizenship or naturalization but forbids discrimination  against any particular nationality              
Discrimination on the basis of nationality is usually included in employment laws              see above section for employment discrimination specifically   It is sometimes referred to as bound together with racial discrimination             although it can be separate  It may vary from laws that stop refusals of hiring based on nationality  asking questions regarding origin  to prohibitions of firing  forced retirement  compensation and pay  etc   based on nationality 
Discrimination on the basis of nationality may show as a  level of acceptance  in a sport or work team regarding new team members and employees who differ from the nationality of the majority of team members             
In the GCC states  in the workplace  preferential treatment is given to full citizens  even though many of them lack experience or motivation to do the job  State benefits are also generally available for citizens only              Westerners might also get paid more than other expatriates

Racial and ethnic discrimination differentiates individuals on the basis of real and perceived racial and ethnic differences and leads to various forms of the ethnic penalty                          It can also refer to the belief that groups of humans possess different behavioral traits corresponding to physical appearance and can be divided based on the superiority of one race over another                                                  It may also mean prejudice  discrimination  or antagonism directed against other people because they are of a different race or ethnicity                         
Modern variants of racism are often based in social perceptions of biological differences between peoples  These views can take the form of social actions  practices or beliefs  or political systems in which different races are ranked as inherently superior or inferior to each other  based on presumed shared inheritable traits  abilities  or qualities                                      It has been official government policy in several countries  such as South Africa during the apartheid era  Discriminatory policies towards ethnic minorities include the race based discrimination against ethnic Indians and Chinese in Malaysia             The concept of multiracism has been used to explain the varieties of race discrimination              After the Vietnam War  many Vietnamese refugees moved to Australia and the United States  where they faced discrimination             

Region edit 
See also  Regional discrimination in China
Regional or geographic discrimination is a form of discrimination that is based on the region in which a person lives or the region in which a person was born  It differs from national discrimination because it may not be based on national borders or the country in which the victim lives  instead  it is based on prejudices against a specific region of one or more countries  Examples include discrimination against Chinese people who were born in regions of the countryside that are far away from cities that are located within China  and discrimination against Americans who are from the southern or northern regions of the United States  It is often accompanied by discrimination that is based on accent  dialect  or cultural differences

In the     s  Bhutan expelled its Hindu population or forced it to leave the country in order to preserve Bhutan s Buddhist culture and identity 
Religious discrimination is valuing or treating people or groups differently because of what they do or do not believe in or because of their feelings towards a given religion  For instance  the Jewish population of Germany  and indeed a large portion of Europe  was subjected to discrimination under Adolf Hitler and his Nazi party between      and       They were forced to live in ghettos  wear an identifying star of David on their clothes  and sent to concentration and death camps in rural Germany and Poland  where they were to be tortured and killed  all because of their Jewish religion  Many laws  most prominently the Nuremberg Laws of       separated those of Jewish faith as supposedly inferior to the Christian population 
Restrictions on the types of occupations that Jewish people could hold were imposed by Christian authorities  Local rulers and church officials closed many professions to religious Jews  pushing them into marginal roles that were considered socially inferior  such as tax and rent collecting and moneylending  occupations that were only tolerated as a  necessary evil               The number of Jews who were permitted to reside in different places was limited  they were concentrated in ghettos and banned from owning land  In Saudi Arabia  non Muslims are not allowed to publicly practice their religions and they cannot enter Mecca and Medina                          Furthermore  private non Muslim religious gatherings might be raided by the religious police              In Maldives  non Muslims living and visiting the country are prohibited from openly expressing their religious beliefs  holding public congregations to conduct religious activities  or involving Maldivians in such activities  Those expressing religious beliefs other than Islam may face imprisonment of up to five years or house arrest  fines ranging from       to        rufiyaa       to          and deportation             
In a      consultation on the issue  the United States commission on civil rights defined religious discrimination in relation to the civil rights which are guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment  Whereas religious civil liberties  such as the right to hold or not to hold a religious belief  are essential for Freedom of Religion  in the United States as secured by the First Amendment   religious discrimination occurs when someone is denied  equal protection under the law  equality of status under the law  equal treatment in the administration of justice  and equality of opportunity and access to employment  education  housing  public services and facilities  and public accommodation because of their exercise of their right to religious freedom              

Sex  sex characteristics  gender  and gender identity edit 
Main article  Sexism
See also  Homophobia  Misogyny  Misandry  Discrimination against intersex people  Transphobia  Discrimination against non binary gender persons  and Violence against LGBT people
Sexism is a form of discrimination based on a person s sex or gender  It has been linked to stereotypes and gender roles                          and may include the belief that one sex or gender is intrinsically superior to another              Extreme sexism may foster sexual harassment  rape  and other forms of sexual violence              Gender discrimination may encompass sexism and is discrimination toward people based on their gender identity             or their gender or sex differences              Gender discrimination is especially defined in terms of workplace inequality              It may arise from social or cultural customs and norms             
Intersex persons experience discrimination due to innate  atypical sex characteristics  Multiple jurisdictions now protect individuals on grounds of intersex status or sex characteristics  South Africa was the first country to explicitly add intersex to legislation  as part of the attribute of  sex               Australia was the first country to add an independent attribute  of  intersex status                           Malta was the first to adopt a broader framework of  sex characteristics   through legislation that also ended modifications to the sex characteristics of minors undertaken for social and cultural reasons                          Global efforts such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal   is also aimed at ending all forms of discrimination on the basis of gender and sex             

Sexual orientation edit

See also  Heterosexism  Heteronormativity  Biphobia  and Homophobia
One s sexual orientation is a  predilection for homosexuality  heterosexuality  or bisexuality               Like most minority groups  homosexuals and bisexuals are vulnerable to prejudice and discrimination from the majority group  They may experience hatred from others because of their sexuality  a term for such hatred based upon one s sexual orientation is often called homophobia  Many continue to hold negative feelings towards those with non heterosexual orientations and will discriminate against people who have them or are thought to have them  People of other uncommon sexual orientations also experience discrimination  One study found its sample of heterosexuals to be more prejudiced against asexual people than against homosexual or bisexual people             
Employment discrimination based on sexual orientation varies by country  Revealing a lesbian sexual orientation  by means of mentioning an engagement in a rainbow organisation or by mentioning one s partner name  lowers employment opportunities in Cyprus and Greece but overall  it has no negative effect in Sweden and Belgium                                                  In the latter country  even a positive effect of revealing a lesbian sexual orientation is found for women at their fertile ages 
Besides these academic studies  in       ILGA published a report based on research carried out by Daniel Ottosson at S dert rn University College in Stockholm  Sweden  This research found that of the    countries around the world that continue to consider homosexuality illegal  five carry the death penalty for homosexual activity  and two do in some regions of the country              In the report  this is described as  State sponsored homophobia               This happens in Islamic states  or in two cases regions under Islamic authority                          On February          the IRIN issued a reported titled  Iraq  Male homosexuality still a taboo   The article stated  among other things that honor killings by Iraqis against a gay family member are common and given some legal protection              In August       Human Rights Watch published an extensive report detailing torture of men accused of being gay in Iraq  including the blocking of men s anuses with glue and then giving the men laxatives              Although gay marriage has been legal in South Africa since       same sex unions are often condemned as  un African               Research conducted in      shows     of black lesbians from the Western Cape live in fear of sexual assault

Reverse discrimination is discrimination against members of a dominant or majority group  in favor of members of a minority or historically disadvantaged group             
This discrimination may seek to redress social inequalities under which minority groups have had less access to privileges enjoyed by the majority group  In such cases it is intended to remove discrimination that minority groups may already face  Reverse discrimination can be defined as the unequal treatment of members of the majority groups resulting from preferential policies  as in college admissions or employment  intended to remedy earlier discrimination against minorities             
Conceptualizing affirmative action as reverse discrimination became popular in the early  to mid     s  a time period that focused on under representation and action policies intended to remedy the effects of past discrimination in both government and the business world

Theories and philosophy edit 
Social theories such as egalitarianism assert that social equality should prevail  In some societies  including most developed countries  each individual s civil rights include the right to be free from government sponsored social discrimination               Due to a belief in the capacity to perceive pain or suffering shared by all animals  abolitionist or vegan egalitarianism maintains that the interests of every individual  regardless of their species   warrant equal consideration with the interests of humans  and that not doing so is speciesist              
Philosophers have debated as to how inclusive the definition of discrimination should be  Some philosophers have argued that discrimination should only refer to wrongful or disadvantageous treatment in the context of a socially salient group  such as race  gender  sexuality etc   within a given context  Under this view  failure to limit the concept of discrimination would lead to it being overinclusive  for example  since most murders occur because of some perceived difference between the perpetrator and the victim  many murders would constitute discrimination if the social salience requirement is not included  Thus this view argues that making the definition of discrimination overinclusive renders it meaningless  Conversely  other philosophers argue that discrimination should simply refer to wrongful disadvantageous treatment regardless of the social salience of the group  arguing that limiting the concept only to socially salient groups is arbitrary  as well as raising issues of determining which groups would count as socially salient  The issue of which groups should count has caused many political and social debates             
Based on realistic conflict theory              and social identity theory               Rubin and Hewstone              have highlighted a distinction among three types of discrimination 

Realistic competition is driven by self interest and is aimed at obtaining material resources  e g   food  territory  customers  for the in group  e g   favoring an in group in order to obtain more resources for its members  including the self  
Social competition is driven by the need for self esteem and is aimed at achieving a positive social status for the in group relative to comparable out groups  e g   favoring an in group in order to make it better than an out group  
Consensual discrimination is driven by the need for accuracy              and reflects stable and legitimate intergroup status hierarchies  e g   favoring a high status in group because it is high status  
Labeling theory edit 
An anti discrimination education workshop at the Auschwitz Jewish Center  Poland      
Discrimination  in labeling theory  takes form as mental categorization of minorities and the use of stereotype  This theory describes difference as deviance from the norm  which results in internal devaluation and social stigma              that may be seen as discrimination  It is started by describing a  natural  social order  It is distinguished between the fundamental principle of fascism and social democracy                   clarification needed      The Nazis in     s era Germany and the pre      Apartheid government of South Africa used racially discriminatory agendas for their political ends  This practice continues with some present day governments              

Game theory edit 
Economist Yanis Varoufakis        argues that  discrimination based on utterly arbitrary characteristics evolves quickly and systematically in the experimental laboratory   and that neither classical game theory nor neoclassical economics can explain this              
In       Varoufakis and Shaun Hargreaves Heap ran an experiment where volunteers played a computer mediated  multiround hawk dove game  At the start of each session  each participant was assigned a color at random  either red or blue  At each round  each player learned the color assigned to his or her opponent  but nothing else about the opponent  Hargreaves Heap and Varoufakis found that the players  behavior within a session frequently developed a discriminatory convention  giving a Nash equilibrium where players of one color  the  advantaged  color  consistently played the aggressive  hawk  strategy against players of the other   disadvantaged  color  who played the acquiescent  dove  strategy against the advantaged color  Players of both colors used a mixed strategy when playing against players assigned the same color as their own  The experimenters then added a cooperation option to the game  and found that disadvantaged players usually cooperated with each other  while advantaged players usually did not  They state that while the equilibria reached in the original hawk dove game are predicted by evolutionary game theory  game theory does not explain the emergence of cooperation in the disadvantaged group  Citing earlier psychological work of Matthew Rabin  they hypothesize that a norm of differing entitlements emerges across the two groups  and that this norm could define a  fairness  equilibrium within the disadvantaged group              

Effects on health edit 
This section is an excerpt from Psychological impact of discrimination on health  edit 
The psychological impact of discrimination on health refers to the cognitive pathways through which discrimination impacts mental and physical health in marginalized  and lower status groups  e g  racial and sexual minorities                Research on the relationship between discrimination and health became grew in the     s  when researchers proposed that persisting racial ethnic disparities in health outcomes could be explained by racial or ethnic differences in experiences with discrimination               While much research focuses on the interactions between interpersonal discrimination and health  researchers studying discrimination and health in the United States have proposed that institutional discrimination and cultural racism also create conditions that contribute to persisting racial and economic health disparities                           

A stress and coping framework              is applied to investigate how discrimination influences health outcomes in racial  gender  and sexual minorities  as well as on immigrant and indigenous populations                            The research indicates that experiences of discrimination are associated with worse physical and mental health conditions and lead to increased participation in unhealthy behaviors               Evidence of the inverse link between discrimination and health has been observed consistently across multiple population groups and various cultural and national contexts
