Cybernetics is the transdisciplinary study of circular causal            processes such as feedback and recursion  where the effects of a system s actions  its outputs  return as inputs to that system  influencing subsequent action             It is concerned with general principles that are relevant across multiple contexts             including in engineering  ecological  economic  biological  cognitive and social systems and also in practical activities such as designing             learning  and managing  Cybernetics  transdisciplinary            character has meant that it intersects with a number of other fields  leading to it having both wide influence and diverse interpretations 
The field is named after an example of circular causal feedback that of steering a ship  the ancient Greek             kybern t s  refers to the person who steers a ship   In steering a ship  the position of the rudder is adjusted in continual response to the effect it is observed as having  forming a feedback loop through which a steady course can be maintained in a changing environment  responding to disturbances from cross winds and tide                       
Cybernetics has its origins in exchanges between numerous disciplines during the     s  Initial developments were consolidated through meetings such as the Macy Conferences and the Ratio Club  Early focuses included purposeful behaviour             neural networks  heterarchy  information theory  and self organising systems             As cybernetics developed  it became broader in scope to include work in design  family therapy  management and organisation  pedagogy  sociology  the creative arts and the counterculture             


Definitions edit 
Cybernetics has been defined in a variety of ways  reflecting  the richness of its conceptual base               One of the best known definitions is that of the American scientist Norbert Wiener  who characterised cybernetics as concerned with  control and communication in the animal and the machine               Another early definition is that of the Macy cybernetics conferences  where cybernetics was understood as the study of  circular causal and feedback mechanisms in biological and social systems               Margaret Mead emphasised the role of cybernetics as  a form of cross disciplinary thought which made it possible for members of many disciplines to communicate with each other easily in a language which all could understand              
Other definitions include               the art of governing or the science of government   Andr  Marie Amp re    the art of steersmanship   Ross Ashby    the study of systems of any nature which are capable of receiving  storing  and processing information so as to use it for control   Andrey Kolmogorov   and  a branch of mathematics dealing with problems of control  recursiveness  and information  focuses on forms and the patterns that connect   Gregory Bateson  

Etymology edit 
Simple feedback model  AB  lt    for negative feedback 
The Ancient Greek term               kubern tikos    good at  steering   appears in Plato s Republic             and Alcibiades  where the metaphor of a steersman is used to signify the governance of people              The French word cybern tique was also used in      by the physicist Andr  Marie Amp re to denote the sciences of government in his classification system of human knowledge 
According to Norbert Wiener  the word cybernetics was coined by a research group involving himself and Arturo Rosenblueth in the summer of                   It has been attested in print since at least      through Wiener s book Cybernetics  Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine      note        In the book  Wiener states 

After much consideration  we have come to the conclusion that all the existing terminology has too heavy a bias to one side or another to serve the future development of the field as well as it should  and as happens so often to scientists  we have been forced to coin at least one artificial neo Greek expression to fill the gap  We have decided to call the entire field of control and communication theory  whether in the machine or in the animal  by the name Cybernetics  which we form from the Greek            or steersman 
Moreover  Wiener explains  the term was chosen to recognize James Clerk Maxwell s      publication on feedback mechanisms involving governors  noting that the term governor is also derived from             kubern t s  via a Latin corruption gubernator  Finally  Wiener motivates the choice by steering engines of a ship being  one of the earliest and best developed forms of feedback mechanisms              

History edit 
First wave edit

Norbert Wiener
The initial focus of cybernetics was on parallels between regulatory feedback processes in biological and technological systems  Two foundational articles were published in        Behavior  Purpose and Teleology  by Arturo Rosenblueth  Norbert Wiener  and Julian Bigelow                  based on the research on living organisms that Rosenblueth did in Mexico                  and the paper  A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity  by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts  The foundations of cybernetics were then developed through a series of transdisciplinary conferences funded by the Josiah Macy  Jr  Foundation  between      and       The conferences were chaired by McCulloch and had participants included Ross Ashby  Gregory Bateson  Heinz von Foerster  Margaret Mead  John von Neumann  and Norbert Wiener  In the UK  similar focuses were explored by the Ratio Club  an informal dining club of young psychiatrists  psychologists  physiologists  mathematicians and engineers that met between      and       Wiener introduced the neologism cybernetics to denote the study of  teleological mechanisms  and popularized it through the book Cybernetics  Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine             
During the     s  cybernetics was developed as a primarily technical discipline  such as in Qian Xuesen s       Engineering Cybernetics   In the Soviet Union  Cybernetics was initially considered with suspicion             but became accepted from the mid to late     s 
By the     s and     s  however  cybernetics  transdisciplinarity fragmented  with technical focuses separating into separate fields  Artificial intelligence  AI  was founded as a distinct discipline at the Dartmouth workshop in       differentiating itself from the broader cybernetics field  After some uneasy coexistence  AI gained funding and prominence  Consequently  cybernetic sciences such as the study of artificial neural networks were downplayed              Similarly  computer science became defined as a distinct academic discipline in the     s and early     s             

Second wave edit 
The second wave of cybernetics came to prominence from the     s onwards  with its focus inflecting away from technology toward social  ecological  and philosophical concerns  It was still grounded in biology  notably Maturana and Varela s autopoiesis  and built on earlier work on self organising systems and the presence of anthropologists Mead and Bateson in the Macy meetings  The Biological Computer Laboratory  founded in      and active until the mid     s under the direction of Heinz von Foerster at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign  was a major incubator of this trend in cybernetics research             
Focuses of the second wave of cybernetics included management cybernetics  such as Stafford Beer s biologically inspired viable system model  work in family therapy  drawing on Bateson  social systems  such as in the work of Niklas Luhmann  epistemology and pedagogy  such as in the development of radical constructivism              Cybernetics  core theme of circular causality was developed beyond goal oriented processes to concerns with reflexivity and recursion  This was especially so in the development of second order cybernetics  or the cybernetics of cybernetics   developed and promoted by Heinz von Foerster  which focused on questions of observation  cognition  epistemology  and ethics 
The     s onwards also saw cybernetics begin to develop exchanges with the creative arts  design  and architecture  notably with the Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition  ICA  London         curated by Jasia Reichardt                          and the unrealised Fun Palace project  London  unrealised       onwards   where Gordon Pask was consultant to architect Cedric Price and theatre director Joan Littlewood             

Third wave edit 
From the     s onwards  there has been a renewed interest in cybernetics from a number of directions  Early cybernetic work on artificial neural networks has been returned to as a paradigm in machine learning and artificial intelligence  The entanglements of society with emerging technologies has led to exchanges with feminist technoscience and posthumanism  Re examinations of cybernetics  history have seen science studies scholars emphasising cybernetics  unusual qualities as a science  such as its  performative ontology               Practical design disciplines have drawn on cybernetics for theoretical underpinning and transdisciplinary connections  Emerging topics include how cybernetics  engagements with social  human  and ecological contexts might come together with its earlier technological focus  whether as a critical discourse                         or a  new branch of engineering              

Key concepts and theories edit 
The central theme in cybernetics is feedback  Feedback is a process where the observed outcomes of actions are taken as inputs for further action in ways that support the pursuit  maintenance  or disruption of particular conditions  forming a circular causal relationship  In steering a ship  the helmsperson maintains a steady course in a changing environment by adjusting their steering in continual response to the effect it is observed as having            
Other examples of circular causal feedback include  technological devices such as the thermostat  where the action of a heater responds to measured changes in temperature regulating the temperature of the room within a set range  and the centrifugal governor of a steam engine  which regulates the engine speed  biological examples such as the coordination of volitional movement through the nervous system and the homeostatic processes that regulate variables such as blood sugar  and processes of social interaction such as conversation             
Negative feedback processes are those that maintain particular conditions by reducing  hence  negative   the difference from a desired state  such as where a thermostat turns on a heater when it is too cold and turns a heater off when it is too hot  Positive feedback processes increase  hence  positive   the difference from a desired state  An example of positive feedback is when a microphone picks up the sound that it is producing through a speaker  which is then played through the speaker  and so on 
In addition to feedback  cybernetics is concerned with other forms of circular processes including  feedforward  recursion  and reflexivity 
Other key concepts and theories in cybernetics include 

Autopoiesis
Black box
Conversation theory
Double bind theory  Double binds are patterns created in interaction between two or more parties in ongoing relationships where there is a contradiction between messages at different logical levels that creates a situation with emotional threat but no possibility of withdrawal from the situation and no way to articulate the problem              The theory was first described by Gregory Bateson and colleagues in the     s with regard to the origins of schizophrenia              but it is also characteristic of many other social contexts             
Experimental epistemology            
Good regulator theorem
Heterarchy
Perceptual control theory  A model of behavior based on the properties of negative feedback  cybernetic  control loops  A key insight of PCT is that the controlled variable is not the output of the system  the behavioral actions   but its input   perception   The theory came to be known as  perceptual control theory  to distinguish from those control theorists that assert or assume that it is the system s output that is controlled  Method of levels is an approach to psychotherapy based on perceptual control theory where the therapist aims to help the patient shift their awareness to higher levels of perception in order to resolve conflicts and allow reorganization to take place

Related fields and applications edit 
Cybernetics  central concept of circular causality is of wide applicability  leading to diverse applications and relations with other fields  Many of the initial applications of cybernetics focused on engineering  biology  and exchanges between the two  such as medical cybernetics and robotics and topics such as neural networks  heterarchy              In the social and behavioral sciences  cybernetics has included and influenced work in anthropology  sociology  economics  family therapy              cognitive science  and psychology                         
As cybernetics has developed  it broadened in scope to include work in management  design             pedagogy                          and the creative arts              while also developing exchanges with constructivist philosophies  counter cultural movements              and media studies              The development of management cybernetics has led to a variety of applications  notably to the national economy of Chile under the Allende government in Project Cybersyn  In design  cybernetics has been influential on interactive architecture  human computer interaction              design research              and the development of systemic design and metadesign practices 

Project Cybersyn was an early form of cybernetic economic planning 
Cybernetics is often understood within the context of systems science  systems theory  and systems thinking                          Systems approaches influenced by cybernetics include critical systems thinking  which incorporates the viable system model  systemic design  and system dynamics  which is based on the concept of causal feedback loops 
Many fields trace their origins in whole or part to work carried out in cybernetics  or were partially absorbed into cybernetics when it was developed  These include artificial intelligence  bionics  cognitive science  control theory  complexity science  computer science  information theory and robotics  Some aspects of modern artificial intelligence  particularly the social machine  are often described in cybernetic terms

Notes edit 


  While Wiener s book presents cybernetics in a scientific context  its subtitle does not use the term science             and Wiener refers to cybernetics as a  field  when defining it              Ashby  however  refers to Wiener as defining cybernetics as  the science of communication and control             and many subsequent authors follow Ashby
