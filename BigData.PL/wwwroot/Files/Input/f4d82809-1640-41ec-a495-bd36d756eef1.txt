Adding Text and Stickers to Photos and Carousels
Users can now add text   including the newly released fonts   and layer images via stickers to their photos and carousels  This allows for greater creative flexibility  enabling users to make their content stand out and explore new storytelling options with photos and carousels 
To use the new text tool  users simply tap on the text button after selecting a photo from their gallery  They can layer in additional images by tapping the gallery button in the top right corner of their screen  Tapping on the sticker itself allows users to change its shape from a rectangle to a square  circle  heart or star
