Introduction to chess edit 
Kasparov began the serious study of chess after he came across a problem set up by his parents and proposed a solution              
From age seven  Kasparov attended the Young Pioneer Palace in Baku and  at ten  began training at Mikhail Botvinnik s chess school under coach Vladimir Makogonov  Makogonov helped develop Kasparov s positional skills and taught him to play the Caro Kann Defence and the Tartakower System of the Queen s Gambit Declined              Kasparov won the Soviet Junior Championship in Tbilisi in       scoring     points  at age thirteen  He repeated the feat the following year  winning with a score of        He was being coached by Alexander Shakarov during this time             
In       Kasparov participated in the Sokolsky Memorial tournament in Minsk  He had received a special invitation to enter the tournament but took first place and became a chess master  Kasparov has stressed that this event was a turning point in his life and that it convinced him to choose chess as his career   I will remember the Sokolsky Memorial as long as I live   he wrote  He has also said that after the victory  he thought he had a very good shot at the world championship             

Chess career edit 
Rising up the ranks edit 
He first qualified for the USSR Chess Championship at age    in       the youngest ever player at that level  He won the    player Swiss system tournament at Daugavpils on a tie break over Igor V  Ivanov to capture the sole qualifying place             
Kasparov rose quickly through the FIDE world rankings  Due to an oversight by the USSR Chess Federation  which believed that a grandmaster tournament in Banja Luka  Yugoslavia  was for juniors  he participated in that event in      while still unrated  He was a replacement for the Soviet defector Viktor Korchnoi  who was originally invited but withdrew due to the threat of a boycott from the Soviets              Kasparov won this high class tournament  emerging with a provisional rating of       enough to catapult him to the top group of chess players  at the time  number    in the world               The next year        he won the World Junior Chess Championship in Dortmund  West Germany  Later that year  he made his debut as the second reserve for the Soviet Union at the Chess Olympiad at Valletta  Malta  and became a Grandmaster             
As a teenager  Kasparov shared the USSR Chess Championship in      with Lev Psakhis            although Psakhis won their game              His first win in a superclass level international tournament was scored at Bugojno  Yugoslavia  in       He earned a place in the      Moscow Interzonal tournament  which he won  to qualify for the Candidates Tournament              At age     he was the youngest Candidate since Bobby Fischer  who was    when he qualified in       At this stage  he was already the No    rated player in the world  trailing only world champion Karpov on the January      list

Kasparov s first  quarter final  Candidates match was against Alexander Beliavsky  whom he defeated      four wins  one loss               Politics threatened Kasparov s semi final against Korchnoi  which was scheduled to be played in Pasadena  California  Korchnoi had defected from the Soviet Union in      and was at that time the strongest active non Soviet player  The Soviet authorities would not allow Kasparov to travel to the United States  meaning that Korchnoi could have had a walkover              This decision was met with disapproval by the chess world  and Korchnoi agreed to the match to being played in London instead  along with the previously scheduled match between Vasily Smyslov and Zolt n Ribli  The Kasparov Korchnoi match was put together on short notice by Raymond Keene  Kasparov lost the first game but won the match      four wins  one loss              
In January       Kasparov became the No    ranked player in the world  with a FIDE rating of       He became the youngest ever world No     a record that lasted    years until being broken by Kramnik in January                   That same year  he won the Candidates  final        four wins  no losses  against former world champion Smyslov at Vilnius  thus qualifying to play Karpov for the world championship             

     world championship edit 
Main article  World Chess Championship     
The World Chess Championship      match between Kasparov and Karpov had many ups and downs and a controversial finish  Karpov started in very good form  and after nine games Kasparov was down     in a  first to six wins  match  Fellow players predicted he would be whitewashed     within    games             
In an unexpected turn of events  there followed a series of    successive draws  some relatively short  others drawn in unsettled positions  Kasparov lost game           then fought back with another series of draws until game     earning his first ever win against the world champion and bringing the score to      Another    successive draws followed  through game     the previous record length for a world title match had been    games  Jos  Ra l Capablanca vs  Alexander Alekhine in                   
Kasparov won games    and    to bring the score to     in Karpov s favour  Then the match was ended without result by FIDE President Florencio Campomanes  and a new match was announced to start a few months later  The termination was controversial  as both players stated that they preferred the match to continue                          Announcing his decision  Campomanes cited the health of the players  which had been strained by the length of the match              According to grandmasters Boris Gulko and Korchnoi  and historians Vladimir Popow and Yuri Felshtinsky in their The KGB Plays Chess book  Campomanes had been a KGB agent and was tasked with preventing Karpov s defeat at all costs  The match was terminated while Karpov was still ahead to avoid the impression that the decision had been made for his benefit             
The match became the first  and so far only  world championship match to be abandoned without a result  Kasparov s relations with Campomanes and FIDE became strained                          and matters came to a head in      with Kasparov s complete break away from FIDE             

World champion edit

The second Karpov Kasparov match in      was organised in Moscow as the best of    games  where the first player to win     points would claim the title  The scores from the terminated match would not carry over  however  in the event of a       draw  the title would remain with Karpov  On   November       Kasparov secured the world crown by a score of        Karpov  with White  needed to win the   th game to retain the title but Kasparov won it with the Sicilian Defence              He was    years old at the time  making him the youngest ever world champion              a record held by Mikhail Tal for over    years              Kasparov s win with Black in the   th game has been recognised as one of the all time chess masterpieces  including being voted the best game played during the first    issues of the magazine Chess Informant                         
As part of the arrangements following the aborted      match  Karpov had been granted  in the event of his defeat  a right to rematch  Another match took place in       hosted jointly in London and Leningrad                          with each city hosting    games  At one point in the match  Kasparov opened a three point lead and looked well on his way to a decisive victory  But Karpov fought back by winning three consecutive games to level the score late in the match  At this point  Kasparov dismissed one of his seconds  grandmaster Evgeny Vladimirov  accusing him of selling his opening preparation to the Karpov team  as described in Kasparov s autobiography Unlimited Challenge  chapter Stab in the Back   Kasparov scored one more win and kept his title by a score of                     
A fourth match for the world title took place in      in Seville              as Karpov had qualified through the Candidates  Matches to become the official challenger once again  This match was also very close  with neither player holding more than a one point lead at any time  With one game left  Kasparov was down a point and needed a win to draw the match and retain his title  A long  tense game ensued  in which Karpov blundered away a pawn just before the first time control  Kasparov then won a long ending to retain the title on a       scoreline             
Kasparov and Karpov met for a fifth time  on this occasion in New York City and Lyon in       with each city hosting    games  Again  the result was a close one  with Kasparov winning by a margin of          In their five world championship matches  Kasparov had    wins     losses and     draws in     games             

Break with and ejection from FIDE edit

In November       Kasparov had created the Grandmasters Association  GMA  to represent professional players and give them more say in FIDE s activities              Kasparov assumed a leadership role  GMA s major achievement was in organising a series of six World Cup tournaments for the world s top players              This caused an uneasy relationship to develop between Kasparov and FIDE              The previous month  Kasparov had made his feelings clear to fellow grandmaster Keene   Campomanes must go  It is war to the death with him as far as I am concerned  I will do everything I can to remove him              
This stand off lasted until       by which time a new challenger had qualified through the Candidates cycle  Nigel Short  a British grandmaster who had defeated Karpov in a qualifying match and then Jan Timman in the finals held in early                   After a confusing and compressed bidding process produced lower financial estimates than expected              the world champion and his challenger both rejected FIDE s bid for an August match in Manchester and decided to play outside FIDE s jurisdiction                          Their match took place under the auspices of the Professional Chess Association  PCA   an organisation established by Kasparov and Short                          At this point  a fracture occurred in the lineage of the FIDE World Championship  In an interview in       Kasparov called the break with FIDE in      the worst mistake of his career  as it hurt the game in the long run             
Kasparov and Short were ejected from FIDE and played their well sponsored match in London in September                   Kasparov won convincingly by a score of         The match considerably raised the profile of chess in the UK  with a substantial level of coverage on Channel                            Meanwhile  FIDE organised its world championship match between Timman  the defeated Candidates finalist  and former world champion Karpov  a defeated Candidates semi finalist   which Karpov won                         
FIDE removed Kasparov and Short from its rating list  Subsequently  the PCA created a rating list of its own  which featured all the world s top players regardless of their relation to FIDE  There were now two world champions  PCA champion Kasparov and FIDE champion Karpov              The title remained split for    years 
Kasparov defended his PCA title in a      match against Viswanathan Anand at the World Trade Center in New York City  Kasparov won the match by four wins to one  with thirteen draws             
Kasparov tried to organise another world championship match under a different organisation  the World Chess Association  WCA   with Linares organiser Luis Rentero  Alexei Shirov and Kramnik played a candidates match to decide the challenger  which Shirov won in an upset  But when Rentero admitted that the funds required and promised had never materialised  the WCA collapsed  Yet another body stepped in  BrainGames com  headed by Raymond Keene  After a match with Shirov could not be agreed by BrainGames com and talks with Anand collapsed  a match was instead arranged against Kramnik             
During this period  Kasparov was approached by Oakham School in the United Kingdom  at the time the only school in the country with a full time chess coach              and developed an interest in the use of chess in education  In       Kasparov supported a scholarship programme at the school              Kasparov also won the Marca Leyenda trophy that year             
In       he played a well known game against Topalov wherein he won after a rook sacrifice and king hunt                         

Losing the title and aftermath edit

The Kasparov Kramnik match took place in London during the latter half of       Kramnik had been a student of Kasparov s at the famous Botvinnik Kasparov chess school in Russia and had served on Kasparov s team for the      match with Anand             
The better prepared Kramnik won game   against Kasparov s Gr nfeld Defence and achieved winning positions in games   and    although Kasparov managed a draw in both games  Kasparov made a critical error in game    with the Nimzo Indian Defence  which Kramnik exploited to win in    moves  As White  Kasparov could not crack the passive but solid Berlin Defence in the Ruy Lopez  and Kramnik managed to draw all his games as Black  Kramnik won the match                   
Kasparov won a series of major tournaments and remained the PCA top rated player in the world  ahead of both Kramnik and the FIDE World Champion  In       he refused an invitation to the      Dortmund Candidates Tournament for the Classical title  claiming his results had earned him a rematch with Kramnik             
Kasparov and Karpov played a four game match with rapid time controls over two days in December      in New York City  Kasparov suffered a surprise loss                         
Because of Kasparov s continuing strong results and status as FIDE world No     he was included in the so called  Prague Agreement   masterminded by Yasser Seirawan and intended to reunite the two world championships  Kasparov was to play a match against the FIDE World Champion Ponomariov in September                   But this match was called off after Ponomariov refused to sign his contract for it without reservation  In its place  there were plans for a match against Rustam Kasimdzhanov  winner of the FIDE World Chess Championship       to be held in January      in the United Arab Emirates  These also fell through owing to a lack of funding  Plans to hold the match in Turkey instead came too late  Kasparov announced in January      that he was tired of waiting for FIDE to arrange a match and had decided to stop all efforts to become undisputed world champion once more             

Retirement from regular competitive chess edit 
Kasparov in     
After winning the prestigious Linares tournament for the ninth time  Kasparov announced on    March      that he would retire from regular competitive chess  He cited as the reason a lack of personal goals in the chess world  When winning the Russian championship in       he commented that it had been the last major title he had never won outright  He also expressed frustration at the failure to reunify the world championship                         
Kasparov said he might play in some rapid chess events for fun  but he intended to spend more time on his books  including the My Great Predecessors series  and work on the links between decision making in chess and other areas of life  He also stated that he would continue to involve himself in Russian politics  which he viewed as  headed down the wrong path

Assessment and legacy edit 
Kasparov received a Chess Oscar eleven times as the best chess player of the year  in                                        and                         Between      and       he won or tied for first place in every tournament he entered               In       Kasparov reached an Elo rating of      points  a record that stood for over thirteen years  on    December       Carlsen achieved an unofficial rating of      points  with which he topped the next release of the rating in January                                 With the exception of the PCA period and sharing first place with Kramnik in       Kasparov led the rating list from      to        a total of     months               On   January       Kasparov ranked first with a coefficient of       However  he was excluded from the FIDE rating list of   April      because he had not participated in tournaments for the previous twelve months              
The rivalry between Kasparov and Karpov  often referred to as the  two Ks                is one of the greatest in the history of chess  In six years they played five matches comprising     games                            For a long time there was personal enmity between Karpov and Kasparov               The conflict between the two men also had a political connotation  Karpov was considered a representative of the Soviet nomenklatura  while Kasparov was young and popular  positioned himself as a  child of change   willingly gave candid interviews and  especially in the West  had an aura of a rebel  although he was never a dissident               Kasparov s      victory coincided with the start of perestroika in the Soviet Union              
Carlsen said of Kasparov   I ve never seen someone with such a feel for dynamics in complex positions                Kramnik has opined that Kasparov s  capacity for study is second to none   adding  There is nothing in chess he has been unable to deal with               
In       the international consulting company Synectics published a rating of     living geniuses in science  politics  art and entrepreneurship  in which Kasparov ranked   th              
Less known about Kasparov is his emphasis on physical fitness  including taking a month off each year to work out strenuously              

Playing style edit 
Kramnik called Kasparov a chess player with virtually no weaknesses               His games are characterised by a dynamic style of play with a focus on tactics  depth of strategy  subtle calculation and original opening ideas               Kasparov was known for his extensive opening preparation and aggressive play in it                            Sergey Shipov considered Kasparov s moral and volitional qualities  impulsiveness and psychological instability  and excessive reliance on options  which can lead to overwork and mistakes  as amongst his few shortcomings              
Kasparov s attacking style of play has been compared by many to Alekhine                            his chess idol since childhood  Kasparov has described his style as being influenced chiefly by Alekhine  Tal and Fischer               Other influences on Kasparov were his early coaches  At a young age  he met with experienced teachers Alexander Nikitin and Alexander Shakarov  Shakarov collected and systematised materials  and then became the keeper of Kasparov s  information bank   A revolutionary step at that time was the involvement of computer programs in analysing games  and it was Kasparov and his team who took the first steps in this direction                            In       Kasparov entered the Botvinnik school and immediately attracted attention  Botvinnik commented on the young schoolboy   Garry s speed and memory capacity are amazing  He counts deep variations and finds unexpected moves  The power of combinational vision makes him similar to Alekhine himself               

Contributions to opening theory edit 
Kasparov has made many contributions to opening theory  In the     s  he systematically developed new variants with computer programs  He also  reanimated  the Scotch Game in top level competitions  Kasparov successfully used this opening  which was considered outdated  in the      match against Karpov and in matches with Short and Anand               One of the offshoots of the Sicilian in the Sz n Variation is called the Kasparov Gambit               Kasparov used this variation in the   th and   th games of the match with Karpov in       in the second of these games  he scored a victory              
Another well known case of winning an important game thanks to a novelty in the opening is Kasparov s   th game of the      match against Anand  On the   th move  in a well known position of the open variation of the Spanish Game  Ruy Lopez   Kasparov discovered a new idea with a rook sacrifice  which brought a decisive attack              
Kasparov has also co authored several books on opening theory              

Chess rating edit 
Kasparov holds the record for the longest time as the No    rated player in the world from      to       Kramnik shared the No    ranking with him once  in the January      FIDE rating list                He headed the PCA rating list during the split from FIDE  At the time of his retirement  he was still ranked No    in the world  with a rating of       His rating has fallen inactive since the January      rating list              
In January       Kasparov achieved the  then  highest FIDE rating ever  passing      and breaking Fischer s old record of       By the July      and January      FIDE rating lists  Kasparov had reached a      Elo rating  at that time the highest rating ever achieved               He held that record until Carlsen attained a new record high rating of      in January      

Other achievements edit 
Kasparov holds the record for most consecutive professional tournament victories  placing first or equal first in fifteen individual tournaments from      to                    The streak was broken by Vasyl Ivanchuk at Linares       where Kasparov placed second  half a point behind him after losing their individual game  The details of this record winning streak follow

Notable games edit

Chess and computers edit 
Acorn Computers acted as one of the sponsors for Kasparov s Candidates semi final match against Korchnoi in       This was Kasparov s first introduction to computers  Kasparov was awarded a BBC Micro  which he took back with him to Baku  making it perhaps one of the first Western made microcomputers to reach the Soviet Union at that time              
Computer chess magazine editor Frederic Friedel consulted with Kasparov in      on how a chess database program would be useful preparation for competition  Friedel founded Chessbase two years later  and he gave a copy of the program to Kasparov  who started using it in his preparation               That same year  Kasparov played against thirty two chess computers in Hamburg  winning all games               Several commercially available Kasparov computers were made in the     s  the Saitek Kasparov Turbo King models                                         On    October       Kasparov defeated the chess computer Deep Thought in both games of a two game match               In December       Kasparov played thirty seven blitz games against Fritz   in Cologne  winning     drawing   and losing                
Kasparov cooperated in producing video material for the computer game Kasparov s Gambit released by Electronic Arts in November       In April       Intel acted as a sponsor for the first Professional Chess Association Grand Prix event in Moscow  played at a time control of twenty five minutes per game  In May  Chessbase s Fritz   running on an Intel Pentium PC defeated Kasparov in their first game in the Intel Express blitz tournament in Munich  but Kasparov managed to tie it for first and won the play off         The next day  Kasparov lost to Fritz   again in a game on ZDF TV               In August  Kasparov was knocked out of the London Intel Grand Prix by Richard Lang s ChessGenius   program in the first round               In       during Kasparov s world title match with Anand  he unveiled an opening novelty that had been checked with a chess engine  an approach that would become increasingly common in subsequent years              
Kasparov played in a pair of six game chess matches with IBM supercomputer Deep Blue  The first match took place in Philadelphia in February      and was won by Kasparov                     The second was played in New York City in May      and won by Deep Blue          The      match was the first defeat of a reigning world champion by a computer under tournament conditions              
The match was even after five games but Kasparov lost quickly in Game    Kasparov said that he was  not well prepared  to face Deep Blue in       He said that based on his  objective strengths  his play was stronger than that of Deep Blue               Kasparov claimed that several factors weighed against him in this match  In particular  he was denied access to Deep Blue s recent games  in contrast to the computer s team  which could study hundreds of Kasparov s              
After the loss  Kasparov said that he sometimes saw deep intelligence and creativity in the machine s moves  suggesting that during the second game chess players had intervened in contravention of the rules  IBM denied that it had cheated  stating the only human intervention occurred between games  The rules provided for the developers to modify the program between games  an opportunity they said they used to shore up weaknesses in the computer s play revealed during the course of the match               Kasparov requested printouts of the machine s log files but IBM refused  although the company later published them on the Internet               Much later  it was suggested that the behaviour Kasparov noted had resulted from a glitch in the computer program               Plans for further engagement between Kasparov and IBM  including a rematch  did not come to fruition  due to the accusations of cheating

Kasparov versus the World was a game that took place in       Kasparov conducted the white moves while more than        people from all over the globe played against him  The game was a huge mixture of tactical and strategical ideas  with Kasparov saying   It is the greatest game in the history of chess  The sheer number of ideas  the complexity  and the contribution it has made to chess make it the most important game ever played                After    moves  Kasparov won the game 
In January       he engaged in a six game classical time control match  with a         million prize fund  against Deep Junior  It was billed as the FIDE  Man vs  Machine  world championship               The engine evaluated three million positions per second               After one win each and three draws  it was all up to the final game  After reaching a decent position  Kasparov offered a draw  which was accepted by the Deep Junior team  Asked why he had offered the draw  Kasparov said he feared making a blunder               Deep Junior was the first machine to beat Kasparov with Black and at a standard time control              
In June       Mindscape released the computer game Kasparov Chessmate  with Kasparov himself listed as a co designer               In November       he engaged in a four game match against the computer program X D Fritz  using a virtual board   D glasses and a speech recognition system  After two draws and one win apiece  the X D Man Machine match ended in a draw  Kasparov received          and took home a golden trophy  He continued to regret the blunder in the second game that cost him a crucial point  He felt that he had outplayed the machine overall and performed well   I only made one mistake but unfortunately that one mistake lost the game               
In       Kasparov promoted a series of    NFTs that detailed important moments in his career  The top four sold for more than                                   

Politics and political views edit 
Russia edit 
Early political activities edit 
Kasparov s grandfather was a staunch communist  but the young Kasparov gradually began to have doubts about the Soviet Union s political system at age    when he travelled abroad for the first time in      to Paris for a chess tournament               In       at age     he read Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn s The Gulag Archipelago  a copy of which he bought while abroad               Nevertheless  Kasparov joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  CPSU  in       and was elected to the Central Committee of Komsomol in       In       he left the party              
In May       Kasparov took part in the creation of the Democratic Party of Russia               He left the party on    April       after its conference               Kasparov was also involved with the creation of the  Choice of Russia  bloc of parties in June       He took part in the election campaign of Boris Yeltsin in       In       he voiced his support for the Russian television channel NTV             
After his retirement from chess in       Kasparov turned to politics and created the United Civil Front  a social movement whose main goal is to  work to preserve electoral democracy in Russia                He has vowed to  restore democracy  to Russia by restoring the rule of law                                         A year later the United Civil Front became part of The Other Russia  Kasparov was instrumental in setting up this coalition  which opposes Putin s government and the United Russia party  The Other Russia was boycotted by the leaders of Russia s mainstream opposition parties  Yabloko and Union of Right Forces  due to its inclusion of both nationalist and radical groups  Kasparov has criticised these two parties as being secretly under the auspices of the Kremlin              
In April       Kasparov was in Moscow at a promotional event when he was struck over the head with a chessboard he had just signed  The assailant was reported to have said   I admired you as a chess player  but you gave that up for politics  immediately before the attack               Kasparov has been the subject of a number of other episodes since  including police brutality and alleged harassment from the Russian secret service                           

Kasparov at the third Dissenters March in Saint Petersburg on   June     
Kasparov helped organise the Saint Petersburg Dissenters  March on   March      and The March of the Dissenters on    March       both involving several thousand people rallying against Putin and Saint Petersburg Governor Valentina Matviyenko                           
Kasparov led a pro democracy demonstration in Moscow in April       Soon after it started  however  over       police descended on the group and seized almost everyone  Kasparov  who was briefly arrested  was warned by the prosecution office on the eve of the march that anyone participating risked being detained  He was held for some ten hours and then fined and released               He was later summoned by the FSB for violations of Russian anti extremism laws              
Speaking about Kasparov in       former KGB defector Oleg Kalugin remarked   I do not talk in details        people who knew them are all dead now because they were vocal  they were open  I am quiet  There is only one man who is vocal  and he may be in trouble  world chess champion Kasparov  He has been very outspoken in his attacks on Putin  and I believe that he is probably next on the list               

Presidential candidate        edit 
On    September       Kasparov entered the Russian presidential race  receiving     of     votes at a congress held in Moscow by The Other Russia               In October       Kasparov announced his intention of standing for the Russian presidency as the candidate of the  Other Russia  coalition and vowed to fight for a  democratic and just Russia   Later that month he travelled to the United States  where he appeared on several popular television programmes              
In November       Kasparov and other protesters were detained by police at an Other Russia rally in Moscow  which drew       demonstrators to protest against election rigging  Following an attempt by about     protesters to march through police lines to the electoral commission  which had barred Other Russia candidates from parliamentary elections  arrests were made  The Russian authorities stated a rally had been approved but not any marches  resulting in several demonstrators being detained               Kasparov was subsequently charged with resisting arrest and organising an unauthorised protest  and was given a jail sentence of five days  Kasparov appealed the charges  citing that he had been following orders given by the police  He was released from jail on    November               Putin castigated Kasparov at the rally for his use of English when speaking rather than Russian              
In December       Kasparov announced that he had to withdraw his presidential candidacy due to inability to rent a meeting hall where at least     of his supporters could assemble  With the deadline expiring on that date  he explained it was impossible for him to run  Russian election laws required sufficient meeting hall space for assembling supporters  Kasparov s spokeswoman accused the government of using pressure to deter anyone from renting a hall for the gathering and said that the electoral commission had rejected a proposal that would have allowed for smaller gathering sizes rather than one large gathering at a meeting hall              

Opposition to Putin administration             edit 
Kasparov was among the    first signatories and a key organiser of the online anti Putin campaign  Putin must go   started on    March       Within the text is a call to Russian law enforcement to ignore Putin s orders  By June       there were        signatures  While the identity of the petition author remained anonymous  there was wide speculation that it was indeed Kasparov                                                      On    January       Kasparov hosted a meeting of opposition leaders planning a mass march on   February       the third major opposition rally held since the disputed State Duma elections of December       Among other opposition leaders attending were Alexey Navalny and Yevgeniya Chirikova              
Kasparov was arrested and beaten outside a Moscow court on    August      while attending sentencing in the case involving the all female punk band Pussy Riot               On    August  he was cleared of charges that he had taken part in an unauthorised protest against the conviction of three members of the band  Judge Yekaterina Veklich said there were  no grounds to believe the testimony of the police                Kasparov later thanked all the bloggers and reporters who provided video evidence that contradicted the testimony of the police               Kasparov wrote in February      that  fascism has come to Russia     Project Putin  just like the old Project Hitler  is but the fruit of a conspiracy by the ruling elite  Fascist rule was never the result of the free will of the people  It was always the fruit of a conspiracy by the ruling elites               
Kasparov denied rumours in April      that he was planning to leave Russia for good   I found these rumors to be deeply saddening and  moreover  surprising   he wrote   I was unable to respond immediately because I was in such a state of shock that such an incredibly inaccurate statement  the likes of which is constantly distributed by the Kremlin s propagandists  came this time from Ilya Yashin  a fellow member of the Opposition Coordination Council  KSO  and my former colleague from the Solidarity movement                He also accused prominent Russian journalist Vladimir Posner of failing to stand up to Putin and to earlier Russian and Soviet leaders              
However  Kasparov subsequently fled Russia less than three months later  On   June       he announced that he had left his homeland on account of fear of persecution for his political views               Further  at the      Women in the World conference  Kasparov told The Daily Beast     s Michael Moynihan that democracy no longer existed in what he called Russia s  dictatorship               

Opposition to Putin from exile         edit 
Kasparov at the      Oslo Freedom Forum
Kasparov said at a press conference in June      that if he returned to Russia  he doubted he would be allowed to leave again  given Putin s ongoing crackdown on dissenters   So for the time being   he said   I refrain from returning to Russia   He explained shortly thereafter in an article for The Daily Beast that this had not been intended as  a declaration of leaving my home country  permanently or otherwise   but merely an expression of  the dark reality of the situation in Russia today  where nearly half the members of the opposition s Coordinating Council are under criminal investigation on concocted charges   He noted that the Moscow prosecutor s office was  opening an investigation that would limit my ability to travel   making it impossible for him to fulfil  professional speaking engagements  and hindering his  work for the non profit Kasparov Chess Foundation  which has centres in New York City  Brussels and Johannesburg  to promote chess in education                Kasparov further wrote in his June      Daily Beast article that the mass protests in Moscow    months earlier against fraudulent Russian elections had been  a proud moment for me   He recalled that after joining the opposition movement in March       he had been criticised for seeking to unite  every anti Putin element in the country to march together regardless of ideology   Therefore  the sight of  hundreds of flags representing every group from liberals to nationalists all marching together for  Russia Without Putin  was the fulfillment of a dream   Yet most Russians  he lamented  had continued to  slumber  even as Putin had  taken off the flimsy mask of democracy to reveal himself in full as the would be KGB dictator he has always been               
Kasparov responded with several Twitter postings to a September      The New York Times op ed by Putin   I hope Putin has taken adequate protections   he tweeted   Now that he is a Russian journalist his life may be in grave danger   Also   Now we can expect NY Times op eds by Mugabe on fair elections  Castro on free speech   amp  Kim Jong un on prison reform  The Axis of Hypocrisy               
Kasparov wrote in July      about the trial in Kirov of fellow opposition leader Navalny  who had been convicted  on concocted embezzlement charges   only to see the prosecutor  surprisingly  ask for his release the next day pending appeal   The judicial process and the democratic process in Russia   wrote Kasparov   are both elaborate mockeries created to distract the citizenry at home and to help Western leaders avoid confronting the awkward fact that Russia has returned to a police state   Still  Kasparov felt that whatever had caused the Kirov prosecutor s about face   my optimism tells me it was a positive sign  After more than    years of predictable repression under Putin  anything different is good               
Kasparov has been outspoken regarding Putin s antigay laws  describing them as  only the most recent encroachment on the freedom of speech and association of Russia s citizens   which the international community had largely ignored  Regarding Russia s hosting of the      Winter Olympics  Kasparov explained in August      that he had opposed Russia s bid from the outset  since it would  allow Vladimir Putin s cronies to embezzle hundreds of millions of dollars  and  lend prestige to Putin s authoritarian regime   Kasparov did not support the proposed Sochi Olympics boycott writing that it would  unfairly punish athletes  but called for athletes and others to  transform Putin s self congratulatory pet project into a spotlight that exposes his authoritarian rule  to the world               In September  Kasparov called upon politicians to refuse to attend the games and the public to pressure sponsors and the media  such that Coca Cola  for example  could put  a rainbow flag on each Coca Cola can  and NBC could  do interviews with Russian gay activists or with Russian political activists   Kasparov also emphasised that although he was  still a Russian citizen   he had  good reason to be concerned about my ability to leave Russia if I returned to Moscow               
Kasparov spoke out against the      Russian annexation of Crimea and has stated that control of Crimea should be returned to Ukraine after the overthrow of Putin without additional conditions               Kasparov s website was blocked by the Russian government censorship agency  Roskomnadzor  at the behest of the public prosecutor  allegedly due to Kasparov s opinions on the annexation of Crimea  Kasparov s block was made in unison with several other notable Russian sites that were accused of inciting public outrage  Reportedly  several of the blocked sites received an affidavit noting their violations  However  Kasparov stated that his site had received no such notice of violations after its block               In       a whole note on Kasparov was removed from a Russian language encyclopaedia of greatest Soviet players after an intervention from  senior leadership               
In October       Kasparov published a book titled Winter Is Coming  Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped  In the book  Kasparov likens Putin to Adolf Hitler and explains the need for the West to oppose Putin sooner  rather than appeasing him and postponing the eventual confrontation  According to his publisher   Kasparov wants this book out fast  in a way that has potential to influence the discussion during the primary season                             In       he said that  anything is better than Putin because that eliminates the probability of a nuclear war  Putin is insane              
Following reports of Russian ransomware attacks against American agencies and companies in       Kasparov stated that  the only language that Putin understands is power  and his power is his money   arguing that the United States should target the bank accounts of Russian oligarchs to force Russia to rein in its criminals  cyberattacks              
Kasparov spoke out against the invasion of Ukraine by Russia on Twitter   The only way this really ends is the fall of Putin s regime by collapse of Russian economy and defeat in Ukraine                He also believed that  pressure must be kept up  in terms of sanctions and condemnations against Russia s actions              and joined with other prominent Russian figures in exile to form the Anti War Committee of Russia               He said that Russia should be  thrown back into the Stone Age to make sure that the oil and gas industry and any other sensitive industries that are vital for survival of the regime cannot function without Western technological support               
On    May       Kasparov was designated as  foreign agent  by the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation              
In May       along with a large group of fellow exiles  Kasparov participated in the drafting of Mikhail Khodorkovsky s  Declaration of Russia s Democratic Forces               
On   August       Kasparov participated on the radio show Open to Debate  In a debate with Charles Kupchan  he argued for Ukrainian admission into NATO and against any form of appeasement towards Putin              
In March       Russia placed Kasparov on its list of  terrorists and extremists                            
On    April      an arrest warrant was issued by a court in Russia s Komi region charging Kasparov of creating and leading a  terrorist  group

In a    May      op ed for The Wall Street Journal  Kasparov questioned reports that the Russian security agency  the FSB  had fully cooperated with the FBI in the matter of the Boston bombers  He noted that the elder bomber  Tamerlan Tsarnaev  had reportedly met in Russia with two known jihadists who  were killed in Dagestan by the Russian military just days before Tamerlan left Russia for the U S   Kasparov argued   If no intelligence was sent from Moscow to Washington  about this meeting   all this talk of FSB cooperation cannot be taken seriously   He further observed   This would not be the first time Russian security forces seemed strangely impotent in the face of an impending terror attack   pointing out that in both the      Moscow theater siege and the      Beslan school attack   there were FSB informants in both terror groups   yet the attacks went ahead unimpeded   Given this history  he wrote   it is impossible to overlook that the Boston bombing took place just days after the U S  Magnitsky List was published  creating the first serious external threat to the Putin power structure by penalising Russian officials complicit in human rights crimes   In sum  Putin s  dubious record on counterterrorism and its continued support of terror sponsors Iran and Syria mean only one thing  common ground zero               
In the      United States presidential election  Kasparov described Republican Donald Trump as  a celebrity showman with racist leanings and authoritarian tendencies               and criticised him for calling for closer ties with Putin               After Trump s running mate  Mike Pence  called Putin a strong leader  Kasparov said that Putin is a strong leader  in the same way arsenic is a strong drink                             He also disparaged the economic policies of Democratic primary candidate Bernie Sanders  but showed respect for Sanders as  a charismatic speaker and a passionate believer in his cause                Kasparov opined that Henry Kissinger  was selling the Trump Administration on the idea of a mirror of       Richard Nixon s visit to China   except  instead of a Sino U S  alliance against the U S S R   this would be a Russian American alliance against China              
In a      interview with HuffPost  Kasparov expressed concern over Elon Musk potentially running the Department of Government Efficiency   Musk could be the first oligarch   he stated              

Armenia edit 
In a      interview discussing the Nagorno Karabakh conflict  Kasparov stated that the Republic of Artsakh has a right to independence and that Azerbaijan has no sovereign right over it  He considers this stance to be objective and without bias  as Soviet law allowed for autonomous republics  such as the Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast  to vote for independence separately and were given an equal right for self determination  a factor he felt often went ignored               Kasparov recalled that he was criticised by Armenians for not taking a strong stance when the Karabakh movement began in       explaining that he was living in Baku with         other Armenians at the time and did not want to increase tensions               Kasparov and his family later fled Baku in January      to escape pogroms against Armenians                            Kasparov has declined invitations back to visit Baku  stating he would only return  if every other Armenian born there can do it without a problem and without special favors from the government

Kasparov was critical of the violence unleashed by the Spanish police against the      independence referendum in Catalonia and accused the Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy of  betraying  the European promise of peace               After the Catalan regional election held later the same year  Kasparov wrote   Despite unprecedented pressure from Madrid  Catalonian separatists won a majority  Europe must speak and help find a peaceful path toward resolution and avoid more violence                             Kasparov recommended that Spain look to how Britain handled the      Scottish independence referendum  adding   look only at how Turkey and Iraq have treated the separatist Kurds  That cannot be the road for Spain and Catalonia               
On the occasion of the      centennial of the Armenian genocide  Kasparov reflected that in      he had called for Turkey to be admitted to the European Union if Turkey recognised the genocide               He condemned the assassination of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi               In October       Kasparov wrote that President Erdo an s regime in Turkey  has jailed more journalists than any country in the world and scores of them remain in prison in Turkey  Since       Turkey s intelligence agency has abducted at least    people in operations in    countries

Artificial intelligence edit 
Speaking to Forbes in spring       Kasparov said that he was not overly concerned about the potential for ChatGPT to gain unauthorised access into everyday appliances  Rather  he felt that it is individuals who  still have the monopoly on evil

Kasparov has written in support of the pseudohistorical New Chronology  Fomenko   although with some reservations               In       he expressed a desire to devote his time to promoting the New Chronology after his chess career   New Chronology is a great area for investing my intellect          My analytical abilities are well placed to figure out what was right and what was wrong                 When I stop playing chess  it may well be that I concentrate on promoting these ideas    I believe they can improve our lives                Later  Kasparov renounced his support of Fomenko theories but reaffirmed his belief that mainstream historical knowledge is inconsistent
