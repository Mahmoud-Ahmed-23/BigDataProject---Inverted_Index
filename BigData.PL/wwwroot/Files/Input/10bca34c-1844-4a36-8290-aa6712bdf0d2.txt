Early life and education edit 
Nilsson was born in Saginaw  Michigan  in                  He received his Ph D  from Stanford in       and spent much of his career at SRI International  a private research lab spun off from Stanford                       
Nilsson served as a lieutenant in the U S  Air Force from      to       he was stationed at the Rome Air Development Center in Rome  New York                       

Career edit 
SRI International edit 
Starting in       Nilsson  along with Charles A  Rosen and Bertram Raphael  led a research team in the construction of Shakey  a robot that constructed a model of its environment from sensor data  reasoned about that environment to arrive at a plan of action  then carried that plan out by sending commands to its motors                        This paradigm has been enormously influential in AI                        Textbooks such as Introduction to Artificial Intelligence             Essentials of Artificial Intelligence             and the first edition of Artificial Intelligence  A Modern Approach            show this influence in almost every chapter                        Although the basic idea of using logical reasoning to decide on actions is due to John McCarthy             Nilsson s group was the first to embody it in a complete agent  along the way inventing the A  search algorithm            and founding the field of automated temporal planning                        In the latter pursuit  they invented the STRIPS planner             whose action representation is still the basis of many of today s planning algorithms  The subfield of automated temporal planning called classical planning is based on most of the assumptions built into STRIPS                       

Stanford University edit 
In       Nilsson became a faculty member at Stanford University  in the Computer Science Department             He was chair of the department from      to                  He was the Kumagai Professor of Engineering  from the foundation of the Chair in around                  until his retirement  and remained Kumagai Professor Emeritus until his death            
He was the fourth President of the AAAI           and a Founding Fellow of that organization             Nilsson wrote or coauthored several books on AI  including two that have been especially widely read Principles of Artificial Intelligence        and Logical Foundations of Artificial Intelligence                              

Awards and memberships edit 
In       Nilsson was inducted into IEEE Intelligent Systems  AI s Hall of Fame for the  significant contributions to the field of AI and intelligent systems       citation needed     

Personal life edit 
On July           Nilsson married Karen Braucht  with whom he had two children                        Braucht died in                  In      he married Grace Abbott  who had four children from a previous marriage
