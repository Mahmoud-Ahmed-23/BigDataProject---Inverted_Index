							The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  UNHCR  bureau in Cairo has responded to the death of an Oromo woman following a protest outside their office on Tuesday 
Although reports about the incident remain vague  two Oromo asylum seekers allegedly set themselves on fire in front of the UNHCR       s headquarters in  th October City  The incident reportedly took place as part of a protest led by Ethiopia s Oromo community that sought to demand the right to seek asylum with the UNHCR 
Tarik Argaz  a public information and communications officer at UNHCR  told Daily News Egypt         We are very saddened by the incident        
Three people were allegedly injured and transported for treatment  according to Argaz  It is not clear whether that number includes the woman who died as a result of her injuries  A source previously told Daily News Egypt that the woman who died had attempted to put out a fire on another protester when she caught fire 
Argaz debunked the Oromo people       s claims that their asylum demands were being ignored         The numbers of asylum seekers in Egypt are increasing         he said  noting that UNHCR does not deal with asylum seekers according to their origin         The decisions are based on legal criteria         he added 
He further claimed that the UNHCR recently granted asylum to a        fair number        of Oromo people 
       The decision to grant asylum cannot be altered by external pressure         Argaz concluded 
In a statement released on Wednesday  UNHCR attributed the Oromo woman       s death to a        violent        incident  without going into further details 
The statement also said   UNHCR is mindful of the frustrations and anxieties that asylum seekers and refugees may feel because of lengthy procedures  due to the high number of applicants in Egypt  As UNHCR is committed to ensure fair  consistent and transparent processes for asylum seekers and refugees of all nationalities  it calls for the cooperation by all refugee communities and appeals for their understanding and non violence  
This protest was part of continued attempts by members of the refugee community in Egypt to demand that the UNHCR recognise their communities  among other demands for fair treatment 
The Oromo people are an ethnic group primarily in Ethiopia  but also in other neighbouring countries  Although the group is considered the ethnic majority in Ethiopia  they are largely politically marginalised and forced to assimilate  which has led to many Oromo people choosing to flee Ethiopia and seek asylum elsewhere 
The Egyptian government signed a memorandum of understanding in      that makes the UNHCR solely responsible for registering and determining the status of refugees in the country 
According to the UNHCR s website  as of December      Egypt was host to over         refugees from around the region  predominantly from Syria  Sudan  Ethiopia  Eritrea  and Iraq
