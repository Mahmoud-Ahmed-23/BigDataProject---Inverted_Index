Egypt s Al Ahly is facing a dilemma after losing the final game of the African Confederation Cup against the Ivory Coast s Sewe Sport with   goals to    They must win as the rival succeeded in shaking the nets during the return game on Saturday in Cairo 
Al Ahly must make up for the loss and obtain the   th title to guarantee its place among the top teams in the world in terms of continental championships 
Al Ahly could not lead the game against its rival who qualified for the first time in its history for the major continental championship and secured its first win this season against the continent s  Team of the Century   The two teams have previously met twice before in the same championship  with the first game ending in a   all draw on the same field where Sewe Sport won five days ago  Al Ahly won the game on its own field with a clean penalty goal  which clearly shows how difficult it would be for the Egyptian team to win against the rival in the final round 
Sewe Sport s right front was stronger and better in the game s first half and achieved a penalty kick  creating an early advance against Al Ahly which almost made a winner  Attacking midfielder Walid Soliman wasted a great chance and kicked the ball on the goalkeeper Sylvain Gbohouo 
Sewe Sport made best use of its prominent player Roger Asally who is waiting to officially become part of the Mazembe team following the end of this season  Asally succeeded in causing tension for Al Ahly s nets when he took a penalty kick  and gave his team ample opportunities to score goals against Al Ahly 
Juan Carlos Garrido  Al Ahly s Spanish coach  waited until the start of the second half of the game to push Sherif Abdel Fadil and Ramadan Sobhy into the game  so that the former could take care of his team s left front defence  while the latter could attack  This would allow the team to score a goal and tie the game through Mahmoud Hassan  who scored his first ever African goal  Hassan almost made another a few minutes later  using side balls so that both the defence and the goalkeeper could not stop him 
Al Ahly lost one of the two final round matches for the championship five times  but succeeded in taking the title at the end of three championships and losing twice 
Al Ahly suffered a loss at the hands of Ghana in the second leg of the championship in      to lose the title after tying      Al Ahly also suffered a defeat on its territory in      at the hands of Tunisia s Al Sahely with a score of     following a negative tie 
Despite the absence of midfielder Mahmoud Trezeguet after receiving two yellow cards and many others missing out on participation  Al Ahly and its fans dream of adding another tournament title to their record  Even if the African Confederation Cup is not as important as other African championship  a win would grant the Al Ahly renewed hope to remain at the top of world football clubs
