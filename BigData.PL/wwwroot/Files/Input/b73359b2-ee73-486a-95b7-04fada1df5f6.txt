Generative grammar is a research tradition in linguistics that aims to explain the cognitive basis of language by formulating and testing explicit models of humans  subconscious grammatical knowledge  Generative linguists  or generativists    d  n r t v sts               tend to share certain working assumptions such as the competence       performance distinction and the notion that some domain specific aspects of grammar are partly innate in humans  These assumptions are rejected in non generative approaches such as usage based models of language  Generative linguistics includes work in core areas such as syntax  semantics  phonology  psycholinguistics  and language acquisition  with additional extensions to topics including biolinguistics and music cognition 
Generative grammar began in the late     s with the work of Noam Chomsky  having roots in earlier approaches such as structural linguistics  The earliest version of Chomsky s model was called Transformational grammar  with subsequent iterations known as Government and binding theory and the Minimalist program  Other present day generative models include Optimality theory  Categorial grammar  and Tree adjoining grammar 


Principles edit 
Generative grammar is an umbrella term for a variety of approaches to linguistics  What unites these approaches is the goal of uncovering the cognitive basis of language by formulating and testing explicit models of humans  subconscious grammatical knowledge                       

Cognitive science edit 
Generative grammar studies language as part of cognitive science  Thus  research in the generative tradition involves formulating and testing hypotheses about the mental processes that allow humans to use language                                  
Like other approaches in linguistics  generative grammar engages in linguistic description rather than linguistic prescription                       

Explicitness and generality edit 
Generative grammar proposes models of language consisting of explicit rule systems  which make testable falsifiable predictions  This is different from traditional grammar where grammatical patterns are often described more loosely                         These models are intended to be parsimonious  capturing generalizations in the data with as few rules as possible  For example  because English imperative tag questions obey the same restrictions that second person future declarative tags do  Paul Postal proposed that the two constructions are derived from the same underlying structure  By adopting this hypothesis  he was able to capture the restrictions on tags with a single rule  This kind of reasoning is commonplace in generative research            
Particular theories within generative grammar have been expressed using a variety of formal systems  many of which are modifications or extensions of context free grammars            

Competence versus performance edit 
Generative grammar generally distinguishes linguistic competence and linguistic performance              Competence is the collection of subconscious rules that one knows when one knows a language  performance is the system which puts these rules to use                          This distinction is related to the broader notion of Marr s levels used in other cognitive sciences  with competence corresponding to Marr s computational level             
For example  generative theories generally provide competence based explanations for why English speakers would judge the sentence in     as odd  In these explanations  the sentence would be ungrammatical because the rules of English only generate sentences where demonstratives agree with the grammatical number of their associated noun             

     That cats is eating the mouse 
By contrast  generative theories generally provide performance based explanations for the oddness of center embedding sentences like one in      According to such explanations  the grammar of English could in principle generate such sentences  but doing so in practice is so taxing on working memory that the sentence ends up being unparsable                         

     The cat that the dog that the man fed chased meowed 
In general  performance based explanations deliver a simpler theory of grammar at the cost of additional assumptions about memory and parsing  As a result  the choice between a competence based explanation and a performance based explanation for a given phenomenon is not always obvious and can require investigating whether the additional assumptions are supported by independent evidence                          For example  while many generative models of syntax explain island effects by positing constraints within the grammar  it has also been argued that some or all of these constraints are in fact the result of limitations on performance                         
Non generative approaches often do not posit any distinction between competence and performance  For instance  usage based models of language assume that grammatical patterns arise as the result of usage             

Innateness and universality edit 
A major goal of generative research is to figure out which aspects of linguistic competence are innate and which are not  Within generative grammar  it is generally accepted that at least some domain specific aspects are innate  and the term  universal grammar  is often used as a placeholder for whichever those turn out to be                         
The idea that at least some aspects are innate is motivated by poverty of the stimulus arguments                          For example  one famous poverty of the stimulus argument concerns the acquisition of yes no questions in English  This argument starts from the observation that children only make mistakes compatible with rules targeting hierarchical structure even though the examples which they encounter could have been generated by a simpler rule that targets linear order  In other words  children seem to ignore the possibility that the question rule is as simple as  switch the order of the first two words  and immediately jump to alternatives that rearrange constituents in tree structures  This is taken as evidence that children are born knowing that grammatical rules involve hierarchical structure  even though they have to figure out what those rules are                                      The empirical basis of poverty of the stimulus arguments has been challenged by Geoffrey Pullum and others  leading to back and forth debate in the language acquisition literature                          Recent work has also suggested that some recurrent neural network architectures are able to learn hierarchical structure without an explicit constraint             
Within generative grammar  there are a variety of theories about what universal grammar consists of  One notable hypothesis proposed by Hagit Borer holds that the fundamental syntactic operations are universal and that all variation arises from different feature specifications in the lexicon                          On the other hand  a strong hypothesis adopted in some variants of Optimality Theory holds that humans are born with a universal set of constraints  and that all variation arises from differences in how these constraints are ranked                          In a      paper  Noam Chomsky  Marc Hauser and W  Tecumseh Fitch proposed that universal grammar consists solely of the capacity for hierarchical phrase structure             
In day to day research  the notion that universal grammar exists motivates analyses in terms of general principles  As much as possible  facts about particular languages are derived from these general principles rather than from language specific stipulations             

Subfields edit 
Research in generative grammar spans a number of subfields  These subfields are also studied in non generative approaches 

Syntax edit 
Syntax studies the rule systems which combine smaller units such as morphemes into larger units such as phrases and sentences              Within generative syntax  prominent approaches include Minimalism  Government and binding theory  Lexical functional grammar  LFG   and Head driven phrase structure grammar  HPSG             

Phonology edit 
Phonology studies the rule systems which organize linguistic sounds  For example  research in phonology includes work on phonotactic rules which govern which phonemes can be combined  as well as those that determine the placement of stress  tone  and other suprasegmental elements              Within generative grammar  a prominent approach to phonology is Optimality Theory             

Semantics edit 
Semantics studies the rule systems that determine expressions  meanings  Within generative grammar  semantics is  a species of formal semantics  providing compositional models of how the denotations of sentences are computed on the basis of the meanings of the individual morphemes and their syntactic structure             

Extensions edit 
Music edit 
Generative grammar has been applied to music theory and analysis since the     s              One notable approach is Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff s Generative theory of tonal music  which formalized and extended ideas from Schenkerian analysis              

Biolinguistics edit 
Recent work in generative inspired biolinguistics has proposed that universal grammar consists solely of syntactic recursion  and that it arose recently in humans as the result of a random genetic mutation              Generative inspired biolinguistics has not uncovered any particular genes responsible for language  While some prospects were raised at the discovery of the FOXP  gene                          there is not enough support for the idea that it is  the grammar gene  or that it had much to do with the relatively recent emergence of syntactical speech             

History edit 
As a distinct research tradition  generative grammar began in the late     s with the work of Noam Chomsky              However  its roots include earlier structuralist approaches such as glossematics which themselves had older roots  for instance in the work of the ancient Indian grammarian P  ini                                      Military funding to generative research was an important factor in its early spread in the     s             
The initial version of generative syntax was called transformational grammar  In transformational grammar  rules called transformations mapped a level of representation called deep structures to another level of representation called surface structure  The semantic interpretation of a sentence was represented by its deep structure  while the surface structure provided its pronunciation  For example  an active sentence such as  The doctor examined the patient  and  The patient was examined by the doctor   had the same deep structure  The difference in surface structures arises from the application of the passivization transformation  which was assumed to not affect meaning  This assumption was challenged in the     s by the discovery of examples such as  Everyone in the room knows two languages  and  Two languages are known by everyone in the room       citation needed     
After the Linguistics wars of the late     s and early     s  Chomsky developed a revised model of syntax called Government and binding theory  which eventually grew into Minimalism  In the aftermath of those disputes  a variety of other generative models of syntax were proposed including relational grammar  Lexical functional grammar  LFG   and Head driven phrase structure grammar  HPSG       citation needed      
Generative phonology originally focused on rewrite rules  in a system commonly known as SPE Phonology after the      book The Sound Pattern of English by Chomsky and Morris Halle  In the     s  this approach was largely replaced by Optimality theory  which was able to capture generalizations called conspiracies which needed to be stipulated in SPE phonology             
Semantics emerged as a subfield of generative linguistics during the late     s  with the pioneering work of Richard Montague  Montague proposed a system called Montague grammar which consisted of interpretation rules mapping expressions from a bespoke model of syntax to formulas of intensional logic  Subsequent work by Barbara Partee  Irene Heim  Tanya Reinhart  and others showed that the key insights of Montague Grammar could be incorporated into more syntactically plausible systems
