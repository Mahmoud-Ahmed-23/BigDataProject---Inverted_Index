							Turkish Ambassador to Cairo  Salih Mutlu  en  stated that Turkish companies are actively seeking expansion and new investment opportunities in Egypt  particularly in the textile sector  alongside other industries  Daily News Egypt sat down with  en to discuss the prospects for cooperation between the two countries and explore potential areas of partnership 
 nbsp 
Will there be any economic or official visits from the Turkish side to Egypt in the coming period  And when 
As you know  in       we held three heads of state level visits between T rkiye and Egypt  President Erdo an visited Egypt bilaterally and on the occasion of the D   Summit in February and December  two times  And President Al Sisi visited on the fourth of September  Therefore  this year we can also expect ministerial level visits 
In fact  recently  the Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Emigration  Badr Abdelatty  was in T rkiye for a bilateral visit  It was a productive and important visit  Abdelatty was also received by President Erdo an  besides his bilateral talks with Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan  So  I would expect that His Excellency  the Foreign Minister of T rkiye  would be visiting Egypt this year  I think that visit will also serve as an occasion to prepare for the second meeting of the High Level Strategic Cooperation Council  headed by the two Presidents 
Additionally  the Egyptian Minister of Tourism and Antiquities was recently in T rkiye to receive     repatriated Egyptian artifacts  Therefore  I also expect contact visits between the two trade ministers of T rkiye and Egypt because  as I always say  the backbone of our relations is in trade and economy  There are many agenda items that should be discussed  and concrete steps should be taken  such as Ro Ro transportation between T rkiye and Egypt  The resumption of Ro Ro transportation is expected to give a significant boost to our trade and transportation  I also assume there might be several other ministerial visits 
No certain date is fixed at this moment  but they will happen  I believe all this will take place probably in autumn  but international developments might necessitate urgent visits or multilateral meetings that may also serve as occasions for official visits on both sides 
What is T rkiye       s position regarding the American stance and the issue of displacing Palestinians to Sinai  and will T rkiye support the Egyptian proposal for reconstruction that is being prepared 
T rkiye s position on displacing Palestinians from Gaza is clear  We reject any such initiative  In fact  we have been observing and opposing this from the very beginning of the conflict  Egypt has been steadfast and consistent in its position  The Palestinians of Gaza cannot be displaced or resettled anywhere neither in Sinai nor anywhere else  Gazans should stay in their home  on their territory  T rkiye s position is exactly the same as Egypt       s  It is critical that Gazans stay and live peacefully and securely in their homes  most of which have been demolished 
However  the international community  Arab and Islamic countries in particular  are ready and capable of rebuilding Gaza quickly  It does not have to take    or    years  We do not yet know the exact details of Egypt s reconstruction plan  but given its role as the most important country with multifaceted interests in Gaza       s political and humanitarian situation  I am confident Egypt s proposal will be very convincing and practical  I am completely convinced that whatever Egypt  the Arab League  and Islamic countries agree upon  based on the Egyptian initiative for rebuilding Gaza without displacing Gazans  would be a welcome development  I am sure T rkiye will support it 
Salih Mutlu  en
In fact  we are already actively engaged in humanitarian assistance  particularly in providing shelter for Gazans whose homes have been demolished  We are prepared to work closely with Egypt  including shipments of container homes  tents  and other urgently needed materials for sheltering the affected people 
We have both the political will and the capability to provide substantial support in the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip  However  no single country can undertake this effort alone  Cooperation and pooling of resources are necessary  T rkiye  Egypt  Saudi Arabia  Gulf countries  the United Nations  and the EU must work together to ensure the reconstruction process is completed as soon as possible  ideally within a few years 
What is new regarding T rkiye       s intention to establish a logistics zone in Egypt  When can the agreement be signed  and what is the size of the allocated investments 
We have signed two agreements  Our Turkish company  Polaris  has signed agreements regarding the establishment of industrial zones in Egypt  They already operate three industrial zones  and progress is advancing quickly on these new projects  One zone is in the  th of October City  I recently met with the CEO and managing director of Polaris  who updated me on recent developments  As far as I understand  land allocation for the project is ready for both the  th of October City and the New Administrative Capital 
I also know that Polaris has other new projects and is in discussions with the Egyptian government regarding additional industrial zones and further land allocations for investment  The total finalized area is five million square meters  which is expected to house       factories operating in various fields  This is particularly important for Turkish companies  especially in the textile sector 
Will we see new Turkish companies in Egypt in new economic sectors  When is this expected  and what are the most prominent sectors that Turkish companies are interested in 
Turkish companies are actively seeking expansion and new investment opportunities in Egypt  particularly in textiles but also in other sectors  There are so many initiatives at various stages some have opened  some have expanded  and others are in negotiations with Egyptian authorities  such as GAFI and the Ministry of Trade and Industry 
Many textile companies are not only expanding minimally but are doubling or tripling their capacities  adding new factories to their sites  The same applies to other Turkish industries  such as glass and home appliances  For example  BEKO has recently begun producing ovens and refrigerators in   th of Ramadan City  They are now working to increase their capacity by adding a third shift to operate at night  allowing them to maximize production 
What is the expected percentage of increase in trade volume between Egypt and T rkiye 
In       I estimate a minimum of     m in additional Turkish investment in Egypt  whether through new ventures or expansion  Trade volume is expected to increase by         In       bilateral trade was at     bn  with a healthy balance between exports and imports  We aim to reach a trade volume of    bn this year 
However  several steps must be taken to facilitate trade and investment  I see the Egyptian government taking concrete measures in this direction  which is promising 
What cultural and sports events are planned for the centennial of T rkiye Egypt diplomatic relations 
We have an exciting lineup of cultural and sporting events this year to celebrate     years of diplomatic ties  A highlight will be a soccer match between the U    national teams of T rkiye and Egypt  Additionally  on April     we will invite Egyptian children to Ankara for the annual World Children       s Festival 
We have already begun our celebrations with multiple performances by Fire of Anatolia at the Cairo Opera House  and they will soon perform in Sharm El Sheikh  We are also planning a spectacular Fire of Anatolia show near the Pyramids this summer  which I believe will be an unforgettable experience with strong local support 
Beyond these  we will host musical concerts  exhibitions  and other cultural initiatives to continue commemorating this important milestone in our shared history
