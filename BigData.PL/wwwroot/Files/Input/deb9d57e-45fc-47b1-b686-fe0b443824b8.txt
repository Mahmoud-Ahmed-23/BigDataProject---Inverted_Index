							Solar energy projects have proved their economic feasibility  The number of companies qualified by the New and Renewable Energy Authority  NREA  to implement small solar projects  with a maximum capacity of     kw each  reached     companies  but they complain about the lack of awareness of solar energy  financing programmes  and dependence on importation to secure the components of their plants 
Wael El Nashar  chairperson of Onera Systems  said his company will complete the construction of a solar power plant for South Sinai Water and Wastewater Company with a capacity of      MW within two months  The solar plant will be used to desalinate water in Sinai and will be financed through a grant from the United Nations Development Programme 
He explained that the company is negotiating the implementation of a number of solar energy projects with capacities ranging from     to     kw  The company has recently finished installing a solar power plant for the German School in Dokki that outputs     kw and was designed to look as an open book  
El Nashar stressed the need for providing financing programmes dedicated to individuals wishing to establish solar power plants  especially that such funds contribute to the establishment of factories to produce solar plant components locally  He explained that Onera agreed with leasing companies to finance establishing solar power stations for the benefit of customers with payment facilities and low interest 
He called for tougher controls on solar cell imports  as well as the state       s adoption of a plan to increase awareness of the importance of solar energy applications         Citizens should be confident in the idea of using solar energy         El Nashar said  
Meanwhile  Wael Madkour  head of Solamisr  said that the company aims to implement stations for the industrial sector of  MW next year  where the company is currently negotiating with two companies to install solar panels on their roofs  
He added that Solamisr has implemented    solar power plants with a total capacity of    MW  which includes    projects for the domestic sector  four stations in the administrative sector  and one project in the industrial sector  All of these projects are linked to the national electricity grid  
He added that the company installed solar panels in the headquarters of the Union National Bank         Egypt  where it put about       solar panels on the facade of the building  up to    floors  beside the installation of a solar plant at the top of the building  where the goal is not only to produce energy  but the use of solar panels instead of glass 
Madkour stressed the need to raise awareness among citizens to use solar energy in their buildings and factories and for the state to adopt initiatives to stimulate the use of solar energy  following the campaign for using LED lightning  
He called for testing the solar cells and systems that are being installed to ensure their efficiency and quality  stressing that the challenge during the coming period is the possibility of networks to absorb the capacity produced from solar energy 
Mostafa Abou El Goukh  chief executive of Solring  said his company went to sell solar systems in pickup trucks  which contribute to the provision of electricity to operate refrigerators and a full kitchen inside the car  The company recently sold an ice cream car with solar powered refrigerators 
He added that the company has sold seven mobile ice cream tricycles using solar power plants  The company is focused on installing solar panels for cars to operate kitchens  The cost of tricycles amounts to EGP                while for cars  it costs some EGP          
He pointed out that he received funding from Misr El Kheir Foundation worth EGP         at the beginning of his project  expecting that his sales will increase in the coming period in conjunction with the final lifting of subsidies on electricity prices  
He explained that Solring aims to sell    cars with an integrated solar powered kitchen next year  The company has obtained a licence from the NREA to install solar systems 
Ibrahim Hashim  director of Italian Med Group  said his company has implemented three solar projects in Kafr El Sheikh area with a capacity of   kW  They seek  in the coming period  to implement solar stations on top of residential buildings with capacities reaching up to     kW  in addition to obtaining a land in Aswan to construct a small solar power plant  
He explained that the main challenge facing solar energy projects is the lack of knowledge and awareness of its importance  in light of the high prices of electricity  and the provision of funding from banks at low interest  The total produced energy from small solar power plants installed on buildings reached      MW  including     stations installed on top of the Egyptian Electricity Holding Company and its subsidiaries buildings producing    MW  in addition to    stations producing     MW  and     stations operating on Net Metering scheme to generate    MW
