The Greek physician Hippocrates          BC   to whom the oath is traditionally attributed
The Hippocratic Oath is an oath of ethics historically taken by physicians  It is one of the most widely known of Greek medical texts  In its original form  it requires a new physician to swear  by a number of healing gods  to uphold specific ethical standards  The oath is the earliest expression of medical ethics in the Western world  establishing several principles of medical ethics which remain of paramount significance today  These include the principles of medical confidentiality and non maleficence  As the foundational articulation of certain principles that continue to guide and inform medical practice  the ancient text is of more than historic and symbolic value  It is enshrined in the legal statutes of various jurisdictions  such that violations of the oath may carry criminal or other liability beyond the oath s symbolic nature 
The original oath was written in Ionic Greek  between the fifth and third centuries BCE             Although it is traditionally attributed to the Greek doctor Hippocrates and it is usually included in the Hippocratic Corpus  some modern scholars do not regard it as having been written by Hippocrates himself

I swear by Apollo Healer  by Asclepius  by Hygieia  by Panacea  and by all the gods and goddesses  making them my witnesses  that I will carry out  according to my ability and judgment  this oath and this indenture 

To hold my teacher in this art equal to my own parents  to make him partner in my livelihood  when he is in need of money to share mine with him  to consider his family as my own brothers  and to teach them this art  if they want to learn it  without fee or indenture  to impart precept  oral instruction  and all other instruction to my own sons  the sons of my teacher  and to indentured pupils who have taken the Healer s oath  but to nobody else 

I will use those dietary regimens which will benefit my patients according to my greatest ability and judgment  and I will do no harm or injustice to them             Neither will I administer a poison to anybody when asked to do so  nor will I suggest such a course  Similarly I will not give to a woman a pessary to cause abortion  But I will keep pure and holy both my life and my art  I will not use the knife  not even  verily  on sufferers from stone  but I will give place to such as are craftsmen therein 

Into whatsoever houses I enter  I will enter to help the sick  and I will abstain from all intentional wrong doing and harm  especially from abusing the bodies of man or woman  bond or free  And whatsoever I shall see or hear in the course of my profession  as well as outside my profession in my intercourse with men  if it be what should not be published abroad  I will never divulge  holding such things to be holy secrets 

Now if I carry out this oath  and break it not  may I gain for ever reputation among all men for my life and for my art  but if I break it and forswear myself  may the opposite befall me

 First do no harm  edit 
Main article  Primum non nocere
It is often said that  First do no harm   Latin  Primum non nocere  is a part of the original Hippocratic oath  A related phrase is found in Epidemics  Book I  of the Hippocratic school   Practice two things in your dealings with disease  either help or do not harm the patient              Although no such phrase from which  First  or  Primum  can be translated appears in any well recognized version of the oath  a similar intention is vowed by   I will abstain from all intentional wrong doing and harm    Primum non nocere  was claimed by the   th century English surgeon Thomas Inman to date from the   th century English physician Thomas Sydenham             but Sydenham s available writings contain no such phrase or equivalent             and it more likely took shape from longstanding popular nonmedical expression             

Context and interpretation edit 
A   th century Greek manuscript of the oath
The oath is arguably the best known text of the Hippocratic Corpus  although most modern scholars do not attribute it to Hippocrates himself  estimating it to have been written in the fourth or fifth century BCE              Alternatively  classical scholar Ludwig Edelstein proposed that the oath was written by the Pythagoreans  an idea that others questioned for lack of evidence for a school of Pythagorean medicine              While Pythagorean philosophy displays a correlation to the Oath s values  the proposal of a direct relationship has been mostly discredited in more recent studies             
Its general ethical principles are also found in other works of the Corpus  the Physician mentions the obligation to keep the  holy things  of medicine within the medical community  i e  not to divulge secrets   it also mentions the special position of the doctor with regard to his patients  especially women and girls              However  several aspects of the oath contradict patterns of practice established elsewhere in the Corpus  Most notable is its ban on the use of the knife  even for small procedures such as lithotomy  even though other works in the Corpus provide guidance on performing surgical procedures             
Providing poisonous drugs would certainly have been viewed as immoral by contemporary physicians if it resulted in murder  However  the absolute ban described in the oath also forbids euthanasia  Several accounts of ancient physicians willingly assisting suicides have survived              Multiple explanations for the prohibition of euthanasia in the oath have been proposed  it is possible that not all physicians swore the oath  or that the oath was seeking to prevent widely held concerns that physicians could be employed as political assassins             
The interpreted the     CE fragment of the oath contains a prohibition of abortion that is in contradiction to original Hippocratic text On the Nature of the Child  which contains a description of an abortion  without any implication that it was morally wrong              and descriptions of abortifacient medications are numerous in the ancient medical literature              The oath s stance on abortion was unclear even in the ancient world where physicians debated whether the specification of pessaries was a ban on simply pessaries  or a blanket ban on all abortion methods              Scribonius Largus was adamant in AD     the earliest surviving reference to the oath  that it precluded abortion              In the  st or  nd century AD work Gynaecology  Soranus of Ephesus wrote that one party of medical practitioners followed the Oath and banished all abortifacients  while the other party to which he belonged was willing to prescribe abortions  but only for the sake of the mother s health                          William Henry Samuel Jones states that  abortion            though doctors are forbidden to cause it  was possibly not condemned in all cases   He believed that the oath prohibited abortions  though not under all circumstances              John M  Riddle argues that because Hippocrates specified pessaries  he only meant pessaries and therefore it was acceptable for a Hippocratic doctor to perform abortions using oral drugs  violent means  a disruption of daily routine or eating habits  and more  Other scholars  most notably Ludwig Edelstein  believe that the author intended to prohibit any and all abortions              Olivia De Brabandere writes that regardless of the author s original intention  the vague and polyvalent nature of the relevant line has allowed both professionals and non professionals to interpret and use the oath in several ways              While many Christian versions of the Hippocratic Oath  particularly from the Middle Ages  explicitly prohibited abortion  the prohibition is often omitted from many oaths taken in US medical schools today  though it remains controversial             
The oath stands out among comparable ancient texts on medical ethics and professionalism through its heavily religious tone  a factor which makes attributing its authorship to Hippocrates particularly difficult  Phrases such as  but I will keep pure and holy both my life and my art  suggest a deep  almost monastic devotion to the art of medicine  He who keeps to the oath is promised  reputation among all men for my life and for my art   This contrasts heavily with Galenic writings on professional ethics  which employ a far more pragmatic approach  where good practice is defined as effective practice  without reference to deities             
The oath s importance among the medical community is nonetheless attested by its appearance on the tombstones of physicians  and by the fourth century AD it had come to stand for the medical profession             
The oath continued to be in use in the Byzantine Christian world with its references to pagan deities replaced by a Christian preamble  as in the   th century manuscript pictured in the shape of a cross             

Modern versions and relevance edit 
An engraving of Hippocrates by Peter Paul Rubens      
The Hippocratic Oath has been eclipsed as a document of professional ethics by more extensive  regularly updated ethical codes issued by national medical associations  such as the American Medical Association s Code of Medical Ethics  first adopted in        and the British General Medical Council s Good Medical Practice  These documents provide a comprehensive overview of the obligations and professional behaviour of a doctor to their patients and wider society  Doctors who violate these codes may be subjected to disciplinary proceedings  including the loss of their license to practice medicine  Nonetheless  the length of these documents has made their distillations into shorter oaths an attractive proposition  In light of this fact  several updates to the oath have been offered in modern times                          some facetious             
The oath has been modified numerous times 
One of the most significant revisions was first drafted in      by the World Medical Association  WMA   called the Declaration of Geneva   During the post World War II and immediately after its foundation  the WMA showed concern over the state of medical ethics in general and over the world  The WMA took up the responsibility for setting ethical guidelines for the world s physicians  It noted that in those years the custom of medical schools to administer an oath to its doctors upon graduation or receiving a license to practice medicine had fallen into disuse or become a mere formality               In Nazi Germany  medical students did not take the Hippocratic Oath  although they knew the ethic of  nil nocere  do no harm                  failed verification     
In the     s  the Hippocratic Oath was changed to require  utmost respect for human life from its beginning   making it a more secular obligation  not to be taken in the presence of any gods  but before only other people  When the oath was rewritten in      by Louis Lasagna  Academic Dean of the School of Medicine at Tufts University  the prayer was omitted  and that version has been widely accepted and is still in use today by many US medical schools             

 I swear to fulfill  to the best of my ability and judgment  this covenant 
I will respect the hard won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk  and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow 
I will apply  for the benefit of the sick  all measures  that  are required  avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism 
I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science  and that warmth  sympathy  and understanding may outweigh the surgeon s knife or the chemist s drug 
I will not be ashamed to say  I know not   nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for a patient s recovery 
I will respect the privacy of my patients  for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know  Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death  If it is given me to save a life  all thanks  But it may also be within my power to take a life  this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty  Above all  I must not play at God 
I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart  a cancerous growth  but a sick human being  whose illness may affect the person s family and economic stability  My responsibility includes these related problems  if I am to care adequately for the sick 
I will prevent disease whenever I can  for prevention is preferable to cure 
I will remember that I remain a member of society  with special obligations to all my fellow human beings  those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm 

If I do not violate this oath  may I enjoy life and art  respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter  May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help 
In a      survey of     US medical schools  only three of them reported use of the original oath  while thirty three used the Declaration of Geneva  sixty seven used a modified Hippocratic Oath  four used the Oath of Maimonides  one used a covenant  eight used another oath  one used an unknown oath  and two did not use any kind of oath  Seven medical schools did not reply to the survey             
As of       only     of medical oaths prohibited euthanasia  and only    prohibited abortion             
In a      survey of US medical schools  all of the then extant medical schools administered some type of professional oath  Among schools of modern medicine  sixty two of     used the Hippocratic Oath  or a modified version of it  The other sixty schools used the original or modified Declaration of Geneva  Oath of Maimonides  or an oath authored by students or faculty or both  All nineteen osteopathic schools in the United States used the Osteopathic Oath              which is taken in place of or in addition to the Hippocratic Oath  The Osteopathic Oath was first used in       and the current version has been in use since                  
In France  it is common for new medical graduates to sign a written oath                         
In       Sir Joseph Rotblat  in his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize  suggested a Hippocratic Oath for Scientists             
In November       Saparmurat Niyazov  then leader of Turkmenistan  declared that doctors should swear an oath to him instead of the Hippocratic Oath             
In       US citizen Rafiq Abdus Sabir was convicted for making a pledge to al Qaeda  thus agreeing to provide medical aid to wounded terrorists             
As of       all US medical school graduates made some form of public oath but none used the original Hippocratic Oath   A modified form or an oath unique to that school is often used  A review of    of these oaths was criticized for their wide variability   Consistency would help society see that physicians are members of a profession that s committed to a shared set of essential ethical values              

Violations edit 
There is no direct punishment for breaking the Hippocratic Oath  although an arguable equivalent in modern times is medical malpractice  which carries a wide range of punishments  from imprisonment to civil penalties              Medical professionals may also be subject to other parts of the criminal and civil law for conduct contrary to both an oath taken and to a more general prohibition on  for example  doing physical or other harm to other persons  In the United States  several major judicial decisions have made reference to the classical Hippocratic Oath  either upholding or dismissing its bounds for medical ethics  Roe v  Wade  Washington v  Harper  Compassion in Dying v  State of Washington         and Thorburn v  Department of Corrections                     In antiquity  the punishment for breaking the Hippocratic oath could range from a penalty to losing the right to practice medicine             
In       at a college in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu  medical students took the Charaka shapath  a Sanskrit oath attributed to ancient sage and physician Maharishi Charak instead of the Hippocratic oath  The state government subsequently dismissed the Dean of the Madurai medical college for this act                                      However  he was reinstated by the Tamil Nadu government and assumed office   days later
