							Pakistan Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif stated that Pakistan is giving a        befitting reply        after India said it carried out        precision strikes        on what it described as        terrorist infrastructure        at nine sites in Pakistan  Sharif characterised the Indian action as a        cowardly attack        and an        act of war         while Pakistan       s Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemned the strikes as        blatant aggression        and alleged civilian casualties 
       The cunning enemy has carried out a cowardly attack on five places in Pakistan         Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif said in a statement         Pakistan has every right to give a befitting reply to this act of war imposed by India and a befitting reply is being given        
Sharif added         The entire nation is with the Pakistani Armed Forces and the morale and spirit of the entire Pakistani nation is high  The Pakistani nation and the Pakistani Armed Forces know how to deal with the enemy very well  The enemy will never be allowed to succeed in his nefarious objectives        
India said its strikes  which took place early on Wednesday morning local time  were        focused  measured and non escalatory in nature         Tensions between the two nuclear armed neighbours have been escalating since last month when New Delhi blamed Islamabad for an attack by militants in Indian administered Kashmir that killed    people  Pakistan has previously denied any involvement in that attack 
While India s defence ministry did not specify the locations of the strikes in Pakistan  it said it was  hitting terrorist infrastructure   The ministry added that  no Pakistani military facilities have been targeted   saying  India has demonstrated considerable restraint in selection of targets and method of execution  
In a separate press release issued on Wednesday    May       Pakistan       s Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated         In an unprovoked and blatant act of war  the Indian Air Force  while remaining within Indian airspace  has violated Pakistan s sovereignty using standoff weapons  targeting civilian population across international border in Muridke and Bahawalpur  and across Line of Control in Kotli and Muzaffarabad  Azad Jammu and Kashmir         The ministry further stated         India s act of aggression has resulted in martyrdom of civilians  including women and children  This act of aggression has also caused grave threat to commercial air traffic        
       We strongly condemn India s cowardly action  which is a flagrant violation of the UN Charter  international law  and established norms of inter state relations         the Foreign Ministry       s statement continued         In the wake of Pahalgam attack  the Indian leadership has once again used the bogey of terrorism to advance its sham narrative of victimhood  jeopardizing regional peace and security  India s reckless action has brought the two nuclear armed states closer to a major conflict        
The ministry asserted that        Pakistan reserves the right to respond appropriately at a time and place of its choosing  in accordance with the Article    of the UN Charter  and as enshrined in international law         It added         The government  armed forces and people of Pakistan stand united in the face of Indian aggression  They will always act with iron resolve to protect and preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan        
Since the killings in Kashmir last month  the two countries have downgraded diplomatic relations  and India has suspended participation in a key water sharing treaty
