Taiwan      II          i      officially the Republic of China  ROC       I      is a country             in East Asia      l      The main island of Taiwan  also known as Formosa  lies between the East and South China Seas in the northwestern Pacific Ocean  with the People s Republic of China  PRC  to the northwest  Japan to the northeast  and the Philippines to the south  It has an area of        square kilometres         square miles   with mountain ranges dominating the eastern two thirds and plains in the western third  where its highly urbanized population is concentrated  The combined territories under ROC control consist of     islands     m      in total covering        square kilometres         square miles                           The largest metropolitan area is formed by Taipei  the capital   New Taipei City  and Keelung  With around      million inhabitants  Taiwan is among the most densely populated countries 
Taiwan has been settled for at least        years  Ancestors of Taiwanese indigenous peoples settled the island around       years ago  In the   th century  large scale Han Chinese immigration began under Dutch colonial rule and continued under the Kingdom of Tungning  the first predominantly Han Chinese state in Taiwanese history  The island was annexed in      by the Qing dynasty of China and ceded to the Empire of Japan in       The Republic of China  which had overthrown the Qing in      under the leadership of Sun Yat sen  took control following the surrender of Japan in World War II  The immediate resumption of the Chinese Civil War resulted in the loss of the Chinese mainland to Communist forces  who established the People s Republic of China  and the flight of the ROC central government to Taiwan in       The effective jurisdiction of the ROC has since been limited to Taiwan  Penghu  and smaller islands 
From the early     s  Taiwan saw rapid economic growth and industrialization known as the  Taiwan Miracle               In the late     s and early     s  the ROC transitioned from a one party state under martial law to a multi party democracy  with democratically elected presidents beginning in       Taiwan s export oriented economy is the   st largest in the world by nominal GDP and the   th largest by PPP measures  with a focus on steel  machinery  electronics  and chemicals manufacturing  Taiwan is a developed country                          It is ranked highly in terms of civil liberties              healthcare              and human development      h                 
The political status of Taiwan is contentious              Despite being a founding member  the ROC no longer represents China as a member of the United Nations after UN members voted in      to recognize the PRC instead              The ROC maintained its claim to be the sole legitimate representative of China and its territory until       when it ceased to regard the Chinese Communist Party as a rebellious group and acknowledged its control over mainland China              Taiwan is claimed by the PRC  which refuses to establish diplomatic relations with countries that recognise the ROC  Taiwan maintains official diplomatic relations with    out of     UN member states and the Holy See              Many others maintain unofficial diplomatic ties through representative offices and institutions that function as de facto embassies and consulates  International organizations in which the PRC participates either refuse to grant membership to Taiwan or allow it to participate on a non state basis  Domestically  the major political contention is between the Pan Blue Coalition  who favors eventual Chinese unification under the ROC and promoting a pan Chinese identity  contrasted with the Pan Green Coalition  which favors eventual Taiwanese independence and promoting a Taiwanese identity  in the   st century  both sides have moderated their positions to broaden their appeal                         


Etymology
Names for the island
In his Daoyi Zhil e         Wang Dayuan used  Liuqiu  as a name for the island  or the part of it closest to Penghu              Elsewhere  the name was used for the Ryukyu Islands in general or Okinawa specifically  the name Ry ky  is the Japanese form of Li qi   The name also appears in the Book of Sui       and other early works  but scholars cannot agree on whether these references are to the Ryukyus  Taiwan or even Luzon             
The name Formosa        dates from       when Portuguese sailors noted it on their maps as Ilha Formosa  Portuguese for  beautiful island                            The name Formosa eventually  replaced all others in European literature              and remained in common use among English speakers into the   th century             
In       a Chinese expedition fleet anchored at a place in Taiwan called Dayuan  a variant of  Taiwan                                       In the early   th century  the Dutch East India Company established a commercial post at Fort Zeelandia  modern day Anping  on a coastal sandbar called  Tayouan               after their ethnonym for a nearby Taiwanese aboriginal tribe  possibly Taivoan people             
Use of the current Chinese name           became official as early as      during the Qing dynasty with the establishment of Taiwan Prefecture centered in modern day Tainan  Through its rapid development the entire Taiwanese mainland eventually became known as  Taiwan

The official name of the country in English is the  Republic of China   Shortly after the ROC s establishment in       while it was still located on the Chinese mainland  the government used the short form  China   Zh nggu       to refer to itself  derived from zh ng   central  or  middle   and gu    state  nation state        n      The term developed under the Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne      o      and was then applied to the area around Luoyi  present day Luoyang  during the Eastern Zhou and later to China s Central Plain  before being used as an occasional synonym for the state during the Qing era              The name of the republic had stemmed from the party manifesto of the Tongmenghui in       which says the four goals of the Chinese revolution was  to expel the Manchu rulers  to revive Chunghwa  to establish a Republic  and to distribute land equally among the people       III      Revolutionary leader Sun Yat sen proposed the name Chunghwa Minkuo as the assumed name of the new country when the revolution succeeded 
During the     s and     s  after the ROC government had withdrawn to Taiwan  it was commonly referred to as  Nationalist China   or  Free China   to differentiate it from  communist China   or  Red China                Over subsequent decades  the Republic of China has become commonly known as  Taiwan   after the main island  To avoid confusion  the ROC government in Taiwan began to put  Taiwan  next to its official name in                   In ROC government publications  the name is written as  Republic of China  Taiwan     Republic of China Taiwan   or sometimes  Taiwan  ROC                                       
 Taiwan Area  was defined to mean the island of Taiwan  Penghu  Kinmen  Matsu  and other territory under ROC s effective control              in contrast to  Mainland Area  which refers to ROC territory outside the Taiwan Area and under Chinese Communist control             
The Republic of China participates in most international forums and organizations under the name  Chinese Taipei  as a compromise with the People s Republic of China  PRC   For instance  it is the name under which it has participated in the Olympic Games as well as the APEC               Taiwan authorities  is sometimes used by the PRC to refer to the government in Taiwan

Taiwan was joined to the Asian mainland in the Late Pleistocene  until sea levels rose about        years ago              Human remains and Paleolithic artifacts dated        to        years ago have been found                          Study of the human remains suggested they were Australo Papuan people similar to Negrito populations in the Philippines              Paleolithic Taiwanese likely settled the Ryukyu Islands        years ago              Slash and burn agriculture practices started at least        years ago             
Stone tools of the Changbin culture have been found in Taitung and Eluanbi  Archaeological remains suggest they were initially hunter gatherers that slowly shifted to intensive fishing                          The distinct Wangxing culture  found in Miaoli County  were initially gatherers who shifted to hunting             
Around       years ago  Taiwan was settled by farmers of the Dapenkeng culture  most likely from what is now southeast China              These cultures are the ancestors of modern Taiwanese Indigenous peoples and the originators of the Austronesian language family                          Trade with the Philippines persisted from the early  nd millennium BCE  including the use of Taiwanese jade in the Philippine jade culture                         
The Dapenkeng culture was succeeded by a variety of cultures throughout the island  including the Tahu and Yingpu  the Yuanshan were characterized by rice harvesting  Iron appeared in such cultures as the Niaosung culture  influenced by trade with China and Maritime Southeast Asia                          The Plains Indigenous peoples mainly lived in permanent walled villages  with a lifestyle based on agriculture  fishing  and hunting              They had traditionally matriarchal societies

In       Japan sent envoys to deliver a letter requesting tribute relations with Taiwan  They found no leader to deliver the letter to and returned home  In       a Japanese expedition was sent to survey Taiwan  After being attacked by the Indigenous people  they took some prisoners and returned home  In       a Japanese fleet of    ships were sent to Taiwan  Due to a storm  only one ship made it there and is presumed to have returned to Japan

In       the Dutch East India Company  VOC  established Fort Zeelandia on the coastal islet of Tayouan  in modern Tainan                            The lowland areas were occupied by    Indigenous chiefdoms  some of which fell under Dutch control  including the Kingdom of Middag                           When the Dutch arrived  southwestern Taiwan was already frequented by a mostly transient Chinese population numbering close to                     The VOC encouraged Chinese farmers to immigrate and work the lands under Dutch control and by the     s  some        to        Chinese were living on the island                            Most of the farmers cultivated rice for local consumption and sugar for export while some immigrants engaged in deer hunting for export                                        
In       the Spanish Empire occupied northern Taiwan as a trading base  first at Keelung and in      building Fort Santo Domingo at Tamsui                            This colony lasted until       when the last Spanish fortress fell to Dutch forces               The Dutch then marched south  subduing hundreds of villages in the western plains

Following the fall of the Ming dynasty in Beijing in       Koxinga  Zheng Chenggong  pledged allegiance to the Yongli Emperor and attacked the Qing dynasty along the southeastern coast of China               In       under increasing Qing pressure  he moved his forces from his base in Xiamen to Taiwan  expelling the Dutch the following year  The Dutch retook the northern fortress at Keelung in       but left the island in      in the face of indigenous resistance                           
The Zheng regime  known as the Kingdom of Tungning  proclaimed its loyalty to the overthrown Ming  but ruled independently                                                      However  Zheng Jing s return to China to participate in the Revolt of the Three Feudatories paved the way for the Qing invasion and occupation of Taiwan in

Following the defeat of Koxinga s grandson by an armada led by Admiral Shi Lang in       the Qing dynasty formally annexed Taiwan in May       making it a prefecture of Fujian province while retaining its administrative seat  now Tainan  under Koxinga as the capital                                        
The Qing government generally tried to restrict migration to Taiwan throughout the duration of its administration because it believed that Taiwan could not sustain too large a population without leading to conflict  After the defeat of the Kingdom of Tungning  most of its population in Taiwan was sent back to the mainland  leaving the official population count at only         including        troops  Despite official restrictions  officials in Taiwan solicited settlers from the mainland  causing tens of thousands of annual arrivals by       A permit system was officially recorded in       but it likely existed as early as       its restrictions included only allowing those to enter who had property on the mainland  family in Taiwan  and who were not accompanied by wives or children  Many of the male migrants married local Indigenous women  Over the   th century  restrictions were relaxed  In       families were allowed to move to Taiwan                            By       there were more than two million Han settlers in Taiwan  and profitable sugar and rice production industries provided exports to the mainland                                         In       restrictions on entering Taiwan were repealed

Three counties nominally covered the entire western plains  but actual control was restricted to a smaller area  A government permit was required for settlers to go beyond the Dajia River  Qing administration expanded across the western plains area over the   th century due to continued illegal crossings and settlement               The Taiwanese Indigenous peoples were categorized by the Qing administration into acculturated aborigines who had adopted Han culture and non acculturated aborigines who had not  The Qing did little to administer or subjugate them  When Taiwan was annexed  there were    aboriginal villages under its control  likely inherited from the Kingdom of Tungning  During the early Qianlong period there were    acculturated villages and    non acculturated villages that paid taxes  In response to the Zhu Yigui settler rebellion in       separation of aboriginals and settlers became official policy via    stelae used to mark the frontier boundary  The markings were changed four times over the latter half of the   th century due to continued settler encroachment  Two aboriginal affairs sub prefects  one for the north and one for the south  were appointed in                   
During the     years of Qing rule in Taiwan  the Plains Indigenous peoples rarely rebelled against the government and the mountain Indigenous peoples were left to their own devices until the last    years of Qing rule  Most of the more than     rebellions during the Qing period  such as the Lin Shuangwen rebellion  were caused by Han settlers                            Their frequency was evoked by the common saying  every three years an uprising  every five years a rebellion               primarily in reference to the period between      and                                             
Many officials stationed in Taiwan called for an active colonization policy over the   th century  In       Taiwan Prefect Yang Tingli supported the efforts of a settler named Wu Sha to claim land held by the Kavalan people  In       Wu Sha was able to recruit settlers with financial support from the local government but was unable to officially register the land  In the early     s  local officials convinced the emperor to officially incorporate the area by playing up the issue of piracy if the land was left alone               In       some settlers attempted to colonize central Taiwan by fabricating rights to lease aboriginal land  They were evicted by government troops two years later  Local officials continued to advocate for the colonization of the area but were ignored              

Taipei North Gate  constructed in       was part of the Walls of Taipei 
The Qing took on a more active colonization policy after      when Japan invaded Indigenous territory in southern Taiwan and the Qing government was forced to pay an indemnity for them to leave               The administration of Taiwan was expanded with new prefectures  sub prefectures  and counties  Mountain roads were constructed to make inner Taiwan more accessible  Restrictions on entering Taiwan were ended in      and agencies for recruiting settlers were established on the mainland  but efforts to promote settlement ended soon after               In       Keelung in northern Taiwan was occupied during the Sino French War but the French forces failed to advance any further inland while their victory at Penghu in      resulted in disease and retreat soon afterward as the war ended  Colonization efforts were renewed under Liu Mingchuan  In       Taiwan s status was upgraded to a province  Taipei became the permanent capital in       Liu s efforts to increase revenues on Taiwan s produce were hampered by foreign pressure not to increase levies  A land reform was implemented  increasing revenue which still fell short of expectation                                         Modern technologies such as electric lighting  a railway  telegraph lines  steamship service  and industrial machinery were introduced under Liu s governance  but several of these projects had mixed results  A campaign to formally subjugate the Indigenous peoples ended with the loss of a third of the army after fierce resistance from the Mkgogan and Msbtunux peoples  Liu resigned in      due to criticism of these costly projects                                                     
By the end of the Qing period  the western plains were fully developed as farmland with about     million Chinese settlers  The mountainous areas were still largely autonomous under the control of Indigenous peoples  Indigenous land loss under the Qing occurred at a relatively slow pace due to the absence of state sponsored land deprivation for the majority of Qing rule

Following the Qing defeat in the First Sino Japanese War              Taiwan  its associated islands  and the Penghu archipelago were ceded to Japan by the Treaty of Shimonoseki               Inhabitants wishing to remain Qing subjects had to move to mainland China within a two year grace period  which few saw as feasible               Estimates say around       to       departed before the expiration of the grace period  and         to         followed during the subsequent disorder                                         On    May       a group of pro Qing high officials proclaimed the Republic of Formosa to resist impending Japanese rule  Japanese forces entered the capital at Tainan and quelled this resistance on    October                    About       inhabitants died in the initial fighting and some        died in the first year of Japanese rule  Another         bandit rebels  were killed from      to                                              Subsequent rebellions against the Japanese  the Beipu uprising of       the Tapani incident of       and the Musha incident of       were unsuccessful but demonstrated opposition to Japanese rule

The colonial period was instrumental to the industrialization of the island  with its expansion of railways and other transport networks  the building of an extensive sanitation system  the establishment of a formal education system  and an end to the practice of headhunting                            The resources of Taiwan were used to aid the development of Japan  The production of cash crops such as sugar greatly increased  and large areas were therefore diverted from the production of rice               By       Taiwan was the seventh greatest sugar producer in the world              
The Han and Indigenous populations were classified as second  and third class citizens  and many prestigious government and business positions were closed to them               After suppressing Han guerrillas in the first decade of their rule  Japanese authorities engaged in bloody campaigns against the Indigenous people residing in mountainous regions  culminating in the Musha Incident of                    Intellectuals and laborers who participated in left wing movements were also arrested and massacred  e g  Chiang Wei shui and Masanosuke Watanabe                Around       the Japanese began an island wide assimilation project               Chinese language newspapers and curriculums were abolished  Taiwanese music and theater were outlawed  A national Shinto religion was promoted in parallel with the suppression of traditional Taiwanese beliefs  Starting from       families were also required to adopt Japanese surnames  although only    had done so by                    By               Japanese were residing in Taiwan

The Nationalists  retreat to Taipei
After the end of World War II  the Chinese Civil War resumed  A series of Chinese Communist offensives in      led to the capture of its capital Nanjing on    April and the subsequent defeat of the Nationalists on the mainland  The Communists founded the People s Republic of China on   October               On   December       Chiang Kai Shek evacuated his Nationalist government to Taiwan and made Taipei the temporary capital of the ROC               Some   million people  mainly soldiers  members of the ruling Kuomintang and intellectual and business elites  were evacuated to Taiwan  adding to the earlier population of approximately six million  These people and their descendants became known in Taiwan as  waisheng ren         The ROC government took to Taipei many national treasures and much of China s gold and foreign currency reserves                                         Most of the gold was used to pay soldiers  salaries               with some used to issue the New Taiwan dollar  part of a price stabilization program to slow inflation in Taiwan

Following the eruption of the Korean War  US President Harry S  Truman dispatched the United States Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait to prevent hostilities between the ROC and the PRC               The United States also passed the Sino American Mutual Defense Treaty and the Formosa Resolution of       granting substantial foreign aid to the KMT regime between      and                    The US foreign aid stabilized prices in Taiwan by                    The KMT government instituted many laws and land reforms that it had never effectively enacted on mainland China               Economic development was encouraged by American aid and programs such as the Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction  which turned the agricultural sector into the basis for later growth  Under the combined stimulus of the land reform and the agricultural development programs  agricultural production increased at an average annual rate of   percent from      to                    The government also implemented a policy of import substitution industrialization  attempting to produce imported goods domestically               The policy promoted the development of textile  food  and other labor intensive industries              
As the Chinese Civil War continued  the government built up military fortifications throughout Taiwan  Veterans built the Central Cross Island Highway through the Taroko Gorge in the     s  During the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in       Nike Hercules missiles were added to the formation of missile batteries throughout the island

During the     s and     s  the ROC maintained an authoritarian  single party government under the Kuomintang s Dang Guo system while its economy became industrialized and technology oriented               This rapid economic growth  known as the Taiwan Miracle  occurred following a strategy of prioritizing agriculture  light industries  and heavy industries  in that order               Export oriented industrialization was achieved by tax rebate for exports  removal of import restriction  moving from multiple exchange rate to single exchange rate system  and depreciation of the New Taiwan dollar               Infrastructure projects such as the Sun Yat sen Freeway  Taoyuan International Airport  Taichung Harbor  and Jinshan Nuclear Power Plant were launched  while the rise of steel  petrochemical  and shipbuilding industries in southern Taiwan saw the transformation of Kaohsiung into a special municipality on par with Taipei               In the     s  Taiwan became the second fastest growing economy in Asia               Real growth in GDP averaged over    percent               In       the combination of tax incentives and a cheap  well trained labor force attracted investments of over      billion from overseas Chinese  the United States  and Japan               By       foreign trade reached     billion per year and generated a surplus of       million               Along with Hong Kong  Singapore  and South Korea  Taiwan became known as one of the Four Asian Tigers 
Because of the Cold War  most Western nations and the United Nations regarded the ROC as the sole legitimate government of China until the     s  Eventually  especially after Taiwan s expulsion from the United Nations  most nations switched diplomatic recognition to the PRC  Until the     s  the ROC government was regarded by Western critics as undemocratic for upholding martial law  severely repressing any political opposition  and controlling the media  The KMT did not allow the creation of new parties and competitive democratic elections did not exist                                                                  
From the late     s to the     s  Taiwan underwent political and social reforms that transformed it into a democracy                            Chiang Ching kuo  Chiang Kai shek s son  served as premier from      and rose to the presidency in       He sought to move more authority to  bensheng ren   residents of Taiwan before Japan s surrender and their descendants                Pro democracy activists Tangwai emerged as the opposition  In       the Kaohsiung Incident took place in Kaohsiung on Human Rights Day  Although the protest was rapidly crushed by the authorities  it is considered as the main event that united Taiwan s opposition              
In       Chiang Ching kuo selected Lee Teng hui as his vice president  After the Democratic Progressive Party  DPP  was  illegally  founded as the first opposition party in Taiwan to counter the KMT in       Chiang announced that he would allow the formation of new parties               On    July       Chiang lifted martial law on the main island of Taiwan

After Chiang Ching kuo s death in       Lee Teng hui became the first president of the ROC born in Taiwan               Lee s administration oversaw a period of democratization in which the Temporary Provisions against the Communist Rebellion were abolished and the Additional Articles of the Constitution were introduced                            Congressional representation was allocated to only the Taiwan Area               and Taiwan underwent a process of localization in which Taiwanese culture and history were promoted over a pan China viewpoint              while assimilationist policies were replaced with support for multiculturalism               In       Lee was re elected in the first direct presidential election               During Lee s administration  both he and his party were involved in corruption controversies that came to be known as  black gold  politics                                        
Chen Shui bian of the DPP was elected as the first non KMT president in                    However  Chen lacked legislative majority  The opposition KMT developed the Pan Blue Coalition with other parties  mustering a slim majority over the DPP led Pan Green Coalition               Polarized politics emerged in Taiwan with the Pan Blue preference for eventual Chinese unification  while the Pan Green prefers Taiwanese independence 
Chen s reference to  One Country on Each Side  of the Taiwan Strait undercut cross Strait relations in                    He pushed for the first national referendum on cross Strait relations                            and called for an end to the National Unification Council               State run companies began dropping  China  references in their names and including  Taiwan                In       referendums asked whether Taiwan should join the UN               This act alienated moderate constituents who supported the status quo  as well as those with cross strait economic ties  It also created tension with the mainland and disagreements with the United States               Chen s administration was also dogged by public concerns over reduced economic growth  legislative gridlock  and corruption investigations                                        

Students occupied the Legislative Yuan in protest against a controversial trade agreement with China in March      
The KMT s nominee Ma Ying jeou won the      presidential election on a platform of increased economic growth and better ties with the PRC under a policy of  mutual non denial                Under Ma  Taiwan and China opened up direct flights and cargo shipments               The PRC government even made the atypical decision to not demand that Taiwan be barred from the annual World Health Assembly               Ma also made an official apology for the White Terror                            However  closer economic ties with China raised concerns about its political consequences                            In       university students occupied the Legislative Yuan and prevented the ratification of the Cross Strait Service Trade Agreement in what became known as the Sunflower Student Movement  The movement gave rise to youth based third parties such as the New Power Party  and is viewed to have contributed to the DPP s victories in the      presidential and legislative elections               the latter of which resulted in the first DPP legislative majority in Taiwanese history              
In January       William Lai Ching te of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party won Taiwan s presidential elections               However  no party won a majority in the simultaneous Taiwan s legislative election for the first time since       meaning    seats for the Democratic Progressive Party  DPP      seats for the Kuomintang  KMT   and the Taiwan People s Party  TPP  secured eight seats

Mount Dabajian was selected as one of the     Peaks of Taiwan 
The island of Taiwan lies in a complex tectonic area between the Yangtze Plate to the west and north  the Okinawa Plate on the north east  and the Philippine Mobile Belt on the east and south  The upper part of the crust on the island is primarily made up of a series of terranes  mostly old island arcs which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the Eurasian Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate  These have been further uplifted as a result of the detachment of a portion of the Eurasian Plate as it was subducted beneath remnants of the Philippine Sea Plate  a process which left the crust under Taiwan more buoyant              
The east and south of Taiwan are a complex system of belts formed by  and part of the zone of  active collision between the North Luzon Trough portion of the Luzon Volcanic Arc and South China  where accreted portions of the Luzon Arc and Luzon forearc form the eastern Coastal Range and parallel inland Longitudinal Valley of Taiwan  respectively              
The major seismic faults in Taiwan correspond to the various suture zones between the various terranes  These have produced major quakes  On    September       a     quake known as the      earthquake  killed more than       people  The seismic hazard map for Taiwan by the USGS shows      of the island at the most hazardous rating

Cho Jung tai  Premier of the Republic of China
The premier is selected by the president without the need for approval from the legislature  and neither the president nor the premier wields veto power               Historically  the ROC has been dominated by strongman single party politics  This legacy has resulted in executive powers currently being concentrated in the office of the president rather than the premier

Constitution
The constitution was drafted by the KMT while the ROC still governed the Chinese mainland               Political reforms beginning in the late     s resulted in the end of martial law in       and Taiwan transformed into a multiparty democracy in the early     s  The constitutional basis for this transition to democracy was gradually laid in the Additional Articles of the Constitution  These articles suspended portions of the Constitution designed for the governance of mainland China and replacing them with articles adapted for the governance of and guaranteeing the political rights of residents of the Taiwan Area  as defined in the Cross Strait Act              
National boundaries were not explicitly prescribed by the      Constitution  and the Constitutional Court declined to define these boundaries in a      interpretation  viewing the question as a political question to be resolved by the Executive and Legislative Yuans               The      Constitution included articles regarding representatives from former Qing dynasty territories including Tibet and Mongol banners                                         The ROC recognized Mongolia as an independent country in      after signing the      Sino Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance  but after retreating to Taiwan in      it reneged to preserve its claim over mainland China               The Additional Articles of the     s did not alter national boundaries  but suspended articles regarding Mongolian and Tibetan representatives  The ROC began to accept the Mongolian passport and removed clauses referring to Outer Mongolia from the Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area in                    In      the Mainland Affairs Council issued a statement clarifying that Outer Mongolia was not part of the ROC s national territory in                    The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission in the Executive Yuan was abolished in

Major camps
Emblem of the Kuomintang  the main Pan Blue Coalition party
Taiwan s political scene is divided into two major camps in terms of cross strait relations  i e  how Taiwan should relate to China or the PRC  The Pan Green Coalition  e g  the Democratic Progressive Party  leans pro independence  and the Pan Blue Coalition  e g  the Kuomintang  leans pro unification               Moderates in both camps regard the Republic of China as a sovereign independent state  but the Pan Green Coalition regard the ROC as synonymous with Taiwan               while moderates in the Pan Blue Coalition view it as synonymous with China               These positions formed against the backdrop of the PRC s Anti Secession Law  which threatens the use of  non peaceful means  to respond to formal Taiwanese independence               The ROC government has understood this to mean a military invasion of Taiwan              

Democratic Progressive Party s event in Taipei
The Pan Green Coalition is mainly led by the pro independence Democratic Progressive Party  DPP   They oppose the idea that Taiwan is part of China  and seek wide diplomatic recognition and an eventual declaration of formal Taiwan independence               In September       the ruling DPP approved a resolution asserting separate identity from China and called for the enactment of a new constitution for a  normal country   It called also for general use of  Taiwan  as the country s name  without abolishing its formal name  the  Republic of China                Some members of the DPP  such as former President Chen Shui bian and President Lai Ching te  argue that it is unnecessary to proclaim independence because Taiwan is already an independent sovereign country called the Republic of China                            Despite being a member of KMT prior to and during his presidency  Lee Teng hui also held a similar view and was a supporter of the Taiwanization movement               Taiwan Statebuilding Party  TSP  and Green Party  GPT               have adopted a line that aggressive route more than the DPP  in order to win over pro independence voters who are dissatisfied with the DPP s conservative stance 
The Pan Blue Coalition  composed of the pro unification Kuomintang  KMT   People First Party  PFP  and New Party generally support the spirit of the      Consensus  where the KMT claimed that there is one China  but that the ROC and PRC have different interpretations of what  China  means  They favor eventual unification with China               The mainstream Pan Blue position is to maintain the status quo  while refusing immediate unification                            Former President Ma Ying jeou defined cross strait relations as special relations  not one between two Chinas or two states                                         Ma also noted that unification is unlikely within our lifetimes  as the Taiwanese people oppose the mainland s authoritarian rule               Some Pan Blue members seek to improve relationships with the PRC  with a focus on improving economic ties              

National identity
Main article  Taiwanese people        The current state of Taiwanese identity
See also  Taiwan independence movement and Chinese unification
Roughly    percent of Taiwan s population are descendants of Han Chinese immigrants between      and       Another significant fraction descends from Han Chinese who immigrated from mainland China in the late     s and early     s  The shared cultural origin as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national identity being a contentious issue with political overtones 
Since democratic reforms and the lifting of martial law  a distinct Taiwanese identity is often at the heart of political debates  Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland China  and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for de jure Taiwan independence               The Pan Green camp supports a predominantly Taiwanese identity  although  Chinese  may be viewed as cultural heritage   while the Pan Blue camp supports a predominantly Chinese identity  with  Taiwanese  as a regional diasporic Chinese identity                The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity                           

Public opinion
See also  Opinion polling on Taiwanese identity
Results from an identity survey conducted each year from      to      by the Election Study Center  National Chengchi University               Responses are Taiwanese  green   Chinese  red  or Both Taiwanese and Chinese  hatched   No response is shown as gray 
Taiwanese identification has increased substantially since the early     s  while Chinese identification has fallen to a low level  and identification as both has also seen a reduction  In            percent of respondents identified as Taiwanese       percent as Chinese       percent as both  and      percent non response  In June            percent identified as Taiwanese      percent as Chinese       percent as both  and     percent non response               A survey conducted in Taiwan by Global Views Survey Research Center in July      showed that      percent of respondents consider the ROC and the PRC two separate countries with each developing on its own but      percent think they are members of the Chinese              
Domestic public opinion has preferred maintaining the status quo  though pro independence sentiment has steadily risen since       In June       an annual poll found that      percent supported the status quo and postponing a decision       percent supported maintaining the status quo indefinitely       percent supported the status quo with a move toward independence      percent supported the status quo with a move toward unification      percent gave no response      percent supported independence as soon as possible  and     percent supported unification as soon as possible               A referendum question in      asked if Taiwan s athletes should compete under  Taiwan  in the      Summer Olympics but did not pass  the New York Times attributed the failure to a campaign cautioning that a name change might lead to Taiwan being banned  under Chinese pressure

The political and legal statuses of Taiwan are contentious issues  The People s Republic of China  PRC  claims that Taiwan is Chinese territory and that the PRC replaced the ROC government in       becoming the sole legal government of China              The ROC  however  has its own currency  widely accepted passport  postage stamps  internet TLD  armed forces  constitution  and institutions               It has not formally renounced its claim to the mainland  but ROC government publications have increasingly downplayed this historical claim              
Until       the foreign policy of Republican China was complicated by a lack of internal unity competing centers of power all claimed legitimacy  This situation changed after the defeat of the Peiyang Government by the Kuomintang  KMT   which led to widespread diplomatic recognition of the Republic of China               After the KMT retreated to Taiwan  most countries  especially those of the Western Bloc   save the United Kingdom  which recognized the PRC in                     continued to maintain formal relations with the ROC  but recognition gradually eroded and many countries switched recognition to the People s Republic of China in the     s  On    October       UN Resolution      was adopted by    votes to    with    abstentions  recognizing the PRC as China s sole representative in the United Nations                           

ROC embassy in Eswatini
The PRC refuses to have diplomatic relations with any nation that has diplomatic relations with the ROC  and requires all nations with which it has diplomatic relations to make a statement on its claims to Taiwan                            As a result  only         UN member states and the Holy See maintain official diplomatic relations with the Republic of China              The ROC maintains unofficial relations with other countries via de facto embassies and consulates mostly called Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Offices  TECRO   with branch offices called  Taipei Economic and Cultural Offices   TECO   Both TECRO and TECO are  unofficial commercial entities  of the ROC in charge of maintaining diplomatic relations  providing consular services  and serving the national interests of the ROC              
From      to       the United States was a partner with Taiwan in a mutual defense treaty  The United States remains one of the main supporters of Taiwan and  through the Taiwan Relations Act passed in       has continued selling arms and providing military training to the Republic of China Armed Forces               The PRC considers US involvement disruptive to the stability of the region                            The official position of the United States is that the PRC is expected to  use no force or threat en  to use force against Taiwan  and the ROC is to  exercise prudence in managing all aspects of cross strait relations   Both are to refrain from performing actions or espousing statements  that would unilaterally alter Taiwan s status                While not officially classified as a major non NATO ally  it has been de facto treated this way by the United States since at least                   
Taiwan  since      under the Tsai administration s New Southbound Policy  has pursued closer economic relations with South and Southeast Asian countries  increasing cooperation on investments and people to people exchanges despite the region s general lack of official diplomatic ties with Taipei                            The policy has led to Taiwan receiving an increased number of migrants and students from the region               However  a few scandals of Southeast Asians  particularly Indonesians  experiencing exploitation in scholarship programs              and in some labor industries have emerged as setbacks for the policy                           as well as for Indonesia Taiwan relations                           

Relations with the PRC

The Ma Xi meeting was the only meeting between the leaders of both sides of the Taiwan Strait since      
The Mainland Affairs Council  MAC  of Taiwan is responsible for relations with the PRC  while the Taiwan Affairs Office  TAO  of the PRC is responsible for relations with Taiwan  Exchanges are conducted through private organizations both founded in       the Straits Exchange Foundation  SEF  of Taiwan and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits  ARATS  of the PRC 
In November       the ARATS and SEF held a meeting which would later become known as the      Consensus  The SEF announced that both sides agreed that there was only one China  but disagreed on the definition of China  i e  the ROC vs  PRC   while the ARATS announced that the two agreed on the One China principle  but did not mention differences regarding its definition made in the SEF statement               In Taiwan  the ruling Democratic Progressive Party has rejected the      Consensus since early                    President Lai Ching te has stated that the ROC and the PRC are not subordinate to each other              
The PRC s One China principle states that Taiwan and mainland China are both part of China  and that the PRC is the only legitimate government of China              It seeks to prevent or reduce any formal recognition of the ROC as an independent sovereign state                            meaning that Taiwan participates in many international forums as a non state member under names such as  Chinese Taipei   The PRC suggested the  one country  two systems  employed in Hong Kong as a model for peaceful unification with Taiwan                            While it aims for peaceful reunification  the PRC does not rule out the use of force                            The political environment is complicated by the potential for military conflict                                        should events outlined in the PRC s Anti Secession Law occur  such as Taiwan declaring de jure independence  There is a substantial military presence on the Fujian coast as well as PRC sorties into Taiwan s air defense identification zone  ADIZ

The ROC was a founding member of United Nations  and held the seat of China on the Security Council and other UN bodies until       when it was expelled by Resolution      and replaced with the PRC as the ROC now has neither official membership nor observer status in the organization  Since       the ROC has petitioned the UN for entry  but its applications have not made it past committee stage                            Due to the One China policy  most UN member states  including the United States  do not wish to discuss the issue of the ROC s political status for fear of souring diplomatic ties with the PRC              
The ROC government shifted its focus to organizations affiliated with the UN  as well as organizations outside the UN system               The government sought to participate in the World Health Organization  WHO  since                                 their efforts were rejected until       when they participated as an observer under the name  Chinese Taipei  after reaching an agreement with Beijing                            In       Taiwan again began to be excluded from the WHO even in an observer capacity               This exclusion caused a number of scandals during the COVID    outbreak                           

The flag used by Taiwan at the Olympic Games  where it competes as  Chinese Taipei        
The Nagoya Resolution in      approved by the International Olympic Committee  IOC  provided a compromise for the ROC to use the name  Chinese Taipei  in international events where the PRC is also a party  such as the Olympic Games                                         Under the IOC charter  ROC flags cannot be flown at any official Olympic venue or gathering               The ROC also participates in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum  since       and the World Trade Organization  since       under the names  Chinese Taipei  and  Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan  Penghu  Kinmen and Matsu   respectively                            It was a founding member of the Asian Development Bank  but since China s ascension in      has participated under the name  Taipei  China   The ROC is able to participate as  China  in organizations in which the PRC does not participate  such as the World Organization of the Scout Movement 
Due to its limited international recognition  the Republic of China has been a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization  UNPO  since the foundation of the organization in       represented by a government funded organization  the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy  TFD   under the name  Taiwan

The Republic of China Armed Forces takes its roots in the National Revolutionary Army  which was established by Sun Yat sen in      in Guangdong with a goal of reunifying China under the Kuomintang  When the People s Liberation Army won the Chinese Civil War  much of the National Revolutionary Army retreated to Taiwan along with the government  The      Constitution of the ROC reformed it into the Republic of China Armed Forces  making it the national army rather than the army of a political party  Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded or incorporated into the People s Liberation Army 
From      to the     s  the primary mission of the Taiwanese military was to  retake mainland China  through Project National Glory  As this mission has transitioned away from attack because the relative strength of the PRC has massively increased  the ROC military has begun to shift emphasis from the traditionally dominant Army to the air force and navy  Control of the armed forces has also passed into the hands of the civilian government                           
The ROC began a series of force reduction plans since the     s to scale down its military from a level of         in      to         in                    As of          update       the total strength of the Armed Forces is capped at         with    percent manning ratio for volunteer military               Conscription remains universal for qualified males reaching age eighteen  but as a part of the reduction effort many are given the opportunity to fulfill their draft requirement through alternative service                            The military s reservists is around          million including first wave reservists numbered at         as of          update                    Taiwan s defense spending as a percentage of its GDP fell below three percent in      and had been trending downwards over the first two decades of the twenty first century                            The ROC government pledged to raise the spending as high as proposed three percent of GDP                                         In       Taiwan proposed      percent of projected GDP in defense spending for the following year              

The Han Kuang Exercise is an annual military exercise by the ROC Armed Forces in preparation for a possible attack from the PRC 
The ROC and the United States signed the Sino American Mutual Defense Treaty in       and established the United States Taiwan Defense Command  About        US troops were stationed in Taiwan  until the United States established diplomatic relations with the PRC in                    A significant amount of military hardware has been bought from the United States  and continues to be legally guaranteed by the Taiwan Relations Act               France and the Netherlands have also sold military weapons and hardware to the ROC  but they almost entirely stopped in the     s under pressure of the PRC                           
There is no guarantee in the Taiwan Relations Act or any other treaty that the United States will defend Taiwan  even in the event of invasion               The joint declaration on security between the US and Japan signed in      may imply that Japan would be involved in any response  However  Japan has refused to stipulate whether the  area surrounding Japan  mentioned in the pact includes Taiwan               The Australia  New Zealand  United States Security Treaty  ANZUS Treaty  may mean that other US allies  such as Australia  could be involved                            While this would risk damaging economic ties with China               a conflict over Taiwan could lead to an economic blockade of China by a greater coalition

On    May       the Constitutional Court ruled that then current marriage laws had been violating the Constitution by denying same sex couples the right to marry  The Court ruled that if the Legislative Yuan did not pass adequate amendments to Taiwanese marriage laws within two years  same sex marriages would automatically become lawful in Taiwan               In a referendum question in       however  voters expressed overwhelming opposition to same sex marriage and supported the removal of content about homosexuality from primary school textbooks  According to the New York Times  the referendum questions were subject to a  well funded and highly organized campaign led by conservative Christians and other groups  involving the use of misinformation               Nevertheless  the vote against same sex marriage does not affect the court ruling  and on    May       Taiwan s parliament approved a bill legalizing same sex marriage  making it the first country in Asia to do so

Taipei     held the world record for the highest skyscraper from      to      
The quick industrialization and rapid growth of Taiwan during the latter half of the   th century has been called the  Taiwan Miracle   Taiwan is one of the  Four Asian Tigers  alongside Hong Kong  South Korea and Singapore  As of October       Taiwan is the   st largest economy in the world by nominal GDP              
Since       agriculture constituted less than   percent of GDP  down from    percent in                    Unlike its neighbors  South Korea and Japan  the Taiwanese economy is dominated by small and medium sized enterprises  rather than the large business groups               Traditional labor intensive industries are steadily being moved offshore and with more capital and technology intensive industries replacing them  High technology science parks have sprung up in Taiwan 
Today Taiwan has a dynamic  capitalist  export driven economy with gradually decreasing state involvement in investment and foreign trade  In keeping with this trend  some large government owned banks and industrial firms are being privatized               Exports have provided the primary impetus for industrialization  The trade surplus is substantial  and Taiwan remained one of the world s largest forex reserve holders               Taiwan s total trade in      reached US          billion  Both exports and imports for the year reached record levels  totaling US             billion and US             billion  respectively               China  United States and Japan are Taiwan s three largest trading partners  accounting for over    percent of total trade              
Since the beginning of the     s  economic ties between Taiwan and China have been extensive  In       China surpassed the United States to become Taiwan s largest export market for the first time               China is also the most important target of outward foreign direct investment               From      to       more than US          billion have been invested in China by Taiwanese companies               China hosts around       Taiwanese enterprises and over         Taiwanese work in China                            Although the economy of Taiwan benefits from this situation  some have expressed the view that the island has become increasingly dependent on the mainland Chinese economy               Others argue that close economic ties between Taiwan and mainland China would make any military intervention by the PLA against Taiwan very costly  and therefore less probable

Taiwan is a major manufacturer of bicycles and their component parts and accounts for around     of all bikes imported to Europe  In the past several decades  the industry has relied on exploitative migrant labor practices to boost its productivity  Workers recruited from poorer neighboring countries face debt bondage  passport retention  wage withholding and substandard living conditions  as well as threats and intimidation from employers  Taiwan is one of the few countries where labor brokers are permitted to charge high recruitment fees to migrant workers  Recent reporting on these practices has led to promises of reform from some manufacturers

Taiwan is well known for adhering to the Confucian paradigm of valuing education as a means to improve one s socioeconomic position in society                            Heavy investment and a cultural valuing of education has made the resource poor nation to be consistently ranked to the top of global education rankings  Taiwan is one of the top performing countries in reading literacy  mathematics and sciences  In       Taiwanese students achieved one of the world s best results in mathematics  science and literacy  as tested by the Programme for International Student Assessment  PISA   with the average student scoring      compared with the OECD average of      placing it seventh in the world                                        
The Taiwanese education system has been praised for its comparatively high test results and its major role in promoting Taiwan s economic development while creating one of the world s most highly educated workforces                            Taiwan has also been praised for its high university entrance rate where the university acceptance rate has increased from around    percent before the     s to    percent in      and over    percent since       among the highest in Asia                                         The nation s high university entrance rate has created a highly skilled workforce making Taiwan one of the most highly educated countries in the world with      percent of Taiwanese high school students going on to attend university               Taiwan has a high percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree where    percent of Taiwanese aged       hold a bachelor s degree or higher compared with the average of    percent among member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD

Early in the program  the payment system was predominantly fee for service  Most health providers operate in the private sector and form a competitive market on the health delivery side  However  many healthcare providers took advantage of the system by offering unnecessary services  In the face of increasing loss and the need for cost containment  NHI changed the payment system from fee for service to a global budget  a kind of prospective payment system  in      
The implementation of universal healthcare created fewer health disparities for lower income citizens in Taiwan  According to a recently published survey  out of            patients surveyed at a randomly chosen hospital       percent of the patients said they are  very satisfied  with the hospital service       percent said they are  okay  with the service  Only     percent of the patients said they are either  not satisfied  or  very not satisfied  with the service or care provided

During the martial law period  the Kuomintang promoted an official traditional Chinese culture over Taiwan in order to emphasize that the Republic of China represents the true orthodoxy to Chinese Culture as opposed to Communist China               The government launched what s known as the Chinese Cultural Renaissance movement in Taiwan in opposition to the cultural destructions caused by the Chinese Communist Party during the Cultural Revolution  The General Assembly of Chinese Culture was established to help promote Chinese culture in Taiwan and overseas  It was Kuomintang s first structured plan for cultural development on Taiwan  The Chinese Cultural Renaissance movement in Taiwan had led to some aspects of Chinese Culture being better preserved there than in mainland China  for example the continued use of Traditional Chinese  The influence of Confucianism can be found in the behavior of Taiwanese people  known for their friendliness and politeness

Reflecting the continuing controversy surrounding the political status of Taiwan  politics continues to play a role in the conception and development of a Taiwanese cultural identity  especially in its relationship to Chinese culture               In recent years  the concept of Taiwanese multiculturalism has been proposed as a relatively apolitical alternative view  which has allowed for the inclusion of mainlanders and other minority groups into the continuing re definition of Taiwanese culture as collectively held systems of meaning and customary patterns of thought and behavior shared by the people of Taiwan               Identity politics  along with the over one hundred years of political separation from mainland China  has led to distinct traditions in many areas  including cuisine and music

  Mandarin as the standard variety of Chinese           Vernacular Chinese  used in most occasions  Classical Chinese  used in formal or ceremonial occasions  religious or cultural rites  official documents  legal and court rulings and judiciary documents             

  A national language in Taiwan is legally defined as  a natural language used by an original people group of Taiwan and the Taiwan Sign Language

  Mixed indigenous Han ancestry is included in the figure for Han 

  While the tricameral parliament continues to exist de jure  the National Assembly  electoral college  was de facto suspended in      and the Control Yuan  upper house  ceased to be a parliamentary chamber de facto in      leaving the Legislative Yuan  lower house  as the de facto unicameral chamber 

  a b The HDI annual report compiled by the UNDP does not include Taiwan because it is no longer a UN member state  and is neither included as part of the People s Republic of China by the UNDP when calculating data for China              Taiwan s Statistical Bureau calculated its HDI for      to be       based on UNDP s      methodology                          which would place Taiwan at   th globally in      within the      UNDP report                          

  a b There are four contemporary geopolitical definitions of the extent of  Taiwan   The common name referring to the state  also known as the  Republic of China   ROC   including all     islands administered by the ROC  collectively known as Taiwan Area             The traditional Taiwan region         which consists of the main island of Taiwan and its surrounding islands  including the Penghu islands                          but excludes Kinmen  Matsu  and Wuqiu  those are traditionally parts of Fujian Province  and also excluding the ROC controlled South China Sea Islands The traditional region without Penghu  which is sometimes regarded as a separate region The main island of Taiwan  Formosa  alone  excluding all the offshore islands nearby 

  Bellwood s definition   Island Southeast Asia includes Taiwan  the Philippines  Brunei and the Sarawak and Sabah provinces of East Malaysia  northern Borneo   and all of the islands of Indonesia to the west of New Guinea  

  Robert Blust   The major western island groups include the great Indonesian  or Malay Archipelago  to its north the smaller and more compact Philippine Archipelago  and still further north at    to    degrees north latitude and some     kilometres from the coast of China  the island of Taiwan  Formosa   Together these island groups constitute insular  or island  Southeast Asia  

  Despite the conventional definition to include Taiwan as part of East Asia  there is some variability as to whether Taiwan is also included in the region of Maritime Southeast Asia  Some scholars  such as Peter Bellwood and Robert Blust                  j          k      include Taiwan as part of Southeast Asia in their definition

  Although this is the present meaning of gu   in Old Chinese  when its pronunciation was something like   q   k               it meant the walled city of the Chinese and the areas they could control from them             

  Its use is attested from the sixth century Classic of History  which states  Huangtian bestowed the lands and the peoples of the central state to the ancestors                               

  Interpretations on whether sovereignty was transferred to the ROC varies  ROC took control of Taiwan under General Order No     on behalf of the Allies of World War II  Taiwan was simultaneously established as a ROC province  though opinions differed among the Allies on the unilateral announcement of annexation of Taiwn by the ROC  Japan later renounced its claims to Taiwan and the Pescadores in the Treaty of San Francisco in       see Retrocession Day  Theory of the Undetermined Status of Taiwan  political status of Taiwan and      Cairo Declaration
