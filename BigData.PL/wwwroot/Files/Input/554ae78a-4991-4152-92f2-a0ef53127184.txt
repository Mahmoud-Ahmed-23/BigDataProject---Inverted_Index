microprogrammed control  computer architecture  instruction design  and format  Computer Organization and Architecture is used to design computer systems  Computer architecture is about designing a computer system to balance performance  efficiency  cost  and reliability  It describes how a system is built from its components  This can be a high level overview or a detailed explanation  including the instruction set architecture  microarchitecture  logic design  and implementation Computer Organization  is about how the components of a computer system  like the CPU  memory  and input output devices  are connected and work together to execute programs  It focuses on the operational aspects and how hardware components are implemented to support the architecture  Introduction and
