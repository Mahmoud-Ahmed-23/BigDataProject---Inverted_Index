Transfer learning  TL  is a technique in machine learning  ML  in which knowledge learned from a task is re used in order to boost performance on a related task             For example  for image classification  knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could be applied when trying to recognize trucks  This topic is related to the psychological literature on transfer of learning  although practical ties between the two fields are limited  Reusing transferring information from previously learned tasks to new tasks has the potential to significantly improve learning efficiency            
Since transfer learning makes use of training with multiple objective functions it is related to cost sensitive machine learning and multi objective optimization            


History edit 
In       Bozinovski and Fulgosi published a paper addressing transfer learning in neural network training                        The paper gives a mathematical and geometrical model of the topic  In       a report considered the application of transfer learning to a dataset of images representing letters of computer terminals  experimentally demonstrating positive and negative transfer learning            
In       Lorien Pratt formulated the discriminability based transfer  DBT  algorithm            
By       the field had advanced to include multi task learning             along with more formal theoretical foundations             Influential publications on transfer learning include the book Learning to Learn in                   a      survey             and a      survey             
Ng said in his NIPS      tutorial                         that TL would become the next driver of machine learning commercial success after supervised learning 
In the      paper   Rethinking Pre Training and self training               Zoph et al  reported that pre training can hurt accuracy  and advocate self training instead

Applications edit 
Algorithms are available for transfer learning in Markov logic networks             and Bayesian networks              Transfer learning has been applied to cancer subtype discovery              building utilization                          general game playing              text classification                          digit recognition              medical imaging and spam filtering             
In       it was discovered that  due to their similar physical natures  transfer learning is possible between electromyographic  EMG  signals from the muscles and classifying the behaviors of electroencephalographic  EEG  brainwaves  from the gesture recognition domain to the mental state recognition domain  It was noted that this relationship worked in both directions  showing that electroencephalographic can likewise be used to classify EMG              The experiments noted that the accuracy of neural networks and convolutional neural networks were improved             through transfer learning both prior to any learning  compared to standard random weight distribution  and at the end of the learning process  asymptote   That is  results are improved by exposure to another domain  Moreover  the end user of a pre trained model can change the structure of fully connected layers to improve performance
