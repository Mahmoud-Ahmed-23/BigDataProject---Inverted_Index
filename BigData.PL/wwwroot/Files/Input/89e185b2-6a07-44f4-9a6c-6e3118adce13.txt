							On Wednesday s newspaper issues  Egyptian writers picked up several ongoing topics including the   nd African Union  AU  Summit in Addis Ababa  and the amendment of the      Constitution  
Khaled Mery  the editor in chief of the state newspaper Al Akhbar  praised the speeches of President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi during the summit  maintaining that the AU sessions draw a future road map in order to enable Africa restore its usurped rights in having two permanent seats at the UN Security Council which have the        veto power         
Mery suggested that significant issues were addressed during the summit  including security  stability  refugees  poverty  education  and armed conflicts in the continent  He added that the AU  under Egypt s leadership  will seek to maintain security  end conflicts  and achieve sustainable development  
Similarly  in Al Akhbar  Karam Gabr wrote that Al Sisi completes the path of the former notable Egyptian leaders  adding that the late President Gamal Abdel Nasser paved the road  when he called for economic cooperation between African countries and the creation of a joint market  
Gabr referred to Al Sisi s efforts on counterterrorism  maintaining that the Egyptian experience in fighting extremism is drawing global attention  despite of what he described as        lies regarding the human rights record        in Egypt  
Meanwhile  Mahmoud Mohamed Ali of Al Ahram daily cited Egypt       s chairpersonship of the AU as a significant event  as Al Sisi s Egypt is improving and enhancing its international and regional relations  
Ali noted that Egypt eventually managed to restore its AU membership  its position  and its principle role in Africa  
On the other hand  Mostafa El Feki of Al Masry Al Youm pointed out that the constitution is the most important and effective document in the country  however  he argued  it is not a        idol         to be worshipped  
El Feki stated that the      Constitution was drafted in a very        blurry        time  and resulted in two uprisings  the    January Revolution in       and the    June Uprising  However  things have changed now  El Feki said  adding that considering a number of constitutional amendments come as no surprise  due to the need to come up with new updates in the political scene Â
