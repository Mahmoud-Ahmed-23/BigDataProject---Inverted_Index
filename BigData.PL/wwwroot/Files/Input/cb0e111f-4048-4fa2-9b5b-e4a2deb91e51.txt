       Egypt is unwavering in its support for Lebanon and its people during this challenging time         said Abdelatty 
Egypt has also provided significant humanitarian aid to Lebanon  with Abdelatty announcing the delivery of a fourth shipment  including medical supplies  shelter materials  and food  under the direct instructions of the President of Egypt 
Abdelatty emphasised the importance of electing a president through national consensus and Lebanese ownership to address the ongoing presidential vacancy in Lebanon 
       Egypt supports the Lebanese institutions and believes that electing a president through a national consensus is crucial for Lebanon       s stability         said Abdelatty 
Prime Minister Mikati expressed his deep appreciation to the President of Egypt for his continuous support for Lebanon on both the political and humanitarian levels  praising Egypt       s stance in support of Lebanon during this difficult period and for the new humanitarian aid shipment delivered today 
In meetings with Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri and Druze leader Walid Jumblatt  Abdelatty reaffirmed Egypt       s strong opposition to Israeli aggression and reiterated its commitment to Lebanon       s sovereignty  He condemned Israel       s repeated violations of Lebanese territory  including the targeting of UNIFIL forces 
 Egypt calls for respect for Lebanese sovereignty and condemns all Israeli actions that violate Lebanon s territorial integrity         said Abdelatty   We are deeply concerned by the targeting of UNIFIL forces  which is a clear violation of international law        
Abdelatty also discussed Egypt       s ongoing efforts to secure an immediate ceasefire in Lebanon and Gaza  and to de escalate the situation in the region  He stressed the need for international cooperation to achieve a ceasefire and fully implement UN Security Council Resolution       with all parties complying  and to support Lebanese institutions  particularly the Lebanese army 
In his meeting with Lebanese army chief Joseph Aoun  Abdelatty expressed Egypt       s full support for all Lebanese state institutions  particularly the Lebanese army  commending its efforts to maintain Lebanon       s stability 
       Egypt is unwavering in its support for Lebanon in the face of Israeli aggression  which violates Lebanese sovereignty in blatant violation of international law         said Abdelatty 
He discussed Egypt       s efforts to coordinate with regional and international actors to urgently achieve an immediate ceasefire  to implement Resolution       and to empower the Lebanese army to enforce its control over the south  providing full support to the army 
At the end of his visit  Abdelatty escorted     Egyptian citizens and their families back to Egypt  who had been stranded in Lebanon due to the ongoing conflict  The Egyptians were flown back on an EgyptAir flight  which also carried the Foreign Minister back to Cairo  This brings the total number of Egyptians repatriated from Lebanon so far to      through special EgyptAir flights 
The returning citizens expressed their deep gratitude to the President of Egypt and to the Egyptian government for ensuring their safe return to their homeland through special flights at the expense of the state  a clear testament to the Egyptian government       s commitment to prioritising the welfare and safety of its citizens 
Abdelatty confirmed that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will continue to coordinate with all state agencies to provide all possible support to Egyptian citizens in Lebanon  both by including them in return flights to Egypt and by providing the various consular services that the Egyptian Embassy in Beirut continues to offer despite the difficult security situation in Beirut 
The Egyptian Foreign Ministry s actions reflect a consistent effort to maintain diplomatic engagement with Lebanon  offering support and aid during a time of crisis  The minister       s visits and discussions highlight the significant role that Egypt continues to play in promoting peace and stability in the region
