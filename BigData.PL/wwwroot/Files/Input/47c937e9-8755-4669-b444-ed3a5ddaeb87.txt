History edit

Correspondence and inquiries from the newspaper s readers 
Wilson described it as taking part in  a severe contest between intelligence  which presses forward  and an unworthy  timid ignorance obstructing our progress   a phrase which still appears on its imprint  US  masthead  as the publication s mission              It has long been respected as  one of the most competent and subtle Western periodicals on public affairs               It was cited by Karl Marx in his formulation of socialist theory because Marx felt the publication epitomised the interests of the bourgeoisie              He wrote that  the London Economist  the European organ of the aristocracy of finance  described most strikingly the attitude of this class               In       revolutionary Vladimir Lenin referred to The Economist as a  journal that speaks for British millionaires               Additionally  Lenin stated that The Economist held a  bourgeois pacifist  position and supported peace out of fear of revolution             
In the currency disputes of the mid nineteenth century  the journal sided with the Banking School against the Currency School  It criticised the Bank Charter Act      which restricted the amount of bank notes that the Bank of England could issue on the basis of Currency School policy encouraged by Lord Overstone  that eventually developed into monetarism  It blamed the      financial crisis in Britain on  a certain class of doctrinaires  who  refer every commercial crisis and its disastrous consequences to  excessive issues of bank notes                           It identified the causes of the financial crisis as variations in interest rates and a build up of excess financial capital leading to unwise investments

In       the paper s circulation rose to        In       it underwent its first major redesign  The current fire engine red nameplate was created by Reynolds Stone in                   In       The Economist changed its large broadsheet format into a smaller magazine style perfect bound formatting              In      the publication introduced a North American edition after publishing the British edition since       its circulation had increased more than tenfold by                  In January       The Economist launched a new weekly section devoted exclusively to China  the first new country section since the introduction of one on the United States in                  
In       James Fallows argued in The Washington Post that The Economist used editorial lines that contradicted the news stories they purported to highlight              In       Andrew Sullivan complained in The New Republic that it uses  marketing genius              to make up for deficiencies in original reporting  resulting in  a kind of Reader s Digest              for America s corporate elite                          The Guardian wrote that  its writers rarely see a political or economic problem that cannot be solved by the trusted three card trick of privatisation  deregulation and liberalisation              
In       the Chicago Tribune named it the best English language paper noting its strength in international reporting where it does not feel moved to  cover a faraway land only at a time of unmitigated disaster  and that it kept a wall between its reporting and its more conservative editorial policies              In       Jon Meacham  former editor of Newsweek and a self described  fan   criticised The Economist     s focus on analysis over original reporting              In       The Economist was accused of hacking into the computer of Justice Mohammed Nizamul Huq of the Bangladesh Supreme Court  leading to his resignation as the chairman of the International Crimes Tribunal                          In August       Pearson sold its     stake in the newspaper to the Italian Agnelli family s investment company  Exor  for      million  US     million  and the paper re acquired the remaining shares for      million       million                          

Fossil fuel advertising edit 
An investigation by the Intercept  the Nation  and DeSmog found that The Economist is one of the leading media outlets that publishes advertising for the fossil fuel industry  Journalists who cover climate change for The Economist are concerned that conflicts of interest with the companies and industries that caused climate change and obstructed action will reduce the credibility of their reporting on climate change and cause readers to downplay the climate crisis             

Organisation edit 
The Economist is a member of the Economist Group 

Shareholders edit 
City of Westminster s Smithson Plaza  formerly known as The Economist Building                                                  served as the headquarters of the paper until       on St James s Street  Pearson plc held a     shareholding via The Financial Times Limited until August       At that time  Pearson sold their share in the Economist  The Agnelli family s Exor paid     m to raise their stake from      to       while the Economist paid     m for the balance of     m shares which will be distributed to current shareholders              Aside from the Agnelli family  smaller shareholders in the company include Cadbury  Rothschild        Schroder  Layton and other family interests as well as a number of staff and former staff shareholders                          A board of trustees formally appoints the editor  who cannot be removed without its permission  The Economist Newspaper Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Economist Group  Sir Evelyn Robert de Rothschild was chairman of the company from      to      
Although The Economist has a global emphasis and scope  about two thirds of the    staff journalists are based in the London borough of Westminster              However  due to half of all subscribers originating in the United States  The Economist has core editorial offices and substantial operations in New York City  Los Angeles  Chicago  and Washington D C                         

Editor edit 
Zanny Minton Beddoes was appointed editor in       first joining as an emerging markets correspondent in      
The editor in chief  commonly known as simply  the Editor   of The Economist is charged with formulating the paper s editorial policies and overseeing corporate operations  Since its      founding  the editors have been the following

Tone and voice edit 
Although it has many individual columns  by tradition and current practice the newspaper ensures a uniform voice aided by the anonymity of writers throughout its pages              as if most articles were written by a single author  which may be perceived to display dry  understated wit  and precise use of language                          The Economist     s treatment of economics presumes a working familiarity with fundamental concepts of classical economics  For instance  it does not explain terms like invisible hand  macroeconomics  or demand curve  and may take just six or seven words to explain the theory of comparative advantage  Articles involving economics do not presume any formal training on the part of the reader and aim to be accessible to the educated layperson  It usually does not translate short French and German quotes or phrases but describes the business or nature of even well known entities  writing  for example   Goldman Sachs  an investment bank               The Economist is known for its extensive use of word play  including puns  allusions  and metaphors  as well as alliteration and assonance  especially in its headlines and captions  This can make it difficult to understand for those who are not native English speakers             
The Economist has traditionally and historically persisted in referring to itself as a  newspaper                                      rather than a  news magazine   due to its mostly cosmetic switch from broadsheet to perfect binding format and its general focus on current affairs as opposed to specialist subjects                         It is legally classified as a newspaper in Britain and the United States                                      Most databases and anthologies catalogue the weekly as a newspaper printed in magazine  or journal format              The Economist differentiates and contrasts itself as a newspaper against their sister lifestyle magazine        which does the same in turn  Editor Zanny Minton Beddoes clarified the distinction in       saying that  we call it a newspaper because it was founded in           years ago   when  all  perfect bound publications  were called newspapers              

Editorial anonymity edit 
The Economist     s articles often take a definite editorial stance and almost never carry a byline              Not even the name of the editor is printed in the issue  It is a long standing tradition that an editor s only signed article during their tenure is written on the occasion of their departure from the position  The author of a piece is named in certain circumstances  when notable persons are invited to contribute opinion pieces  when journalists of The Economist compile special reports  previously known as surveys   for the Year in Review special edition  and to highlight a potential conflict of interest over a book review  The names of The Economist editors and correspondents can be located on the media directory pages of the website              Online blog pieces are signed with the initials of the writer and authors of print stories are allowed to note their authorship from their personal web sites              One anonymous writer of The Economist observed   This approach is not without its faults  we have four staff members with the initials  J P    for example  but is the best compromise between total anonymity and full bylines  in our view               According to one academic study  the anonymous ethos of the weekly has contributed to strengthening three areas for The Economist  collective and consistent voice  talent and newsroom management  and brand strength             
The editors say this is necessary because  collective voice and personality matter more than the identities of individual journalists               and reflects  a collaborative effort               In most articles  authors refer to themselves as  your correspondent  or  this reviewer   The writers of the titled opinion columns tend to refer to themselves by the title  hence  a sentence in the  Lexington  column might read  Lexington was informed       American author and long time reader Michael Lewis criticised the paper s editorial anonymity in       labelling it a means to hide the youth and inexperience of those writing articles              Although individual articles are written anonymously  there is no secrecy over who the writers are  as they are listed on The Economist     s website  which also provides summaries of their careers and academic qualifications              In       Lewis included multiple Economist articles in his anthology about the      financial crisis  Panic  The Story of Modern Financial Insanity             
John Ralston Saul describes The Economist as a newspaper that  hides the names of the journalists who write its articles in order to create the illusion that they dispense disinterested truth rather than opinion  This sales technique  reminiscent of pre Reformation Catholicism  is not surprising in a publication named after the social science most given to wild guesses and imaginary facts presented in the guise of inevitability and exactitude  That it is the Bible of the corporate executive indicates to what extent received wisdom is the daily bread of a managerial civilization              

Features edit 
A stack of Economist papers  ordered by publication date       
The Economist     s primary focus is world events  politics and business  but it also runs regular sections on science and technology as well as books and the arts  Approximately every two weeks  the publication includes an in depth special report  previously called surveys  on a given topic              The five main categories are Countries and Regions  Business  Finance and Economics  Science  and Technology  The newspaper goes to press on Thursdays  between        p m  and        p m  GMT  and is available at newsagents in many countries the next day  It is printed at seven sites around the world 
Since July       there has also been a complete audio edition of the paper available        pm London time on Thursdays              The audio version of The Economist is produced by the production company Talking Issues  The company records the full text of the newspaper in MP  format  including the extra pages in the UK edition  The weekly     MB download is free for subscribers and available for a fee for non subscribers  The publication s writers adopt a tight style that seeks to include the maximum amount of information in a limited space              David G  Bradley  publisher of The Atlantic  described the formula as  a consistent world view expressed  consistently  in tight and engaging prose              

Letters edit 
The Economist frequently receives letters from its readership in response to the previous week s edition  While it is known to feature letters from senior businesspeople  politicians  ambassadors  and spokespeople  the paper includes letters from typical readers as well  Well written or witty responses from anyone are considered  and controversial issues frequently produce a torrent of letters  For example  the survey of corporate social responsibility  published January       produced largely critical letters from Oxfam  the World Food Programme  United Nations Global Compact  the Chairman of BT Group  an ex Director of Shell and the UK Institute of Directors             
In an effort to foster diversity of thought  The Economist routinely publishes letters that openly criticize the paper s articles and stance  After The Economist ran a critique of Amnesty International in its issue dated    March       its letters page ran a reply from Amnesty  as well as several other letters in support of the organisation  including one from the head of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights              Rebuttals from officials within regimes such as the Singapore government are routinely printed  to comply with local right of reply laws without compromising editorial independence             
Letters published in the paper are typically between     and     words long and had the now discontinued salutation  Sir  from      to       In the latter year  upon the appointment of Zanny Minton Beddoes  the first female editor  the salutation was dismissed  letters have since had no salutation      citation needed      Prior to a change in procedure  all responses to online articles were published in  The Inbox       citation needed

Data journalism edit 
The presence of data journalism in The Economist can be traced to its founding year in       Initially  the weekly published basic international trade figures and tables                            The paper first included a graphical model in      a letter featuring an illustration of various coin sizes and its first non epistolary chart a tree map visualising the size of coal fields in America and England was included in November                    This early adoption of data based articles was estimated to be  a     years before the field s modern emergence  by Data Journalism com               Its transition from broadsheet to magazine style formatting led to the adoption of coloured graphs  first in fire engine red during the     s and then in a thematic blue in                    The Economist s editors and readers developed a taste for more data driven stories throughout the     s               Starting in the late     s  the paper began to publish more and more articles that centred solely on charts  some of which were published online every weekday               These  daily charts  are typically followed by a short      word explanation  In September       The Economist launched a Twitter account for their Data Team              
In       the data journalism department a dedicated team of data journalists  visualisers and interactive developers was created to head up the paper s data journalism efforts               The team s output soon included election forecasting models  covering the French presidential elections of      and      and the US presidential and congressional elections in       among others  In late       the data team advertised for a political data scientist to bolster its political forecasting efforts  In order to ensure transparency in the team s data collection and analysis The Economist maintains a corporate GitHub account to publicly disclose their models and software wherever possible               In October       they introduced a  Graphic Detail  featuring large charts and maps in both their print and digital editions which ran until November

Opinions edit 
Main article  The Economist editorial stance
The editorial stance of The Economist primarily revolves around classical  social  and most notably  economic liberalism  Since its founding  it has supported radical centrism  favouring policies and governments that maintain centrist politics  The newspaper typically champions neoliberalism  particularly free markets  free trade  free immigration  deregulation  and globalisation               When the newspaper was founded  the term economism denoted what would today be termed  economic liberalism   The activist and journalist George Monbiot has described it as neoliberal while occasionally accepting the propositions of Keynesian economics where deemed more  reasonable                The weekly favours a carbon tax to fight global warming               According to one former editor  Bill Emmott   the Economist     s philosophy has always been liberal  not conservative                Alongside other publications such as The Guardian  The Observer and The Independent  it supports the United Kingdom becoming a republic              

Scottish economist Adam Smith  right  and philosopher David Hume  left  represent the newspaper s foundational beliefs of laissez faire policies  self sufficiency  anti protectionism and free trade 
Individual contributors take diverse views  The Economist favours the support  through central banks  of banks and other important corporations  This principle can  in a much more limited form  be traced back to Walter Bagehot  the third editor of The Economist  who argued that the Bank of England should support major banks that got into difficulties  Karl Marx deemed The Economist the  European organ  of  the aristocracy of finance                The newspaper has also supported liberal causes on social issues such as recognition of gay marriages               legalisation of drugs               criticises the U S  tax model               and seems to support some government regulation on health issues  such as smoking in public               as well as bans on smacking children               The Economist consistently favours guest worker programmes  parental choice of school  and amnesties               and once published an  obituary  of God               The Economist also has a long record of supporting gun control               In       the paper was criticized for publishing an  anti transgender screed                In       The Economist received backlash for suggesting that transgender people should be sterilized  The paper subsequently apologized for this statement                                                     
In British general elections  The Economist has endorsed the Labour Party  in      and                                  the Conservative Party  in      and                                  and the Liberal Democrats  in      and                                  and supported both Republican and Democratic candidates in the United States  The Economist put its stance this way 

What  besides free trade and free markets  does The Economist believe in   It is to the Radicals that The Economist still likes to think of itself as belonging  The extreme centre is the paper s historical position   That is as true today as when Crowther  Geoffrey  Economist editor            said it in       The Economist considers itself the enemy of privilege  pomposity and predictability  It has backed conservatives such as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher  It has supported the Americans in Vietnam  But it has also endorsed Harold Wilson and Bill Clinton  and espoused a variety of liberal causes  opposing capital punishment from its earliest days  while favouring penal reform and decolonisation  as well as more recently gun control and gay marriage             
In       The Economist commented that Cristina Fern ndez de Kirchner  the president of Argentina at the time  was  Dashing hopes of change  Argentina s new president is leading her country into economic peril and social conflict                The Economist also called for Bill Clinton s impeachment               as well as for Donald Rumsfeld s resignation after the emergence of the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse               Although The Economist initially gave vigorous support for the U S  led invasion of Iraq  it later called the operation  bungled from the start  and criticised the  almost criminal negligence  of the Bush Administration s handling of the Iraq War  while maintaining in      that pulling out in the short term would be irresponsible               In an editorial marking its    th anniversary  The Economist criticised adherents to liberalism for becoming too inclined to protect the political status quo rather than pursue reform               The paper called on liberals to return to advocating for bold political  economic and social reforms  protecting free markets  land and tax reform in the tradition of Georgism  open immigration  a rethink of the social contract with more emphasis on education  and a revival of liberal internationalism

Censorship edit 
A copy of The Economist in Liaoning Provincial Library  Page    from the   June      issue  about the      Tiananmen Square Protests  has been removed 
Sections of The Economist criticising authoritarian regimes are frequently removed from the paper by the authorities in those countries  Like many other publications  The Economist is subjected to censorship in Iran  On    June       Iran banned the sale of The Economist when it published a map labelling the Persian Gulf simply as Gulf a choice that derives its political significance from the Persian Gulf naming dispute              
In a separate incident  the government of Zimbabwe went further and imprisoned The Economist     s correspondent there  Andrew Meldrum  The government charged him with violating a statute on  publishing untruth  for writing that a woman was decapitated by supporters of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union   Patriotic Front party  The decapitation claim was retracted               and allegedly fabricated by the woman s husband  The correspondent was later acquitted  only to receive a deportation order  On    August       The Economist disclosed that the Missouri Department of Corrections had censored its issue of    June       According to the letter sent by the department  prisoners were not allowed to receive the issue because     it constitutes a threat to the security or discipline of the institution     may facilitate or encourage criminal activity  or    may interfere with the rehabilitation of an offender
