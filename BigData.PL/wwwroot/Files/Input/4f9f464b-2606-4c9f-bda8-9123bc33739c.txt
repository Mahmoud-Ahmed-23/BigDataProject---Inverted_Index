							Gaza faces an imminent humanitarian catastrophe as Israel s military campaign  now in its   th consecutive month  continues to intensify  Escalating air and ground operations  coupled with deepening restrictions on civilian movement and aid access  are accelerating the collapse of Gaza s infrastructure and health services  while prompting widespread warnings from local authorities and international agencies 
The Ministry of Health in Gaza issued an urgent appeal this week  warning that current fuel conservation efforts are no longer sufficient to keep hospital generators operational  Without immediate fuel deliveries  critical healthcare services are projected to cease within    hours  The Government Media Office echoed this warning  calling on the international community to act swiftly and deliver fuel to avert the complete breakdown of the enclave       s healthcare system 
According to the latest figures from the Health Ministry     Palestinians were killed and     injured in the past    hours  The total death toll since   October       has now reached         with         reported injuries  Since March    alone        people have been killed and       wounded 
On the diplomatic front  Egypt has received a new proposal from the United States intended to revive long stalled mediation efforts between Hamas and Israel  Citing Egyptian diplomatic sources  Arab media reported that the proposal could serve as a preliminary framework for ceasefire negotiations and a potential pathway to political dialogue aimed at ending the war 
Meanwhile  Qatar confirmed that its mediation efforts are ongoing despite what officials describe as deteriorating conditions  Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed Al Ansari said during a press briefing on Tuesday that Doha remains in close contact with key stakeholders  including the United States  in pursuit of a humanitarian ceasefire  He described the situation in Gaza as  catastrophic by all standards  and acknowledged that serious obstacles remain in reaching an agreement 
On the ground  the Israeli military announced plans to expand its offensive operations in Rafah  a densely populated area in southern Gaza where hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians have sought refuge  According to a military statement  the campaign will now include additional neighborhoods and targets within the city  This development follows Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s formal approval of expanded military action in Gaza  including plans to occupy the territory and push its population further south 
In a highly controversial statement reflecting growing fears of forced displacement  Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich declared at a settler conference that  victory will be achieved when Gaza becomes absolute rubble and its population is concentrated south of the Morag axis and begins to leave en masse to a third country   He emphasized the government       s intent to  eliminate Hamas and completely destroy Gaza  
Further supporting accusations of systematic displacement  Israeli army radio revealed a new aid distribution strategy aimed at accelerating population movement out of northern Gaza  Under this plan  humanitarian aid will be restricted exclusively to Rafah particularly the corridor between Morag and Salah al Din  Philadelphi  an area now under full Israeli control  Aid recipients will be required to undergo stringent security screenings to ensure they are not affiliated with Hamas 
Only three aid distribution centers are planned  all located in Rafah  with no provisions for aid in northern Gaza  The report indicates a possible temporary distribution center may be established in the north but will be dismantled once population transfers are completed 
The international community continues to voice strong opposition  Hamas condemned the latest Israeli ground operations  calling them a  decision to sacrifice Israeli hostages   and accusing Israel of undermining ongoing mediation efforts 
The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  OCHA  also rejected Israel s plan to shut down the existing aid mechanism in Gaza  stating that it violates essential humanitarian principles of neutrality  impartiality  and independence  The agency emphasized that any aid framework must meet these standards to effectively support civilians
