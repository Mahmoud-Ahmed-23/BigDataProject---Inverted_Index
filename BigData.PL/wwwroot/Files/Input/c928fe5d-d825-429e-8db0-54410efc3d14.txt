Checkers     note         American English   also known as draughts   dr  fts  dr fts   British English   is a group of strategy board games for two players which involve forward movements of uniform game pieces and mandatory captures by jumping over opponent pieces  Checkers is developed from alquerque             The term  checkers  derives from the checkered board which the game is played on  whereas  draughts  derives from the verb  to draw  or  to move             
The most popular forms of checkers in Anglophone countries are American checkers  also called English draughts   which is played on an     checkerboard  Russian draughts  Turkish draughts and Armenian droughts  all of them on an     board  and international draughts  played on a       board   with the latter widely played in many countries worldwide  There are many other variants played on     boards  Canadian checkers and Malaysian Singaporean checkers  also locally known as dam  are played on a       board 
American checkers was weakly solved in      by a team of Canadian computer scientists led by Jonathan Schaeffer  From the standard starting position  perfect play by each side would result in a draw 


General rules edit 
Checkers is played by two opponents on opposite sides of the game board  One player has dark pieces  usually black   the other has light pieces  usually white or red   The darker color moves first  then players alternate turns  A player cannot move the opponent s pieces  A move consists of moving a piece forward to an adjacent unoccupied square  If the adjacent square contains an opponent s piece  and the square immediately beyond it is vacant  the piece may be captured  and removed from the game  by jumping over it            
Only the dark squares of the checkerboard are used  A piece can only move forward into an unoccupied square  When capturing an opponent s piece is possible  capturing is mandatory in most official rules  If the player does not capture  the other player can remove the opponent s piece as a penalty  or muffin   and where there are two or more such positions the player forfeits pieces that cannot be moved  although some rule variations make capturing optional   In almost all variants  a player with no valid move remaining loses  This occurs if the player has no pieces left  or if all the player s pieces are obstructed from moving by opponent pieces            

Pieces edit 
Man edit 
An uncrowned piece  man  moves one step ahead and captures an adjacent opponent s piece by jumping over it and landing on the next square  Multiple enemy pieces can be captured in a single turn provided this is done by successive jumps made by a single piece  the jumps do not need to be on the same diagonal and may  zigzag   change diagonal direction   In American checkers  men can jump only forwards  in international draughts and Russian draughts  men can jump both forwards and backwards 

King  edit 
A game in international draughts        board   featuring a flying king  the move  Les Blancs prennent   pions     
When a man reaches the farthest row forward  known as the kings row or crown head  it becomes a king  It is marked by placing an additional piece on top of  or crowning  the first man  The king has additional powers  namely the ability to move any amount of squares at a time  in international checkers   move backwards and  in variants where men cannot already do so  capture backwards  Like a man  a king can make successive jumps in a single turn  provided that each jump captures an enemy piece 
In international draughts  kings  also called flying kings  move any distance  They may capture an opposing man any distance away by jumping to any of the unoccupied squares immediately beyond it  Because jumped pieces remain on the board until the turn is complete  it is possible to reach a position in a multi jump move where the flying king is blocked from capturing further by a piece already jumped 
Flying kings are not used in American checkers  a king s only advantage over a man is the additional ability to move and capture backwards 

Naming edit 
In most non English languages  except those that acquired the game from English speakers   checkers is called dame  dames  damas  or a similar term that refers to ladies  The pieces are usually called men  stones   pe n   pawn  or a similar term  men promoted to kings are called dames or ladies  In these languages  the queen in chess or in card games is usually called by the same term as the kings in checkers  A case in point includes the Greek terminology  in which checkers is called          dama   which is also one term for the queen in chess      citation needed     

History edit 
Ancient games edit 
Men in medieval clothing playing checkers
Similar games have been played for  millennia             A board resembling a checkers board was found in Ur dating from      BC             In the British Museum are specimens of ancient Egyptian checkerboards  found with their pieces in burial chambers  and the game was played by the pharaoh Hatshepsut                        Plato mentioned a game          or petteia  as being of Egyptian origin             and Homer also mentions it             The method of capture was placing two pieces on either side of the opponent s piece  It was said to have been played during the Trojan War                        The Romans played a derivation of petteia called latrunculi  or the game of the Little Soldiers  The pieces  and sporadically the game itself  were called calculi  pebbles                         Like the pawn in chess  alquerque was probably derived from         and latrunculi by removing the necessity for two pieces to cooperate to capture one  although  like Ghanaian draughts  the game could still be declared lost by a player with only one piece left 

Alquerque edit 
Alquerque board and setup
An Arabic game called Quirkat or al qirq  with similar play to modern checkers  was played on a     board  It is mentioned in the tenth century work Kitab al Aghani             Al qirq was also the name for the game that is now called nine men s morris             Al qirq was brought to Spain by the Moors              where it became known as Alquerque  the Spanish derivation of the Arabic name  It was maybe adapted into a derivation of latrunculi  or the game of the Little Soldiers  with a leaping capture  which  like modern Argentine  German  Greek  Kenyan and Thai draughts  had flying kings which had to stop on the next square after the captured piece  but pieces could only make up to three captures at once  or seven if all directions were legal  That said  even if playing al qirq inside the cells of a square grid was not already known to the Moors who brought it  which it probably was  either via playing on a chessboard  in about       probably in the south of France  this was done once again using backgammon pieces              thereby each piece was called a  fers   the same name as the chess queen  as the move of the two pieces was the same at the time              or adapting Seega using jumping capture  The rules are given in the   th century book Libro de los juegos            

Crowning edit 
The rule of crowning was used by the   th century  as it is mentioned in the Philippe Mousk s s Chronique in                 when the game was known as Fierges  the name used for the chess queen  derived from the Persian ferz  meaning royal counsellor or vizier   The pieces became known as  dames  when that name was also adopted for the chess queen              The rule forcing players to take whenever possible was introduced in France in around       at which point the game became known as Jeu forc   identical to modern American checkers                         The game without forced capture became known as Le jeu plaisant de dames  the precursor of international checkers 
The   th century English author Samuel Johnson wrote a foreword to a      book about checkers by William Payne  the earliest book in English about the game

Christopher Strachey s checkers        the first video game
Scott M Savage s checkers        the first robot game
American checkers  English draughts  has been the arena for several notable advances in game artificial intelligence  In      Christopher Strachey wrote the first video game program on checkers  The checkers program tried to run for the first time on    July      at NPL  but was unsuccessful due to program errors  In the summer of      he successfully ran the program on Ferranti Mark   computer and played the first computer checkers and arguably the first video game ever according to certain definitions   In the     s  Arthur Samuel created one of the first board game playing programs of any kind   More recently  in      scientists at the University of Alberta             developed their  Chinook  program to the point where it is unbeatable  A brute force approach that took hundreds of computers working nearly two decades was used to solve the game              showing that a game of checkers will always end in a draw if neither player makes a mistake                          The solution is for the checkers variation called go as you please  GAYP  checkers and not for the variation called three move restriction checkers  however it is a legal three move restriction game because only openings believed to lose are barred under the three move restriction  As of December       this makes American checkers the most complex game ever solved 
In November       the Science Museum Oklahoma  then called the Omniplex  unveiled a new exhibit  Lefty the Checker Playing Robot  Programmed by Scott M Savage  Lefty used an Armdroid robotic arm by Colne Robotics and was powered by a      processor with a combination of Basic and Assembly code to interactively play a round of checkers with visitors to the museum  Originally  the program was deliberately simple so that the average museum visitor could potentially win  but over time was improved  The improvements however proved to be more frustrating for the visitors  so the original code was reimplemented             

Computational complexity edit 
Generalized Checkers is played on an M   N board 
It is PSPACE hard to determine whether a specified player has a winning strategy  And if a polynomial bound is placed on the number of moves that are allowed in between jumps  which is a reasonable generalisation of the drawing rule in standard Checkers   then the problem is in PSPACE  thus it is PSPACE complete              However  without this bound  Checkers is EXPTIME complete             
However  other problems have only polynomial complexity             

Can one player remove all the other player s pieces in one move  by several jumps  
Can one player king a piece in one move
