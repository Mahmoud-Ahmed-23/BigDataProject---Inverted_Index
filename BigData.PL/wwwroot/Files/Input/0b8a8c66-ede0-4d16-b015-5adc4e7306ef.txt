Identification of a military target entity

Target acquisition is the detection and identification of the location of a target in sufficient detail to permit the effective employment of lethal and non lethal means  The term is used for a broad area of applications  
A  target  here is an entity or object considered for possible engagement or other action  see Targeting   Targets include a wide array of resources that an enemy commander can use to conduct operations including mobile and stationary units  forces  equipment  capabilities  facilities  persons and functions  It may comprise target acquisition             Joint Targeting            or Information Operations             
Technically target acquisition may just denote the process of a weapon system to decide which object to lock on to  as opposed to surveillance on one and target tracking on the other side  for example in an anti aircraft system 

History edit 
Target acquisition under the doctrines of the Cold War and post Cold War were focused on identifying the capabilities  assets and identities of large troop formations  air defense systems  artillery  rockets  missiles and identifying other High Pay off Targets  HPTs  and High Value Targets  HVTs   HPTs  which if successfully engaged and neutralized  significantly contribute to the success of the  friendly commander s  course of action  HVT is a target that an  enemy commander  requires for completion of a mission  They both seem to accomplish the same  but are different when conducting the targeting analysis process 
Since the September    attacks  target acquisition has become a highly technical  robust and complex process because of the priority target types  including the targeting of individuals  Whereas a satellite can locate a missile launcher or a formation of    tanks by its shape  heat signature or size  it cannot identify and locate   of   billion individuals without having a person on the ground to recognize  report and engage that individual  This also requires an enhancement of Human Intelligence  HUMINT  sources or the enhancement of biometric technology for the purpose of positive identification of individuals in the targeting process             The Joint Targeting process is better suited for targeting individuals  The latest U S  doctrine is the JP       Joint Doctrine for Targeting
