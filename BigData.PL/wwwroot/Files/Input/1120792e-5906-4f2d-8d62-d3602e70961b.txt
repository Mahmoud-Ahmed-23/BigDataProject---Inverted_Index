In the context of human computer interaction  a modality is the classification of a single independent channel of input output between a computer and a human  Such channels may differ based on sensory nature  e g   visual vs  auditory              or other significant differences in processing  e g   text vs  image             
A system is designated unimodal if it has only one modality implemented  and multimodal if it has more than one             When multiple modalities are available for some tasks or aspects of a task  the system is said to have overlapping modalities  If multiple modalities are available for a task  the system is said to have redundant modalities  Multiple modalities can be used in combination to provide complementary methods that may be redundant but convey information more effectively             Modalities can be generally defined in two forms  computer human and human computer modalities 


Computer human modalities edit 
Computers utilize a wide range of technologies to communicate and send information to humans 

Common modalities
Vision   computer graphics typically through a screen
Audition   various audio outputs
Tactition   vibrations or other movement
Uncommon modalities
Gustation  taste 
Olfaction  smell 
Thermoception  heat 
Nociception  pain 
Equilibrioception  balance 
Any human sense can be used as a computer to human modality  However  the modalities of seeing and hearing are the most commonly employed since they are capable of transmitting information at a higher speed than other modalities      to                and     to                words per minute  respectively  Though not commonly implemented as computer human modality  tactition can achieve an average of     wpm            through the use of a refreshable Braille display  Other more common forms of tactition are smartphone and game controller vibrations 

Human computer modalities edit 
Computers can be equipped with various types of input devices and sensors to allow them to receive information from humans  Common input devices are often interchangeable if they have a standardized method of communication with the computer and afford practical adjustments to the user  Certain modalities can provide a richer interaction depending on the context  and having options for implementation allows for more robust systems            

Simple modalities
Keyboard
Pointing device
Touchscreen
Complex modalities
Computer vision
Speech recognition
Motion
Orientation
With the increasing popularity of smartphones  the general public are becoming more comfortable with the more complex modalities  Motion and orientation are commonly used in smartphone mapping applications  Speech recognition is widely used with Virtual Assistant applications  Computer Vision is now common in camera applications that are used to scan documents and QR codes 

Using multiple modalities edit 
Main article  Multimodal interaction
Having multiple modalities in a system gives more affordance to users and can contribute to a more robust system  Having more also allows for greater accessibility for users who work more effectively with certain modalities  Multiple modalities can be used as backup when certain forms of communication are not possible  This is especially true in the case of redundant modalities in which two or more modalities are used to communicate the same information  Certain combinations of modalities can add to the expression of a computer human or human computer interaction because the modalities each may be more effective at expressing one form or aspect of information than others 
There are six types of cooperation between modalities  and they help define how a combination or fusion of modalities work together to convey information more effectively            

Equivalence  information is presented in multiple ways and can be interpreted as the same information
Specialization  when a specific kind of information is always processed through the same modality
Redundancy  multiple modalities process the same information
Complementarity  multiple modalities take separate information and merge it
Transfer  a modality produces information that another modality consumes
Concurrency  multiple modalities take in separate information that is not merged
Complementary redundant systems are those which have multiple sensors to form one understanding or dataset  and the more effectively the information can be combined without duplicating data  the more effectively the modalities cooperate  Having multiple modalities for communication is common  particularly in smartphones  and often their implementations work together towards the same goal  for example gyroscopes and accelerometers working together to track movement
