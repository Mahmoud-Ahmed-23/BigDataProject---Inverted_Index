							In a major escalation of its military campaign in the Gaza Strip  Israel s security cabinet on Sunday approved a wide ranging plan dubbed  Gideon s Chariots   signaling a new phase of operations that deepens the ongoing humanitarian crisis and defies growing international pressure for a ceasefire 
The plan  endorsed by the Israeli government  includes the continued presence of occupation forces in areas they seize an apparent shift toward prolonged military control and mass displacement  It also reportedly aims to disrupt Hamas s distribution of humanitarian aid and push civilians southward under the stated goal of        protecting them        a justification that United Nations officials have flatly rejected 
According to Haaretz  the plan includes denying Hamas access to aid and entrusting distribution to foreign contractors  a move that the UN humanitarian team in Gaza said        violates fundamental humanitarian principles        and constitutes a        tactic of coercion within a military strategy         The UN s condemnation further challenges Israel s narrative of facilitating aid delivery  which critics describe as a maneuver to deflect mounting global scrutiny 
Hamas has dismissed the plan as a  deceptive maneuver  intended to obscure what it calls ongoing crimes against civilians  The group said the proposed aid mechanism amounts to political extortion and a breach of international law  particularly the Geneva Conventions  It accused Israel of pursuing a  starvation and displacement policy  to prolong the conflict 
Meanwhile  on the ground  Hamas s military wing  the Izz al Din al Qassam Brigades  announced a  complex ambush  on an Israeli engineering unit in southern Gaza  claiming multiple casualties  The Israeli military confirmed the death of a soldier from its Combat Engineering Corps in what it termed a  military operational traffic incident  in the Gaza envelope area  without explicitly linking it to the Hamas attack 
Domestically  the expansion of the military campaign has ignited growing dissent within Israel  Families of hostages held in Gaza denounced the government       s move as  a formal admission of abandoning the hostages   accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich of prioritizing territorial gains over the captives        lives  In controversial remarks made Monday in Jerusalem  Smotrich declared   We are occupying Gaza to stay  No more in and out  This is a war for victory   reiterating the government       s refusal to withdraw even in exchange for hostage releases 
The humanitarian toll continues to mount  The Gaza Ministry of Health reported on Monday that the death toll has reached         with         wounded since the conflict began on   October       Over the past    hours alone     people were killed and     injured 
Since    March       the ministry has recorded       deaths and       injuries  underscoring the unrelenting pace of Israeli strikes more than six months into the war
