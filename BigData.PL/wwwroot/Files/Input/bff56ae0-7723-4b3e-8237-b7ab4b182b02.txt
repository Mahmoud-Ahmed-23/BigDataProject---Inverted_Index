							JOHANNESBURG  The past returned to haunt Ivorian club Africa Sports on Sunday as they were eliminated from the African Champions League in the second round 
Jean Michael Sery scored in each half to earn the Abidjan club a     home victory over five time champions Zamalek of Egypt only to lose the tie     on penalties after a     aggregate deadlock 
Africa Sports suffered an identical fate in the      final  failing in a shootout at the Felix Houphouet Boigny Stadium after each club had triumphed     at home 
Defending champions Etoile Sahel of Tunisia cruised into the third and final qualifying round despite suffering a record equaling     loss at AS Douanes of Senegal

But the team from the Mediterranean resort of Sousse held on to a     first leg advantage until collapsing in the closing stages when Sadio Diao scored twice and Babacar Mbengue once 
FC     of Gabon and Sporting Club Praia of the Cape Verde Islands  the giantkillers of the first round  were among the casualties with the latter club cursing their luck 
Clinging to a one goal advantage  Praia contained Angolan police outfit InterClube in Luanda until stoppage time when Minguito struck and his team squeezed through on the away goal rule after losing     in west Africa 
Gabonese military side FC     surprisingly fell     in Libreville against twice champions Tout Puissant Mazembe  who had been held     in the Democratic Republic of Congo two weeks ago 
All the      semi finalists survived the last    stage with Al Hilal of Sudan and Al Ittihad of Libya advancing to join Etoile Sahel and Al Ahly  who had a bye  in the next phase of the      million competition 
Experienced international campaigners Hilal took a two goal advantage over debutants ZESCO United to the Zambian copperbelt town of Ndola and went ahead two minutes before half time through Ahmed Adil 
Enock Sakala converted a   th minute penalty for ZESCO to salvage a     draw while Hilal booked a third round date with Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa  who completed a double over Curepipe Starlight with a     win in Mauritius 
Former Coventry City and Sheffield Untied striker Peter Ndlovu scored the first half winner for Sundowns  his fourth goal this year in the African Football Confederation club showpiece 
Ittihad lost     at Primeiro Agosto of Angola  but qualified on the away goal rule thanks to a late srike by Mohamed Zubya after Zambian Harry Milanzi had scored twice for the home team 
JS Kabylie of Algeria  twice winners of a competition first staged    years ago  forced a     draw at AshantiGold of Ghana despite having striker Nabil Hemani sent off and progressed     on aggregate
