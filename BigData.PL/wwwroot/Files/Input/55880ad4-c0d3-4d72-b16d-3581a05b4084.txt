In ordinary language  a crime is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority             The term crime does not  in modern criminal law  have any simple and universally accepted definition             though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes             The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law  in other words  something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law             One proposed definition is that a crime or offence  or criminal offence  is an act harmful not only to some individual but also to a community  society  or the state   a public wrong    Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law                       
The notion that acts such as murder  rape  and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide             What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by the criminal law of each relevant jurisdiction  While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code  in some common law nations no such comprehensive statute exists 
The state  government  has the power to severely restrict one s liberty for committing a crime  In modern societies  there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere  If found guilty  an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence  or  depending on the nature of their offence  to undergo imprisonment  life imprisonment or  in some jurisdictions  death  
Usually  to be classified as a crime  the  act of doing something criminal   actus reus  must                  with certain exceptions                  be accompanied by the  intention to do something criminal   mens rea             
While every crime violates the law  not every violation of the law counts as a crime  Breaches of private law  torts and breaches of contract  are not automatically punished by the state  but can be enforced through civil procedure 


Definition
The exact definition of crime is a philosophical issue without an agreed upon answer  Fields such as law  politics  sociology  and psychology define crime in different ways             Crimes may be variously considered as wrongs against individuals  against the community  or against the state             The criminality of an action is dependent on its context  acts of violence will be seen as crimes in many circumstances but as permissible or desirable in others             Crime was historically seen as a manifestation of evil  but this has been superseded by modern criminal theories            

Legalism
Main article  Legalism  Western philosophy 
Legal and political definitions of crime consider actions that are banned by authorities or punishable by law              Crime is defined by the criminal law of a given jurisdiction  including all actions that are subject to criminal procedure  There is no limit to what can be considered a crime in a legal system  so there may not be a unifying principle used to determine whether an action should be designated as a crime              From a legal perspective  crimes are generally wrong actions that are severe enough to warrant punishment that infringes on the perpetrator s liberties              
English criminal law and the related common law of Commonwealth countries can define offences that the courts alone have developed over the years  without any actual legislation  common law offences  The courts used the concept of malum in se to develop various common law offences             

Sociology
As a sociological concept  crime is associated with actions that cause harm and violate social norms              Under this definition  crime is a type of social construct              and societal attitudes determine what is considered criminal                          
In legal systems based on legal moralism  the predominant moral beliefs of society determine the legal definition as well as the social definition of crime  This system is less prominent in liberal democratic societies that prioritize individualism and multiculturalism over other moral beliefs             
Paternalism defines crime not only as harm to others or to society  but also as harm to the self             

Psychology
Psychological definitions consider the state of mind of perpetrators and their relationship with their environment              

History
Early history
Restrictions on behavior existed in all prehistoric societies              Crime in early human society was seen as a personal transgression and was addressed by the community as a whole rather than through a formal legal system              often through the use of custom  religion  or the rule of a tribal leader              Some of the oldest extant writings are ancient criminal codes              The earliest known criminal code was the Code of Ur Nammu  c                    c             BC               and the first known criminal code that incorporated retaliatory justice was the Code of Hammurabi              The latter influenced the conception of crime across several civilizations over the following millennia             
The Romans systematized law and applied their system across the Roman Empire  The initial rules of Roman law regarded assaults as a matter of private compensation  The most significant Roman law concept involved dominion              Most acts recognized as crimes in ancient societies  such as violence and theft  have persisted to the modern era              The criminal justice system of Imperial China existed unbroken for over       years             
Many of the earliest conceptions of crime are associated with sin and corresponded to acts that were believed to invoke the anger of a deity              This idea was further popularized with the development of the Abrahamic religions  The understanding of crime and sin were closely associated with one another for much of history  and conceptions of crime took on many of the ideas associated with sin              Islamic law developed its own system of criminal justice as Islam spread in the seventh and eighth centuries             

Post classical era
In post classical Europe and East Asia  central government was limited and crime was defined locally  Towns established their own criminal justice systems  while crime in the countryside was defined by the social hierarchies of feudalism              In some places  such as the Russian Empire and the Kingdom of Italy  feudal justice survived into the   th century             
Common law first developed in England under the rule of Henry II in the   th century  He established a system of traveling judges that tried accused criminals in each region of England by applying precedent from previous rulings              Legal developments in   th century England also resulted in the earliest known recording of official crime data             

Modern era
In the modern era  crime came to be seen as an issue affecting society rather than conflicts between individuals  Writers such as Thomas Hobbes saw crime as a societal issue as early as the   th century             Imprisonment developed as a long term penalty for crime in the   th century              Increasing urbanization and industrialization in the   th century caused crime to become an immediate issue that affected society  prompting government intervention in crime and the establishment of criminology as its own field            
Anthropological criminology was popularized by Cesare Lombroso in the late   th century  This was a biological determinist school of thought based in social darwinism  arguing that certain people are naturally born as criminals              The eugenics movement of the early   th century similarly held that crime was caused primarily by genetic factors             
The concept of crime underwent a period of change as modernism was widely accepted in the years following World War II  Crime increasingly came to be seen as a societal issue  and criminal law was seen as a means to protect the public from antisocial behavior  This idea was associated with a larger trend in the western world toward social democracy and centre left politics             
Through most of history  reporting of crime was generally local  The advent of mass media through radio and television in the mid   th century allowed for the sensationalism of crime  This created well known stories of criminals such as Jeffrey Dahmer  and it allowed for dramatization that perpetuates misconceptions about crime              Forensic science was popularized in the     s  establishing DNA profiling as a new method to prevent and analyze crime

Virtually all countries in the   st century have criminal law grounded in civil law  common law  Islamic law  or socialist law              Historically  criminal codes have often divided criminals by class or caste  prescribing different penalties depending on status              In some tribal societies  an entire clan is recognized as liable for a crime  In many cases  disputes over a crime in this system lead to a feud that lasts over several generations             

Criminalization
Main article  Criminalization
The state determines what actions are considered criminal in the scope of the law              Criminalization has significant human rights considerations  as it can infringe on rights of autonomy and subject individuals to unjust punishment             

Law enforcement
Main article  Law enforcement
The enforcement of criminal law seeks to prevent crime and sanction crimes that do occur  This enforcement is carried out by the state through law enforcement agencies  such as police  which are empowered to arrest suspected perpetrators of crimes              Law enforcement may focus on policing individual crimes  or it may focus on bringing down overall crime rates              One common variant  community policing  seeks to prevent crime by integrating police into the community and public life             

Criminal procedure
Main article  Criminal procedure
When the perpetrator of a crime is found guilty of the crime  the state delivers a sentence to determine the penalty for the crime             

Liability

International criminal law
Main article  International criminal law
International criminal law typically addresses serious offenses  such as genocide  crimes against humanity  and war crimes              As with all international law  these laws are created through treaties and international custom              and they are defined through the consensus of the involved states              International crimes are not prosecuted through a standard legal system  though international organizations may establish tribunals to investigate and rule on egregious offenses such as genocide             

Types

Property crime
Main article  Property crime
Common examples of property crime include burglary  theft  and vandalism                         
Examples of financial crimes include counterfeiting  smuggling  tax evasion  and bribery  The scope of financial crimes has expanded significantly since the beginning of modern economics in the   th century              In occupational crime  the complexity and anonymity of computer systems may help criminal employees camouflage their operations  The victims of the most costly scams include banks  brokerage houses  insurance companies  and other large financial institutions             

Public order crime

Participants
Criminal
A criminal is an individual who commits a crime  What constitutes a criminal can vary depending on the context and the law  and it often carries a pejorative connotation              Criminals are often seen as embodying certain stereotypes or traits and are seen as a distinct type of person from law abiding citizens  Despite this  no mental or physical trend is identifiable that differentiates criminals from non criminals              Public response to criminals may be indignant or sympathetic  Indignant responses involve resentment and a desire for vengeance  wishing to see criminals removed from society or made to suffer for harm that they cause  Sympathetic responses involve compassion and understanding  seeking to rehabilitate or forgive criminals and absolve them of blame             
In the modern era  a criminal is a human being   Historically  from ancient times until the   th century  many societies believed that non human animals were capable of committing crimes  and prosecuted and punished them accordingly              Prosecutions of animals gradually dwindled during the   th century  although a few were recorded as late as the     s and     s             

Victim
See also  Victims  rights and Right to an effective remedy
A victim is an individual who has been treated unjustly or made to suffer              In the context of crime  the victim is the individual that is harmed by a violation of criminal law              Victimization is associated with post traumatic stress and a long term decrease in quality of life              Victimology is the study of victims  including their role in crime and how they are affected             
Several factors affect an individual s likelihood of becoming a victim  Some factors may cause victims of crime to experience short term or long term  repeat victimization                           Common long term victims are those that have close relationships with the criminal  manifesting in crimes such as domestic violence  embezzlement  child abuse  and bullying  Repeat victimization may also occur when a potential victim appears to be a viable target  such as when indicating wealth in a less affluent region              Many of the traits that indicate criminality also indicate victimality  victims of crime are more likely to engage in unlawful behavior and respond to provocation  Overall demographic trends of victims and criminals are often similar  and victims are more likely to have engaged in criminal activities themselves                         
The victims may only want compensation for the injuries suffered  while remaining indifferent to a possible desire for deterrence              Victims  on their own  may lack the economies of scale that could allow them to administer a penal system  let alone to collect any fines levied by a court             

Crime statistics
Information and statistics about crime in a given jurisdiction are collected as crime estimates  typically produced by national or international agencies  Methods to collect crime statistics may vary  even between jurisdictions within the same nation              Under reporting of crime is common  particularly in developing nations  resulting in the dark figure of crime              Victim studies may be used to determine the frequency of crime in a given population              The gap to official statistics is generally smaller with higher severity of the crime              Clearance rate measures the fraction of crimes where a criminal charge has been laid or the responsible person convicted              Fear of crime can be distinct from crime probability             

Public perception
Crime is often a high priority political issue in developed countries  regardless of the country s crime rates  People that are not regularly exposed to crime most often experience it through media  including news reporting and crime fiction              Exposure of crime through news stories is associated with alarmism and inaccurate perceptions of crime trends  Selection bias in new stories about criminals significantly over represent the prevalence of violent crime  and news reporting will often overemphasize a specific type of crime for a period of time  creating a  crime wave  effect              
As public opinion of morality changes over time  actions that were once condemned as crimes may be considered justifiable

Natural law theory
Justifying the state s use of force to coerce compliance with its laws has proven a consistent theoretical problem  One of the earliest justifications involved the theory of natural law  This posits that the nature of the world or of human beings underlies the standards of morality or constructs them  Thomas Aquinas wrote in the   th century   the rule and measure of human acts is the reason  which is the first principle of human acts               He regarded people as by nature rational beings  concluding that it becomes morally appropriate that they should behave in a way that conforms to their rational nature  Thus  to be valid  any law must conform to natural law and coercing people to conform to that law is morally acceptable  In the     s  William Blackstone described the thesis             

 This law of nature  being co eval with mankind and dictated by God himself  is of course superior in obligation to any other  It is binding over all the globe  in all countries  and at all times  no human laws are of any validity  if contrary to this  and such of them as are valid derive all their force  and all their authority  mediately or immediately  from this original  
But John Austin              an early positivist  applied utilitarianism in accepting the calculating nature of human beings and the existence of an objective morality  He denied that the legal validity of a norm depends on whether its content conforms to morality  Thus  in Austinian terms  a moral code can objectively determine what people ought to do  the law can embody whatever norms the legislature decrees to achieve social utility  but every individual remains free to choose what to do  Similarly  H L A  Hart saw the law as an aspect of sovereignty  with lawmakers able to adopt any law as a means to a moral end             
Thus the necessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of a proposition of law involved internal logic and consistency  and that the state s agents used state power with responsibility  Ronald Dworkin rejects Hart s theory and proposes that all individuals should expect the equal respect and concern of those who govern them as a fundamental political right  He offers a theory of compliance overlaid by a theory of deference  the citizen s duty to obey the law  and a theory of enforcement  which identifies the legitimate goals of enforcement and punishment  Legislation must conform to a theory of legitimacy  which describes the circumstances under which a particular person or group is entitled to make law  and a theory of legislative justice  which describes the law they are entitled or obliged to make             
There are natural law theorists who have accepted the idea of enforcing the prevailing morality as a primary function of the law              This view entails the problem that it makes any moral criticism of the law impossible  if conformity with natural law forms a necessary condition for legal validity  all valid law must  by definition  count as morally just  Thus  on this line of reasoning  the legal validity of a norm necessarily entails its moral justice             

Corrections and punishment
Main articles  Corrections and Punishment
Authorities may respond to crime through corrections  carrying out punishment as a means to censure the criminal act              Punishment is generally reserved for serious offenses  Individuals regularly engage in activity that could be scrutinized under criminal law but are deemed inconsequential              Retributive justice seeks to create a system of accountability and punish criminals in a way that knowingly causes suffering              This may arise out of a feeling that criminals deserve to suffer and that punishment should exist for its own sake  The existence of punishment also creates an effect of deterrence that discourages criminal action for fear of punishment               
Rehabilitation seeks to understand and mitigate the causes of a criminal s unlawful action to prevent recidivism               Different criminological theories propose different methods of rehabilitation  including strengthening social networks  reducing poverty  influencing values  and providing therapy for physical and mental ailments               Rehabilitative programs may include counseling or vocational education              
Developed nations are less likely to use physical punishments  Instead  they will impose financial penalties or imprisonment              In places with widespread corruption or limited rule of law  crime may be punished extralegally through mob rule and lynching              
Whether a crime can be resolved through financial compensation varies depending on the culture and the specific context of the crime  Historically  many societies have absolved acts of homicide through compensation to the victim s relatives              

Criminology
Main articles  Criminology and Crime science
The study of crime is called criminology              Criminology is a subfield of sociology that addresses issues of social norms  social order  deviance  and violence  It includes the motivations and consequences of crime and its perpetrators  as well as preventative measures  either studying criminal acts on an individual level or the relationship of crime and the community                            Due to the wide range of concepts associated with crime and the disagreement on a precise definition  the focus of criminology can vary considerably              Various theories within criminology provide different descriptions and explanations for crime  including social control theory  subcultural theory  strain theory  differential association  and labeling theory              
Subfields of criminology and related fields of study include crime prevention  criminal law  crime statistics  anthropological criminology  criminal psychology  criminal sociology  criminal psychiatry  victimology  penology  and forensic science               Besides sociology  criminology is often associated with law and psychology              

Causes and correlates
Main article  Causes and correlates of crime
Criminal behavior determinants include cost benefit analysis              opportunity or crime of passion               A person that commits a criminal act typically believes that its benefits will outweigh the risk of being caught and punished  Negative economic factors  such as unemployment and income inequality  can increase the incentive to commit crime  while severe punishments can deter crime in some cases             
Social factors similarly affect the likelihood of criminal activity              Crime corresponds heavily with social integration  groups that are less integrated with society or that are forcibly integrated with society are more likely to engage in crime               Involvement in the community  such as through a church  decreases the likelihood of crime  while associating with criminals increases the likelihood of becoming a criminal as well             
There is no known genetic cause of crime  Some genes have been found to affect traits that may incline individuals toward criminal activity  but no biological or physiological trait has been found to directly cause or compel criminal actions               One biological factor is the disparity between men and women  as men are significantly more likely to commit crimes than women in virtually all cultures  Crimes committed by men also tend to be more severe than those committed by women              
Crime distribution shows a long tail with a small fraction of individuals re offending many times due to high recidivism  while onset of crime at younger age predicts a longer criminal career
