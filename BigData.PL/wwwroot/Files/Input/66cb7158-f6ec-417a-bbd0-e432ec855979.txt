A graphic created by UNESCO to demonstrate some of the forms of harassment that women experience online
Online gender based violence is targeted harassment and prejudice through technology against people  disproportionately women  based on their gender  The term is also similar to online harassment  cyberbullying and cybersexism  but the latter terms are not gender specific  Gender based violence differs from these because of the attention it draws to discrimination and online violence targeted specifically because of their gender  most frequently those who identify as female  Online gender based violence can include unwanted sexual remarks  non consensual posting of sexual media  threats  doxing  cyberstalking and harassment  and gender based discriminatory memes and posts among other things  Online gender based violence derives from gender based violence but it is perpetuated through electronic means  The vulnerable groups include the asexual  bisexual  gay  intersex  trans  intersex  queer  and lesbian  Online gender based violence may occur through various ways  These include impersonation  hacking  spamming  tracking and surveillance  malicious sharing of intimate messages and photos 


Forms edit 
Since the introduction of the internet  the presence of online gender based violence has grown exponentially  While online gender based violence can target anyone  it disproportionately targets those who identify as female  This violence and targeted harassment comes in many forms  One common space where online gender based violence occurs is in the blogosphere  This is a male dominated space where female bloggers are criticized at a higher rate than male bloggers  There are frequently comments under female written blogs which are sexually violent in nature              Another common place where online gender based violence takes place is in the form of trolling  This includes derogatory comments and sexist  inflammatory comments  This is online gender based violence masked as a harmless  aimless activity  It also includes cyber sexism played off as humorous and harmless when in reality it reinforces harmful stereotypes  violence  and gender based power structures that dominant both the offline and online world             Memes are another form through which online gender based violence is spread  These are images created to present sexist jokes  sexual violence  and gender stereotypes while playing it off as simply something humorous  Hashtags are used in order to make sexist commentary and topics go viral  which then inserts sexist ideology into the mainstream social media            

Types edit 
Within the broader definition  there are various types of online gender based violence  One type is online domestic violence  where perpetrators use the internet to exploit the intimate and private knowledge that they have of their partner in order to hurt them  They also use intimate photos and videos to assert power and violence over their partner             Research by Sameer Hinduja and Justin Patchin have studied this phenomenon  which they term  digital dating abuse   finding that     of students in a romantic relationship the previous year had been victimized in this manner  Males       were victimized more often  compared to females        and experiencing offline dating violence was the strongest identified correlate of online dating violence  Other key findings included links to depression  sexting  and cyberbullying victimization            
Cyberstalking is another type of online gender based violence  It has been reported that     of women aged       have reported being stalked through the use of telecommunication tools afforded by the internet and social media             A recent systematic literature review by Puneet Kaur et al   identified that the prevalence of cyberstalking is unclear  with empirical studies identifying rates as low as      and as high as      this wide variation is likely due to divergent sampling methodologies  conceptualization and operationalization of the term  reticence in reporting  and even differences across demographic groups            

Causes edit 
Online gender based violence emerges from misogyny in physical spaces and the cultural norms that guide our lives  Accepted forms of gender based violence include in person contact such as  intimate partner violence  street harassment  rape  and others described in violence against women  All of these have resulted in the creation of online forms of gender based violence  Other causes of violence include the practices of online communities and lack of regulations that address gender specific harassment and violence in these communities 

Cultural edit 
The societal acceptance of norms that are deemed  misogynistic  has a large impact on the prevalence of gender based violence online  Cultural norms and beliefs are carried from physical communities into online spaces by actors who engage in this behavior in person or who already agree with misogynist ideas  People who engage in physical violence against women also are likely to engage in online forms of violence             Through cultural causes  scholars claim that rather than technology creating violence online  it simply provides a new platform which users adapt to suit their desired action  some of which may include acts such as doxing  threatening  or stalking women             Culture also can influence the popularity of violent activity against women when these behaviors are perpetrated or normalized by celebrities  This is also true when acts of gender violence are normalized against female celebrities and public figures             These cultural causes can have large or small impacts depending on the identity of the victim or the context  For instance  acts of gender based violence may be more common in fields such as politics where strong ideologies about women s roles and misogyny are already present  This would include cases where the victim is working in politics or the threats and violent behavior came as a response to a political post             

Algorithmic edit 
Although cultural norms are one cause of gender violence that can attract some actors to perpetrate these behaviors  online algorithms and behavior can bring about another factor that causes violent behavior  Public comments on social media applications such as Twitter and Facebook can lead to other users agreeing with and adding their own additional comments  In cases of online harassment  these additional users  actions are caused when the original threat or internet troll comment is perceived as acceptable or when they become normalized and more common in the user s feed              These threads of gendered trolling can be inflated by algorithm behaviors  in many cases online systems  boost  negative posts leading them to reach a larger audience and gain more violent responses              Cases where the violence is instigated and grows because of perceptions of lawlessness as well as cases where online algorithms are responsible for the growth in harassment are both examples of how gender based violence can be instigated online 

Structural edit 
Some forms of gender based violence online are caused by the availability of online spaces for communities with misogynistic and violent ideas about women  Systems which provide online formats such as Reddit or Tor can often become popular among groups with violent ideas or who would like to remain anonymous              Anonymous online spaces allow subcultures like incels to grow  In many of these spaces  misogyny and rape fantasies are commonly discussed and these spaces can teach individuals that violent acts and behavior is acceptable  In some cases  incel forums have had a role in encouraging violent behavior among members              The spread of violent and gendered rhetoric is not isolated to one subculture and can be normalized and taught in a variety of groups 
Structural inequalities that exist at the core of technological landscapes reproduce discriminate practices geared towards women  Women are being kept offline because of the arguably unsafe digital field that has been cultivated through misogynistic  aggressive  and threatening practices              Schemas that classify women as less valuable generators of knowledge and less relevant actors in social spaces result in knowledge gaps online through the generation of feelings of unsafe spaces online for women to participate  Trends of women and individuals of low socio economic status producing less content online poses a threat to the democratization of the internet             
Despite its status as the most participatory site on the internet  Wikipedia perpetrates these inequalities and does not serve as a safe knowledge outlet for women  The exacerbation of knowledge gaps harms women by limiting their capacity to contribute to the digital world and prevents social mobility through the lack of access to information regarding female generated information and biographies             
An example of the perpetuated gender inequality on Wikipedia exists in interpretations of gendered language  particularly on articles about women  in which the use of gendered language  e g    female  or  wife   implies a gender binary from which interpretations of heteronormativity are applied to the content of the article itself  Such use of female gendered language affects the notability of the article in question  an article is considered more notable if gendered language is used in conjunction with a particular achievement  e g    first female mayor    The discussion of the notability of a Wikipedia article also involves its relevance to other context existent on Wikipedia  an article is more likely to be marked for deletion if it lacks hyperlinks to other Wikipedia articles  A Wikipedia article with low notability according to its point of view is more likely to be marked for deletion              Reports of women claiming that editing Wikipedia articles is something that they fear is a critical component of gender based violence online  Women in Red  a group of editors committed to improving structural inequalities on Wikipedia through the creation of female generated content  describes how efforts for female publication are challenged by being flagged as non notable and thus nominated for deletion 
Gender inequality on Wikipedia is also exemplified through the reluctance of female editors to edit existing pages  Studies have found that male editors overwhelmingly populate the percentage of Wikipedia page editors at approximately                     Issues of safety are relevant in this conversation as the small proportion of women who do participate in these edits feel pressured to reside within the  quiet corners  of Wikipedia as a personal precaution              This implies that women choose to integrate their edits within topics and pages that are not prone to harassment by other editors  Participation in Wikipedia article editing requires heavy emotional labor for women due to its hostile and judgmental environment posed by existing gender inequalities  Overcoming gender barriers online presents challenges that have been mitigated in physical spaces  That is  anonymity and efficiency that coincide with the essence of the technological media allow for past prejudices to pervade participatory publishing sites 

Impact edit 
Gender based violence online can impact the development and mental health of victims in similar ways to physical forms of violence and bullying  Unlike those physically attacked  online formats make it much possible for victims to receive hundreds or thousands of threats and violent comments in a short span of time  This can lead to different effects than would be expected in cases of physical assault or violence             

Youth experience edit 
Among victims who are minors  these experiences and the impacts are similar  Along with the experiences of cyberbullying  young people can experience specific impacts from gendered violence online  This more commonly appears as difficulty forming healthy relationships or trust after receiving violent threats              Young people may also fear for their safety following events of online violence and many become less involved in online communities or in activities out of fear that these actions could lead to further violence against the victim 

Adult experiences edit 
Acts of violence and harassment online can lead victims to withdraw from social environments  both online and in person              Young women aged       are far more likely to experience online harassment than older women  most likely due to their level of access and involvement with online communities and causes them to be more likely to experience the negative impacts of online gendered violence             Other impacts victims may experience depression and other mental health issues             

Gamergate edit 
One of the most notorious instances of widespread gender based violence is the Gamergate controversy  Beginning in August       this controversy evolved into a widespread harassment campaign against female identifying internet users  Proliferated through the hashtag  Gamergate  this controversy shows how at risk female identifying internet users and content creators are to harassment  death threats  and sexually derogatory attacks among other things  These online threats translated into the personal lives of the women being attacked  many were forced to relocate  stay in close contact with the police  and cancel scheduled in person events  The Gamergate controversy shows how widespread and damaging online gender based violence is  and how quickly this sort of harassment and abuse is able to spread online              This is also an example of online gender based violence where women were attacked who were attempting to raise issues regarding online gender based violence 

Impacts edit 
Online gender based violence can have both online and offline effects  Online abuse and violence may silence and sensor women s voices  It may also threaten women s offline safety  Online violence and threats may cause the affected gender to fear for their offline safety  It may also affect their offline jobs due to the fear of being attacked physically 
Online gender based abuse and violence is an intersectional challenge  The perpeterators of online gender based violence target the vulnerable members of a particular gender  including the women of color and the LGBTQ 

Addressing gender based harassment edit 
In the United States edit 
The United States Department of State currently has policies which address gender based violence  but do not have develop policies regarding online gender based violence  The United States has not addressed online gender based violence on a legislative level             despite there being a push from activists and internet users for more concrete policies that denounce and decrease the pervasiveness of online gender based violence 

Internationally edit 
There are organizations across the world seeking to address the problem of online gender based violence  These include United Nations organizations such as the UNESCO             and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights             
The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency  SIDA  is an agency of the Swedish government working to bring awareness to online gender based violence in the hopes of increasing regulations  They have also published a report which found that over the last few years  online gender based violence has garnered acknowledgment within the international community  The SIDA report serves as a source of information to further regulation process  It also noted the role of organizations such as the Women s Rights Programme of the Association of Progressive Communication in pushing for an increase in substantive policies regarding online gender based violence  This report also points out the discrepancies between international regulations and state implementation             
The Association for Progressive Communications  APC  has been working since      to end violence against women in the online space by strengthening women s rights organizations and activists working to end online gender based violence              One of their projects in particular   End violence  Women s rights and safety online  focuses on strengthening women s safety and security  by preventing the growing violence against women through ICTs   is being carried out in seven countries worldwide  Countries are  Bosnia Herzegovina  Colombia  Democratic Republic of Congo  Kenya  Mexico  Pakistan  and the Philippines  Some other APC projects include websites such as Take Back The Tech  and  GenderIT org  which focus on providing tools for coping with receiving online gender based violence and defend against online internet users who are spreading online gender based violence
