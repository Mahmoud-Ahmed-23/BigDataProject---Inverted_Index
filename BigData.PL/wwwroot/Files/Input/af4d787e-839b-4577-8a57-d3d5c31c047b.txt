Italian computer engineer and scientist
Not to be confused with Alberto Caramella 
Alberto Ciaramella  born                  is an Italian computer engineer and scientist  He is notable for extensive pioneering contributions in the field of speech technologies and applied natural language processing  most of them at CSELT and Loquendo  with the amount of    papers and four patents 


Biography edit 
Ciaramella obtained the Laurea in Electronic Engineering and the Post Laurea in      at La Sapienza University in Rome with prof  Antonio Ruberti as supervisor of his thesis  Then  he joined CSELT as a research engineer 
In      he patented at CSELT one of the first architecture independent bootstrap devices that allowed the Gruppi Speciali  the first electronic Italian telephone switch and the most advanced project in Italian in the seventies             to start up by pushing a single button from a ROM memory in case of failure            
During the   s Ciaramella took part in some European projects  Esprit P    SUNDIAL             in the pioneering field of speech recognition and dialogue systems on many European languages  such as Italian  during which he proposed a method to evaluate the quality of the dialogue systems by comparing the meanings                       
In      he co authored one of the first international patents on speaker recognition                                   a new research field at that time  applied commercially in a speech recognition software licensed by CSELT 
In      he co authored one of the first international patents of a real time speech recognition system integrated in a microprocessor suitable for being used by a Telecommunication company                          the microprocessor was named RIPAC  Riconoscitore di Parlato Connesso   as stated in the patent description itself                          
Extensive research was conducted on the Hidden Markov Model aimed to speech recognition tasks  by using small such as big dictionaries and applied to many cases   e g  the recognition of the children s voice  or browser navigation by voice              Other contributions include test and proposals in international communication standards  such as VoiceXML             
In      the CSELT s voice technology group became Loquendo and Alberto Ciaramella became Competitive intelligence supervisor of the company 
In      Ciaramella founded IntelliSemantic             at the Incubator of Politecnico di Torino  an innovative company that works in the field of Competitive Business Intelligence  Also within his present company  he continues the research in the field of the applied language technologies  In      he co authored a paper about his view about the application of the emerging  semantic  technologies to the patent analysis              which became popular in the field of Patent Informatics  and took part in Topas European project             focused on patent summarization
