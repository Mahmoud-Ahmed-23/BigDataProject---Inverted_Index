John McCarthy  September           October           was an American computer scientist and cognitive scientist  He was one of the founders of the discipline of artificial intelligence             He co authored the document that coined the term  artificial intelligence   AI   developed the programming language family Lisp  significantly influenced the design of the language ALGOL  popularized time sharing  and invented garbage collection 
McCarthy spent most of his career at Stanford University             He received many accolades and honors  such as the      Turing Award for his contributions to the topic of AI             the United States National Medal of Science  and the Kyoto Prize 


Early life and education edit 
John McCarthy was born in Boston  Massachusetts  on September          to an Irish immigrant father and a Lithuanian Jewish immigrant mother             John Patrick and Ida  Glatt  McCarthy  The family was obliged to relocate frequently during the Great Depression  until McCarthy s father found work as an organizer for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers in Los Angeles  California  His father came from Cromane  a small fishing village in County Kerry  Ireland             His mother died in                 
Both parents were active members of the Communist Party during the     s  and they encouraged learning and critical thinking  Before he attended high school  McCarthy became interested in science by reading a translation of         Whys  a Russian popular science book for children              He was fluent in the Russian language and made friends with Russian scientists during multiple trips to the Soviet Union  but distanced himself after making visits to the Soviet Bloc  which led to him becoming a conservative Republican            
McCarthy graduated from Belmont High School two years early            and was accepted into Caltech in      
He showed an early aptitude for mathematics  during his teens  he taught himself college math by studying the textbooks used at the nearby California Institute of Technology  Caltech   As a result  he was able to skip the first two years of math at Caltech              He was suspended from Caltech for failure to attend physical education courses              He then served in the US Army and was readmitted  receiving a Bachelor of Science  BS  in mathematics in                  
It was at Caltech that he attended a lecture by John von Neumann that inspired his future endeavors 
McCarthy completed his graduate studies at Caltech before moving to Princeton University  where he received a PhD in mathematics in      with his dissertation  Projection operators and partial differential equations   under the supervision of Donald C  Spencer             

Academic career edit 
After short term appointments at Princeton and Stanford University  McCarthy became an assistant professor at Dartmouth in      
A year later  he moved to MIT as a research fellow in the autumn of       By the end of his years at Massachusetts Institute of Technology  MIT  he was already affectionately referred to as  Uncle John  by his students             
In       he became a full professor at Stanford  where he remained until his retirement in      
McCarthy championed mathematics such as lambda calculus and invented logics for achieving common sense in artificial intelligence 

Contributions in computer science edit 
McCarthy in     
John McCarthy is one of the  founding fathers  of artificial intelligence  together with Alan Turing  Marvin Minsky  Allen Newell  and Herbert A  Simon  McCarthy  Minsky  Nathaniel Rochester and Claude E  Shannon coined the term  artificial intelligence  in a proposal that they wrote for the famous Dartmouth conference in Summer       This conference started AI as a field                          Minsky later joined McCarthy at MIT in       
In       he proposed the advice taker  which inspired later work on question answering and logic programming 
In the late     s  McCarthy discovered that primitive recursive functions could be extended to compute with symbolic expressions  producing the Lisp programming language              That functional programming seminal paper also introduced the lambda notation borrowed from the syntax of lambda calculus in which later dialects like Scheme based its semantics  Lisp soon became the programming language of choice for AI applications after its publication in      
In       McCarthy served on an Association for Computing Machinery ad hoc committee on Languages that became part of the committee that designed ALGOL     In August      he proposed the use of recursion and conditional expressions  which became part of ALGOL              He then became involved with developing international standards in programming and informatics  as a member of the International Federation for Information Processing  IFIP  Working Group     on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi              which specified  maintains  and supports ALGOL    and ALGOL                
Around       he invented so called  garbage collection  methods  a kind of automatic memory management  to solve problems in Lisp                         
During his time at MIT  he helped motivate the creation of Project MAC  and while at Stanford University  he helped establish the Stanford AI Laboratory  for many years a friendly rival to Project MAC 
McCarthy was instrumental in the creation of three of the very earliest time sharing systems  Compatible Time Sharing System  BBN Time Sharing System  and Dartmouth Time Sharing System   His colleague Lester Earnest told the Los Angeles Times 

The Internet would not have happened nearly as soon as it did except for the fact that John initiated the development of time sharing systems  We keep inventing new names for time sharing  It came to be called servers          Now we call it cloud computing  That is still just time sharing  John started it                    Elaine Woo
In       he was perhaps the first to suggest publicly the idea of utility computing  in a speech given to celebrate MIT s centennial  that computer time sharing technology might result in a future in which computing power and even specific applications could be sold through the utility business model  like water or electricity                            This idea of a computer or information utility was very popular during the late     s  but had faded by the mid     s  However  since       the idea has resurfaced in new forms  see application service provider  grid computing  and cloud computing  
In       McCarthy and his team at Stanford wrote a computer program used to play a series of chess games with counterparts in the Soviet Union  McCarthy s team lost two games and drew two games  see Kotok McCarthy  
From      to       McCarthy developed the circumscription method of non monotonic reasoning 
In       he seems to have originated the idea of the space fountain  a type of tower extending into space and kept vertical by the outward force of a stream of pellets propelled from Earth along a sort of conveyor belt which returns the pellets to Earth  Payloads would ride the conveyor belt upward             

Other activities edit 
McCarthy often commented on world affairs on the Usenet forums  Some of his ideas can be found in his sustainability Web page              which is  aimed at showing that human material progress is desirable and sustainable   McCarthy was an avid book reader  an optimist  and a staunch supporter of free speech  His best Usenet interaction is visible in rec arts books archives  He actively attended San Francisco  SF  Bay Area dinners in Palo Alto of r a b  readers  called rab fests  He went on to defend free speech criticism involving European ethnic jokes at Stanford             
McCarthy saw the importance of mathematics and mathematics education  His Usenet signature block   sig  for years was   He who refuses to do arithmetic is doomed to talk nonsense   his license plate cover read  similarly   Do the arithmetic or be doomed to talk nonsense                           He advised    PhD graduates             
His      short story  The Robot and the Baby              farcically explored the question of whether robots should have  or simulate having  emotions  and anticipated aspects of Internet culture and social networking that became increasingly prominent during ensuing decades             

Personal life edit 
McCarthy was married three times  His second wife was Vera Watson  a programmer and mountaineer who died in      attempting to scale Annapurna I Central as part of an all women expedition  He later married Carolyn Talcott  a computer scientist at Stanford and later Scientific Research Institute  SRI  International                         
McCarthy declared himself an atheist in a speech about artificial intelligence at Stanford Memorial Church                                      Raised as a Communist  he became a conservative Republican after a visit to Czechoslovakia in      after the Soviet invasion              He died at his home in Stanford on October                      

Philosophy of artificial intelligence edit 
In      McCarthy wrote an article             entitled  Ascribing Mental Qualities to Machines   In it he wrote   Machines as simple as thermostats can be said to have beliefs  and having beliefs seems to be a characteristic of most machines capable of problem solving performance   In      the philosopher John Searle responded with his famous Chinese Room Argument                          disagreeing with McCarthy and taking the stance that machines cannot have beliefs simply because they are not conscious  Searle argues that machines lack intentionality  A vast amount of literature      example needed      has been written in support of one side or the other
