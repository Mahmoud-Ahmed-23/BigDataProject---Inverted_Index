Full text Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons at Wikisource
The United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons  CCW or CCWC   concluded at Geneva on October           and entered into force in December       seeks to prohibit or restrict the use of certain conventional weapons which are considered excessively injurious or whose effects are indiscriminate  The full title is Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects  The convention covers land mines  booby traps  incendiary devices  blinding laser weapons and clearance of explosive remnants of war 


Objectives edit 
The aim of the Convention and its protocols is to provide new rules for the protection of civilians from injury by weapons that are used in armed conflicts and also to protect combatants from unnecessary suffering   The convention covers fragments that are undetectable in the human body by X rays  landmines and booby traps  and incendiary weapons  blinding laser weapons and the clearance of explosive remnants of war  Parties to the convention must take legislative and other actions to ensure compliance with the convention            
CCWC includes five protocols dealing with specific weapons  The Convention and its annexed protocols apply in all types of armed conflict  both international and non international  This was not the case when the convention was first adopted  but the scope was expanded by two conferences in      and       Some provisions also apply after open hostilities has ended  such as the rules in protocols II and V about minimizing the dangers from mines and other ordnance            
CCWC lacks verification and enforcement mechanisms and spells out no formal process for resolving compliance concerns  A state party can refute its commitment to the convention or any of the protocols  but it will remain legally bound until one year after notifying the treaty depositary  the UN Secretary General  of its intent to be free of its obligations      citation needed     

Adoption and entry into force edit 
The CCWC consist of a set of additional protocols first formulated on October           in Geneva and entered into force on December          As of the end of September       there are     state parties to the convention             Some of those countries have only adopted some of the five protocols  with two being the minimum required to be considered a party            
The convention has five protocols 

Protocol I restricts weapons with non detectable fragments
Protocol II restricts landmines  booby traps
Protocol III restricts incendiary weapons
Protocol IV restricts blinding laser weapons  adopted on October           in Vienna 
Protocol V sets out obligations and best practice for the clearance of explosive remnants of war  adopted on November           in Geneva           
Protocol II was amended in       extending its scope of application   and entered in force on December          The amendment extended the restrictions on landmine use to internal conflicts  established reliability standards for remotely delivered mines  and prohibited the use of non detectable fragments in anti personnel landmines  APL   The failure to agree to a total ban on landmines led to the Ottawa Treaty            

Protocol I  Non Detectable Fragments edit 
Protocol I on Non Detectable Fragments prohibits the use of any weapon the primary effect of which is to injure by fragments which are not detectable in the human body by X rays                        The reason is that such fragments are difficult to remove and cause unnecessary suffering  The protocol applies when the  primary effect  is to injure by non detectable fragments and does not prohibit all use of e g  plastic in weapons design            

Protocol II  Mines  Booby Traps and Other Devices edit 
Main article  Protocol on Mines  Booby Traps and Other Devices
Protocol II on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines  Booby Traps and Other Devices was amended on May          to strengthen its provisions and extend the scope of application to cover both international and internal armed conflicts  The protocol regulates  but does not ban  land mines  It prohibits the use of non detectable anti personnel mines and their transfer  prohibits the use of non self destructing and non self deactivating mines outside fenced  monitored and marked areas  prohibits directing mines and booby traps against civilians  requires parties to the conflict to remove mines and booby traps when the conflict ends  broadens obligations of protecting peacekeeping and other missions of the United Nations and its agencies  requires States to enforce compliance with its provisions within their jurisdiction  and calls for penal sanctions in case of violation                       

Protocol III  Incendiary Weapons edit 
Main article  Protocol on Incendiary Weapons
Protocol III on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Incendiary Weapons prohibits  in all circumstances  making the civilian population as such  individual civilians or civilian objects  the object of attack by any weapon or munition which is primarily designed to set fire to objects or to cause burn injury to persons through the action of flame  heat or a combination thereof  produced by a chemical reaction of a substance delivered on the target  The protocol also prohibits the use of air delivered incendiary weapons against military targets within a concentration of civilians  and limits the use of incendiary weapons delivered by other means  Forest and other plants may not be a target unless they are used to conceal combatants or other military objectives                       
Protocol III lists certain munition types like smoke shells which only have a secondary or additional incendiary effect  these munition types are not considered to be incendiary weapons             

Protocol IV  Blinding Laser Weapons edit 
Main article  Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons
Protocol IV on Blinding Laser Weapons prohibits the use of laser weapons specifically designed to cause permanent blindness  The parties to the protocol also agree to not transfer such weapons to any state or non state entity             The protocol does not prohibit laser systems where blinding is an incidental or collateral effect  but parties that agree to it must take all feasible precautions to avoid such effects                         

Protocol V  Explosive Remnants of War edit 
Main article  Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War
Protocol V on Explosive Remnants of War requires the clearance of UXO  unexploded ordnance   such as unexploded bomblets from cluster bombs and abandoned explosive weapons  At the cessation of active hostilities  Protocol V establishes a responsibility on parties that have used explosive weapons to assist with the clearance of unexploded ordnance that this use has created  Parties are also required  subject to certain qualifications  to provide information on their use of explosive weapons  Each party is responsible for the territory in their control after a conflict  The protocol does not apply to mines and other weapons covered by protocol II                         The protocol came about as a result of a growing awareness during the     s that the protection against unexploded ordnance was insufficient  The protocol was adopted in      and entered into force in                  

Other proposals edit 
As of       the CCW has failed to achieve consensus to open negotiations on adding a compliance mechanism to help ensure parties honor their commitments  China and Russia have opposed restrictions on anti vehicle mines  such as a requirement that such mines self deactivate              In the     s the CCW opened talks on restricting lethal autonomous weapons              As of       most of the major powers oppose an international ban on lethal autonomous weapons
