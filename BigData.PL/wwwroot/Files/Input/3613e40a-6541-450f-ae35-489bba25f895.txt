Automatic image annotation  also known as automatic image tagging or linguistic indexing  is the process by which a computer system automatically assigns metadata in the form of captioning or keywords to a digital image  This application of computer vision techniques is used in image retrieval systems to organize and locate images of interest from a database 
This method can be regarded as a type of multi class image classification with a very large number of classes   as large as the vocabulary size  Typically  image analysis in the form of extracted feature vectors and the training annotation words are used by machine learning techniques to attempt to automatically apply annotations to new images             The first methods learned the correlations between image features and training annotations  Subsequently  techniques were developed using machine translation to  to attempt to translate the textual vocabulary into the  visual vocabulary   represented by clustered regions known as blobs  Subsequent work has included classification approaches  relevance models  and other related methods 
The advantages of automatic image annotation versus content based image retrieval  CBIR  are that queries can be more naturally specified by the user             At present  Content Based Image Retrieval  CBIR  generally requires users to search by image concepts such as color and texture or by finding example queries  However  certain image features in example images may override the concept that the user is truly focusing on  Traditional methods of image retrieval  such as those used by libraries  have relied on manually annotated images  which is expensive and time consuming  especially given the large and constantly growing image databases in existence
