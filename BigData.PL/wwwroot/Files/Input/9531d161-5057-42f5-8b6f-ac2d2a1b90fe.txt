Intellectual isolation through internet algorithms
 Social media bubble  redirects here  For the technology boom and bust phenomenon  see Social media stock bubble 


Social media inadvertently isolates users into their own ideological filter bubbles  according to internet activist Eli Pariser
A filter bubble or ideological frame is a state of intellectual isolation            that can result from personalized searches  recommendation systems  and algorithmic curation  The search results are based on information about the user  such as their location  past click behavior  and search history             Consequently  users become separated from information that disagrees with their viewpoints  effectively isolating them in their own cultural or ideological bubbles  resulting in a limited and customized view of the world             The choices made by these algorithms are only sometimes transparent             Prime examples include Google Personalized Search results and Facebook s personalized news stream 
However  there are conflicting reports about the extent to which personalized filtering happens and whether such activity is beneficial or harmful  with various studies producing inconclusive results 
The term filter bubble was coined by internet activist Eli Pariser circa       In Pariser s influential book under the same name  The Filter Bubble         it was predicted that individualized personalization by algorithmic filtering would lead to intellectual isolation and social fragmentation             The bubble effect may have negative implications for civic discourse  according to Pariser  but contrasting views regard the effect as minimal            and addressable             According to Pariser  users get less exposure to conflicting viewpoints and are isolated intellectually in their informational bubble             He related an example in which one user searched Google for  BP  and got investment news about BP  while another searcher got information about the Deepwater Horizon oil spill  noting that the two search results pages were  strikingly different  despite use of the same key words                                               The results of the U S  presidential election in      have been associated with the influence of social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook              and as a result have called into question the effects of the  filter bubble  phenomenon on user exposure to fake news and echo chambers              spurring new interest in the term              with many concerned that the phenomenon may harm democracy and well being by making the effects of misinformation worse                                                                         


Concept edit 
The term filter bubble was coined by internet activist Eli Pariser  circa      
Pariser defined his concept of a filter bubble in more formal terms as  that personal ecosystem of information that s been catered by these algorithms              An internet user s past browsing and search history is built up over time when they indicate interest in topics by  clicking links  viewing friends  putting movies in  their  queue  reading news stories   and so forth              An internet firm then uses this information to target advertising to the user  or make certain types of information appear more prominently in search results pages             
This process is not random  as it operates under a three step process  per Pariser  who states   First  you figure out who people are and what they like  Then  you provide them with content and services that best fit them  Finally  you tune in to get the fit just right  Your identity shapes your media               Pariser also reports 

According to one Wall Street Journal study  the top fifty Internet sites  from CNN to Yahoo to MSN  install an average of    data laden cookies and personal tracking beacons  Search for a word like  depression  on Dictionary com  and the site installs up to     tracking cookies and beacons on your computer so that other Web sites can target you with antidepressants  Share an article about cooking on ABC News  and you may be chased around the Web by ads for Teflon coated pots  Open even for an instant a page listing signs that your spouse may be cheating and prepare to be haunted by DNA paternity test ads             
Accessing the data of link clicks displayed through site traffic measurements determines that filter bubbles can be collective or individual             
As of       one engineer had told Pariser that Google looked at    different pieces of data to personally tailor a user s search results  including non cookie data such as the type of computer being used and the user s physical location             
Pariser s idea of the filter bubble was popularized after the TED talk in May       in which he gave examples of how filter bubbles work and where they can be seen  In a test seeking to demonstrate the filter bubble effect  Pariser asked several friends to search for the word  Egypt  on Google and send him the results  Comparing two of the friends  first pages of results  while there was overlap between them on topics like news and travel  one friend s results prominently included links to information on the then ongoing Egyptian revolution of       while the other friend s first page of results did not include such links             
In The Filter Bubble  Pariser warns that a potential downside to filtered searching is that it  closes us off to new ideas  subjects  and important information               and  creates the impression that our narrow self interest is all that exists              In his view  filter bubbles are potentially harmful to both individuals and society  He criticized Google and Facebook for offering users  too much candy and not enough carrots               He warned that  invisible algorithmic editing of the web  may limit our exposure to new information and narrow our outlook              According to Pariser  the detrimental effects of filter bubbles include harm to the general society in the sense that they have the possibility of  undermining civic discourse  and making people more vulnerable to  propaganda and manipulation              He wrote 

A world constructed from the familiar is a world in which there s nothing to learn      since there is  invisible autopropaganda  indoctrinating us with our own ideas         Eli Pariser in The Economist                  
Many people are unaware that filter bubbles even exist  This can be seen in an article in The Guardian  which mentioned the fact that  more than     of Facebook users are entirely unaware of any curation on Facebook at all  believing instead that every single story from their friends and followed pages appeared in their news feed               A brief explanation for how Facebook decides what goes on a user s news feed is through an algorithm that takes into account  how you have interacted with similar posts in the past              

Extensions of concept edit 
A filter bubble has been described as exacerbating a phenomenon that called splinternet or cyberbalkanization      Note        which happens when the internet becomes divided into sub groups of like minded people who become insulated within their own online community and fail to get exposure to different views  This concern dates back to the early days of the publicly accessible internet  with the term  cyberbalkanization  being coined in                                           Other terms have been used to describe this phenomenon  including  ideological frames             and  the figurative sphere surrounding you as you search the internet              
The concept of a filter bubble has been extended into other areas  to describe societies that self segregate according political views but also economic  social  and cultural situations               That bubbling results in a loss of the broader community and creates the sense that for example  children do not belong at social events unless those events were especially planned to be appealing for children and unappealing for adults without children             
Barack Obama s farewell address identified a similar concept to filter bubbles as a  threat to  Americans   democracy   i e   the  retreat into our own bubbles     especially our social media feeds  surrounded by people who look like us and share the same political outlook and never challenge our assumptions    And increasingly  we become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information  whether it s true or not  that fits our opinions  instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out there              

Comparison with echo chambers edit 
Further information  Echo chamber  media 
Both  echo chambers  and  filter bubbles  describe situations where individuals are exposed to a narrow range of opinions and perspectives that reinforce their existing beliefs and biases  but there are some subtle differences between the two  especially in practices surrounding social media                         
Specific to news media  an echo chamber is a metaphorical description of a situation in which beliefs are amplified or reinforced by communication and repetition inside a closed system                           Based on the sociological concept of selective exposure theory  the term is a metaphor based on the acoustic echo chamber  where sounds reverberate in a hollow enclosure  With regard to social media  this sort of situation feeds into explicit mechanisms of self selected personalization  which describes all processes in which users of a given platform can actively opt in and out of information consumption  such as a user s ability to follow other users or select into groups             
In an echo chamber  people are able to seek out information that reinforces their existing views  potentially as an unconscious exercise of confirmation bias  This sort of feedback regulation may increase political and social polarization and extremism  This can lead to users aggregating into homophilic clusters within social networks  which contributes to group polarization               Echo chambers  reinforce an individual s beliefs without factual support  Individuals are surrounded by those who acknowledge and follow the same viewpoints  but they also possess the agency to break outside of the echo chambers             
On the other hand  filter bubbles are implicit mechanisms of pre selected personalization  where a user s media consumption is created by personalized algorithms  the content a user sees is filtered through an AI driven algorithm that reinforces their existing beliefs and preferences  potentially excluding contrary or diverse perspectives  In this case  users have a more passive role and are perceived as victims of a technology that automatically limits their exposure to information that would challenge their world view              Some researchers argue  however  that because users still play an active role in selectively curating their own newsfeeds and information sources through their interactions with search engines and social media networks  that they directly assist in the filtering process by AI driven algorithms  thus effectively engaging in self segregating filter bubbles             
Despite their differences  the usage of these terms go hand in hand in both academic and platform studies  It is often hard to distinguish between the two concepts in social network studies  due to limitations in accessibility of the filtering algorithms  that perhaps could enable researchers to compare and contrast the agencies of the two concepts              This type of research will continue to grow more difficult to conduct  as many social media networks have also begun to limit API access needed for academic research             

Reactions and studies edit 
Media reactions edit 
There are conflicting reports about the extent to which personalized filtering happens and whether such activity is beneficial or harmful  Analyst Jacob Weisberg  writing in June      for Slate  did a small non scientific experiment to test Pariser s theory which involved five associates with different ideological backgrounds conducting a series of searches   John Boehner    Barney Frank    Ryan plan   and  Obamacare   and sending Weisberg screenshots of their results  The results varied only in minor respects from person to person  and any differences did not appear to be ideology related  leading Weisberg to conclude that a filter bubble was not in effect  and to write that the idea that most internet users were  feeding at the trough of a Daily Me  was overblown             Weisberg asked Google to comment  and a spokesperson stated that algorithms were in place to deliberately  limit personalization and promote variety              Book reviewer Paul Boutin did a similar experiment to Weisberg s among people with differing search histories and again found that the different searchers received nearly identical search results             Interviewing programmers at Google  off the record  journalist Per Grankvist           sv      found that user data used to play a bigger role in determining search results but that Google  through testing  found that the search query is by far the best determinant of what results to display             
There are reports that Google and other sites maintain vast  dossiers  of information on their users  which might enable them to personalize individual internet experiences further if they choose to do so  For instance  the technology exists for Google to keep track of users  histories even if they don t have a personal Google account or are not logged into one             One report stated that Google had collected     years  worth  of information amassed from varying sources  such as Gmail  Google Maps  and other services besides its search engine                  failed verification      although a contrary report was that trying to personalize the internet for each user  was technically challenging for an internet firm to achieve despite the huge amounts of available data      citation needed      Analyst Doug Gross of CNN suggested that filtered searching seemed to be more helpful for consumers than for citizens  and would help a consumer looking for  pizza  find local delivery options based on a personalized search and appropriately filter out distant pizza stores                  failed verification      Organizations such as The Washington Post  The New York Times  and others have experimented with creating new personalized information services  with the aim of tailoring search results to those that users are likely to like or agree with            

Academia studies and reactions edit 
A scientific study from Wharton that analyzed personalized recommendations also found that these filters can create commonality  not fragmentation  in online music taste              Consumers reportedly use the filters to expand their taste rather than to limit it              Harvard law professor Jonathan Zittrain disputed the extent to which personalization filters distort Google search results  saying that  the effects of search personalization have been light              Further  Google provides the ability for users to shut off personalization features if they choose             by deleting Google s record of their search history and setting Google not to remember their search keywords and visited links in the future            
A study from Internet Policy Review addressed the lack of a clear and testable definition for filter bubbles across disciplines  this often results in researchers defining and studying filter bubbles in different ways              Subsequently  the study explained a lack of empirical data for the existence of filter bubbles across disciplines             and suggested that the effects attributed to them may stem more from preexisting ideological biases than from algorithms  Similar views can be found in other academic projects  which also address concerns with the definitions of filter bubbles and the relationships between ideological and technological factors associated with them              A critical review of filter bubbles suggested that  the filter bubble thesis often posits a special kind of political human who has opinions that are strong  but at the same time highly malleable  and that it is a  paradox that people have an active agency when they select content but are passive receivers once they are exposed to the algorithmically curated content recommended to them              
A study by Oxford  Stanford  and Microsoft researchers examined the browsing histories of     million U S  users of the Bing Toolbar add on for Internet Explorer between March and May       They selected        of those users who were active news consumers  then classified whether the news outlets they visited were left  or right leaning  based on whether the majority of voters in the counties associated with user IP addresses voted for Obama or Romney in the      presidential election  They then identified whether news stories were read after accessing the publisher s site directly  via the Google News aggregation service  web searches  or social media  The researchers found that while web searches and social media do contribute to ideological segregation  the vast majority of online news consumption consisted of users directly visiting left  or right leaning mainstream news sites and consequently being exposed almost exclusively to views from a single side of the political spectrum  Limitations of the study included selection issues such as Internet Explorer users skewing higher in age than the general internet population  Bing Toolbar usage and the voluntary  or unknowing  sharing of browsing history selection for users who are less concerned about privacy  the assumption that all stories in left leaning publications are left leaning  and the same for right leaning  and the possibility that users who are not active news consumers may get most of their news via social media  and thus experience stronger effects of social or algorithmic bias than those users who essentially self select their bias through their choice of news publications  assuming they are aware of the publications  biases              
A study by Princeton University and New York University researchers aimed to study the impact of filter bubble and algorithmic filtering on social media polarization  They used a mathematical model called the  stochastic block model  to test their hypothesis on the environments of Reddit and Twitter  The researchers gauged changes in polarization in regularized social media networks and non regularized networks  specifically measuring the percent changes in polarization and disagreement on Reddit and Twitter  They found that polarization increased significantly at      in non regularized networks  while polarization increased by    in regularized networks and disagreement by                

Platform studies edit 
While algorithms do limit political diversity  some of the filter bubbles are the result of user choice              A study by data scientists at Facebook found that users have one friend with contrasting views for every four Facebook friends that share an ideology                          No matter what Facebook s algorithm for its News Feed is  people are more likely to befriend follow people who share similar beliefs              The nature of the algorithm is that it ranks stories based on a user s history  resulting in a reduction of the  politically cross cutting content by   percent for conservatives and   percent for liberals               However  even when people are given the option to click on a link offering contrasting views  they still default to their most viewed sources                U ser choice decreases the likelihood of clicking on a cross cutting link by    percent for conservatives and   percent for liberals               A cross cutting link is one that introduces a different point of view than the user s presumed point of view or what the website has pegged as the user s beliefs              A recent study from Levi Boxell  Matthew Gentzkow  and Jesse M  Shapiro suggest that online media isn t the driving force for political polarization              The paper argues that polarization has been driven by the demographic groups that spend the least time online  The greatest ideological divide is experienced amongst Americans older than     while only     reported using social media as of       In contrast      of Americans aged       reported using social media as of       The data suggests that the younger demographic isn t any more polarized in      than it had been when online media barely existed in       The study highlights differences between age groups and how news consumption remains polarized as people seek information that appeals to their preconceptions  Older Americans usually remain stagnant in their political views as traditional media outlets continue to be a primary source of news  while online media is the leading source for the younger demographic  Although algorithms and filter bubbles weaken content diversity  this study reveals that political polarization trends are primarily driven by pre existing views and failure to recognize outside sources  A      study from Germany utilized the Big Five Psychology model to test the effects of individual personality  demographics  and ideologies on user news consumption              Basing their study on the notion that the number of news sources that users consume impacts their likelihood to be caught in a filter bubble with higher media diversity lessening the chances their results suggest that certain demographics  higher age and male  along with certain personality traits  high openness  correlate positively with a number of news sources consumed by individuals  The study also found a negative ideological association between media diversity and the degree to which users align with right wing authoritarianism  Beyond offering different individual user factors that may influence the role of user choice  this study also raises questions and associations between the likelihood of users being caught in filter bubbles and user voting behavior             
The Facebook study found that it was  inconclusive  whether or not the algorithm played as big a role in filtering News Feeds as people assumed              The study also found that  individual choice   or confirmation bias  likewise affected what gets filtered out of News Feeds              Some social scientists criticized this conclusion because the point of protesting the filter bubble is that the algorithms and individual choice work together to filter out News Feeds              They also criticized Facebook s small sample size  which is about     of actual Facebook users   and the fact that the study results are  not reproducible  due to the fact that the study was conducted by  Facebook scientists  who had access to data that Facebook does not make available to outside researchers             
Though the study found that only about        of the average user s Facebook friends subscribe to the opposite side of the political spectrum  Julia Kaman from Vox theorized that this could have potentially positive implications for viewpoint diversity  These  friends  are often acquaintances with whom we would not likely share our politics without the internet  Facebook may foster a unique environment where a user sees and possibly interacts with content posted or re posted by these  second tier  friends  The study found that     percent of the news items liberals saw were conservative leaning and    percent of the news conservatives saw was liberal leaning                Liberals tend to be connected to fewer friends who share information from the other side  compared with their conservative counterparts               This interplay has the ability to provide diverse information and sources that could moderate users  views 
Similarly  a study of Twitter s filter bubbles by New York University concluded that  Individuals now have access to a wider span of viewpoints about news events  and most of this information is not coming through the traditional channels  but either directly from political actors or through their friends and relatives  Furthermore  the interactive nature of social media creates opportunities for individuals to discuss political events with their peers  including those with whom they have weak social ties               According to these studies  social media may be diversifying information and opinions users come into contact with  though there is much speculation around filter bubbles and their ability to create deeper political polarization 
One driver and possible solution to the problem is the role of emotions in online content  A      study shows that different emotions of messages can lead to polarization or convergence  joy is prevalent in emotional polarization  while sadness and fear play significant roles in emotional convergence              Since it is relatively easy to detect the emotional content of messages  these findings can help to design more socially responsible algorithms by starting to focus on the emotional content of algorithmic recommendations 

Visualization of the process and growth of two social media bots used in the      Weibo study  The diagrams represent two aspects of the structure of filter bubbles  according to the study  large concentrations of users around single topics and a uni directional  star like structure that impacts key information flows 
Social bots have been utilized by different researchers to test polarization and related effects that are attributed to filter bubbles and echo chambers                          A      study used social bots on Twitter to test deliberate user exposure to partisan viewpoints              The study claimed it demonstrated partisan differences between exposure to differing views  although it warned that the findings should be limited to party registered American Twitter users  One of the main findings was that after exposure to differing views  provided by the bots   self registered republicans became more conservative  whereas self registered liberals showed less ideological change if none at all  A different study from The People s Republic of China utilized social bots on Weibo the largest social media platform in China to examine the structure of filter bubbles regarding to their effects on polarization              The study draws a distinction between two conceptions of polarization  One being where people with similar views form groups  share similar opinions  and block themselves from differing viewpoints  opinion polarization   and the other being where people do not access diverse content and sources of information  information polarization   By utilizing social bots instead of human volunteers and focusing more on information polarization rather than opinion based  the researchers concluded that there are two essential elements of a filter bubble  a large concentration of users around a single topic and a uni directional  star like structure that impacts key information flows 
In June       the platform DuckDuckGo conducted a research study on the Google Web Browser Platform  For this study     adults in various locations around the continental United States googled three keywords at the exact same time  immigration  gun control  and vaccinations  Even in private browsing mode  most people saw results unique to them  Google included certain links for some that it did not include for other participants  and the News and Videos infoboxes showed significant variation  Google publicly disputed these results saying that Search Engine Results Page  SERP  personalization is mostly a myth  Google Search Liaison  Danny Sullivan  stated that  Over the years  a myth has developed that Google Search personalizes so much that for the same query  different people might get significantly different results from each other  This isn t the case  Results can differ  but usually for non personalized reasons              
When filter bubbles are in place  they can create specific moments that scientists call  Whoa  moments  A  Whoa  moment is when an article  ad  post  etc   appears on your computer that is in relation to a current action or current use of an object  Scientists discovered this term after a young woman was performing her daily routine  which included drinking coffee when she opened her computer and noticed an advertisement for the same brand of coffee that she was drinking   Sat down and opened up Facebook this morning while having my coffee  and there they were two ads for Nespresso  Kind of a  whoa  moment when the product you re drinking pops up on the screen in front of you                Whoa  moments occur when people are  found   Which means advertisement algorithms target specific users based on their  click behavior  to increase their sale revenue 
Several designers have developed tools to counteract the effects of filter bubbles  see        Countermeasures               Swiss radio station SRF voted the word filterblase  the German translation of filter bubble  word of the year                  

Countermeasures edit 
By individuals edit 
In The Filter Bubble  What the Internet Is Hiding from You              internet activist Eli Pariser highlights how the increasing occurrence of filter bubbles further emphasizes the value of one s bridging social capital as defined by Robert Putman  Pariser argues that filter bubbles reinforce a sense of social homogeneity  which weakens ties between people with potentially diverging interests and viewpoints              In that sense  high bridging capital may promote social inclusion by increasing our exposure to a space that goes beyond self interests  Fostering one s bridging capital  such as by connecting with more people in an informal setting  may be an effective way to reduce the filter bubble phenomenon 
Users can take many actions to burst through their filter bubbles  for example by making a conscious effort to evaluate what information they are exposing themselves to  and by thinking critically about whether they are engaging with a broad range of content              Users can consciously avoid news sources that are unverifiable or weak  Chris Glushko  the VP of Marketing at IAB  advocates using fact checking sites to identify fake news              Technology can also play a valuable role in combating filter bubbles             
Some browser plug ins are aimed to help people step out of their filter bubbles and make them aware of their personal perspectives  thus  these media show content that contradicts with their beliefs and opinions  In addition to plug ins  there are apps created with the mission of encouraging users to open their echo chambers  News apps such as Read Across the Aisle nudge users to read different perspectives if their reading pattern is biased towards one side ideology              Although apps and plug ins are tools humans can use  Eli Pariser stated  certainly  there is some individual responsibility here to really seek out new sources and people who aren t like you              
Since web based advertising can further the effect of the filter bubbles by exposing users to more of the same content  users can block much advertising by deleting their search history  turning off targeted ads  and downloading browser extensions  Some use anonymous or non personalized search engines such as YaCy  DuckDuckGo  Qwant  Startpage com  Disconnect  and Searx in order to prevent companies from gathering their web search data  Swiss daily Neue Z rcher Zeitung is beta testing a personalized news engine app which uses machine learning to guess what content a user is interested in  while  always including an element of surprise   the idea is to mix in stories which a user is unlikely to have followed in the past             
The European Union is taking measures to lessen the effect of the filter bubble  The European Parliament is sponsoring inquiries into how filter bubbles affect people s ability to access diverse news              Additionally  it introduced a program aimed to educate citizens about social media              In the U S   the CSCW panel suggests the use of news aggregator apps to broaden media consumers news intake  News aggregator apps scan all current news articles and direct you to different viewpoints regarding a certain topic  Users can also use a diversely aware news balancer which visually shows the media consumer if they are leaning left or right when it comes to reading the news  indicating right leaning with a bigger red bar or left leaning with a bigger blue bar  A study evaluating this news balancer found  a small but noticeable change in reading behavior  toward more balanced exposure  among users seeing the feedback  as compared to a control group              

By media companies edit 
In light of recent concerns about information filtering on social media  Facebook acknowledged the presence of filter bubbles and has taken strides toward removing them              In January       Facebook removed personalization from its Trending Topics list in response to problems with some users not seeing highly talked about events there              Facebook s strategy is to reverse the Related Articles feature that it had implemented in       which would post related news stories after the user read a shared article  Now  the revamped strategy would flip this process and post articles from different perspectives on the same topic  Facebook is also attempting to go through a vetting process whereby only articles from reputable sources will be shown  Along with the founder of Craigslist and a few others  Facebook has invested     million into efforts  to increase trust in journalism around the world  and to better inform the public conversation               The idea is that even if people are only reading posts shared from their friends  at least these posts will be credible 
Similarly  Google  as of January           has also acknowledged the existence of a filter bubble difficulties within its platform  Because current Google searches pull algorithmically ranked results based upon  authoritativeness  and  relevancy  which show and hide certain search results  Google is seeking to combat this  By training its search engine to recognize the intent of a search inquiry rather than the literal syntax of the question  Google is attempting to limit the size of filter bubbles  As of now  the initial phase of this training will be introduced in the second quarter of       Questions that involve bias and or controversial opinions will not be addressed until a later time  prompting a larger problem that exists still  whether the search engine acts either as an arbiter of truth or as a knowledgeable guide by which to make decisions by             
In April      news surfaced that Facebook  Mozilla  and Craigslist contributed to the majority of a    M donation to CUNY s  News Integrity Initiative   poised at eliminating fake news and creating more honest news media             
Later  in August  Mozilla  makers of the Firefox web browser  announced the formation of the Mozilla Information Trust Initiative  MITI   The  MITI would serve as a collective effort to develop products  research  and community based solutions to combat the effects of filter bubbles and the proliferation of fake news  Mozilla s Open Innovation team leads the initiative  striving to combat misinformation  with a specific focus on the product with regards to literacy  research and creative interventions             

Ethical implications edit 
As the popularity of cloud services increases  personalized algorithms used to construct filter bubbles are expected to become more widespread              Scholars have begun considering the effect of filter bubbles on the users of social media from an ethical standpoint  particularly concerning the areas of personal freedom  security  and information bias              Filter bubbles in popular social media and personalized search sites can determine the particular content seen by users  often without their direct consent or cognizance              due to the algorithms used to curate that content  Self created content manifested from behavior patterns can lead to partial information blindness              Critics of the use of filter bubbles speculate that individuals may lose autonomy over their own social media experience and have their identities socially constructed as a result of the pervasiveness of filter bubbles             
Technologists  social media engineers  and computer specialists have also examined the prevalence of filter bubbles              Mark Zuckerberg  founder of Facebook  and Eli Pariser  author of The Filter Bubble  have expressed concerns regarding the risks of privacy and information polarization                          The information of the users of personalized search engines and social media platforms is not private  though some people believe it should be              The concern over privacy has resulted in a debate as to whether or not it is moral for information technologists to take users  online activity and manipulate future exposure to related information             
Some scholars have expressed concerns regarding the effects of filter bubbles on individual and social well being  i e  the dissemination of health information to the general public and the potential effects of internet search engines to alter health related behavior                                                  A      multi disciplinary book reported research and perspectives on the roles filter bubbles play in regards to health misinformation              Drawing from various fields such as journalism  law  medicine  and health psychology  the book addresses different controversial health beliefs  e g  alternative medicine and pseudoscience  as well as potential remedies to the negative effects of filter bubbles and echo chambers on different topics in health discourse  A      study on the potential effects of filter bubbles on search engine results related to suicide found that algorithms play an important role in whether or not helplines and similar search results are displayed to users and discussed the implications their research may have for health policies              Another      study from the Croatian Medical journal proposed some strategies for mitigating the potentially harmful effects of filter bubbles on health information  such as  informing the public more about filter bubbles and their associated effects  users choosing to try alternative  to Google  search engines  and more explanation of the processes search engines use to determine their displayed results             
Since the content seen by individual social media users is influenced by algorithms that produce filter bubbles  users of social media platforms are more susceptible to confirmation bias              and may be exposed to biased  misleading information              Social sorting and other unintentional discriminatory practices are also anticipated as a result of personalized filtering             
In light of the      U S  presidential election scholars have likewise expressed concerns about the effect of filter bubbles on democracy and democratic processes  as well as the rise of  ideological media               These scholars fear that users will be unable to   think  beyond  their  narrow self interest  as filter bubbles create personalized social feeds  isolating them from diverse points of view and their surrounding communities              For this reason  an increasingly discussed possibility is to design social media with more serendipity  that is  to proactively recommend content that lies outside one s filter bubble  including challenging political information and  eventually  to provide empowering filters and tools to users                                      A related concern is in fact how filter bubbles contribute to the proliferation of  fake news  and how this may influence political leaning  including how users vote                                       
Revelations in March      of Cambridge Analytica s harvesting and use of user data for at least    million Facebook profiles during the      presidential election highlight the ethical implications of filter bubbles               Co founder and whistleblower of Cambridge Analytica Christopher Wylie  detailed how the firm had the ability to develop  psychographic  profiles of those users and use the information to shape their voting behavior               Access to user data by third parties such as Cambridge Analytica can exasperate and amplify existing filter bubbles users have created  artificially increasing existing biases and further divide societies 

Dangers edit 
Filter bubbles have stemmed from a surge in media personalization  which can trap users  The use of AI to personalize offerings can lead to users viewing only content that reinforces their own viewpoints without challenging them  Social media websites like Facebook may also present content in a way that makes it difficult for users to determine the source of the content  leading them to decide for themselves whether the source is reliable or fake               That can lead to people becoming used to hearing what they want to hear  which can cause them to react more radically when they see an opposing viewpoint  The filter bubble may cause the person to see any opposing viewpoints as incorrect and so could allow the media to force views onto consumers                                        
Researches explain that the filter bubble reinforces what one is already thinking               This is why it is extremely important to utilize resources that offer various points of view
