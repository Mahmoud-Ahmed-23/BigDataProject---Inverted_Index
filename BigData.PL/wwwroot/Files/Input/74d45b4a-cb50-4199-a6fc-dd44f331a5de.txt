Recruitment is the overall process of identifying  sourcing  screening  shortlisting  and interviewing candidates for jobs  either permanent or temporary  within an organization  Recruitment also is the process involved in choosing people for unpaid roles  Managers  human resource generalists  and recruitment specialists may be tasked with carrying out recruitment  but in some cases  public sector employment  commercial recruitment agencies  or specialist search consultancies such as Executive search in the case of more senior roles  are used to undertake parts of the process  Internet based recruitment is now widespread  including the use of artificial intelligence  AI             


Process edit 
The recruitment process varies widely based on the employer  seniority and type of role and the industry or sector the role is in  Some recruitment processes may include 

Job analysis for new jobs or substantially changed jobs  It might be undertaken to document the knowledge  skills  abilities  and other characteristics  KSAOs  required or sought for the job  From these  the relevant information is captured in a person s specification            
Kick Off Call  This is when the recruiter will connect with the hiring manager to understand the needs for the role 
Sourcing   sorting through applicants and resumes to select candidates to screen 
Screening and selection   picking  interviewing  and hiring the right candidate 
Interviews  Shortlisted candidates are invited for interviews  The interview process may include one or more rounds of interviews with HR representatives  hiring managers  and sometimes panel interviews 
Sourcing edit 
Sourcing is the use of one or more strategies to attract and identify candidates to fill job vacancies  It may involve internal and or external recruitment advertising  using appropriate media such as job portals  local or national newspapers  social media  business media  specialist recruitment media  professional publications  window advertisements  job centers  career fairs  or in a variety of ways via the internet 
Alternatively  employers may use recruitment consultancies or agencies to find otherwise scarce candidates who  in many cases  may be content in their current positions and are not actively looking to move  This initial research for candidates also called name generation produces contact information for potential candidates  whom the recruiter can then discreetly contact and screen            

Referral recruitment programs edit 
Referral recruitment programs allow both outsiders and employees to refer candidates for filling job openings  Online  they can be implemented by leveraging social networks 

Employee referral edit 
An employee referral is a candidate recommended by an existing employee  This is sometimes referred to as referral recruitment  Encouraging existing employees to select and recruit suitable candidates results in 

Improved candidate quality   fit    Employee referrals allow existing employees to screen  select and refer candidates  lowers staff attrition rate  candidates hired through referrals tend to stay up to   times longer than candidates hired through job boards and other sources             The one to one direct relationship between the candidate and the referring employee and the exchange of knowledge that takes place allows the candidate to develop a strong understanding of the company  its business and the application and recruitment process  The candidate is thereby enabled to assess their own suitability and likelihood of success  including  fitting in  
Reduces the considerable cost of third party service providers who would have previously conducted the screening and selection process  An op ed in Crain s in April      recommended that companies look to employee referral to speed the recruitment process for purple squirrels  which are rare candidates considered to be  perfect  fits for open positions            
The employee typically receives a referral bonus  and is widely acknowledged as being cost effective  The Global Employee Referral Index      Survey found that     of participants reported employee referrals as one of the top recruiting sources            
As candidate quality improves and interview to job offer conversion rates increase  the amount of time spent interviewing decreases  which means the company s employee headcount can be streamlined and be used more efficiently  Marketing and advertising expenditures decrease as existing employees source potential candidates from existing personal networks of friends  family  and associates  By contrast  recruiting through third party recruitment agencies incurs a        agency finder s fee   which can top    K for an employee with     K annual salary 
There is  however  a risk of less corporate creativity   An overly homogeneous workforce is at risk for  fails to produce novel ideas or innovations             

Social network referral edit 
Initially  responses to mass emailing of job announcements to those within employees  social network slowed the screening process            
Two ways in which this improved are 

Making available screen tools for employees to use  although this interferes with the  work routines of already time starved employees            
 When employees put their reputation on the line for the person they are recommending            
Screening and selection edit 
Various psychological tests can assess a variety of KSAOs   including literacy  Assessments are also available to measure physical ability  Recruiters and agencies may use applicant tracking systems to filter candidates  along with software tools for psychometric testing and performance based assessment             In many countries  employers are legally mandated to ensure their screening and selection processes meet equal opportunity and ethical standards            
Employers are likely to recognize the value of candidates who encompass soft skills  such as interpersonal or team leadership             and the level of drive needed to stay engaged             but most employers are still using degree requirements to screen out the     million workers Skilled Through Alternative Routes  STARs  who already possess many of those skills               In fact  many companies  including multinational organizations and those that recruit from a range of nationalities  are also often concerned about whether candidate fits the prevailing company culture and organization as a whole                          Companies and recruitment agencies are now turning to video screening as a way to notice these skills without the need to invite the candidates in person             
The selection process is often claimed to be an invention of Thomas Edison             

Candidates with disabilities edit 
The word disability carries few positive connotations for most employers  Research has shown that the employer biases tend to improve through first hand experience and exposure with proper supports for the employee             and the employer making the hiring decisions  As for most companies  money and job stability are two of the contributing factors to the productivity of a disabled employee  which in return equates to the growth and success of a business  Hiring disabled workers produces more advantages than disadvantages              There is no difference in the daily production of a disabled worker              Given their situation  they are more likely to adapt to their environmental surroundings and acquaint themselves with equipment  enabling them to solve problems and overcome adversity than other employees      citation needed      The United States Internal Revenue Service  IRS  grants companies Disabled Access Credit when they meet eligibility criteria             

Diversity edit 
Many major corporations recognize the need for diversity in hiring to compete successfully in a global economy              The challenge is to avoid recruiting staff who are  in the likeness of existing employees              but also to retain a more diverse workforce and work with inclusion strategies to include them in the organization  More companies are starting to focus on DEI  Diversity  Equity  amp  Inclusion  within their recruitment tactics and techniques in order to offer a more welcoming and inclusive workplace for their employees  

Safer recruitment edit 
 Safer recruitment  refers to procedures intended to promote and exercise  a safe culture including the supervision and oversight of those who work with children and vulnerable adults               The NSPCC describes safer recruitment as a set of practices to help make sure your staff and volunteers are suitable to work with children and young people  It s a vital part of creating a safe and positive environment and making a commitment to keep children safe from harm              In England and Wales  statutory guidance issued by the Department for Education directs how safer recruitment must be undertaken within an educational context             
Recruitment process outsourcing edit 
Recruitment process outsourcing  RPO  is a form of business process outsourcing  BPO  where a company engages a third party provider to manage all or part of its recruitment process             

Approaches edit 
Internal recruitment or internal mobility              not to be confused with internal recruiters  refers to the process of a candidate being selected from the existing workforce to take up a new job in the same organization  perhaps as a promotion  or to provide career development opportunity  or to meet a specific or urgent organizational need  Advantages include the organization s familiarity with the employee and their competencies insofar as they are revealed in their current job  and their willingness to trust said employee  It can be quicker and have a lower cost to hire someone internally             
Many companies will choose to recruit or promote employees internally  This means that instead of searching for candidates in the general labor market  the company will look at hiring one of their own employees for the position  After searches that combine internal with external processes  companies often choose to hire an internal candidate over an external candidate due to the costs of acquiring new employees  and also on the fact that companies have pre existing knowledge of their own employees  effectiveness in the workplace              Additionally  internal recruitment can encourage the development of skills and knowledge because employees anticipate longer careers at the company              However  promoting an employee can leave a gap at the promoted employee s previous position that subsequently needs to be filled              Traditionally  internal recruitment will be done through internal job postings              Another method of recruiting internally is through employee referrals  Having existing employees in good standing recommend coworkers for a job position is often a preferred method of recruitment because these employees know the values of the organization  as well as the work ethic of their coworkers              Some managers will provide incentives to employees who provide successful referrals             
Searching for candidates externally is another option when it comes to recruitment  In this case  employers or hiring committees will search outside of their own company for potential job candidates  The advantages of hiring externally is that it often brings fresh ideas and perspectives to the company              As well  external recruitment opens up more possibilities for the applicant pool than internal recruitment does              The conditions of the economy and labor market will impact the ability for a company to find and attract viable candidates              In order to make job openings known to potential candidates  companies will usually advertise their job in a number of ways  This can include advertising in local newspapers  journals  and online              Research has argued that social media networks offer job seekers and recruiters the opportunity to connect with other professionals cheaply  In addition  professional networking websites such as LinkedIn offer the ability to go through job seekers  biographical resumes and message them directly even if they are not actively looking for a job              Attending job fairs  especially at secondary and post secondary schools  is another method of recruiting external candidates             
An employee referral program is a system where existing employees recommend prospective candidates for the job offered  and usually  if the suggested candidate is hired  the employee receives a cash bonus             
Niche firms tend to focus on building ongoing relationships with their candidates  as the same candidates may be placed many times throughout their careers  Online resources have developed to help find niche recruiters              Niche firms also develop knowledge on specific employment trends within their industry of focus  e g   the energy industry  and are able to identify demographic shifts such as aging and its impact on the industry             
Social recruiting is the use of social media for recruiting  As more and more people are using the internet  social networking sites  or SNS  have become an increasingly popular tool used by companies to recruit and attract applicants  A study conducted by researchers found that       of Cypriot companies had an account on an SNS  the most common being Facebook  LinkedIn  and Twitter              There are many benefits associated with using SNS in recruitment  such as reducing the time required to hire someone  reduced costs  attracting more  computer literate  educated young individuals   and positively impacting the company s brand image              However  some disadvantages include increased costs for training HR specialists and installing related software for social recruiting              There are also legal issues associated with this practice  such as the privacy of applicants  discrimination based on information from SNS  and inaccurate or outdated information on applicant SNS             
Mobile recruiting is a recruitment strategy that uses mobile technology to attract  engage  and convert candidates 
Some recruiters work by accepting payments from job seekers  and in return help them to find a job  This is illegal in some countries  such as in the United Kingdom  in which recruiters must not charge candidates for their services  although websites such as LinkedIn may charge for ancillary job search related services   Such recruiters often refer to themselves as  personal marketers  and  job application services  rather than as recruiters 
Using multiple criteria decision analysis             tools such as analytic hierarchy process  AHP  and combining it with conventional recruitment methods provides an added advantage by helping the recruiters to make decisions when there are several diverse criteria to be considered or when the applicants lack past experience  for instance  recruitment of fresh university graduates             
Employers may re recruit prior rejected candidates or recruit from retired employees as a way to increase the chances for attractive qualified applicants 

Multi tier recruitment model edit 
In some companies where the recruitment volume is high  it is common to see a multi tier recruitment model where the different sub functions are grouped together to achieve efficiency 
An example of a three tier recruitment model 

Tier     Contact help desk   This tier acts as the first point of contact where recruitment requests are being raised  If the requests are simple to fulfil or are queries in nature  resolution may take place at this tier 
Tier     Administration   This tier manages mainly the administration processes
Tier     Process   This tier manages the process and how the requests get fulfilled
General edit 
Organizations define their own recruiting strategies to identify who they will recruit  as well as when  where  and how that recruitment should take place              Common recruiting strategies answer the following questions             

What type of individuals should be targeted 
What recruitment message should be communicated 
How can the targeted individuals best be reached 
When should the recruitment campaign begin 
What should be the nature of a site visit 
Practices edit 
Organizations develop recruitment objectives  and the recruitment strategy follows these objectives  Typically  organizations develop pre  and post hire objectives and incorporate these objectives into a holistic recruitment strategy              Once an organization deploys a recruitment strategy it conducts recruitment activities  This typically starts by advertising a vacant position             

Professional associations edit 
There are numerous professional associations for human resources professionals  Such associations typically offer benefits such as member directories  publications  discussion groups  awards  local chapters  vendor relations  government lobbying  and job boards             
Professional associations also offer a recruitment resource for human resources professionals             

Corrupt practices in recruitment edit 
In the United States  the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has established guidelines for prohibited employment policies practices  These regulations serve to discourage discrimination based on race  color  religion  sex  age  disability  etc              However  recruitment ethics is an area of business that is prone to many other unethical and corrupt practices              According to Independent Broad based Anti corruption Commission  IBAC   business ethics are a vital component to recruitment  hiring unqualified friends or family  allowing problematic employees to be recycled through a company  and failing to properly validate the background of candidates can be detrimental to a business             
When hiring for positions that involve ethical and safety concerns it is often the individual employees who make decisions which can lead to devastating consequences to the whole company  Likewise  executive positions are often tasked with making difficult decisions when company emergencies occur such as public relation nightmares  natural disasters  pandemics  or a slowing economy  Businesses that have made headlines for undesirable cultures may also have a difficult time recruiting new hires              Companies should aim to minimize corruption using tools such as the recruitment processes  pre employment screening  personality tests  induction  training  and establishing a code of conduct             
In Germany  universities  though public employers  are generally not required to advertise most vacancies especially of academic positions  teaching and or research  other than tenured full professors  verbeamtete Hochschullehrer               At the same time  anti discrimination measures and equal opportunities  although required within the framework of the European Union  only apply to advertised jobs and to the wording of the job advert
