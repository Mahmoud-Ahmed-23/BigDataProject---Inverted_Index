More than     million people out of a population of     billion people were eligible to vote  equivalent to    percent of the total population                                         million voters participated in the election      million of these were women  the highest ever participation by women voters                          This was the largest ever election  surpassing the previous election  and lasted    days  second only to the         Indian general election  The legislative assembly elections in the states of Andhra Pradesh  Arunachal Pradesh  Odisha  and Sikkim were held simultaneously with the general election  along with the by elections for    constituencies in    legislative assemblies 
Incumbent prime minister Narendra Modi  who completed a second term  ran for a third consecutive term  His Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP  had enjoyed an absolute majority a minimum of     seats in the      and      elections  The primary opposition was the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance  INDIA   a coalition formed in      by the Indian National Congress  INC  and many regional parties  The election was criticised for lack of action on hate speeches by Modi s BJP              reported electronic voting machine  EVM  malfunctioning                          and suppression of political opponents of the BJP

Background
Contemporary politics and previous elections
India has a multi party system with two major parties  namely the Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP  and the Indian National Congress  INC   that dominate politics at the national level  The BJP has governed the country with Narendra Modi at the helm since       The tenure of the   th Lok Sabha was scheduled to end on    June                   The previous general election was held in April May       after which the National Democratic Alliance  NDA   led by the BJP  formed the union government  with Modi continuing as Prime Minister              The Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance  comprising    opposition parties  was formed in      to compete against the NDA in the elections             

Electoral system
Main article  Elections in India
Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar announced the schedule for the elections on    March      
Article    of the Constitution of India requires elections to the Lok Sabha to be held once every five years              The     MPs are elected from single member constituencies using first past the post voting              The    th amendment to the constitution abolished the two seats that were reserved for the Anglo Indian community             
Indian citizens who are    years or older  ordinary residents of the polling area of the constituency and registered to vote  name included in the electoral rolls   possess a valid voter identification card issued by the Election Commission of India or equivalent are eligible to vote              People convicted of electoral or other offenses and prisoners  are barred from voting              Indians holding foreign citizenship are not eligible to vote in India  There is no postal or online absentee voting in India  members of the Indian diaspora are required to travel back to their home constituencies in order to cast a ballot             
For the      election      million people were eligible to vote  an increase of about     million people from the      election              In Arunachal Pradesh  a polling station would be set up for the only registered voter in the village of Malogam  as electoral laws stipulate that voting booths need to be within two kilometres           mi  of any settlement                          A polling station was also set up inside the Gir Forest in Gujarat to cater for a single voter  a priest at a Hindu temple              Polling stations were also set up inside a wildlife sanctuary in Kerala  in a shipping container in Gujarat  and     relief camps hosting nearly        people displaced during violence in Manipur                         
In March       the Supreme Court of India rejected a petition by the Congress party to end the usage of electronic voting machines  EVMs  and revert to paper ballots and manual counting  which was the system used in elections until the late     s  with the party citing risks of electoral fraud              Nearly     million EVMs were utilized in more than one million polling stations with    million election workers and security personnel tasked with managing the conduct of the election             
For the first time  the Election Commission of India allowed voters with disabilities and those over the age of    to cast ballots from their homes              In Telangana  voting in some areas was extended by an hour more to allow voters to come at a more convenient time             

Planning
Key processes during a Lok Sabha election involved monitoring campaign expenditure  preventing the circulation of illicit goods  and ensuring adherence to the Model Code of Conduct  In the final    hours before voting  campaigns are ceased  and measures are implemented to maintain order and prevent disruptions  On polling day  strict rules are enforced to prevent undue influence and ensure a secure and free election process  After the elections  EVMs are sealed and stored under tight security with Booth Level Officers assisting throughout the process

The BJP prepared a pamphlet for the Ram Mandir Inauguration Programmes to connect with families across the nation  After the consecration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya  a new era of Hindu nationalistic sentiments have dominated the political sphere in India                          Modi kept a long standing political pledge of the reconstruction of the Ram Mandir and was seen to have fulfilled the BJP s manifesto to the nation s Hindu population              The Hindu nationalist ideology of Modi and the BJP has also garnered substantial support from Hindu community members                          At the same time  Bollywood productions have been released with themes supporting the Modi government s policies and Hindu nationalist ideologies              In response to such concerns  BJP spokesperson Mmhonlumo Kikon acknowledged the existence of a  level of threat perception   but said that the party was trying to change that             
A major controversy was stirred when the opposition Congress Party and its leaders declined an invitation to the Ram Mandir consecration ceremony  saying that the event was politicised into a  BJP RSS event               Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that the invitation was an opportunity for the Congress to  reduce its sin   and that history would continue to judge it as  anti Hindu               The four Shankaracharyas also declined attending the event  stating that the ceremony was politicised as a campaign event at the half built temple                         
During a campaign rally in Rajasthan on    April  Narendra Modi accused the Congress party of prioritizing Muslim access to national wealth and planning to distribute resources among  those who have more children  and  infiltrators  once it was in power  which reflected stereotypes about Muslims reproducing in greater numbers and conspiracy theories pushed by the BJP that Muslims were planning to outnumber Hindus  Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge called Modi s remarks a panic filled  hate speech  and a ploy to divert attention from the opposition outperforming the BJP during the first phase of the election  while officials in Rajasthan received complaints from the Azad Adhikar Sena and a non profit organisation demanding Modi s arrest and for his campaign to be suspended                         
A complaint letter by the Samvidhan Bacchao Nagrik Abhiyan  Save the Constitution Citizens  Campaign  organisation to the Election Commission of India  signed by over        people  alleged that Modi had violated the Model Code of Conduct and the Representation of the People Act       by making a speech  aiming at not only appealing to  communal feelings  but also instigating and aggravating hatred in the Hindus against Muslims                           

Electoral Bonds
On    February       the Supreme Court of India ruled that the Electoral Bond system of campaign financing that was introduced by the Modi government in      which allowed individuals and companies to donate money to political parties anonymously and without limits was unconstitutional  saying that the process allowed donors to assert  influence over policymaking                On    March  the court ordered the State Bank of India  SBI  to provide all records regarding the electoral bonds to the Election Commission of India by    March in order to match electoral donors with their recipients and rejected a plea by the Confederation of Indian Industry  the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry  and the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India from divulging the identities of donors  Initial reports suggest that among the leading donors to political parties were some of India s largest firms such as Vedanta Limited  Bharti Airtel  RPSG Group and Essel Mining  It also found that the BJP was the recipient of nearly half of all recorded donations              
In total  the top five political parties in terms of electoral bonds received are the BJP  which received Rs         crore  the All India Trinamool Congress  TMC   which received Rs         crore  the Congress Party  with Rs         crore  the Bharat Rashtra Samithi  BRS   which received Rs         crore  and the Biju Janata Dal  BJD   which received Rs       crore                                         The biggest buyer of electoral bonds was found to be Santiago Martin  the Tamil Nadu based head of the lottery firm Future Gaming and Hotel Services Private Limited  who bought bonds worth       billion rupees       million  between      and      and made donations to the TMC  the BJP  and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam  DMK   which rules Tamil Nadu  The biggest single donor to any political party was Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Limited  MEIL   a construction firm based in Hyderabad that bought electoral bonds worth over    billion rupees       million  between      and      and made donations to the Bharat Rashtra Samithi  BRS   the BJP  and the Congress Party  who alternated in ruling Telangana during that time              
Some politicians from the opposition have termed Electoral Bonds a  scam  and an  extortion racket                                          In response to allegations regarding the electoral bonds  BJP spokesperson Syed Zafar Islam denied that the party had done any wrongdoing and said that its electoral bonds were gained  on merit                However  Indian political observers have reached the conclusion that either Indian businessmen have been regularly bribing their way out of trouble  or that the BJP controlled government has been using government agencies to extort them  From the data released by the SBI  it was found that companies gave donations around the time they received major government contracts  Close to half of the top    corporate donors were facing investigations by government agencies around the time they purchased electoral bonds

Following the first round  the BJP won its first seat after Mukesh Dalal  its candidate for Surat constituency in Gujarat  was elected unopposed following rejection and withdrawal of other candidates                            No voting was held in the constituency  as the ECI had certified the results two weeks prior due to the absence of rival candidates              
The overall election result was described in several media sources as a  shock  to Narendra Modi                            with the BJP falling short of its expectations of winning     seats               Though pre poll predictions were for an overwhelming majority for the BJP  the INDIA bloc performed much better than exit polls had predicted it to               with upset victories in major states such as Uttar Pradesh  Maharashtra  and West Bengal               The BJP had to rely on the    cumulative seats won by the Andhra Pradesh based Telugu Desam Party led by Chandrababu Naidu and the Bihar based Janata Dal  United  led by Nitish Kumar in order for the NDA to retain its majority in the Lok Sabha
