The Egyptian Center for Economic Studies  ECES  has proposed a programme for merging the informal real estate and economic activities in Egypt with the formal economy  according to a news release 
Its goal is to encourage and motivate Egyptians involved in informal economic activity or with unrecorded assets to join the formal economy in order to benefit from the advantages and opportunities of the open market 
ECES hopes this integration will create new wealth capable of raising the standard of living for a large number of Egyptians 
The volume of informal real estate and commercial establishments in Egypt is much higher than many expect  according to ECES  These assets include any unregistered property  including buildings on agricultural land  encroachment of state property  public housing units subject to various restrictions on property transfer  illicit units in registered buildings  and adverse possession  squatting   which is un registerable under the current legislation 
According to the statement  unregistered real estate wealth is estimated at nearly     bn  representing about     of total real estate wealth  As for industrial and commercial activities outside of the formal sector  it is estimated that it employs nearly five million persons  including nearly     million business owners  or about     of all business owners in Egypt  and produces about     of GNP 
The programme focuses on two major types of assets  according to the news release  The first is real estate assets  whether buildings  farmland  or other  The second is the various production units from workshops and informal shops which is not registered or licensed 
The programme proposes the establishment of a legislative and administrative system which  on the one hand  encourages people to register  and  on the other hand  discourages them from remaining within the informal framework 
The programme expects to see a strong set of positive results from this integration  including  adding    higher annual economic growth  supporting the rule of law and public order  expanding the number of beneficiaries to at least    million people  increasing social security revenue to the tune of     bn per year  and increasing income tax receipts by    per annum  ECES wrote 
The programme works to integrate nearly five million workers into the formal sector so as to provide them with all the guarantees thereof  such as pensions and social security  and enable informal enterprises to gain access to credit and financing through official channels  in addition to using their assets as collateral to borrow 
ECES projects that integrating the informal sector would create a set of rules for information regarding assets  real estate  and real estate dwellers in order to assist in targeting these groups to improve their living conditions through social security services and cash assistance 
The programme summarises a set of proposals to address the issue  In terms of the real estate sector  it is recommended that registration procedures for proof of ownership documents be simplified and streamlined  the full registration power be entrusted to a local registry  registration fees be reduced  a dispute resolution mechanism be established  real estate and inventory be recorded  and a new administrative apparatus to apply the legal and administrative system be created 
As for the commercial sector  the programme proposes the creation of a new management body for implementing the transfer of business activities from the informal sector into the formal sector by encouraging the owners of these activities to register them  All necessary documents and licences should be made available at one administrative agency and  absent a cause for rejection  applications for licences should be promptly processed and approved 
The purpose of these proposed procedures is to overcome the red tape and bureaucracy that has doubled the cost of handing off property or obtaining licences and permissions to engage in various commercial and industrial activities 
The proposed programme suggests that reducing the fees imposed on registering deeds for land and real estate units may remove a major obstacle on recording these contracts  according to the news release 
This programme focuses on the individual willingly accepting integration in the formal economy  which brings him the greatest benefit and ensures his rights and benefit from various government services  The cost of establishing an entity formally and the cost of registration is less than the cost of continuing in the informal sector  the statement added 
The programme recommends the state adopt a comprehensive strategy to create policies which incentivise individuals to enter and voluntarily remain in the formal sector  but stresses this cannot be achieved without the political will
