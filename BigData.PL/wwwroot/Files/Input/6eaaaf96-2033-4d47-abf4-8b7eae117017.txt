Machine translation is use of computational techniques to translate text or speech from one language to another  including the contextual  idiomatic and pragmatic nuances of both languages 
Early approaches were mostly rule based or statistical  These methods have since been superseded by neural machine translation            and large language models            


History edit 
Main article  History of machine translation
Origins edit 
The origins of machine translation can be traced back to the work of Al Kindi  a ninth century Arabic cryptographer who developed techniques for systemic language translation  including cryptanalysis  frequency analysis  and probability and statistics  which are used in modern machine translation             The idea of machine translation later appeared in the   th century  In       Ren  Descartes proposed a universal language  with equivalent ideas in different tongues sharing one symbol            
The idea of using digital computers for translation of natural languages was proposed as early as      by England s A  D  Booth            and Warren Weaver at Rockefeller Foundation in the same year   The memorandum written by Warren Weaver in      is perhaps the single most influential publication in the earliest days of machine translation                         Others followed  A demonstration was made in      on the APEXC machine at Birkbeck College  University of London  of a rudimentary translation of English into French  Several papers on the topic were published at the time  and even articles in popular journals  for example an article by Cleave and Zacharov in the September      issue of Wireless World    A similar application  also pioneered at Birkbeck College at the time  was reading and composing Braille texts by computer 

    s edit 
The first researcher in the field  Yehoshua Bar Hillel  began his research at MIT         A Georgetown University MT research team  led by Professor Michael Zarechnak  followed        with a public demonstration of its Georgetown IBM experiment system in       MT research programs popped up in Japan                       and Russia         and the first MT conference was held in London                                
David G  Hays  wrote about computer assisted language processing as early as       and  was project leader on computational linguistics
at Rand from      to                   

          edit 
Researchers continued to join the field as the Association for Machine Translation and Computational Linguistics was formed in the U S         and the National Academy of Sciences formed the Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee  ALPAC  to study MT         Real progress was much slower  however  and after the ALPAC report         which found that the ten year long research had failed to fulfill expectations  funding was greatly reduced              According to a      report by the Director of Defense Research and Engineering  DDR amp E   the feasibility of large scale MT was reestablished by the success of the Logos MT system in translating military manuals into Vietnamese during that conflict 
The French Textile Institute also used MT to translate abstracts from and into French  English  German and Spanish         Brigham Young University started a project to translate Mormon texts by automated translation        

     and beyond edit 
SYSTRAN  which  pioneered the field under contracts from the U S  government              in the     s  was used by Xerox to translate technical manuals         Beginning in the late     s  as computational power increased and became less expensive  more interest was shown in statistical models for machine translation  MT became more popular after the advent of computers              SYSTRAN s first implementation system was implemented in      by the online service of the French Postal Service called Minitel              Various computer based translation companies were also launched  including Trados         which was the first to develop and market Translation Memory technology         though this is not the same as MT  The first commercial MT system for Russian   English   German Ukrainian was developed at Kharkov State University        
By        for as little as         one could  buy a program for translating in one direction between English and a major European language of
your choice  to run on a PC             
MT on the web started with SYSTRAN offering free translation of small texts        and then providing this via AltaVista Babelfish              which racked up         requests a day                     The second free translation service on the web was Lernout  amp  Hauspie s GlobaLink              Atlantic Magazine wrote in      that  Systran s Babelfish and GlobaLink s Comprende  handled
 Don t bank on it  with a  competent performance              
Franz Josef Och  the future head of Translation Development AT Google  won DARPA s speed MT competition                     More innovations during this time included MOSES  the open source statistical MT engine         a text SMS translation service for mobiles in Japan         and a mobile phone with built in speech to speech translation functionality for English  Japanese and Chinese         In       Google announced that Google Translate translates roughly enough text to fill   million books in one day 

Approaches edit 
See also  Hybrid machine translation and Example based machine translation
Before the advent of deep learning methods  statistical methods required a lot of rules accompanied by morphological  syntactic  and semantic annotations 

Rule based edit 
Main article  Rule based machine translation
The rule based machine translation approach was used mostly in the creation of dictionaries and grammar programs  Its biggest downfall was that everything had to be made explicit  orthographical variation and erroneous input must be made part of the source language analyser in order to cope with it  and lexical selection rules must be written for all instances of ambiguity 

Transfer based machine translation edit 
Main article  Transfer based machine translation
Transfer based machine translation was similar to interlingual machine translation in that it created a translation from an intermediate representation that simulated the meaning of the original sentence  Unlike interlingual MT  it depended partially on the language pair involved in the translation 

Interlingual edit 
Main article  Interlingual machine translation
Interlingual machine translation was one instance of rule based machine translation approaches   In this approach  the source language  i e  the text to be translated  was transformed into an interlingual language  i e  a  language neutral  representation that is independent of any language  The target language was then generated out of the interlingua  The only interlingual machine translation system that was made operational at the commercial level was the KANT system  Nyberg and Mitamura         which was designed to translate Caterpillar Technical English  CTE  into other languages 

Dictionary based edit 
Main article  Dictionary based machine translation
Machine translation used a method based on dictionary entries  which means that the words were translated as they are by a dictionary 

Statistical edit 
Main article  Statistical machine translation
Statistical machine translation tried to generate translations using statistical methods based on bilingual text corpora  such as the Canadian Hansard corpus  the English French record of the Canadian parliament and EUROPARL  the record of the European Parliament  Where such corpora were available  good results were achieved translating similar texts  but such corpora were rare for many language pairs  The first statistical machine translation software was CANDIDE from IBM  In       Google improved its internal translation capabilities by using approximately     billion words from United Nations materials to train their system  translation accuracy improved             
SMT s biggest downfall included it being dependent upon huge amounts of parallel texts  its problems with morphology rich languages  especially with translating into such languages   and its inability to correct singleton errors 
Some work has been done in the utilization of multiparallel corpora  that is a body of text that has been translated into   or more languages  Using these methods  a text that has been translated into   or more languages may be utilized in combination to provide a more accurate translation into a third language compared with if just one of those source languages were used alone                                     

Neural MT edit 
Main article  Neural machine translation
A deep learning based approach to MT  neural machine translation has made rapid progress in recent years  However  the current consensus is that the so called human parity achieved is not real  being based wholly on limited domains  language pairs  and certain test benchmarks             i e   it lacks statistical significance power             
Translations by neural MT tools like DeepL Translator  which is thought to usually deliver the best machine translation results as of       typically still need post editing by a human                                     
Instead of training specialized translation models on parallel datasets  one can also directly prompt generative large language models like GPT to translate a text                                      This approach is considered promising              but is still more resource intensive than specialized translation models 

Issues edit 
Machine translation could produce some non understandable phrases  such as       Macrolepiota albuminosa  being rendered as  wikipedia  
Broken Chinese        from machine translation in Bali  Indonesia  The broken Chinese sentence sounds like  there does not exist an entry  or  have not entered yet  
Studies using human evaluation  e g  by professional literary translators or human readers  have systematically identified various issues with the latest advanced MT outputs              Common issues include the translation of ambiguous parts whose correct translation requires common sense like semantic language processing or context              There can also be errors in the source texts  missing high quality training data and the severity of frequency of several types of problems may not get reduced with techniques used to date  requiring some level of human active participation 

Disambiguation edit 
Main articles  Word sense disambiguation and Syntactic disambiguation
Word sense disambiguation concerns finding a suitable translation when a word can have more than one meaning  The problem was first raised in the     s by Yehoshua Bar Hillel              He pointed out that without a  universal encyclopedia   a machine would never be able to distinguish between the two meanings of a word              Today there are numerous approaches designed to overcome this problem  They can be approximately divided into  shallow  approaches and  deep  approaches 
Shallow approaches assume no knowledge of the text  They simply apply statistical methods to the words surrounding the ambiguous word  Deep approaches presume a comprehensive knowledge of the word  So far  shallow approaches have been more successful             
Claude Piron  a long time translator for the United Nations and the World Health Organization  wrote that machine translation  at its best  automates the easier part of a translator s job  the harder and more time consuming part usually involves doing extensive research to resolve ambiguities in the source text  which the grammatical and lexical exigencies of the target language require to be resolved 

Why does a translator need a whole workday to translate five pages  and not an hour or two        About     of an average text corresponds to these simple conditions   But unfortunately  there s the other       It s that part that requires six  more  hours of work   There are ambiguities one has to resolve   For instance  the author of the source text  an Australian physician  cited the example of an epidemic which was declared during World War II in a  Japanese prisoners of war camp    Was he talking about an American camp with Japanese prisoners or a Japanese camp with American prisoners   The English has two senses   It s necessary therefore to do research  maybe to the extent of a phone call to Australia             

The ideal deep approach would require the translation software to do all the research necessary for this kind of disambiguation on its own  but this would require a higher degree of AI than has yet been attained   A shallow approach which simply guessed at the sense of the ambiguous English phrase that Piron mentions  based  perhaps  on which kind of prisoner of war camp is more often mentioned in a given corpus  would have a reasonable chance of guessing wrong fairly often   A shallow approach that involves  ask the user about each ambiguity  would  by Piron s estimate  only automate about     of a professional translator s job  leaving the harder     still to be done by a human 

Non standard speech edit 
One of the major pitfalls of MT is its inability to translate non standard language with the same accuracy as standard language  Heuristic or statistical based MT takes input from various sources in standard form of a language  Rule based translation  by nature  does not include common non standard usages  This causes errors in translation from a vernacular source or into colloquial language  Limitations on translation from casual speech present issues in the use of machine translation in mobile devices 

Named entities edit 
Main article  Named entity
In information extraction  named entities  in a narrow sense  refer to concrete or abstract entities in the real world such as people  organizations  companies  and places that have a proper name  George Washington  Chicago  Microsoft   It also refers to expressions of time  space and quantity such as   July            
In the sentence  Smith is the president of Fabrionix  both Smith and Fabrionix are named entities  and can be further qualified via first name or other information   president  is not  since Smith could have earlier held another position at Fabrionix  e g  Vice President 
The term rigid designator is what defines these usages for analysis in statistical machine translation 
Named entities must first be identified in the text  if not  they may be erroneously translated as common nouns  which would most likely not affect the BLEU rating of the translation but would change the text s human readability              They may be omitted from the output translation  which would also have implications for the text s readability and message 
Transliteration includes finding the letters in the target language that most closely correspond to the name in the source language   This  however  has been cited as sometimes worsening the quality of translation              For  Southern California  the first word should be translated directly  while the second word should be transliterated   Machines often transliterate both because they treated them as one entity   Words like these are hard for machine translators  even those with a transliteration component  to process 
Use of a  do not translate  list  which has the same end goal   transliteration as opposed to translation               still relies on correct identification of named entities 
A third approach is a class based model  Named entities are replaced with a token to represent their  class    Ted   and  Erica  would both be replaced with  person  class token  Then the statistical distribution and use of person names  in general  can be analyzed instead of looking at the distributions of  Ted  and  Erica  individually  so that the probability of a given name in a specific language will not affect the assigned probability of a translation  A study by Stanford on improving this area of translation gives the examples that different probabilities will be assigned to  David is going for a walk  and  Ankit is going for a walk  for English as a target language due to the different number of occurrences for each name in the training data  A frustrating outcome of the same study by Stanford  and other attempts to improve named recognition translation  is that many times  a decrease in the BLEU scores for translation will result from the inclusion of methods for named entity translation             

Applications edit 
While no system provides the ideal of fully automatic high quality machine translation of unrestricted text  many fully automated systems produce reasonable output                                      The quality of machine translation is substantially improved if the domain is restricted and controlled              This enables using machine translation as a tool to speed up and simplify translations  as well as producing flawed but useful low cost or ad hoc translations 

Travel edit 
Machine translation applications have also been released for most mobile devices  including mobile telephones  pocket PCs  PDAs  etc  Due to their portability  such instruments have come to be designated as mobile translation tools enabling mobile business networking between partners speaking different languages  or facilitating both foreign language learning and unaccompanied traveling to foreign countries without the need of the intermediation of a human translator 
For example  the Google Translate app allows foreigners to quickly translate text in their surrounding via augmented reality using the smartphone camera that overlays the translated text onto the text              It can also recognize speech and then translate it             

Public administration edit 
Despite their inherent limitations  MT programs are used around the world  Probably the largest institutional user is the European Commission  In       with an aim to replace a rule based MT by newer  statistical based MT EC  The European Commission contributed       million euros  via its ISA programme              

Wikipedia edit 
Machine translation has also been used for translating Wikipedia articles and could play a larger role in creating  updating  expanding  and generally improving articles in the future  especially as the MT capabilities may improve  There is a  content translation tool  which allows editors to more easily translate articles across several select languages                                      English language articles are thought to usually be more comprehensive and less biased than their non translated equivalents in other languages              As of       English Wikipedia has over     million articles while  for example  the German and Swedish Wikipedias each only have over     million articles              each often far less comprehensive 

Surveillance and military edit 
Following terrorist attacks in Western countries  including       the U S  and its allies have been most interested in developing  Arabic machine translation programs  but also in translating Pashto and Dari languages      citation needed      Within these languages  the focus is on key phrases and quick communication between military members and civilians through the use of mobile phone apps              The Information Processing Technology Office in DARPA hosted programs like TIDES and Babylon translator  US Air Force has awarded a    million contract to develop a language translation technology             

Social media edit 
The notable rise of social networking on the web in recent years has created yet another niche for the application of machine translation software   in utilities such as Facebook  or instant messaging clients such as Skype  Google Talk  MSN Messenger  etc    allowing users speaking different languages to communicate with each other 

Online games edit 
Lineage W gained popularity in Japan because of its machine translation features allowing players from different countries to communicate             

Medicine edit 
Despite being labelled as an unworthy competitor to human translation in      by the Automated Language Processing Advisory Committee put together by the United States government              the quality of machine translation has now been improved to such levels that its application in online collaboration and in the medical field are being investigated  The application of this technology in medical settings where human translators are absent is another topic of research  but difficulties arise due to the importance of accurate translations in medical diagnoses             
Researchers caution that the use of machine translation in medicine could risk mistranslations that can be dangerous in critical situations                          Machine translation can make it easier for doctors to communicate with their patients in day to day activities  but it is recommended to only use machine translation when there is no other alternative  and that translated medical texts should be reviewed by human translators for accuracy                         

Law edit 
Legal language poses a significant challenge to machine translation tools due to its precise nature and atypical use of normal words  For this reason  specialized algorithms have been developed for use in legal contexts              Due to the risk of mistranslations arising from machine translators  researchers recommend that machine translations should be reviewed by human translators for accuracy  and some courts prohibit its use in formal proceedings             
The use of machine translation in law has raised concerns about translation errors and client confidentiality  Lawyers who use free translation tools such as Google Translate may accidentally violate client confidentiality by exposing private information to the providers of the translation tools              In addition  there have been arguments that consent for a police search that is obtained with machine translation is invalid  with different courts issuing different verdicts over whether or not these arguments are valid             

Ancient languages edit 
The advancements in convolutional neural networks in recent years and in low resource machine translation  when only a very limited amount of data and examples are available for training  enabled machine translation for ancient languages  such as Akkadian and its dialects Babylonian and Assyrian             

Evaluation edit 
Main article  Evaluation of machine translation
There are many factors that affect how machine translation systems are evaluated  These factors include the intended use of the translation  the nature of the machine translation software  and the nature of the translation process 
Different programs may work well for different purposes  For example  statistical machine translation  SMT  typically outperforms example based machine translation  EBMT   but researchers found that when evaluating English to French translation  EBMT performs better              The same concept applies for technical documents  which can be more easily translated by SMT because of their formal language 
In certain applications  however  e g   product descriptions written in a controlled language  a dictionary based machine translation system has produced satisfactory translations that require no human intervention save for quality inspection             
There are various means for evaluating the output quality of machine translation systems  The oldest is the use of human judges             to assess a translation s quality  Even though human evaluation is time consuming  it is still the most reliable method to compare different systems such as rule based and statistical systems              Automated means of evaluation include BLEU  NIST  METEOR  and LEPOR             
Relying exclusively on unedited machine translation ignores the fact that communication in human language is context embedded and that it takes a person to comprehend the context of the original text with a reasonable degree of probability  It is certainly true that even purely human generated translations are prone to error  Therefore  to ensure that a machine generated translation will be useful to a human being and that publishable quality translation is achieved  such translations must be reviewed and edited by a human              The late Claude Piron wrote that machine translation  at its best  automates the easier part of a translator s job  the harder and more time consuming part usually involves doing extensive research to resolve ambiguities in the source text  which the grammatical and lexical exigencies of the target language require to be resolved  Such research is a necessary prelude to the pre editing necessary in order to provide input for machine translation software such that the output will not be meaningless             
In addition to disambiguation problems  decreased accuracy can occur due to varying levels of training data for machine translating programs  Both example based and statistical machine translation rely on a vast array of real example sentences as a base for translation  and when too many or too few sentences are analyzed accuracy is jeopardized  Researchers found that when a program is trained on         sentence pairings  accuracy actually decreases              The optimal level of training data seems to be just over         sentences  possibly because as training data increases  the number of possible sentences increases  making it harder to find an exact translation match 
Flaws in machine translation have been noted for their entertainment value  Two videos uploaded to YouTube in April      involve two Japanese hiragana characters     e and gu  being repeatedly pasted into Google Translate  with the resulting translations quickly degrading into nonsensical phrases such as  DECEARING EGG  and  Deep sea squeeze trees   which are then read in increasingly absurd voices                          the full length version of the video currently has     million views as of March           update                 

Machine translation and signed languages edit 
Main article  Machine translation of sign languages
In the early     s  options for machine translation between spoken and signed languages were severely limited  It was a common belief that deaf individuals could use traditional translators  However  stress  intonation  pitch  and timing are conveyed much differently in spoken languages compared to signed languages  Therefore  a deaf individual may misinterpret or become confused about the meaning of written text that is based on a spoken language             
Researchers Zhao  et al          developed a prototype called TEAM  translation from English to ASL by machine  that completed English to American Sign Language  ASL  translations  The program would first analyze the syntactic  grammatical  and morphological aspects of the English text  Following this step  the program accessed a sign synthesizer  which acted as a dictionary for ASL  This synthesizer housed the process one must follow to complete ASL signs  as well as the meanings of these signs  Once the entire text is analyzed and the signs necessary to complete the translation are located in the synthesizer  a computer generated human appeared and would use ASL to sign the English text to the user             

Copyright edit 
Only works that are original are subject to copyright protection  so some scholars claim that machine translation results are not entitled to copyright protection because MT does not involve creativity              The copyright at issue is for a derivative work  the author of the original work in the original language does not lose his rights when a work is translated  a translator must have permission to publish a translation      citation needed
