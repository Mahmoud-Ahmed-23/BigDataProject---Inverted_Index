Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring  processing  analyzing  and understanding digital images  and extraction of high dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information  e g  in the form of decisions                                               Understanding  in this context signifies the transformation of visual images  the input to the retina  into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action  This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry  physics  statistics  and learning theory 
The scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images  Image data can take many forms  such as video sequences  views from multiple cameras  multi dimensional data from a  D scanner   D point clouds from LiDaR sensors  or medical scanning devices  The technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems 
Subdisciplines of computer vision include scene reconstruction  object detection  event detection  activity recognition  video tracking  object recognition   D pose estimation  learning  indexing  motion estimation  visual servoing   D scene modeling  and image restoration 


Definition edit 
Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made to gain high level understanding from digital images or videos  From the perspective of engineering  it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do                                    Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction  analysis  and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images  It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding              As a scientific discipline  computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images  The image data can take many forms  such as video sequences  views from multiple cameras  or multi dimensional data from a medical scanner             As a technological discipline  computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems  Machine vision refers to a systems engineering discipline  especially in the context of factory automation  In more recent times  the terms computer vision and machine vision have converged to a greater degree                                  

History edit 
In the late     s  computer vision began at universities that were pioneering artificial intelligence  It was meant to mimic the human visual system as a stepping stone to endowing robots with intelligent behavior              In       it was believed that this could be achieved through an undergraduate summer project              by attaching a camera to a computer and having it  describe what it saw                          
What distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of digital image processing at that time was a desire to extract three dimensional structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding  Studies in the     s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision algorithms that exist today  including extraction of edges from images  labeling of lines  non polyhedral and polyhedral modeling  representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures  optical flow  and motion estimation             
The next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision  These include the concept of scale space  the inference of shape from various cues such as shading  texture and focus  and contour models known as snakes  Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as regularization and Markov random fields             
By the     s  some of the previous research topics became more active than others  Research in projective   D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration  With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration  it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry  This led to methods for sparse   D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images  Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multi view stereo techniques  At the same time  variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation  This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images  see Eigenface   Toward the end of the     s  a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision  This included image based rendering  image morphing  view interpolation  panoramic image stitching and early light field rendering             
Recent work has seen the resurgence of feature based methods used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks                          
The advancement of Deep Learning techniques has brought further life to the field of computer vision  The accuracy of deep learning algorithms on several benchmark computer vision data sets for tasks ranging from classification              segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods                         

Related fields edit

Solid state physics edit 
Solid state physics is another field that is closely related to computer vision  Most computer vision systems rely on image sensors  which detect electromagnetic radiation  which is typically in the form of either visible  infrared or ultraviolet light  The sensors are designed using quantum physics  The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics  Physics explains the behavior of optics which are a core part of most imaging systems  Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process              Also  various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision  for example  motion in fluids 

Neurobiology edit 
Simplified example of training a neural network in object detection  The network is trained by multiple images that are known to depict starfish and sea urchins  which are correlated with  nodes  that represent visual features  The starfish match with a ringed texture and a star outline  whereas most sea urchins match with a striped texture and oval shape  However  the instance of a ring textured sea urchin creates a weakly weighted association between them Subsequent run of the network on an input image  left               The network correctly detects the starfish  However  the weakly weighted association between ringed texture and sea urchin also confers a weak signal to the latter from one of two intermediate nodes  In addition  a shell that was not included in the training gives a weak signal for the oval shape  also resulting in a weak signal for the sea urchin output  These weak signals may result in a false positive result for sea urchin In reality  textures and outlines would not be represented by single nodes  but rather by associated weight patterns of multiple nodes 
Neurobiology has greatly influenced the development of computer vision algorithms  Over the last century  there has been an extensive study of eyes  neurons  and brain structures devoted to the processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals  This has led to a coarse yet convoluted description of how natural vision systems operate in order to solve certain vision related tasks  These results have led to a sub field within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems at different levels of complexity  Also  some of the learning based methods developed within computer vision  e g  neural net and deep learning based image and feature analysis and classification  have their background in neurobiology   The Neocognitron  a neural network developed in the     s by Kunihiko Fukushima  is an early example of computer vision taking direct inspiration from neurobiology  specifically the primary visual cortex 
Some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of biological vision indeed  just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human intelligence and the use of stored knowledge to interpret  integrate  and utilize visual information  The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals  Computer vision  on the other hand  develops and describes the algorithms implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems  An interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fields             

Signal processing edit 
Yet another field related to computer vision is signal processing  Many methods for processing one variable signals  typically temporal signals  can be extended in a natural way to the processing of two variable signals or multi variable signals in computer vision  However  because of the specific nature of images  there are many methods developed within computer vision that have no counterpart in the processing of one variable signals  Together with the multi dimensionality of the signal  this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision 

Robotic navigation edit 
Robot navigation sometimes deals with autonomous path planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment              A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them  Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system  acting as a vision sensor and providing high level information about the environment and the robot

Visual computing edit 
This section is an excerpt from Visual computing  edit 
Visual computing is a generic term for all computer science disciplines dealing with images and  D models  such as computer graphics  image processing  visualization  computer vision  virtual and augmented reality  video processing  and computational visualistics  Visual computing also includes aspects of pattern recognition  human computer interaction  machine learning and digital libraries  The core challenges are the acquisition  processing  analysis and rendering of visual information  mainly images and video   Application areas include industrial quality control  medical image processing and visualization  surveying  robotics  multimedia systems  virtual heritage  special effects in movies and television  and computer games 
Other fields edit 
Besides the above mentioned views on computer vision  many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view  For example  many methods in computer vision are based on statistics  optimization or geometry  Finally  a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision  how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware  or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance  Computer vision is also used in fashion eCommerce  inventory management  patent search  furniture  and the beauty industry             

Distinctions edit 
The fields most closely related to computer vision are image processing  image analysis and machine vision  There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover  This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar  something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names  On the other hand  it appears to be necessary for research groups  scientific journals  conferences  and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and  hence  various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented  In image processing  the input and output are both images  whereas in computer vision  the input is an image or video  and the output could be an enhanced image  an analysis of the image s content  or even a system s behavior based on that analysis 
Computer graphics produces image data from  D models  and computer vision often produces  D models from image data              There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines  e g   as explored in augmented reality 
The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally accepted 

Image processing and image analysis tend to focus on  D images  how to transform one image to another  e g   by pixel wise operations such as contrast enhancement  local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal  or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image  This characterization implies that image processing analysis neither requires assumptions nor produces interpretations about the image content 
Computer vision includes  D analysis from  D images  This analyzes the  D scene projected onto one or several images  e g   how to reconstruct structure or other information about the  D scene from one or several images  Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image 
Machine vision is the process of applying a range of technologies and methods to provide imaging based automatic inspection  process control  and robot guidance             in industrial applications              Machine vision tends to focus on applications  mainly in manufacturing  e g   vision based robots and systems for vision based inspection  measurement  or picking  such as bin picking               This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that real time processing is emphasized by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software  It also implies that external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision  which can enable the use of different algorithms 
There is also a field called imaging which primarily focuses on the process of producing images  but sometimes also deals with the processing and analysis of images  For example  medical imaging includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications  Progress in convolutional neural networks  CNNs  has improved the accurate detection of disease in medical images  particularly in cardiology  pathology  dermatology  and radiology             
Finally  pattern recognition is a field that uses various methods to extract information from signals in general  mainly based on statistical approaches and artificial neural networks              A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data 
Photogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision  e g   stereophotogrammetry vs  computer stereo vision 

Applications edit 
Applications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which  say  inspect bottles speeding by on a production line  to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them  The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap  Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields  Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications  In many computer vision applications  computers are pre programmed to solve a particular task  but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common  Examples of applications of computer vision include systems for

Medicine edit 
DARPA s Visual Media Reasoning concept video
One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision  or medical image processing  characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient  An example of this is the detection of tumours  arteriosclerosis or other malign changes  and a variety of dental pathologies  measurements of organ dimensions  blood flow  etc  are another example  It also supports medical research by providing new information  e g   about the structure of the brain or the quality of medical treatments  Applications of computer vision in the medical area also include enhancement of images interpreted by humans ultrasonic images or X ray images  for example to reduce the influence of noise 

Machine vision edit 
A second application area in computer vision is in industry  sometimes called machine vision  where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a production process  One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects  One of the most prevalent fields for such inspection is the Wafer industry in which every single Wafer is being measured and inspected for inaccuracies or defects to prevent a computer chip from coming to market in an unusable manner  Another example is a measurement of the position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm  Machine vision is also heavily used in the agricultural processes to remove undesirable foodstuff from bulk material  a process called optical sorting             

Military edit 
Military applications are probably one of the largest areas of computer vision     citation needed       The obvious examples are the detection of enemy soldiers or vehicles and missile guidance  More advanced systems for missile guidance send the missile to an area rather than a specific target  and target selection is made when the missile reaches the area based on locally acquired image data  Modern military concepts  such as  battlefield awareness   imply that various sensors  including image sensors  provide a rich set of information about a combat scene that can be used to support strategic decisions  In this case  automatic processing of the data is used to reduce complexity and to fuse information from multiple sensors to increase reliability 

Autonomous vehicles edit

One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles  which include submersibles  land based vehicles  small robots with wheels  cars  or trucks   aerial vehicles  and unmanned aerial vehicles  UAV   The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous  unmanned  vehicles to vehicles where computer vision based systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations  Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation  e g   for knowing where they are or mapping their environment  SLAM   for detecting obstacles  It can also be used for detecting certain task specific events  e g   a UAV looking for forest fires  Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars  cameras and LiDAR sensors in vehicles  and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft  Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars  There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance  Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision  e g   NASA s Curiosity and CNSA s Yutu   rover 

Tactile feedback edit 
Rubber artificial skin layer with the flexible structure for the shape estimation of micro undulation surfaces
Above is a silicon mold with a camera inside containing many different point markers  When this sensor is pressed against the surface  the silicon deforms  and the position of the point markers shifts  A computer can then take this data and determine how exactly the mold is pressed against the surface  This can be used to calibrate robotic hands in order to make sure they can grasp objects effectively 
Materials such as rubber and silicon are being used to create sensors that allow for applications such as detecting microundulations and calibrating robotic hands  Rubber can be used in order to create a mold that can be placed over a finger  inside of this mold would be multiple strain gauges  The finger mold and sensors could then be placed on top of a small sheet of rubber containing an array of rubber pins  A user can then wear the finger mold and trace a surface  A computer can then read the data from the strain gauges and measure if one or more of the pins are being pushed upward  If a pin is being pushed upward then the computer can recognize this as an imperfection in the surface  This sort of technology is useful in order to receive accurate data on imperfections on a very large surface              Another variation of this finger mold sensor are sensors that contain a camera suspended in silicon  The silicon forms a dome around the outside of the camera and embedded in the silicon are point markers that are equally spaced  These cameras can then be placed on devices such as robotic hands in order to allow the computer to receive highly accurate tactile data             
Other application areas include 

Support of visual effects creation for cinema and broadcast  e g   camera tracking  match moving  
Surveillance 
Driver drowsiness detection                                    
Tracking and counting organisms in the biological sciences            
Typical tasks edit 
Each of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks  more or less well defined measurement problems or processing problems  which can be solved using a variety of methods  Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below 
Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring  processing  analyzing and understanding digital images  and extraction of high dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information  e g   in the forms of decisions                                              Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images  the input of the retina  into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action  This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry  physics  statistics  and learning theory             

Recognition edit 
The classical problem in computer vision  image processing  and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object  feature  or activity  Different varieties of recognition problem are described in the literature             

Object recognition  also called object classification                   one or several pre specified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized  usually together with their  D positions in the image or  D poses in the scene  Blippar  Google Goggles  and LikeThat provide stand alone programs that illustrate this functionality 
Identification                  an individual instance of an object is recognized  Examples include identification of a specific person s face or fingerprint  identification of handwritten digits  or the identification of a specific vehicle 
Detection                  the image data are scanned for specific objects along with their locations  Examples include the detection of an obstacle in the car s field of view and possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or the detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system  Detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation 
Currently  the best algorithms for such tasks are based on convolutional neural networks  An illustration of their capabilities is given by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge  this is a benchmark in object classification and detection  with millions of images and      object classes used in the competition              Performance of convolutional neural networks on the ImageNet tests is now close to that of humans              The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin  such as a small ant on the stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand  They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters  an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras   By contrast  those kinds of images rarely trouble humans  Humans  however  tend to have trouble with other issues  For example  they are not good at classifying objects into fine grained classes  such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird  whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease      citation needed     
Several specialized tasks based on recognition exist  such as 

Content based image retrieval                  finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content  The content can be specified in different ways  for example in terms of similarity relative to a target image  give me all images similar to image X  by utilizing reverse image search techniques  or in terms of high level search criteria given as text input  give me all images which contain many houses  are taken during winter and have no cars in them  
Computer vision for people counter purposes in public places  malls  shopping centers
Pose estimation                  estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera  An example application for this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an assembly line situation or picking parts from a bin 
Optical character recognition  OCR                   identifying characters in images of printed or handwritten text  usually with a view to encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or indexing  e g  ASCII   A related task is reading of  D codes such as data matrix and QR codes 
Facial recognition                   a technology that enables the matching of faces in digital images or video frames to a face database  which is now widely used for mobile phone facelock  smart door locking  etc             
Emotion recognition                  a subset of facial recognition  emotion recognition refers to the process of classifying human emotions  Psychologists caution  however  that internal emotions cannot be reliably detected from faces             
Shape Recognition Technology  SRT  in people counter systems differentiating human beings  head and shoulder patterns  from objects 
Human activity recognition   deals with recognizing the activity from a series of video frames  such as  if the person is picking up an object or walking 
Motion analysis edit 
Several tasks relate to motion estimation  where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the  D scene or even of the camera that produces the images  Examples of such tasks are 

Egomotion                  determining the  D rigid motion  rotation and translation  of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera 
Tracking                  following the movements of a  usually  smaller set of interest points or objects  e g   vehicles  objects  humans or other organisms              in the image sequence  This has vast industry applications as most high running machinery can be monitored in this way 
Optical flow                  to determine  for each point in the image  how that point is moving relative to the image plane  i e   its apparent motion  This motion is a result of both how the corresponding  D point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene 
Scene reconstruction edit 
Given one or  typically  more images of a scene  or a video  scene reconstruction aims at computing a  D model of the scene  In the simplest case  the model can be a set of  D points  More sophisticated methods produce a complete  D surface model  The advent of  D imaging not requiring motion or scanning  and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field  Grid based  D sensing can be used to acquire  D images from multiple angles  Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple  D images together into point clouds and  D models             

Image restoration edit 
Image restoration comes into the picture when the original image is degraded or damaged due to some external factors like lens wrong positioning  transmission interference  low lighting or motion blurs  etc   which is referred to as noise  When the images are degraded or damaged  the information to be extracted from them also gets damaged  Therefore  we need to recover or restore the image as it was intended to be  The aim of image restoration is the removal of noise  sensor noise  motion blur  etc   from images  The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters  such as low pass filters or median filters  More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look to distinguish them from noise  By first analyzing the image data in terms of the local image structures  such as lines or edges  and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step  a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches 
An example in this field is inpainting 

System methods edit 
The organization of a computer vision system is highly application dependent  Some systems are stand alone applications that solve a specific measurement or detection problem  while others constitute a sub system of a larger design which  for example  also contains sub systems for control of mechanical actuators  planning  information databases  man machine interfaces  etc  The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on whether its functionality is pre specified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation  Many functions are unique to the application  There are  however  typical functions that are found in many computer vision systems 

Image acquisition   A digital image is produced by one or several image sensors  which  besides various types of light sensitive cameras  include range sensors  tomography devices  radar  ultra sonic cameras  etc  Depending on the type of sensor  the resulting image data is an ordinary  D image  a  D volume  or an image sequence  The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands  gray images or colour images  but can also be related to various physical measures  such as depth  absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves  or magnetic resonance imaging             
Pre processing   Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information  it is usually necessary to process the data in order to ensure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method  Examples are 
Re sampling to ensure that the image coordinate system is correct 
Noise reduction to ensure that sensor noise does not introduce false information 
Contrast enhancement to ensure that relevant information can be detected 
Scale space representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales 
Feature extraction   Image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data              Typical examples of such features are 
Lines  edges and ridges 
Localized interest points such as corners  blobs or points 
More complex features may be related to texture  shape  or motion 
Detection segmentation   At some point in the processing  a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing              Examples are 
Selection of a specific set of interest points 
Segmentation of one or multiple image regions that contain a specific object of interest 
Segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprising foreground  object groups  single objects or salient object             parts  also referred to as spatial taxon scene hierarchy               while the visual salience is often implemented as spatial and temporal attention 
Segmentation or co segmentation of one or multiple videos into a series of per frame foreground masks while maintaining its temporal semantic continuity                         
High level processing   At this step  the input is typically a small set of data  for example  a set of points or an image region  which is assumed to contain a specific object              The remaining processing deals with  for example 
Verification that the data satisfies model based and application specific assumptions 
Estimation of application specific parameters  such as object pose or object size 
Image recognition   classifying a detected object into different categories 
Image registration   comparing and combining two different views of the same object 
Decision making Making the final decision required for the application              for example 
Pass fail on automatic inspection applications 
Match no match in recognition applications 
Flag for further human review in medical  military  security and recognition applications 
Image understanding systems edit 
Image understanding systems  IUS  include three levels of abstraction as follows  low level includes image primitives such as edges  texture elements  or regions  intermediate level includes boundaries  surfaces and volumes  and high level includes objects  scenes  or events  Many of these requirements are entirely topics for further research 
The representational requirements in the designing of IUS for these levels are  representation of prototypical concepts  concept organization  spatial knowledge  temporal knowledge  scaling  and description by comparison and differentiation 
While inference refers to the process of deriving new  not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts  control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference  search  and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing  Inference and control requirements for IUS are  search and hypothesis activation  matching and hypothesis testing  generation and use of expectations  change and focus of attention  certainty and strength of belief  inference and goal satisfaction             

Hardware edit

There are many kinds of computer vision systems  however  all of them contain these basic elements  a power source  at least one image acquisition device  camera  ccd  etc    a processor  and control and communication cables or some kind of wireless interconnection mechanism  In addition  a practical vision system contains software  as well as a display in order to monitor the system  Vision systems for inner spaces  as most industrial ones  contain an illumination system and may be placed in a controlled environment  Furthermore  a completed system includes many accessories  such as camera supports  cables  and connectors 
Most computer vision systems use visible light cameras passively viewing a scene at frame rates of at most    frames per second  usually far slower  
A few computer vision systems use image acquisition hardware with active illumination or something other than visible light or both  such as structured light  D scanners  thermographic cameras  hyperspectral imagers  radar imaging  lidar scanners  magnetic resonance images  side scan sonar  synthetic aperture sonar  etc  Such hardware captures  images  that are then processed often using the same computer vision algorithms used to process visible light images 
While traditional broadcast and consumer video systems operate at a rate of    frames per second  advances in digital signal processing and consumer graphics hardware has made high speed image acquisition  processing  and display possible for real time systems on the order of hundreds to thousands of frames per second  For applications in robotics  fast  real time video systems are critically important and often can simplify the processing needed for certain algorithms  When combined with a high speed projector  fast image acquisition allows  D measurement and feature tracking to be realized             
Egocentric vision systems are composed of a wearable camera that automatically take pictures from a first person perspective 
As of       vision processing units are emerging as a new class of processors to complement CPUs and graphics processing units  GPUs  in this role
