Rodney Allen Brooks  born    December                             is an Australian roboticist  Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science  author  and robotics entrepreneur  most known for popularizing the actionist approach to robotics  He was a Panasonic Professor of Robotics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and former director of the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory  He is a founder and former Chief Technical Officer of iRobot            and co founder  Chairman and Chief Technical Officer of Rethink Robotics  formerly Heartland Robotics  and is the co founder and Chief Technical Officer of Robust AI  founded in                  


Life edit 
Brooks received an M A  in pure mathematics from Flinders University of South Australia             In       he received a PhD in Computer Science from Stanford University under the supervision of Thomas Binford             He has held research positions at Carnegie Mellon University and MIT and a faculty position at Stanford University  He joined the MIT faculty in       He was Panasonic Professor of Robotics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  He was director of the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory              previously the  Artificial Intelligence Laboratory  
In       Brooks and his work were featured in the film Fast  Cheap  amp  Out of Control            
Brooks became a member of the National Academy of Engineering in      for contributions to the foundations and applications of robotics  including establishing consumer and hazardous environment robotics industries            

Work edit 
Academic work edit 
Rodney Brooks in     
Instead of computation as the ultimate conceptual metaphor that helped artificial intelligence become a separate discipline in the scientific community  he proposed that action or behavior is more appropriate to be used in robotics  Critical of applying the computational metaphor  even to the fields where the action metaphor is more relevant  he wrote in      that 

Some of my colleagues have managed to recast Pluto s orbital behavior as the body itself carrying out computations on forces that apply to it  I think we are perhaps better off using Newtonian mechanics  with a little Einstein thrown in  to understand and predict the orbits of planets and others  It is so much simpler            
In his      paper   Elephants Don t Play Chess               Brooks argued that for robots to accomplish everyday tasks in an environment shared by humans  their higher cognitive abilities  including abstract thinking emulated by symbolic reasoning  need to be based on the primarily sensory motor coupling  action  with the environment  complemented by the proprioceptive sense which is a critical component in hand eye coordination  pointing out that 

Over time there s been a realization that vision  sound processing  and early language are maybe the keys to how our brain is organized            
Industrial work edit 
Brooks was an entrepreneur before leaving academia to found Rethink Robotics  He was one of ten founders of Lucid Inc   and worked with them until the company s closure in           citation needed      Before Lucid closed  Brooks had founded iRobot with former students Colin Angle and Helen Greiner 

Robots edit 
Robot at Rethink Robotics        Brooks is at the right in the lineup behind the robot  At left is Steve Jurvetson  the photographer 
He experimented with off the shelf components  such as Fischertechnik and Lego  and tried to make robots self replicate by putting together clones of themselves using the components  His robots include mini robots used in oil wells explorations without cables  the robots that searched for survivors at Ground Zero in New York  and the robots used in medicine doing robotic surgery            

Allen
In the late     s  Brooks and his team introduced Allen  a robot using subsumption architecture  As of          update      Brooks  work focused on engineering intelligent robots to operate in unstructured environments and understanding human intelligence through building humanoid robots      citation needed     

Baxter
Main article  Baxter  robot 
Introduced in      by Rethink Robotics  an industrial robot named Baxter was intended as the robotic analogue of the early personal computer designed to safely interact with neighbouring human workers and be programmable for the performance of simple tasks  The robot stops if it encounters a human in the way of its robotic arm and has a prominent off switch that its human partner can push if necessary  Costs were projected to be the equivalent of a worker making    an hour             

AI edit 
In June       Brooks said GenAI is overrated
