Alternate term for or form of artificial intelligence

Synthetic intelligence  SI  is an alternative opposite term for artificial intelligence emphasizing that the intelligence of machines need not be an imitation or in any way artificial  it can be a genuine form of intelligence                        John Haugeland proposes an analogy with simulated diamonds and synthetic diamonds only the synthetic diamond is truly a diamond             Synthetic means that which is produced by synthesis  combining parts to form a whole  colloquially  a human made version of that which has arisen naturally  A  synthetic intelligence  would therefore be or appear human made  but not a simulation            


Definition edit 
The term was used by Haugeland in      to describe artificial intelligence research up to that point             which he called  good old fashioned artificial intelligence  or  GOFAI   AI s first generation of researchers firmly believed their techniques would lead to real  human like intelligence in machines             After the first AI winter  many AI researchers shifted their focus from artificial general intelligence to finding solutions for specific individual problems  such as machine learning  an approach to which some popular sources refer as  weak AI  or  applied AI             
The term  synthetic AI  is now sometimes used by researchers in the field to separate their work  using subsymbolism  emergence  Psi Theory  or other relatively new methods to define and create  true  intelligence  from previous attempts  particularly those of GOFAI or weak AI                       
Sources disagree about exactly what constitutes  real  intelligence as opposed to  simulated  intelligence and therefore whether there is a meaningful distinction between artificial intelligence and synthetic intelligence  Russell and Norvig present this example            

 Can machines fly   The answer is yes  because airplanes fly 
 Can machines swim   The answer is no  because submarines don t swim 
 Can machines think   Is this question like the first  or like the second 
Drew McDermott firmly believes that  thinking  should be construed like  flying   While discussing the electronic chess champion Deep Blue  he argues  Saying Deep Blue doesn t really think about chess is like saying an airplane doesn t really fly because it doesn t flap its wings                          Edsger Dijkstra agrees that some find  the question whether machines can think as relevant as the question whether submarines can swim              
John Searle  on the other hand  suggests that a thinking machine is  at best  a simulation  and writes  No one supposes that computer simulations of a five alarm fire will burn the neighborhood down or that a computer simulation of a rainstorm will leave us all drenched               The essential difference between a simulated mind and a real mind is one of the key points of his Chinese room argument 
Daniel Dennett believes that this is basically a disagreement about semantics  peripheral to the central questions of the philosophy of artificial intelligence  He notes that even a chemically perfect imitation of a Chateau Latour is still a fake  but that any vodka is real  no matter who made it              Similarly  a perfect  molecule by molecule recreation of an original Picasso would be considered a  forgery   but any image of the Coca Cola logo is completely real and subject to trademark laws  Russell and Norvig comment  we can conclude that in some cases  the behavior of an artifact is important  while in others it is the artifact s pedigree that matters  Which one is important in which case seems to be a matter of convention  But for artificial minds  there is no convention

Difference between AI and SI   The key difference between AI and SI is that AI refers to developing computer systems that can mimic human intelligence  while SI involves the creation of entirely synthetic intelligent systems            that are not based on biological structures or processes
