                                                                Tailwind CSS has gained immense popularity among developers for its utility first approach to styling web applications  Django on the other hand is a robust and flexible web framework written in Python  Combining these two powerful tools can enhance your Django projects  In this article  we will explore how to integrate the capabilities of Tailwind CSS within a Django project 
Tailwind CSS is basically a Utility first CSS framework for building rapid custom UI  It is a highly customizable  low level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks that you need  Also  it is a cool way to write inline styling and achieve an awesome interface without writing a single line of your own CSS 
Python Django is a web framework that is used to create web applications very efficiently and quickly  Django is called a battery included framework because it contains a lot of built in features such as Django Admin Interface  default database   SQLite   etc  Django provides various ready made components such as a way to handle user authentication  a management panel for your website  forms  a way to upload files  etc 
Steps to use Tailwind CSS with DjangoStep    Install Django package  Install the Django package via the following command 
python  m pip install DjangoStep    Create a Django project  Create a Django project via the following command and name your Project whatever you want  Here my Project name is  myapp  
django admin startproject myappStep    Go inside myapp folder  We need to get inside the created folder to create other files 
cd myappStep    Create a new  templates   directory inside the project folder and update  settings py  folder 

            Python

    TEMPLATES    
     
             BACKEND            django template backends django DjangoTemplates      
             DIRS        BASE DIR        templates         updated part
             APP DIRS       True 
             OPTIONS        
                 context processors        
                     django template context processors debug      
                     django template context processors request      
                     django contrib auth context processors auth      
                     django contrib messages context processors messages      
              
          
      
 

Step    Install Django compressor by running the following command in your terminal 
python  m pip install django compressorStep    Add compressor to the installed apps inside the  settings py  file 

            Python

    INSTALLED APPS    
         django contrib admin      
         django contrib auth      
         django contrib contenttypes      
         django contrib sessions      
         django contrib messages      
         django contrib staticfiles      
         compressor         updated part
 

Step    Configure the compressor inside the  settings py  file 

            Python

    COMPRESS ROOT   BASE DIR        static     

COMPRESS ENABLED   True

STATICFILES FINDERS         compressor finders CompressorFinder       

Step    Create two new folders  static src  and an input css file inside those folders 
Step    Create a new  views py  file inside  myapp   next to urls py and add the following content 

            Python

    from django shortcuts import render

def index request  
    return render request       index html      

Step     Import the newly created view instance inside the  urls py  file by adding the following code 

            Python

    from  views import index

urlpatterns    
    path      admin        admin site urls  
    path             index  name      index      
 

Step     Create a new   base html  file inside the templates directory and write the following code inside it  It s a template file that serves as a base or layout for other HTML files in your application 

            HTML

       load compress   
   load static   

 lt  DOCTYPE html gt 
 lt html lang  quot en quot  gt 

 lt head gt 
     lt meta charset  quot UTF   quot  gt 
     lt meta http equiv  quot X UA Compatible quot  content  quot IE edge quot  gt 
     lt meta name  quot viewport quot  content 
         quot width device width  initial scale     quot  gt 
     lt title gt Django   Tailwind CSS lt  title gt 

       compress css   
     lt link rel  quot stylesheet quot  
        href  quot    static      src output css         quot  gt 
       endcompress   

 lt  head gt 

 lt body class  quot bg green    quot  gt 
     lt div class  quot container mx auto mt   quot  gt 
           block content   
           endblock content   
     lt  div gt 
 lt  body gt 

 lt  html gt 

Step     Create an  index html  file  This will serve as the homepage 
Step     Now install Tailwind CSS  Run the following command on the terminal to install all the tailwind dependencies 
npm install  D tailwindcssStep     Initialize the tailwind  The below command will generate a config file named  tailwind config js  
npx tailwindcss initStep     Configure your tailwind config js  To do that go inside  tailwind config js  and update it as given below 

            JavaScript

    module exports    
      content   
                 templates      html     
        
      theme   
        extend     
        
      plugins     
 

Step     Import the Tailwind CSS directives  Add the layer directives of tailwind CSS by writing the following code inside  input css  

            CSS

     tailwind base 
 tailwind components 
 tailwind utilities 

Step     Compile the Tailwind CSS code  Run the following command on the terminal to compile the Tailwind CSS directives from  input css  into CSS code in  output css 
npx tailwindcss  i   static src input css  o   static src output cssStep     Check the Project Structure

Step     Run the application  To run the application  use the command  python manage py runserver  in the terminal 
python manage py runserverThe above line of code will generate a localhost server  amp  follow the server link to open the application on the web browser 
Step     Test Tailwind CSS with an example  Now that we have successfully set up the tailwind CSS and understand how to run the application  now  we will test with a simple example 
Example  Write the code inside  index html 

            HTML

       extends  quot  base html quot    

   block content   
       lt h  class  quot text  xl text green     quot  gt 
          GeeksforGeeks
     lt  h  gt 
       lt h  class  quot text  x  text green     quot  gt 
          GeeksforGeeks
     lt  h  gt 
   endblock content   

Output
