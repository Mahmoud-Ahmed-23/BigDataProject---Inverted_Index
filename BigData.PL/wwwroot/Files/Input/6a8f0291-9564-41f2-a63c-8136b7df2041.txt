							Volkswagen       s top brass has asked for patience as it pursues those responsible for the company       s emissions scandal  But that won       t be enough to guarantee VW       s survival  It needs a visionary plan  says DW       s Henrik B hme 
Of course  no one expected Volkswagen to have all the answers at Thursday       s press conference 
It       s been nearly three months since that fateful day in September when news of the diesel emissions scandal broke  Since then  it has slowly become clear just how massive the avalanche is that is sliding toward Europe       s largest auto maker 
There are    million cars around the world with cheating software installed to foil laboratory tests measuring nitric oxide emissions  That       s fraud in a truly menacing dimension         from which Volkswagen may never recover 
For that reason  there       s only one way out the quagmire in which the carmaker currently finds itself  a no holds barred investigation  humility toward its customers and an absolutely unambiguous promise never to do such a thing ever  ever again 
A first step
In that respect  Volkswagen       s new leadership took a first step at today       s press conference in Wolfsburg 
The company       s new supervisory board chairman  Hans Dieter P tsch  has promised clarification        without taboos         The new chief executive  Matthias M ller  said he saw the emissions scandal as a catalyst for change that VW desperately needs  Internal as well as external investigators are poring over gigantic quantities of data  Affected customers are being promised maximum support and  of course  rental cars while theirs are in the shop for new software updates or retrofits 
But is that really enough for VW to win back the trust it lost  Do people       s next car really need to be a Volkswagen  Or an Audi  Porsche  Skoda or Seat for that matter 
That       s where the problems begin 
The current VW chief  M ller  was the head of Porsche until last fall  And the luxury carmaker had its fair share of trickery too  Audi Chairman Rupert Stadler maintained for weeks that his company       s cars were not affected by the cheating  only to do a U turn and admit that Audi  too  had installed the fraudulent software in some of its models  Hans Dieter P tsch  now VW       s head supervisor  was the concern       s long time chief financial officer and a close confidant of the disgraced VW CEO Martin Winterkorn 
And we       re supposed to believe that none of them knew anything about the machinations of their engineers 
It       s bad either way  Either they were in the know and are now lying about it  or they made for some pretty uninformed bosses 
Perhaps only a very limited number of employees were involved  P tsch certainly didn       t tire from touting this line over and over again at today       s press conference 
Where       s the vision 
If P tsch and M ller are to be believed  then the VW scandal is attributable to ambiguities in the chain of command  deficencies in reporting and monitoring systems  and an unclear allocation of responsibilities 
My God  one is tempted to ask  what the hell was going on there  Was this some kind of mutiny  Was the top brass lost in its vision of being the world       s No    carmaker  Did Winterkorn and co  lose sight of their vast empire 
What kind of company culture must have been in place at Volkswagen if the new boss has to make clear that it       s not more yes men that VW needs  but the curious  the pioneers and the maladjusted  VW needs to be conducive to discussion  to closer cooperation  he said  Its employees need to be able to make mistakes as long as they learn from them 
Of course  a corporation the size of Volkswagen can       t simply replace its entire leadership  But a couple of new faces wouldn       t hurt  And  no  tapping a former Daimler manager  Christine Hohman Dennhardt  to head up the newly created post of board member for integrity and legal affairs won       t cut it 
Plenty of VW executives before them have pledged to change the corporate culture only to leave it intact  Now  it       s time to act 
Seize the moment 
For VW there can only be one way forward  To play with an open hand  like P tsch and M ller promised to today  and keep its eyes firmly on the future 
The newly decentralized company leadership structure could be a step in the right direction  But neither P tsch nor M ller dared to say today that Volkswagen wanted to be the leading provider of environmentally friendly vehicles in the future 
Wouldn       t it be an appropriate vision for Volkswagen         literally  the        people       s car                to build the people       s e car 
It has the potential  That much was made clear at today       s press conference  But simply surviving the emissions cheating scandal can       t be the end goal  VW needs a vision big enough to fuel the company for the next fifty years 
Wouldn       t now be the perfect time to change
