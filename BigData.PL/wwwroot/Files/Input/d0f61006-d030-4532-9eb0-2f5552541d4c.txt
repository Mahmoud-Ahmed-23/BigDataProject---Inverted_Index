History
Main article  History of the United Nations
Background  pre      
Haile Selassie I at the League of Nations appealing Italy s invasion in      which the League failed to intervene
In the century prior to the UN s creation  several international organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross were formed to ensure protection and assistance for victims of armed conflict and strife            
During World War I  several major leaders  especially U S  president Woodrow Wilson  advocated for a world body to guarantee peace  The winners of the war  the Allies  met to decide on formal peace terms at the Paris Peace Conference  The League of Nations was approved and started operations  but the United States never joined  On    January       the League of Nations formally came into being when the Covenant of the League of Nations  ratified by    nations in       took effect             The League Council acted as an executive body directing the Assembly s business  It began with four permanent members the United Kingdom  France  Italy  and Japan 
After some limited successes and failures during the     s  the League proved ineffective in the     s  as it failed to act against the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in       Forty nations voted for Japan to withdraw from Manchuria but Japan voted against it and walked out of the League instead of withdrawing from Manchuria             It also failed to act against the Second Italo Ethiopian War  after the appeal for international intervention by Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie I at Geneva in      went with no avail  including when calls for economic sanctions against Italy failed  Italy and other nations left the League            
When war broke out in       the League effectively closed down            

Declarations by the Allies of World War II

The first step towards the establishment of the United Nations was the Inter Allied Conference in London that led to the Declaration of St James s Palace on    June                             By August       American President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had drafted the Atlantic Charter  which defined goals for the post war world  At the subsequent meeting of the Inter Allied Council in London on    September       the eight governments in exile of countries under Axis occupation  together with the Soviet Union and representatives of the Free French Forces  unanimously adopted adherence to the common principles of policy set forth by Britain and the United States                        
Roosevelt and Churchill met at the White House in December      for the Arcadia Conference  Roosevelt is considered a founder of the UN                          and coined the term United Nations to describe the Allied countries              Churchill accepted it  noting its use by Lord Byron              The text of the Declaration by United Nations was drafted on    December       by Roosevelt  Churchill  and Harry Hopkins  It incorporated Soviet suggestions but included no role for France  One major change from the Atlantic Charter was the addition of a provision for religious freedom  which Stalin approved after Roosevelt insisted                         
Roosevelt s idea of the  Four Powers   refers to the four major Allied countries  the United States  the United Kingdom  the Soviet Union  and China  emerged in the Declaration by the United Nations              On New Year s Day       Roosevelt  Churchill  the Soviet Union s former Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov  and the Chinese Premier T  V  Soong signed the  Declaration by United Nations               and the next day the representatives of twenty two other nations added their signatures  During the war  the United Nations became the official term for the Allies  In order to join  countries had to sign the Declaration and declare war on the Axis powers             
The October      Moscow Conference resulted in the Moscow Declarations  including the Four Power Declaration on General Security  This declaration was signed by the Allied Big Four the United States  the Soviet Union  the United Kingdom  and China and aimed for the creation  at the earliest possible date of a general international organization   This was the first public announcement that a new international organization was being contemplated to replace the League of Nations  The Tehran Conference followed shortly afterwards at which Roosevelt  Churchill and Joseph Stalin  the leader of the Soviet Union  met and discussed the idea of a post war international organization 
The new international organization was formulated and negotiated amongst the delegations from the Allied Big Four at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference from    September to   October       They agreed on proposals for the aims  structure and functioning of the new organization                                      It took the conference at Yalta in February       and further negotiations with the Soviet Union  before all the issues were resolved

By   March          additional states had signed the Declaration by the United Nations              After months of planning  the UN Conference on International Organization opened in San Francisco on    April       It was attended by    nations  governments and a number of non governmental organizations                                      The delegations of the Big Four chaired the plenary meetings              Previously  Churchill had urged Roosevelt to restore France to its status of a major power after the liberation of Paris in August       The drafting of the Charter of the United Nations was completed over the following two months  and it was signed on    June      by the representatives of the    countries                          The UN officially came into existence on    October       upon ratification of the Charter by the five permanent members of the Security Council  the United States  the United Kingdom  France  the Soviet Union and China   and by a majority of the other    nations                         
The first meetings of the General Assembly  with    nations represented      a      and the Security Council took place in London beginning in January                   Debates began at once  covering topical issues such as the presence of Russian troops in Iranian Azerbaijan and British forces in Greece              British diplomat Gladwyn Jebb served as interim secretary general 
The General Assembly selected New York City as the site for the headquarters of the UN  Construction began on    September      and the facility was completed on   October       The Norwegian Foreign Minister  Trygve Lie  was the first elected UN secretary general             

Cold War            
Dag Hammarskj ld was a particularly active secretary general from      until he died in      
Though the UN s primary mandate was peacekeeping  the division between the United States and the Soviet Union often paralysed the organization  generally allowing it to intervene only in conflicts distant from the Cold War              Two notable exceptions were a Security Council resolution on   July      authorizing a US led coalition to repel the North Korean invasion of South Korea  passed in the absence of the Soviet Union                          and the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement on    July                  
On    November       the General Assembly approved resolution      a proposal to partition Palestine into two states  with Jerusalem placed under a special international regime              The plan failed             and a civil war broke out in Palestine  that led to the creation of the state of Israel afterward              Two years later  Ralph Bunche  a UN official  negotiated an armistice to the resulting conflict  with the Security Council deciding that  an armistice shall be established in all sectors of Palestine                           On   November       the first UN peacekeeping force was established to end the Suez Crisis              however  the UN was unable to intervene against the Soviet Union s simultaneous invasion of Hungary  following the country s revolution             
On    July       the UN established the United Nations Operation in the Congo  or UNOC   the largest military force of its early decades  to bring order to Katanga  restoring it to the control of the Democratic Republic of the Congo by    May                   While travelling to meet rebel leader Moise Tshombe during the conflict  Dag Hammarskj ld  often named as one of the UN s most effective secretaries general                                      died in a plane crash  Months later he was posthumously awarded the Nobel Peace Prize              In       Hammarskj ld s successor  U Thant  deployed the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus  which would become one of the UN s longest running peacekeeping missions             
With the spread of decolonization in the     s  the UN s membership shot up due to an influx of newly independent nations  In      alone     new states joined the UN     of them from Africa              On    October       with opposition from the United States  but with the support of many Third World nations  the People s Republic of China was given the Chinese seat on the Security Council in place of the Republic of China  also known as Taiwan   The vote was widely seen as a sign of waning American influence in the organization              Third World nations organized themselves into the Group of    under the leadership of Algeria  which briefly became a dominant power at the UN              On    November       a bloc comprising the Soviet Union and Third World nations passed a resolution  over strenuous American and Israeli opposition  declaring Zionism to be a form of racism  The resolution was repealed on    December       shortly after the end of the Cold War                         
With an increasing Third World presence and the failure of UN mediation in conflicts in the Middle East  Vietnam  and Kashmir  the UN increasingly shifted its attention to its secondary goals of economic development and cultural exchange              By the     s  the UN budget for social and economic development was far greater than its peacekeeping budget      citation needed

After the Cold War  the UN saw a radical expansion in its peacekeeping duties  taking on more missions in five years than it had in the previous four decades              Between      and       the number of adopted Security Council resolutions more than doubled  and the peacekeeping budget increased more than tenfold                                                  The UN negotiated an end to the Salvadoran Civil War  launched a successful peacekeeping mission in Namibia  and oversaw democratic elections in post apartheid South Africa and post Khmer Rouge Cambodia              In       the UN authorized a US led coalition that repulsed Iraq s invasion of Kuwait              Brian Urquhart  the under secretary general of the UN from      to       later described the hopes raised by these successes as a  false renaissance  for the organization  given the more troubled missions that followed             
Beginning in the last decades of the Cold War  critics of the UN condemned the organization for perceived mismanagement and corruption              In       American President Ronald Reagan withdrew the United States  funding from the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization  or UNESCO  over allegations of mismanagement  followed by the United Kingdom and Singapore                          Boutros Boutros Ghali  the secretary general from      to       initiated a reform of the Secretariat  somewhat reducing the size of the organization                          His successor  Kofi Annan  initiated further management reforms in the face of threats from the US to withhold its UN dues             
Though the UN Charter had been written primarily to prevent aggression by one nation against another  in the early     s the UN faced several simultaneous  serious crises within Somalia  Haiti  Mozambique  and the nations that previously made up Yugoslavia              The UN mission in Somalia was widely viewed as a failure after the United States  withdrawal following casualties in the Battle of Mogadishu  The UN mission to Bosnia faced worldwide ridicule for its indecisive and confused mission in the face of ethnic cleansing              In       the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda failed to intervene in the Rwandan genocide amidst indecision in the Security Council             
From the late     s to the early     s  international interventions authorized by the UN took a wider variety of forms  The United Nations Security Council Resolution      authorized the NATO led Kosovo Force beginning in       The UN mission in the Sierra Leone Civil War was supplemented by a British military intervention  The invasion of Afghanistan in      was overseen by NATO              In       the United States invaded Iraq despite failing to pass a UN Security Council resolution for authorization  prompting a new round of questioning of the UN s effectiveness             
Under the eighth secretary general  Ban Ki moon  the UN intervened with peacekeepers in crises such as the War in Darfur in Sudan and the Kivu conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and sent observers and chemical weapons inspectors to the Syrian Civil War              In       an internal review of UN actions in the final battles of the Sri Lankan Civil War in      concluded that the organization had suffered a  systemic failure               In       the organization suffered the worst loss of life in its history  when     personnel died in the Haiti earthquake              Acting under the United Nations Security Council Resolution      in       NATO countries intervened in the First Libyan Civil War 
The Millennium Summit was held in      to discuss the UN s role in the   st century              The three day meeting was the largest gathering of world leaders in history  and it culminated in the adoption by all member states of the Millennium Development Goals  or MDGs   a commitment to achieve international development in areas such as poverty reduction  gender equality and public health  Progress towards these goals  which were to be met by       was ultimately uneven  The      World Summit reaffirmed the UN s focus on promoting development  peacekeeping  human rights and global security              The Sustainable Development Goals  or SDGs  were launched in      to succeed the Millennium Development Goals             
In addition to addressing global challenges  the UN has sought to improve its accountability and democratic legitimacy by engaging more with civil society and fostering a global constituency              In an effort to enhance transparency  in      the organization held its first public debate between candidates for secretary general              On   January       Portuguese diplomat Ant nio Guterres  who had previously served as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees  became the ninth secretary general  Guterres has highlighted several key goals for his administration  including an emphasis on diplomacy for preventing conflicts  more effective peacekeeping efforts  and streamlining the organization to be more responsive and versatile to international needs             
On    June       the UN signed a Strategic Partnership Framework with the World Economic Forum in order to  jointly accelerate  the implementation of the      Agenda for Sustainable Development             

Structure
Main article  United Nations System
The United Nations is part of the broader UN System  which includes an extensive network of institutions and entities  Central to the organization are five principal organs established by the UN Charter  the General Assembly  the Security Council  the Economic and Social Council  the International Court of Justice and the UN Secretariat              A sixth principal organ  the Trusteeship Council  suspended its operations on   November      upon the independence of Palau  the last remaining UN trustee territory             
Four of the five principal organs are located at the main UN Headquarters in New York City  while the International Court of Justice is seated in The Hague              Most other major agencies are based in the UN offices at Geneva              Vienna              and Nairobi              and additional UN institutions are located throughout the world  The six official languages of the UN  used in intergovernmental meetings and documents  are Arabic  Chinese  English  French  Russian and Spanish              On the basis of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations  the UN and its agencies are immune from the laws of the countries where they operate  safeguarding the UN s impartiality with regard to host and member countries             
Below the six organs are  in the words of the author Linda Fasulo   an amazing collection of entities and organizations  some of which are actually older than the UN itself and operate with almost complete independence from it               These include specialized agencies  research and training institutions  programmes and funds and other UN entities             
All organizations in the UN system obey the Noblemaire principle  which calls for salaries that will attract and retain citizens of countries where compensation is highest  and which ensures equal pay for work of equal value regardless of the employee s nationality                          In practice  the International Civil Service Commission  which governs the conditions of UN personnel  takes reference to the highest paying national civil service              Staff salaries are subject to an internal tax that is administered by the UN organizations

Membership in the United Nations is open to all other peace loving states that accept the obligations contained in the present Charter and  in the judgment of the Organization  are able and willing to carry out these obligations 
The admission of any such state to membership in the United Nations will be effected by a decision of the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council  Chapter II  Article

Peacekeeping and security
Main articles  United Nations peacekeeping and List of United Nations peacekeeping missions
United Nations Peacekeeping Logo
The UN  after approval by the Security Council  sends peacekeepers to regions where armed conflict has recently ceased or paused to enforce the terms of peace agreements and to discourage combatants from resuming hostilities  Since the UN does not maintain its own military  peacekeeping forces are voluntarily provided by member states  These soldiers are sometimes nicknamed  Blue Helmets  because they wear distinctive blue helmets                            Peacekeeping forces as a whole received the Nobel Peace Prize in                   
The UN has carried out    peacekeeping operations since       and As of April          update       over        peacekeeping personnel from     nations have been deployed on missions               The largest is the United Nations Mission in South Sudan  or UNMISS   which has close to        uniformed personnel               and the smallest  the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan  or UNMOGIP   consists of     civilians and experts charged with monitoring the ceasefire in Jammu and Kashmir  UN peacekeepers with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization  or UNTSO  have been stationed in the Middle East since       the longest running active peacekeeping mission              
A study by the RAND Corporation in      found the UN to be successful in two thirds of its peacekeeping efforts  It compared efforts at nation building by the UN to those of the United States and found that       of UN cases are at peace  as compared with     of U S  cases at peace               Also in       the Human Security Report documented a decline in the number of wars  genocides  and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War  and presented evidence  albeit circumstantial  that international activism   mostly spearheaded by the UN   has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict               Situations in which the UN has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the Korean War and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War               Further studies published between      and      determined UN peacekeeping operations to be more effective at ensuring long lasting peace and minimizing civilian casualties              


The UN Buffer Zone in Cyprus was established in      following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus 
The UN has also drawn criticism for perceived failures  In many cases  member states have shown reluctance to achieve or enforce Security Council resolutions  Disagreements in the Security Council about military action and intervention are seen as having failed to prevent the Bangladesh genocide in                    the Cambodian genocide in the     s               and the Rwandan genocide in                    Similarly  UN inaction is blamed for failing to either prevent the Srebrenica massacre or complete the peacekeeping operations during the Somali Civil War               UN peacekeepers have also been accused of child rape  soliciting prostitutes  and sexual abuse during various peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo               Haiti               Liberia               Sudan               Burundi  and C te d Ivoire               Scientists cited UN peacekeepers from Nepal as the source of the     s Haiti cholera outbreak  which killed more than       people

In addition to peacekeeping  the UN is also active in encouraging disarmament  Regulation of armaments was included in the writing of the UN Charter in      and was envisioned as a way of limiting the use of human and economic resources for their creation               The advent of nuclear weapons came only weeks after the signing of the charter  resulting in the first resolution of the first General Assembly meeting calling for specific proposals for  the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction                The UN has been involved with arms limitation treaties such as the Outer Space Treaty  the Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  the Seabed Arms Control Treaty  the Biological Weapons Convention  the Chemical Weapons Convention  and the Ottawa Treaty               Three UN bodies oversee arms proliferation issues  the International Atomic Energy Agency  the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission               Additionally  many peacekeeping missions focus on disarmament  several operations in West Africa disarmed roughly         former combatants and secured tens of thousands of weapons and millions of munitions              

Human rights
One of the UN s primary purposes is  promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race  sex  language  or religion   and member states pledge to undertake  joint and separate action  to protect these rights                           

Eleanor Roosevelt with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights      
In       the General Assembly adopted a Universal Declaration of Human Rights  drafted by a committee headed by American diplomat and activist Eleanor Roosevelt  and including the French lawyer Ren  Cassin  The document proclaims basic civil  political and economic rights common to all human beings  though its effectiveness towards achieving these ends has been disputed since its drafting               The Declaration serves as a  common standard of achievement for all people and all nations  rather than a legally binding document  but it has become the basis of two binding treaties  the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights               In practice  the UN is unable to take significant action against human rights abuses without a Security Council resolution  though it does substantial work in investigating and reporting abuses              
In       the General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women  followed by the Convention on the Rights of the Child in                    With the end of the Cold War  the push for human rights action took on new impetus               The United Nations Commission on Human Rights was formed in      to oversee human rights issues for the UN  following the recommendation of that year s World Conference on Human Rights  Jacques Fomerand  a scholar of the UN  describes the organization s mandate as  broad and vague   with only  meagre  resources to carry it out               In       it was replaced by a Human Rights Council consisting of    nations               Also in       the General Assembly passed a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People               and in      it passed its first resolution recognizing the rights of members of the LGBTQ  community              
Other UN bodies responsible for women s rights issues include the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women  the United Nations Development Fund for Women and the United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women               The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues  one of three bodies with a mandate to oversee issues related to indigenous peoples  held its first session in

Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
Achieve universal primary education
Promote gender equality and empower women

Ensure environmental sustainability
Develop a global partnership for development

Another primary purpose of the UN is  to achieve international co operation in solving international problems of an economic  social  cultural and humanitarian character                Numerous bodies have been created to work towards this goal  primarily under the authority of the General Assembly and the ECOSOC               In       the     UN member states agreed to achieve eight Millennium Development Goals by                    The Sustainable Development Goals were launched in      to succeed the Millennium Development Goals              The SDGs have an associated financing framework called the Addis Ababa Action Agenda 
The UN Development Programme  or the UNDP   an organization for grant based technical assistance  is one of the leading bodies in the field of international development  The organization also publishes the UN Human Development Index  a comparative measure ranking countries by poverty  literacy  education  life expectancy  and other factors                            The Food and Agriculture Organization  or the FAO  promotes agricultural development and food security               The United Nations Children s Fund  or UNICEF  was created in      to aid European children after the Second World War and expanded its mission to provide aid around the world and to uphold the convention on the Rights of the Child

The World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund  or the IMF  are independent  specialized agencies and observers within the UN framework               They were initially formed separately from the UN through the Bretton Woods Agreement               The World Bank provides loans for international development  while the IMF promotes international economic co operation and gives emergency loans to indebted countries              

In Jordan  UNHCR remains responsible for the Syrian refugees and the Zaatari refugee camp 
The World Health Organization  or WHO   which focuses on international health issues and disease eradication  is another of the UN s largest agencies  In       the agency announced that the eradication of smallpox had been completed  In subsequent decades  WHO eradicated polio  river blindness  and leprosy               The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV AIDS  or UNAIDS  coordinated the organization s response to the AIDS epidemic               The UN Population Fund  which also dedicates part of its resources to combating HIV  is the world s largest source of funding for reproductive health and family planning services              
Along with the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement  the UN takes a leading role in coordinating emergency relief               The World Food Programme  or the WFP  provides food aid in response to famine  natural disasters  and armed conflict  The organization feeds an average of    million people in    nations per year                            The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  or the UNHCR  works to protect the rights of refugees  asylum seekers and stateless people               The UNHCR and the WFP programmes are funded by voluntary contributions from governments  corporations  and individuals  though the UNHCR s administrative costs are paid for by the UN s primary budget              

Environment and climate
Further information  United Nations Environment Programme  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
Beginning with the formation of the UN Environmental Programme  or the UNEP  in       the UN has made environmental issues a prominent part of its agenda  A lack of success in the first two decades of UN work in this area led to the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro  Brazil  in       which sought to give new impetus to these efforts               In       the UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization  or the WMO   another UN organization  established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  which assesses and reports on research on global warming               The UN sponsored Kyoto Protocol set legally binding emissions reduction targets for ratifying states              

Other global issues
Since the UN s creation  over    colonies have attained independence  The General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in      with no votes against but abstentions from all major colonial powers  The UN works towards decolonization through groups including the UN Committee on Decolonization               The committee lists seventeen remaining  non self governing territories   the largest and most populous of which is the Western Sahara              
The UN also declares and co ordinates international observances that bring awareness to issues of international interest or concern  examples include World Tuberculosis Day  Earth Day  and the International Year of Deserts and Desertification

The UN budget for      was       billion  not including additional resources donated by members  such as peacekeeping forces               Including specialized agencies of the UN  the UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination reports total expenses of       billion in      for    United Nations entities                           
The UN is financed from assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states  The General Assembly approves the regular budget and determines the assessment for each member  This is broadly based on the relative capacity of each nation to pay  as measured by its gross national income  or GNI   with adjustments for external debt and low per capita income              
The Assembly has established the principle that the UN should not be unduly dependent on any one member to finance its operations  Thus  there is a  ceiling  rate  setting the maximum amount that any member can be assessed for the regular budget  In December       the Assembly revised the scale of assessments in response to pressure from the United States  As part of that revision  the regular budget ceiling was reduced from     to                   For the least developed countries  or LDCs   a ceiling rate of       is applied               In addition to the ceiling rates  the minimum amount assessed to any member nation  or  floor  rate  is set at        of the UN budget          for the two year budget                                      
A large share of the UN s expenditure addresses its core mission of peace and security  and this budget is assessed separately from the main organizational budget               The peacekeeping budget for the           fiscal year is       billion  supporting        personnel deployed in    missions worldwide               UN peace operations are funded by assessments  using a formula derived from the regular funding scale that includes a weighted surcharge for the five permanent Security Council members  who must approve all peacekeeping operations  This surcharge serves to offset discounted peacekeeping assessment rates for less developed countries  The largest contributors to the UN peacekeeping budget for           are  the United States           China           Japan          Germany          the United Kingdom          France          Italy          Canada          South Korea         and Russia                      
Special UN programmes not included in the regular budget  such as UNICEF and the World Food Programme  are financed by voluntary contributions from member governments  corporations  and private individuals                           

Assessments and reviews
Main articles  Reform of the United Nations and Reform of the United Nations Security Council
The      Nobel Peace Prize to the UN diploma in the lobby of the UN Headquarters in New York City
Several studies have examined the Security Council s responsiveness to armed conflict  Findings suggests that the Council is more likely to meet and deliberate on conflicts that are more intense and have led to more humanitarian suffering  but that its responsiveness is also shaped by the political interests of member states and in particular of the permanent members              
UN peacekeeping missions are assessed to be generally successful  A book looking at    peace operations by Virginia Page Fortna of Columbia University found that UN led conflict resolution usually resulted in long term peace              
Political scientists Hanne Fjelde  Lisa Hultman and Desiree Nilsson of Uppsala University studied twenty years of data on peacekeeping missions  concluding that they were more effective at reducing civilian casualties than counterterrorism operations by nation states              
Georgetown University professor Lise Howard postulates that UN peacekeeping operations are more effective due to their emphasis on  verbal persuasion  financial inducements and coercion short of offensive military force  including surveillance and arrest   which are likelier to change the behavior of warring parties              
British historian Paul Kennedy states that while the organization has suffered some major setbacks   when all its aspects are considered  the UN has brought great benefits to our generation and will bring benefits to our children s and grandchildren s generations as well               
In       then French President Fran ois Hollande stated that  France trusts the United Nations  She knows that no state  no matter how powerful  can solve urgent problems  fight for development and bring an end to all crises  France wants the UN to be the centre of global governance                In his      address to the United States Committee for United Nations Day  American President Dwight D  Eisenhower expressed his view that  for all its flaws   the United Nations represents man s best organized hope to substitute the conference table for the battlefield               
Jacques Fomerand  a professor in political sciences  writes that the  accomplishments of the United Nations in the last    years are impressive in their own terms  Progress in human development during the   th century has been dramatic  and the UN and its agencies have certainly helped the world become a more hospitable and livable place for millions               
Reviewing the first    years of the UN s history  the author Stanley Meisler writes that  the United Nations never fulfilled the hopes of its founders  but it accomplished a great deal nevertheless   citing its role in decolonization and its many successful peacekeeping efforts              

Awards
A number of agencies and individuals associated with the UN have won the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of their work  Two secretaries general  Dag Hammarskj ld and Kofi Annan  were each awarded the prize  as were Ralph Bunche  a UN negotiator  Ren  Cassin  a contributor to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and the American Secretary of State Cordell Hull for his role in the organization s founding  Lester B  Pearson  the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs  was awarded the prize in      for his role in organizing the UN s first peacekeeping force to resolve the Suez Crisis

In a sometimes misquoted statement  American President George W  Bush stated in February      referring to UN uncertainty towards Iraqi provocations under the Saddam Hussein regime that  free nations will not allow the UN to fade into history as an ineffective  irrelevant debating society                                         
In       former American President Barack Obama  in his memoir A Promised Land noted   In the middle of the Cold War  the chances of reaching any consensus had been slim  which is why the UN had stood idle as Soviet tanks rolled into Hungary or U S  planes dropped napalm on the Vietnamese countryside  Even after the Cold War  divisions within the Security Council continued to hamstring the UN s ability to tackle problems  Its member states lacked either the means or the collective will to reconstruct failing states like Somalia  or prevent an ethnic slaughter in places like Sri Lanka                            
Since its founding  there have been many calls for reform of the UN but little consensus on how to do so  Some want the UN to play a greater or more effective role in world affairs  while others want its role reduced to humanitarian work 

Representation and structure
Core features of the UN apparatus  such as the veto privileges of some nations in the Security Council  are often described as fundamentally undemocratic  contrary to the UN mission  and a main cause of inaction on genocides and crimes against humanity                           
Jacques Fomerand state that the most enduring divide in views of the UN is  the North South split  between richer Northern nations and developing Southern nations  Southern nations tend to favour a more empowered UN with a stronger General Assembly  allowing them a greater voice in world affairs  while Northern nations prefer an economically laissez faire UN that focuses on transnational threats such as terrorism              
There have been numerous calls for the UN Security Council s membership to be increased  for different ways of electing the UN s secretary general  and for a UN Parliamentary Assembly  UNPA               
In the context of ongoing United Nations reform discussions  Noble World Foundation  NWF  proposes changing the structure of the United Nations Security Council  UNSC  by shifting membership and veto power from individual states to regional organizations like the European Union  This proposed shift is in line with the UNSC s existing practice of basing the selection of non permanent members on regional representation  Shifting to regional organization based membership in the UNSC aims to reduce deadlock caused by individual state vetoes  A prime example of this issue was observed on    February       when Russia used its veto power to block a resolution against its invasion of Ukraine  thereby underscoring a significant weakness in the UNSC s functioning  NWF s proposal is intended to improve the effectiveness and decision making process within the UNSC                           
In response to concerns regarding the pace of progress under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  UNFCCC   recent studies have suggested institutional reforms to enhance the integration of ecological concerns in UN decision making processes               Scholars affiliated with the Planet Politics Institute and The Planetary Democrats have proposed the creation of an Earth System Council  modelled after the UNSC  and a Planetary Parliament  alongside the proposed UNPA  to provide formal representation for ecological interests within the UN system

After World War II  the French Committee of National Liberation was late to be recognized by the United States as the government of France  and so the country was initially excluded from the conferences that created the new organization  Future French president Charles de Gaulle criticized the UN  famously calling it a machin  contraption   and was not convinced that a global security alliance would help maintain world peace  preferring direct defence treaties between countries              
Since       the Republic of China  also known as Taiwan  has been excluded from the UN and consistently denied membership in its reapplications               Critics allege that this position reflects a failure of the organization s development goals and guidelines               and it garnered renewed scrutiny during the COVID    pandemic  when Taiwan was denied membership into the World Health Organization despite its relatively effective response to the virus               Support for Taiwan s inclusion is subject to pressure from the People s Republic of China  which regards the territories administered by Taiwan as their own territory              

Independence
Throughout the Cold War  both the United States and the Soviet Union repeatedly accused the UN of favouring the other  In       the Soviet Union boycotted the organization in protest to China s seat at the UN Security Council being given to the anti communist Republic of China  Three years later  the Soviets effectively forced the resignation of UN Secretary General Trygve Lie by refusing to acknowledge his administration due to his support of the Korean War              
Ironically  the United States had simultaneously scrutinized the UN for employing communists and Soviet sympathizers  following a high profile accusation that Alger Hiss  an American who had taken part in the establishment of the UN  had been a Soviet spy  American Senator Joseph McCarthy claimed that the UN Secretariat under Secretary General Lie harboured American communists  leading to further pressure that the UN chief resign               The United States saw nascent opposition to the UN in the     s  particularly amongst conservatives  with groups such as the John Birch Society stating that the organization was an instrument for communism               Popular opposition to the UN was expressed through bumper stickers and signs with slogans such as  Get the U S  out of the U N  and the U N  out of the U S    and  You can t spell communism without U N               

National sovereignty
In the United States  there were concerns about supposed threats to national sovereignty  most notably promoted by the John Birch Society  which mounted a nationwide campaign in opposition to the UN during the     s                                        
Beginning in the     s  the same concern appeared with the American Sovereignty Restoration Act  which has been introduced multiple times in the United States Congress  In       an amendment containing the bill received a floor vote  with    representatives voting in favor                            The      version of the bill  H R             was authored by U S  Representative Ron Paul  to effect the United States  withdrawal from the United Nations  It would repeal various laws pertaining to the UN  terminate authorization for funds to be spent on the UN  terminate UN presence on American property  and withdraw diplomatic immunity for UN employees               It would provide up to two years for the United States to withdraw               The Yale Law Journal cited the Act as proof that  the United States s complaints against the United Nations have intensified                The most recent iteration  As of          update       is H R       introduced by Mike D  Rogers              

Bias
The UN s attention to Israel s treatment of Palestinians is considered excessive by Jewish critics  including Israeli diplomat Dore Gold  British scholar Robert S  Wistrich  American legal scholar Alan Dershowitz  Australian politician Mark Dreyfus  and the Anti Defamation League               In September       Saudi Arabia s Faisal bin Hassan Trad was elected chair of an advisory committee in the UN Human Rights Council               a move criticized by the UN Watch               The UNHRC has likewise been accused of anti Israel bias by Ex President of the United States George W  Bush  who complained that the Council focused too much attention on Israel and not enough on countries such as Cuba  Venezuela  North Korea and Iran              
American state lawmakers have proposed legislation to block various UN programs deemed to threaten U S  sovereignty               In       Tennessee enacted legislation to block the implementation of programs  originating in  or traceable to  the United Nations or a subsidiary entity of the United Nations   including Agenda    and the      Agenda                            In her confirmation hearing before the Senate panel to be the U S  ambassador to the United Nations  Elise Stefanik  described the UN s attitude toward Israel as  anti semitic  and affirmed the views of the right wing Israeli ministers  Bezalel Smotrich and Ben Gvir  that Israel has a  biblical right to the entire West Bank                                                      

Effectiveness
According to international relations scholar Edward Luck  the United States has preferred a feeble United Nations in major projects undertaken by the organization to forestall UN interference with  or resistance to  American policies   The last thing the U S  wants is an independent UN throwing its weight around   Luck said  Similarly  former US Ambassador to the United Nations Daniel Patrick Moynihan explained that  The Department of State desired that the United Nations prove utterly ineffective in whatever measures it undertook  The task was given to me  and I carried it forward with not inconsiderable success               
In       former special representative of the secretary general of the UN to Somalia Mohamed Sahnoun published Somalia  The Missed Opportunities               a book in which he analyses the reasons for the failure of the      UN intervention in Somalia  Sahnoun claims that between the start of the Somali civil war in      and the fall of the Siad Barre regime in January       the UN missed at least three opportunities to prevent major human tragedies  When the UN tried to provide humanitarian assistance  they were totally outperformed by NGOs  whose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the UN s excessive caution and bureaucratic inefficiencies  Sahnoun warned that if radical reform were not undertaken  then the UN would continue to respond to such crises with inept improvisation              
Beyond specific instances or areas of alleged ineffectiveness  some scholars debate the overall effectiveness of the UN  Adherents to the realist school of international relations take a pessimistic position  arguing that the UN is not an effective organization because it is dominated and constrained by great powers  Liberal scholars counter that it is an effective organization because it has proved capable of solving many problems by working around the restrictions imposed by powerful member states  The UN is generally considered by scholars to be more effective in realms such as public health  and humanitarian assistance               The ineffectiveness of enforcing territorial integrity in the   st century              have led to debate on possible re emergence of the right of conquest              

Inefficiency and corruption
Critics have also accused the UN of bureaucratic inefficiency  waste  and corruption  In       the General Assembly established the Joint Inspection Unit to seek out inefficiencies within the UN system  During the     s  the United States withheld dues citing inefficiency and only started repayment on the condition that a major reforms initiative be introduced  In       the Office of Internal Oversight Services  or the OIOS  was established by the General Assembly to serve as an efficiency watchdog              
In       the UN faced accusations that its recently ended Oil for Food Programme   in which Iraq had been allowed to trade oil for basic needs to relieve the pressure of sanctions   had suffered from widespread corruption  including billions of dollars of kickbacks  An independent inquiry created by the UN found that many of its officials had been involved in the scheme  and raised significant questions about the role of Kojo Annan  the son of Kofi Annan              

Model United Nations
Main article  Model United Nations
The United Nations has inspired the extracurricular activity Model United Nations  or MUN   MUN is a simulation of United Nations activity based on the UN agenda and following UN procedure  It is usually attended by high school and university students who organize conferences to simulate the various UN committees to discuss important issues of the day               Today  MUN educates tens of thousands on the activities of the UN around the world  MUN has many famous and notable alumni  such as the former UN Secretary General Ban Ki moon              

Hymn to the United Nations
Main article  Hymn to the United Nations
On the request of then United Nations Secretary General U Thant  a Hymn to the United Nations was performed on the occasion of its   th anniversary  on    October       by Pau Casals  the lyrics to which were penned by the poet W  H  Auden 
Thant first approached Casals  who was a personal friend  looking to create a hymn to peace and hoping for the song to be based on the preamble of the Charter of the United Nations  Thant later commissioned Auden to write the poem after Casals requested one to set to music  Auden completed his work in three days time  The finished work  scored for chorus and orchestra  takes approximately seven minutes to play  However  there were never any plans to adopt the song as the organization s official anthem

Notes


  Poland had not been represented among the fifty nations at the San Francisco conference due to the reluctance of the Western superpowers to recognize its post war communist government  However  the Charter was later amended to list Poland as a founding member  and Poland ratified the Charter on    October
