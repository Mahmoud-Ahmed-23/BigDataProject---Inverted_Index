Neuro symbolic AI is a type of artificial intelligence that integrates neural and symbolic AI architectures to address the weaknesses of each  providing a robust AI capable of reasoning  learning  and cognitive modeling  As argued by Leslie Valiant            and others                        the effective construction of rich computational cognitive models demands the combination of symbolic reasoning and efficient machine learning  
Gary Marcus argued   We cannot construct rich cognitive models in an adequate  automated way without the triumvirate of hybrid architecture  rich prior knowledge  and sophisticated techniques for reasoning              Further   To build a robust  knowledge driven approach to AI we must have the machinery of symbol manipulation in our toolkit  Too much useful knowledge is abstract to proceed without tools that represent and manipulate abstraction  and to date  the only known machinery that can manipulate such abstract knowledge reliably is the apparatus of symbol manipulation             
Angelo Dalli             Henry Kautz             Francesca Rossi             and Bart Selman            also argued for such a synthesis  Their arguments attempt to address the two kinds of thinking  as discussed in Daniel Kahneman s book Thinking Fast and Slow  It describes cognition as encompassing two components  System   is fast  reflexive  intuitive  and unconscious  System   is slower  step by step  and explicit  System   is used for pattern recognition  System   handles planning  deduction  and deliberative thinking  In this view  deep learning best handles the first kind of cognition while symbolic reasoning best handles the second kind  Both are needed for a robust  reliable AI that can learn  reason  and interact with humans to accept advice and answer questions  Such dual process models with explicit references to the two contrasting systems have been worked on since the     s  both in AI and in Cognitive Science  by multiple researchers             


Approaches edit 
Approaches for integration are diverse              Henry Kautz s taxonomy of neuro symbolic architectures             follows  along with some examples 

Symbolic Neural symbolic is the current approach of many neural models in natural language processing  where words or subword tokens are the ultimate input and output of large language models  Examples include BERT  RoBERTa  and GPT   
Symbolic Neural  is exemplified by AlphaGo  where symbolic techniques are used to invoke neural techniques  In this case  the symbolic approach is Monte Carlo tree search and the neural techniques learn how to evaluate game positions 
Neural   Symbolic uses a neural architecture to interpret perceptual data as symbols and relationships that are reasoned about symbolically  Neural Concept Learner             is an example 
Neural  Symbolic   Neural relies on symbolic reasoning to generate or label training data that is subsequently learned by a deep learning model  e g   to train a neural model for symbolic computation by using a Macsyma like symbolic mathematics system to create or label examples 
NeuralSymbolic uses a neural net that is generated from symbolic rules  An example is the Neural Theorem Prover              which constructs a neural network from an AND OR proof tree generated from knowledge base rules and terms  Logic Tensor Networks             also fall into this category 
Neural Symbolic  allows a neural model to directly call a symbolic reasoning engine  e g   to perform an action or evaluate a state  An example would be ChatGPT using a plugin to query Wolfram Alpha 
These categories are not exhaustive  as they do not consider multi agent systems  In       Bader and Hitzler presented a more fine grained categorization that considered  e g   whether the use of symbols included logic and if it did  whether the logic was propositional or first order logic              The      categorization and Kautz s taxonomy above are compared and contrasted in a      article              Recently  Sepp Hochreiter argued that Graph Neural Networks     are the predominant models of neural symbolic computing              since   t hey describe the properties of molecules  simulate social networks  or predict future states in physical and engineering applications with particle particle interactions              

Artificial general intelligence edit 
Gary Marcus argues that     hybrid architectures that combine learning and symbol manipulation are necessary for robust intelligence  but not sufficient               and that there are

   four cognitive prerequisites for building robust artificial intelligence  
hybrid architectures that combine large scale learning with the representational and computational powers of symbol manipulation 
large scale knowledge bases likely leveraging innate frameworks that incorporate symbolic knowledge along with other forms of knowledge 
reasoning mechanisms capable of leveraging those knowledge bases in tractable ways  and
rich cognitive models that work together with those mechanisms and knowledge bases             
This echoes earlier calls for hybrid models as early as the     s                         

History edit 
Garcez and Lamb described research in this area as ongoing at least since the     s                          At that time  the terms symbolic and sub symbolic AI were popular 
A series of workshops on neuro symbolic AI has been held annually since      Neuro Symbolic Artificial Intelligence              In the early     s  an initial set of workshops on this topic were organized             

Research edit 
Key research questions remain              such as 

What is the best way to integrate neural and symbolic architectures 
How should symbolic structures be represented within neural networks and extracted from them 
How should common sense knowledge be learned and reasoned about 
How can abstract knowledge that is hard to encode logically be handled 
Implementations edit 
Implementations of neuro symbolic approaches include 

AllegroGraph  an integrated Knowledge Graph based platform for neuro symbolic application development                                     
Scallop  a language based on Datalog that supports differentiable logical and relational reasoning  Scallop can be integrated in Python and with a PyTorch learning module             
Logic Tensor Networks  encode logical formulas as neural networks and simultaneously learn term encodings  term weights  and formula weights 
DeepProbLog  combines neural networks with the probabilistic reasoning of ProbLog 
SymbolicAI  a compositional differentiable programming library 
Explainable Neural Networks  XNNs   combine neural networks with symbolic hypergraphs and trained using a mixture of backpropagation and symbolic learning called induction
