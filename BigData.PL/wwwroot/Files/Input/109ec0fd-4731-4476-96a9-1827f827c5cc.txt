							CAIRO  Fixed line monopoly Telecom Egypt posted lower third quarter profit as rivals from the mobile sector continue to lure away voice and data clients and push the firm to open up to new revenue streams  
Third quarter net profit fell    percent to LE     million       million   but soundly beat the LE       million average predicted by four analysts polled by Reuters  
 Our business model is very quickly adapting to the rapid changes happening in the market and the aggressive competition which is intensifying on the mobile operators front   Chief Executive Officer Tarek Tantawy told Reuters in an interview  
Broadband internet remained a main growth area with its data arm reporting    percent year on year growth in total broadband customers to          However  fixed line subscribers dropped    percent year on year to     million  while monthly Average Revenue Per User  ARPU  in the quarter dipped by   percent  
While mobile operators try to attract people away from fixed line  Egypt is preparing to offer two combined cable television  telephone and internet licenses that could open the way to breaking Telecom Egypt s monopoly  
The government tender for the licenses is expected to generate    billion over five years  The new operators will initially be limited to working in Egypt s rapidly expanding new residential compounds in suburbs and satellite cities  
Triple play
In a bid to gain a head start  Telecom Egypt launched  triple play  telecoms services last month shortly after the tender was announced  and said on Thursday it would roll out fiber networks in at least four or five big compounds next year  
The company had said in October it was launching its first fiber to the home service in the Cairo suburb of Kattamia  
 We would continue to roll out fiber in areas where we see demand for high speed internet connectivity and content services as well   Tantawy said  
 The best thing we would do in light of the anticipated competition is what we are doing today  to pre emptively have a first move and advantage and start offering the service in many of those compounds   Tantawy said  
He does not think the new triple play licenses would include voice services  as the regulator has said  
 I wouldn t position the two new licenses as a full fledged competitor for us  We look at them as competition in a certain segment and customers of our wholesale services as well   
Telecom Egypt said it had been able to repay LE     billion in debt in the first nine months of       and would settle another LE     million of debt before the end of the year  The firm said it had reached a net cash position of LE     million  three months ahead of target  
 Since we are one of the best capitalized companies in the sector at large  that obviously opens the doors for many opportunities for us  So we are open today to explore acquisitions when and if they arrive   Tantawy said  
The firm said revenues fell     percent to      billion in the quarter  Earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  after subtracting provisions dropped      percent to LE       billion  
The shares were up      percent at LE       by     GMT while the benchmark EGX   index fell     percent
