							Minister of Environment Yasmine Fouad met with representatives from Sinoway  a Chinese company specializing in afforestation  forest restoration  and environmental sustainability  to explore avenues for cooperation in implementing forestry and afforestation projects in Egypt 
During the meeting  Sinoway presented its vision for expanding operations in Egypt by undertaking pioneering projects focused on afforestation  wetland restoration  and the rehabilitation of degraded areas  The company also detailed its initiatives aimed at reducing carbon emissions  implementing artificial afforestation techniques  and managing forests sustainably  Additionally  Sinoway highlighted its commitment to knowledge exchange in fields such as land sciences  forestry  and biodiversity 
A key aspect of the discussions was the introduction of seed ball technology  an innovative afforestation method that enables forest growth by utilizing moisture from the soil and air as a water source  This technology offers a potential solution to the challenges of climate change and desertification  making it particularly relevant for Egypt s environmental and climatic conditions 
The company showcased successful afforestation and forestry projects it has implemented in various countries  including the United Arab Emirates  Abu Dhabi   Saudi Arabia  Mauritania  and Tunisia  These projects serve as models for afforestation and land restoration efforts that could be adapted to Egypt s unique environmental needs 
Minister Fouad underscored the importance of ensuring that any afforestation technology applied in Egypt is compatible with the country s water scarcity challenges and does not add further strain on its limited water resources  She also discussed the potential for leveraging afforestation projects within carbon credit markets  especially in light of Egypt s launch of its first voluntary carbon market  Fouad highlighted that increasing green spaces and restoring degraded land are key mechanisms for tackling climate change  combating desertification  and enhancing environmental sustainability 
In response  Sinoway representatives emphasized that forestry is a proven solution for reducing carbon emissions  citing China s own experiences in afforestation as a response to the loss of one million hectares of cultivated land annually  They pointed out that afforestation and land restoration have been recognized in global climate and desertification conferences as effective  long term solutions to environmental challenges 
The company further explained that it is working with local governments to accelerate the restoration of natural ecosystems  improve rainfall patterns  and support carbon neutrality efforts  By collaborating with industry stakeholders  Sinoway also engages in the trade of forest carbon certificates  ensuring that afforestation projects contribute to broader carbon reduction and sustainability goals 
The discussions between Egypt s Ministry of Environment and Sinoway mark a significant step towards introducing advanced forestry technologies that align with Egypt s national strategies for environmental conservation  carbon reduction  and climate resilience
