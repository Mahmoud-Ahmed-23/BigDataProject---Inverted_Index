Example of targeting in an online ad system
Targeted            advertising or data driven marketing is a form of advertising  including online advertising  that is directed towards an audience with certain traits  based on the product or person the advertiser is promoting            
These traits can either be demographic with a focus on race  economic status  sex  age  generation  level of education  income level  and employment  or psychographic focused on the consumer values  personality  attitude  opinion  lifestyle  and interests             This focus can also entail behavioral variables  such as browser history  purchase history  and other recent online activities  The process of algorithm targeting eliminates waste            
Traditional forms of advertising  including billboards  newspapers  magazines  and radio channels  are progressively becoming replaced by online advertisements            
Through the emergence of new online channels  the usefulness of targeted advertising is increasing because companies aim to minimize wasted advertising             Most targeted new media advertising currently uses second order proxies for targets  such as tracking online or mobile web activities of consumers  associating historical web page consumer demographics with new consumer web page access  using a search word as the basis of implied interest  or contextual advertising            


Types edit 
Companies have technology that allows them to gather information about web users             By tracking and monitoring what websites users visit  internet service providers can directly show ads that are relative to the consumer s preferences  Most of today s websites are using these targeting technologies to track users  internet behavior and there is much debate over the privacy issues present            

Search engine marketing edit 
Further information  Search engine marketing
Search engine marketing uses search engines to reach target audiences  For example  Google s Remarketing Campaigns are a type of targeted marketing where advertisers use the IP addresses of computers that have visited their websites to remarket their ad specifically to users who have previously been on their website whilst they browse websites that are a part of the Google display network  or when searching for keywords related to a product or service on the Google search engine             Dynamic remarketing can improve targeted advertising as the ads can include the products or services that the consumers have previously viewed on the advertisers  websites within the ads            
Google Ads includes different platforms  The Search Network displays the ads on  Google Search  other Google sites such as Maps and Shopping  and hundreds of non Google search partner websites that show ads matched to search results               The Display Network includes a collection of Google websites  like Google Finance  Gmail  Blogger  and YouTube   partner sites  and mobile sites and apps that show adverts from Google Ads matched to the content on a given page             
These two kinds of advertising networks can be beneficial for each specific goal of the company  or type of company  For example  the search network can benefit a company to reach consumers actively searching for a particular product or service 
Other ways advertising campaigns can target the user is to use browser history and search history  For example  if the user types promotional pens into a search engine such as Google  ads for promotional pens will appear at the top of the page above the organic listings  These ads will be geo targeted to the area of the user s IP address  showing the product or service in the local area or surrounding regions  The higher ad position is often rewarded to the ad having a higher quality score             The ad quality is affected by the   components of the quality score             

The ad s expected click through rate
The quality of the landing page
The ad search relevance
Geographic performance
The targeted devices
When ranked based on these criteria  it will affect the advertiser by improving ad auction eligibility  the actual cost per click  CPC   ad position  and ad position bid estimates  to summarise  the better the quality score  the better ad position  and lower costs 
Google uses its display network to track what users are looking at and to gather information about them  When a user goes to a website that uses the Google display network  it will send a cookie to Google  showing information on the user  what they have searched  where they are from  found by the IP address  and then builds a profile around them  allowing Google to easily target ads to the user more specifically 
For example  if a user goes onto promotional companies  websites often  that sell promotional pens  Google will gather data from the user such as age  gender  location  and other demographic information as well as information on the websites visited  the user will then be put into a category of promotional products  allowing Google to easily display ads on websites the user visits relating to promotional products             

Social media targeting edit 
Further information  Social media marketing
Social media targeting is a form of targeted advertising  that uses general targeting attributes such as geotargeting  behavioral targeting  and socio psychographic targeting  and gathers the information that consumers have provided on each social media platform 
According to the media users  view history  customers who are interested in the criteria will be automatically targeted by the advertisements of certain products or services              For example  Facebook collects massive amounts of user data from surveillance infrastructure on its platforms              Information such as a user s likes  view history  and geographic location is leveraged to micro target consumers with personalized products 
Paid advertising on Facebook works by helping businesses to reach potential customers by creating targeted campaigns             
Social media also creates profiles of the consumer and only needs to look at one place  the user s profile  to find all interests and  likes  
E g  Facebook lets advertisers target using broad characteristics like gender  age  and location  Furthermore  they allow more narrow targeting based on demographics  behavior  and interests  see a comprehensive list of Facebook s different types of targeting options              

Television edit 
Advertisements can be targeted to specific consumers watching digital cable              Smart TVs  or over the top video              Targeting can be done according to age  gender  location  or personal interests in films  etc             
Cable box addresses can be cross referenced with information from data brokers like Acxiom  Equifax  and Experian  including information about marriage  education  criminal record  and credit history  Political campaigns may also match against public records such as party affiliation and which elections and party primaries the view has voted in             

Mobile devices edit 
Since the early     s  advertising has been pervasive online and more recently in the mobile setting  Targeted advertising based on mobile devices allows more information about the consumer to be transmitted  not just their interests  but their information about their location and time              This allows advertisers to produce advertisements that could cater to their schedule and a more specific changing environment 

Content and contextual targeting edit 
Further information  Content marketing
The most straightforward method of targeting is content contextual targeting  This is when advertisers put ads in a specific place  based on the relative content present             Another name used is content oriented advertising  as it corresponds to the context being consumed 
This targeting method can be used across different mediums  for example in an article online  purchasing homes would have an advert associated with this context  like an insurance ad  This is usually achieved through an ad matching system that analyses the contents on a page or finds keywords and presents a relevant advert  sometimes through pop ups             
Sometimes the ad matching system can fail  as it can neglect to tell the difference between positive and negative correlations  This can result in placing contradictory adverts  which are not appropriate to the content             

Technical targeting edit 
Technical targeting is associated with the user s own software or hardware status  The advertisement is altered depending on the user s available network bandwidth  for example  if a user is on a mobile phone that has a limited connection  the ad delivery system will display a version of the ad that is smaller for a faster data transfer rate            
Addressable advertising systems serve ads directly based on demographic  psychographic  or behavioral attributes associated with the consumer s  exposed to the ad  These systems are always digital and must be addressable in that the endpoint that serves the ad  set top box  website  or digital sign  must be capable of rendering an ad independently of any other endpoints based on consumer attributes specific to that endpoint at the time the ad is served 
Addressable advertising systems  therefore  must use consumer traits associated with the endpoints as the basis for selecting and serving ads             

Time Targeting edit 
According to the Journal of Marketing  more than     billion clients spent a minimum of     minutes daily  via web based networking media in                   Nearly     of these clients interact with the content through likes  commenting  and clicking on links related to content  With this astounding buyer trend  advertisers need to choose the right time to schedule content  to maximize advertising efficiency 
To determine what time of day is most effective for scheduling content  it is essential to know when the brain is most effective at retaining memory  Research in chronopsychology has credited that time of day impacts diurnal variety in a person s working memory accessibility and has discovered the enactment of inhibitory procedures to build working memory effectiveness during times of low working memory accessibility  Working memory is known to be vital for language perception  learning  and reasoning                         providing us with the capacity of putting away  recovering  and preparing quick data 
For many people  working memory accessibility is good when they get up toward the beginning of the day  most reduced in mid evening  and moderate at night             

Sociodemographic targeting edit 
See also  Narrowcasting and Social sorting
Sociodemographic targeting focuses on the characteristics of consumers  This includes their age  generation  gender  salary  and nationality             The idea is to target users specifically and to use this collected data  for example  targeting a male in the age bracket of        Facebook and other social media platforms use this form of targeting by showing advertisements relevant to the user s demographic on their account  this can show up in the forms of banner ads  mobile ads  or commercial videos             

Geographical and location based targeting edit 
This type of advertising involves targeting different users based on their geographic location  IP addresses can signal the location of a user and can usually transfer the location through ZIP codes             Locations are then stored for users in static profiles  thus advertisers can easily target these individuals based on their geographic location 
A location based service  LBS  is a mobile information service that allows spatial and temporal data transmission and can be used to an advertiser s advantage              This data can be harnessed from applications on the device  mobile apps like Uber  that allow access to the location information             
This type of targeted advertising focuses on localizing content  for example  a user could be prompted with options of activities in the area  for example  places to eat  nearby shops  etc  Although producing advertising off consumer location based services can improve the effectiveness of delivering ads  it can raise issues with the user s privacy             

Behavioral targeting edit 
Behavioral targeting is centered around the activity actions of users and is more easily achieved on web pages                          Information from browsing websites can be collected from data mining  which finds patterns in users  search history  Advertisers using this method believe it produces ads that will be more relevant to users  thus leading consumers to be more likely influenced by them             
If a consumer was frequently searching for plane ticket prices  the targeting system would recognize this and start showing related adverts across unrelated websites  such as airfare deals on Facebook  Its advantage is that it can target individual interests  rather than target groups of people whose interests may vary            
When a consumer visits a website  the pages they visit  the amount of time they view each page  the links they click on  the searches they make  and the things that they interact with  allow sites to collect that data  and other factors  to create a  profile  that links to that visitor s web browser  As a result  site publishers can use this data to create defined audience segments based on visitors who have similar profiles 
When visitors return to a specific site or a network of sites using the same web browser  those profiles can be used to allow marketers and advertisers to position their online ads and messaging in front of those visitors who exhibit a greater level of interest and intent for the products and services being offered 
Behavioral targeting has emerged as one of the main technologies used to increase the efficiency and profits of digital marketing and advertisements  as media providers can provide individual users with highly relevant advertisements  On the theory that properly targeted ads and messaging will fetch more consumer interest  publishers can charge a premium for behaviorally targeted ads and marketers can achieve 
Behavioral marketing can be used on its own or in conjunction with other forms of targeting              Many practitioners also refer to this process as  audience targeting              
While behavioral targeting can enhance ad effectiveness  it also raises privacy concerns              Users may feel uncomfortable with the idea of their online behavior being tracked and used for advertising purposes  Striking a balance between personalization and privacy is crucial             

Onsite edit 
See also  FTC regulation of behavioral advertising
Behavioral targeting may also be applied to any online property on the premise that it either improves the visitor experience or benefits the online property  typically through increased conversion rates or increased spending levels  The early adopters of this technology philosophy were editorial sites such as HotWired                          online advertising             with leading online ad servers              retail or another e commerce website as a technique for increasing the relevance of product offers and promotions on a visitor by visitor basis  More recently  companies outside this traditional e commerce marketplace have started to experiment with these emerging technologies 
The typical approach to this starts by using web analytics or behavioral analytics to breakdown the range of all visitors into several discrete channels  Each channel is then analyzed and a virtual profile is created to deal with each channel 
These profiles can be based around Personas that gives the website operators a starting point in terms of deciding what content  navigation  and layout to show to each of the different personas  When it comes to the practical problem of successfully delivering the profiles correctly this is usually achieved by either using a specialist content behavioral platform or by bespoke software development 
Most platforms identify visitors by assigning a unique ID cookie to every visitor to the site thereby allowing them to be tracked throughout their web journey  the platform then makes a rules based decision about what content to serve 
Self learning onsite behavioral targeting systems will monitor visitor response to site content and learn what is most likely to generate a desired conversion event  Some good content for each behavioral trait or pattern is often established using numerous simultaneous multivariate tests  Onsite behavioral targeting requires a relatively high level of traffic before statistical confidence levels can be reached regarding the probability of a particular offer generating a conversion from a user with a set behavioral profile  Some providers have been able to do so by leveraging their large user base  such as Yahoo   Some providers use a rules based approach  allowing administrators to set the content and offers shown to those with particular traits 
According to research behavioral targeting provides little benefit at a huge privacy cost   when targeting for gender  the targeted guess is     accurate  which is less than a random guess  When targeting for gender and age the accuracy is                 

Network edit 
Advertising networks use behavioral targeting in a different way than individual sites  Since they serve many advertisements across many different sites  they can build up a picture of the likely demographic makeup of internet users             
Data from a visit to one website can be sent to many different companies  including Microsoft and Google subsidiaries  Facebook  Yahoo  many traffic logging sites  and smaller ad firms             
This data can sometimes be sent to more than     websites and shared with business partners  advertisers  and other third parties for business purposes  The data is collected using cookies  web beacons and similar technologies  and or a third party ad serving software  to automatically collect information about site users and site activity  Some servers even record the page that referred you to them  the websites you visit after them  which ads you see  and which ads you click on             
Online advertising uses cookies  a tool used specifically to identify users  as a means of delivering targeted advertising by monitoring the actions of a user on the website  For this purpose  the cookies used are called tracking cookies  An ad network company such as Google uses cookies to deliver advertisements adjusted to the interests of the user  control the number of times that the user sees an ad  and  measure  whether they are advertising the specific product to the customer s preferences             
This data is collected without attaching the people s names  addresses  email addresses  or telephone numbers  but it may include device identifying information such as the IP address  MAC address  web browser information  cookie  or other device specific unique alphanumerical ID of your computer  but some stores may create guest IDs to go along with the data 
Cookies are used to control displayed ads and to track browsing activity and usage patterns on sites  This data is used by companies to infer people s age  gender  and possible purchase interests so that they can make customized ads that you would be more likely to click on             
An example would be a user seen on football sites  business sites  and male fashion sites  A reasonable guess would be to assume the user is male  Demographic analyses of individual sites provided either internally  user surveys  or externally  Comscore Netratings  allow the networks to sell audiences rather than sites             
Although advertising networks were used to sell this product  this was based on picking the sites where the audiences were  Behavioral targeting allows them to be slightly more specific about this 

Research on targeted advertising edit 
In the work titled An Economic Analysis of Online Advertising Using Behavioral Targeting              Chen and Stallaert        study the economic implications when an online publisher engages in behavioral targeting  They consider that the publisher auctions off an advertising slot and are paid on a cost per click basis  Chen and Stallaert        identify the factors that affect the publisher s revenue  the advertisers  payoffs  and social welfare  They show that revenue for the online publisher in some circumstances can double when behavioral targeting is used 
Increased revenue for the publisher is not guaranteed  in some cases  the prices of advertising and hence the publisher s revenue can be lower  depending on the degree of competition and the advertisers  valuations  They identify two effects associated with behavioral targeting  a competitive effect and a propensity effect  The relative strength of the two effects determines whether the publisher s revenue is positively or negatively affected  Chen and Stallaert        also demonstrate that  although social welfare is increased and small advertisers are better off under behavioral targeting  the dominant advertiser might be worse off and reluctant to switch from traditional advertising 
In       BlueLithium  now Yahoo  Advertising  in a large online study  examined the effects of behavior targeted advertisements based on contextual content  The study used     million  impressions   or advertisements conveyed across behavioral and contextual borders  Specifically  nine behavioral categories  such as  shoppers  or  travelers              with over    million  impressions  were observed for patterns across the content             
All measures for the study were taken in terms of click through rates  CTR  and  action through rates   ATR   or conversions  So  for every impression that someone gets  the number of times they  click through  to it will contribute to CTR data  and every time they go through with or convert on the advertisement the user adds  action through  data 
Results from the study show that advertisers looking for traffic on their advertisements should focus on behavioral targeting in context  Likewise  if they are looking for conversions on the advertisements  behavioral targeting out of context is the most effective process              The data helped determine an  across the board rule of thumb               however  results fluctuated widely by content categories  Overall results from the researchers indicate that the effectiveness of behavioral targeting is dependent on the goals of the advertiser and the primary target market the advertiser is trying to reach 

Process edit 
Through the use of analytic tools  marketers attempt to understand customer behavior and make informed decisions based on the data              E commerce retailers use data driven marketing to try and improve customer experience and increase sales  One example cited in the Harvard Business Review is Vineyard Vines  a fashion brand with brick and mortar stores and an online product catalog  The company has used an artificial intelligence  AI  platform to gain knowledge about its customers from actions taken or not taken on the e commerce site  Email or social media communications are automatically triggered at certain points  such as cart abandonment  This information is also used to refine search engine marketing             
Advertising provides advertisers with a direct line of communication with existing and prospective consumers  By using a combination of words and or pictures the general aim of the advertisement is to act as a  medium of information   David Ogilvy              making the means of delivery and to whom the information is delivered most important  Advertising should define how and when structural elements of advertisements influence receivers  knowing that all receivers are not the same and thus may not respond in a single  similar manner             
Targeted advertising serves the purpose of placing particular advertisements before specific groups to reach consumers who would be interested in the information  Advertisers aim to reach consumers as efficiently as possible with the belief that it will result in a more effective campaign  By targeting  advertisers can identify when and where the ad should be positioned to achieve maximum profits  This requires an understanding of how customers  minds work  see also neuromarketing  to determine the best channel by which to communicate 
Types of targeting include  but are not limited to advertising based on demographics  psychographics  behavioral variables  and contextual targeting 
Behavioral advertising is the most common form of targeting used online  Internet cookies are sent back and forth between an internet server and the browser  which allows a user to be identified or to track their progressions  Cookies provide details on what pages a consumer visits  the amount of time spent viewing each page  the links clicked on  and searches and interactions made 
From this information  the cookie issuer gathers an understanding of the user s browsing tendencies and interests generating a profile  By analyzing the profile  advertisers can create defined audience segments based upon users with similar returned information  hence profiles  Tailored advertising is then placed in front of the consumer based on what organizations working on behalf of the advertisers assume are the interests of the consumer             
These advertisements have been formatted to appear on pages and in front of users that they would most likely appeal to based on their profiles  For example  under behavioral targeting  if a user is known to have recently visited several automotive shopping and comparison sites based on the data recorded by cookies stored on the user s computer  the user can then be served automotive related advertisements when visiting other sites             
Behavioral advertising is reliant on data both wittingly and unwittingly provided by users and is made up of two different forms  one involving the delivery of advertising based on an assessment of user s web movements  the second involving the examination of communication and information as it passes through the gateways of internet service providers      citation needed     
Demographic targeting was the first and most basic form of targeting used online  involves segmenting an audience into more specific groups using parameters such as gender  age  ethnicity  annual income  parental status  etc  All members of the group share a common trait 
So  when an advertiser wishes to run a campaign aimed at a specific group of people then that campaign is intended only for the group that contains those traits at which the campaign is targeted  Having finalized the advertiser s demographic target  a website or a website section is chosen as a medium because a large proportion of the targeted audience utilizes that form of media      citation needed     
Segmentation using psychographics Is based on an individual s personality  values  interests  and lifestyles  A recent study concerning what forms of media people use  conducted by the Entertainment Technology Center at the University of Southern California  the Hallmark Channel  and E Poll Market Research  concludes that a better predictor of media usage is the user s lifestyle 
Researchers concluded that while cohorts of these groups may have similar demographic profiles  they may have different attitudes and media usage habits              Psychographics can provide further insight by distinguishing an audience into specific groups by using their traits  Once acknowledging this is the case  advertisers can begin to target customers having recognized that factors other than age for example provide greater insight into the customer 
Contextual advertising is a strategy to place advertisements on media vehicles  such as specific websites or print magazines  whose themes are relevant to the promoted products                                  Advertisers apply this strategy to narrow target their audiences                          Advertisements are selected and served by automated systems based on the identity of the user and the displayed content of the media  The advertisements will be displayed across the user s different platforms and are chosen based on searches for keywords  appearing as either a web page or pop up ads  It is a form of targeted advertising in which the content of an ad is in direct correlation to the content of the webpage the user is viewing 

Retargeting edit 
Main article  Behavioral retargeting
Retargeting is where advertisers use behavioral targeting to produce ads that follow users after users have looked at or purchased a particular item  An example of this is store catalogs  where stores subscribe customers to their email system after a purchase hoping that they draw attention to more items for continuous purchases 
The main example of retargeting that has earned a reputation from most people is ads that follow users across the web  showing them the same items that they have looked at in the hope that they will purchase them  Retargeting is a very effective process  by analyzing consumers activities with the brand they can address their consumers  behavior appropriately             

The major psychographic segments edit 
Personality edit 
Every brand  service  or product has itself a personality  how it is viewed by the public and the community and marketers will create these personalities to match the personality traits of their target market             Marketers and advertisers create these personalities because when consumers can relate to the characteristics of a brand  service  or product they are more likely to feel connected to the product and purchase it      citation needed     

Lifestyle edit 
Advertisers are aware that different people lead different lives  have different lifestyles and different wants  and needs at different times in their consumer s lives  thus individual differences can be compensated for Advertisers who base their segmentation on psychographic characteristics promote their product as the solution to these wants and needs  Segmentation by lifestyle considers where the consumer is in their life cycle and which preferences are associated with that life stage      citation needed     

Opinions  attitudes  interests  and hobbies edit 
Psychographic segmentation also includes opinions on religion  gender  politics  sporting and recreational activities  views on the environment  and arts and cultural issues  The views that the market segments hold and the activities they participate in will have an impact on the products and services they purchase and it will affect how they respond to the message 
Alternatives to behavioral advertising and psychographic targeting include geographic targeting and demographic targeting
When advertisers want to efficiently reach as many consumers as possible  they use a six step process 

identify the objectives the advertisers do this by setting benchmarks  and identifying products or proposals  identifying the core values and strategic objectives  This step also includes listing and monitoring competitor s content and creating objectives for the next       months 
The second step understanding buyers  is all about identifying what types of buyers the advertiser wants to target and identifying the buying process for the consumers 
Identifying gaps is key as this illustrates all of the gaps in the content and finds what is important for the buying process and the stages of the content 
Content is created and the stage where the key messages are identified and the quality bench line is discussed 
Organizing distribution is key for maximizing the potential of the content  these can be social media  blogs  or google display networks 
The last step is vital for an advertiser as they need to measure the return on investment  ROI  there are multiple ways to measure performance  these can be tracking web traffic  sales lead quality  and  or social media sharing 
Alternatives to behavioral advertising include audience targeting  contextual targeting  and psychographic             targeting 

Effectiveness edit 
Targeting aims to improve the effectiveness of advertising and reduce the wastage created by sending advertising to consumers who are unlikely to purchase that product  Targeted advertising or improved targeting may lead to lower advertising costs and expenditures             
The effects of advertising on society and those targeted are all implicitly underpinned by the consideration of whether advertising compromises autonomous choice             
Those arguing for the ethical acceptability of advertising claim that  because of the commercially competitive context of advertising  the consumer has a choice over what to accept and what to reject 
Humans have the cognitive competence and are equipped with the necessary faculties to decide whether to be affected by adverts              Those arguing against note  for example  that advertising can make us buy things we do not want or that  as advertising is enmeshed in a capitalist system  it only presents choices based on consumerist centered reality thus limiting the exposure to non materialist lifestyles 
Although the effects of target advertising are mainly focused on those targeted  it can also affect those outside of the target segment  Its unintended audiences often view an advertisement targeted at other groups and start forming judgments and decisions regarding the advertisement and even the brand and company behind the advertisement  these judgments may affect future consumer behavior             
The Network Advertising Initiative conducted a study             in      measuring the pricing and effectiveness of targeted advertising  It revealed that targeted advertising 

Secured an average of     times as much revenue per ad as non targeted  run of network  advertising 
Twice as effective at converting users who click on the ads into buyers
However  other studies show that targeted advertising  at least by gender             is not effective 
One of the major difficulties in measuring the economic efficiency of targeting  however  is being able to observe what would have happened in the absence of targeting since the users targeted by advertisers are more likely to convert than the general population  Farahat and Bailey              exploit a large scale natural experiment on Yahoo  allowing them to measure the true economic impact of targeted advertising on brand searches and clicks  They find  assuming the cost per      ad impressions  CPM  is     that 

The marginal cost of a brand related search resulting from ads is        per search but is only       per search from a targeted campaign 
The marginal cost of a click is    cents  but only    cents from a targeted campaign 
The variation in CTR lifts from targeted advertising campaigns is mostly determined by pre existing brand interest 
Research shows that Content marketing in      generated   times as many leads as traditional outbound marketing  but costs     less             showing how being able to advertise to targeted consumers is becoming the ideal way to advertise to the public  Other stats show that     of people skip television adverts and     of people ignore direct mail  which also displays how advertising to the wrong group of people can be a waste of resources             

Benefits and disadvantages edit 
Benefits edit 
Proponents of targeted advertising argue that there are advantages for both consumers and advertisers 

Consumers edit 
Targeted advertising benefits consumers because advertisers can effectively attract consumers by using their purchasing and browsing habits this enables ads to be more apparent and useful for customers  Having ads that are related to the interests of the consumers allows the message to be received in a directly through effective touchpoints  An example of how targeted advertising is beneficial to consumers is that if someone sees an ad targeted to them for something similar to an item they have previously viewed online and were interested in  they are more likely to buy it 
Consumers can benefit from targeted advertising in the following ways 

More effective delivery of desired product or service directly to the consumer              Having assumed the traits or interests of the consumer from their targeting  advertisements that will appeal to engage the customer are used 
More direct delivery of a message that relates to the consumer s interest              Advertisements are comfortably delivered to the customer  whether it be jargon or a certain medium  the delivery of the message is part of the consumer s  lifestyle 
Intelligence agencies edit 
Intelligence agencies worldwide can more easily  and without exposing their personnel to the risks of HUMINT  track targets at sensitive locations such as military bases or training camps by simply purchasing location data from commercial providers who collect it from mobile devices with geotargeting enabled used by the operatives present at these places             

Location data can be extremely valuable and must be protected  It can reveal details about the number of users in a location  user and supply movements  daily routines  user and organizational   and can expose otherwise unknown associations between users and locations         National Security Agency
Advertiser edit 
Advertisers benefit from target advertising are reducing resource costs and creating more effective ads by attracting consumers with a strong appeal to these products  Targeted advertising allows advertisers to reduce the cost of advertisement by minimizing  wasted  advertisements to non interested consumers  Targeted advertising captivates the attention of consumers they were aimed at resulting in higher return on investment for the company 
Because behavioral advertising enables advertisers to more easily determine user preferences and purchasing habits  the ads will be more pertinent and useful for consumers  By creating a more efficient and effective manner of advertising to the consumer  an advertiser benefits greatly in the following ways 

More efficient campaign development              By having information about the consumer an advertiser can make more concise decisions on how to best communicate with them 
Better use of advertising dollar              A greater understanding of the targeted audience will allow an advertiser to achieve better results with an advertising campaign
Increased return on investment  Targeted advertisements will yield higher results for lower costs 
Using information from consumers can benefit the advertiser by developing a more efficient campaign  targeted advertising is proven to work both effectively and efficiently              They don t want to waste time and money advertising to the  wrong people               Through technological advances  the internet has allowed advertisers to target consumers beyond the capabilities of traditional media  and target significantly larger amount             
The main advantage of using targeted advertising is that it can help minimize wasted advertising by using detailed information about individuals who are intended for a product              If consumers produce these ads that are targeted at them  it is more likely they will be interested and click on them   Know thy consumer   is a simple principle used by advertisers  when businesses know information about consumers  it can be easier to target them and get them to purchase their product 
Some consumers do not mind if their information is used  and are more accepting of ads with easily accessible links  This is because they may appreciate adverts tailored to their preferences  rather than just generic ads  They are more likely to be directed to products they want  and possibly purchase them  in return generating more income for the business advertising 

Controversies edit 
Targeted advertising has raised controversies  most particularly regarding privacy rights and policies  With behavioral targeting focusing on specific user actions such as site history  browsing history  and buying behavior  this has raised user concern that all activity is being tracked 
Privacy International  a UK based registered charity that defends and promotes the right to privacy across the world  suggests that from any ethical standpoint such interception of web traffic must be conditional on the based on explicit and informed consent  and action must be taken where organizations can be shown to have acted unlawfully      citation needed     
A survey conducted in the United States by the Pew Internet  amp  American Life Project between January    and February           revealed that most Americans are not in favor of targeted advertising  seeing it as an invasion of privacy  Indeed      of those surveyed said they are  not okay  with targeted advertising because they do not like having their online behavior tracked and analyzed 
Another issue with targeted advertising is the lack of  new  advertisements of goods or services  Seeing as all ads are tailored to be based on user preferences  no different products will be introduced to the consumer  Hence  in this case  the consumer will be at a loss as they are not exposed to anything new 
Advertisers concentrate their resources on the consumer  which can be very effective when done right              When advertising doesn t work  the consumer can find this creepy and start wondering how the advertiser learned the information about them              Consumers can have concerns over ads targeted at them  which are too personal for comfort  feeling a need for control over their data             
In targeted advertising privacy is a complicated issue due to the type of protected user information and the number of parties involved  The three main parties involved in online advertising are the advertiser  the publisher  and the network  People tend to want to keep their previously browsed websites private  although users  clickstreams  are being transferred to advertisers who work with ad networks  The user s preferences and interests are visible through their clickstream and their behavioral profile is generated             
As of       many people have found this form of advertising to be concerning and see these tactics as manipulative and a sense of discrimination              As a result of this  several methods have been introduced to avoid advertising             Internet users employing ad blockers are rapidly growing in numbers  The average global ad blocking             rate in early      was estimated at    percent  Greece is at the top of the list with more than     of internet users admitting to using ad blocking software  Among the technical population ad blocking reaches                 

Privacy and security concerns edit 
Main article  Browser security
Targeted advertising raises privacy concerns  Targeted advertising is performed by analyzing consumers  activities through online services such as HTTP cookies and data mining  both of which can be seen as detrimental to consumers  privacy  Marketers research consumers  online activity for targeted advertising campaigns like programmatic and SEO 
Consumers  privacy concerns revolve around today s unprecedented tracking capabilities and whether to trust their trackers  Consumers may feel uncomfortable with sites knowing so much about their activity online  Targeted advertising aims to increase promotions  relevance to potential buyers  delivering ad campaign executions to specified consumers at critical stages in the buying decision process  This potentially limits a consumer s awareness of alternatives and reinforces selective exposure 
Consumers may start avoiding certain sites and brands if they keep getting served the same advertisements and the consumer may feel like they are being watched too much or may start getting annoyed with certain brands  Due to the increased use of tracking cookies all over the web  many sites now have cookie notices that pop up when a visitor lands on a site  The notice informs the visitor about the use of cookies  how they affect the visitor  and the visitor s options in regarding to what information the cookies can obtain 
As of       many online users and advocacy groups were concerned about privacy issues around targeted advertising  because it requires aggregation of large amounts of personal data  including highly sensitive data  such as sexual orientation or sexual preferences  health issues  and location  which is then traded between hundreds of parties in the process of real time bidding                         
This is a controversy that the behavioral targeting industry is trying to contain through education  advocacy  and product constraints to keep all information non personally identifiable or to obtain permission from end users              AOL created animated cartoons in      to explain to its users that their past actions may determine the content of ads they see in the future             
Canadian academics at the University of Ottawa Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic have recently demanded the federal privacy commissioner investigate online profiling of Internet users for targeted advertising             
The European Commission  via Commissioner Meglena Kuneva  has also raised several concerns related to online data collection  of personal data   profiling  and behavioral targeting  and is looking to  enforce existing regulation              
In October      it was reported that a recent survey carried out by the University of Pennsylvania and the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology found that a large majority of US internet users rejected the use of behavioral advertising             
Several research efforts by academics and others as of      have demonstrated that data that is supposedly anonymized can be used to identify real individuals             
In December       online tracking firm Quantcast agreed to pay     M to settle a class action lawsuit for their use of  zombie  cookies to track consumers  These zombie cookies  which were on partner sites such as MTV  Hulu  and ESPN  would re generate to continue tracking the user even if they were deleted              Other uses of such technology include Facebook  and their use of the Facebook Beacon to track users across the internet  to later use for more targeted advertising              Tracking mechanisms without consumer consent are generally frowned upon  however  tracking of consumer behavior online or on mobile devices is key of digital advertising  which is the financial backbone to most of the internet 
In March       it was reported that the online ad industry would begin working with the Council of Better Business Bureaus to start policing itself as part of its program to monitor and regulate how marketers track consumers online  also known as behavioral advertising             

Microphone surveillance theories edit 
Since at least the mid     s  many users of smartphones or other mobile devices have advanced the theory that technology companies are using microphones in the devices to record personal conversations for purposes of targeted advertising              Such theories are often accompanied by personal anecdotes involving advertisements with apparent connections to prior conversations              Facebook has denied the practice  and Mark Zuckerberg denied it in congressional testimony              Google has also denied using ambient sound or conversations to target advertising              Technology experts who have investigated the claims have described them as unproven and unlikely                                      An alternative explanation for apparent connections between conversations and subsequent advertisements is the fact that technology companies track user behavior and interests in many ways other than via microphones             
In December           Media reported that Cox Media Group was advertising a service to marketing professionals called  Active Listening   which involved the ability to listen to microphones installed in smartphones  smart TVs  and other devices in order to target ads to consumers                          A pitch deck promoting the capability stated that it targeted  Google Bing  and that Cox Media Group was a Google Premier Partner              Meta  Amazon  Google  and Microsoft all denied using the service              In response to questions from     Media  Google stated that it had removed Cox Media Group from its Partners Program after a review              Cox Media removed the material from their website and denied listening to any conversations             

History edit 
Contemporary data driven marketing can be traced back to the     s and the emergence of database marketing  which increased the ease of personalizing customer communications
