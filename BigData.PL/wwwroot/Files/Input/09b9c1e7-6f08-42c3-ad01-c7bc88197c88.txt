A computer monitor provides a visual interface between the machine and the user 
Human computer interaction  HCI  is the process through which people operate and engage with computer systems  Research in HCI covers the design and the use of computer technology  which focuses on the interfaces between people  users  and computers  HCI researchers observe the ways humans interact with computers and design technologies that allow humans to interact with computers in novel ways  These include visual  auditory  and tactile  haptic  feedback systems  which serve as channels for interaction in both traditional interfaces and mobile computing contexts            
A device that allows interaction between human being and a computer is known as a  human computer interface  
As a field of research  human computer interaction is situated at the intersection of computer science  behavioral sciences  design  media studies  and several other fields of study  The term was popularized by Stuart K  Card  Allen Newell  and Thomas P  Moran in their      book  The Psychology of Human Computer Interaction  The first known use was in      by Carlisle             The term is intended to convey that  unlike other tools with specific and limited uses  computers have many uses which often involve an open ended dialogue between the user and the computer  The notion of dialogue likens human computer interaction to human to human interaction  an analogy that is crucial to theoretical considerations in the field

Humans interact with computers in many ways  and the interface between the two is crucial to facilitating this interaction  HCI is also sometimes termed human machine interaction  HMI   man machine interaction  MMI  or computer human interaction  CHI   Desktop applications  web browsers  handheld computers  and computer kiosks make use of the prevalent graphical user interfaces  GUI  of today             Voice user interfaces  VUIs  are used for speech recognition and synthesizing systems  and the emerging multi modal and Graphical user interfaces  GUI  allow humans to engage with embodied character agents in a way that cannot be achieved with other interface paradigms 
The Association for Computing Machinery  ACM  defines human computer interaction as  a discipline that is concerned with the design  evaluation  and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them              A key aspect of HCI is user satisfaction  also referred to as End User Computing Satisfaction  It goes on to say 
 Because human computer interaction studies a human and a machine in communication  it draws from supporting knowledge on both the machine and the human side  On the machine side  techniques in computer graphics  operating systems  programming languages  and development environments are relevant  On the human side  communication theory  graphic and industrial design disciplines  linguistics  social sciences  cognitive psychology  social psychology  and human factors such as computer user satisfaction are relevant  And  of course  engineering and design methods are relevant              HCI ensures that humans can safely and efficiently interact with complex technologies in fields like aviation and healthcare            
Due to the multidisciplinary nature of HCI  people with different backgrounds contribute to its success 
Poorly designed human machine interfaces can lead to many unexpected problems  A classic example is the Three Mile Island accident  a nuclear meltdown accident  where investigations concluded that the design of the human machine interface was at least partly responsible for the disaster                                   Similarly  accidents in aviation have resulted from manufacturers  decisions to use non standard flight instruments or throttle quadrant layouts  even though the new designs were proposed to be superior in basic human machine interaction  pilots had already ingrained the  standard  layout  Thus  the conceptually good idea had unintended results

A human computer interface can be described as the interface of communication between a human user and a computer  The flow of information between the human and computer is defined as the loop of interaction  The loop of interaction has several aspects to it  including 

Visual based  The visual based human computer interaction is probably the most widespread human computer interaction  HCI  research area 
Audio based  The audio based interaction between a computer and a human is another important area of HCI systems  This area deals with information acquired by different audio signals 
Feedback  Loops through the interface that evaluate  moderate  and confirm processes as they pass from the human through the interface to the computer and back 
Fit  This matches the computer design  the user  and the task to optimize the human resources needed to accomplish the task 
Visual based HCI                  
Facial expression analysis  This area focuses on visually recognizing and analyzing emotions through facial expressions 
Body movement tracking  large scale   Researchers in this area concentrate on tracking and analyzing large scale body movements 
Gesture recognition  Gesture recognition involves identifying and interpreting gestures made by users  often used for direct interaction with computers in command and action scenarios 
Gaze detection  eye movement tracking   Gaze detection involves tracking the movement of a user s eyes and is primarily used to better understand the user s attention  intent  or focus in context sensitive situations   While the specific goals of each area vary based on applications  they collectively contribute to enhancing human computer interaction  Notably  visual approaches have been explored as alternatives or aids to other types of interactions  such as audio  and sensor based methods  For example  lip reading or lip movement tracking has proven influential in correcting speech recognition errors 
Audio based HCI                   Audio based interaction in human computer interaction  HCI  is a crucial field focused on processing information acquired through various audio signals  While the nature of audio signals may be less diverse compared to visual signals  the information they provide can be highly reliable  valuable  and sometimes uniquely informative  The research areas within this domain include 
Speech recognition  This area centers on the recognition and interpretation of spoken language 
Speaker recognition  Researchers in this area concentrate on identifying and distinguishing different speakers 
Auditory emotion analysis  Efforts have been made to incorporate human emotions into intelligent human computer interaction by analyzing emotional cues in audio signals 
Human made noise sign detections  This involves recognizing typical human auditory signs like sighs  gasps  laughs  cries  etc   which contribute to emotion analysis and the design of more intelligent HCI systems 
Musical interaction  A relatively new area in HCI  it involves generating and interacting with music  with applications in the art industry  This field is studied in both audio  and visual based HCI systems 
Sensor based HCI                  This section encompasses a diverse range of areas with broad applications  all of which involve the use of physical sensors to facilitate interaction between users and machines  These sensors can range from basic to highly sophisticated  The specific areas include 
Pen based interaction  Particularly relevant in mobile devices  focusing on pen gestures and handwriting recognition 
Mouse  amp  keyboard  Well established input devices discussed in Section      commonly used in computing 
Joysticks  Another established input device for interactive control  commonly used in gaming and simulations 
Motion tracking sensors and digitizers  Cutting edge technology that has revolutionized industries like film  animation  art  and gaming  These sensors  in forms like wearable cloth or joint sensors  enable more immersive interactions between computers and reality 
Haptic sensors  Particularly significant in applications related to robotics and virtual reality  providing feedback based on touch  They play a crucial role in enhancing sensitivity and awareness in humanoid robots  as well as in medical surgery applications 
Pressure sensors  Also important in robotics  virtual reality  and medical applications  providing information based on pressure exerted on a surface 
Taste smell sensors  Although less popular compared to other areas  research has been conducted in the field of sensors for taste and smell   These sensors vary in their level of maturity  with some being well established and others representing cutting edge technologies 
Goals for computers edit 
Human computer interaction involves the ways in which humans make or do not make use of computational artifacts  systems  and infrastructures  Much of the research in this field seeks to improve the human computer interaction by improving the usability of computer interfaces              How usability is to be precisely understood  how it relates to other social and cultural values  and when it is  and when it may not be a desirable property of computer interfaces is increasingly debated                         
Much of the research in the field of human computer interaction takes an interest in 

Methods for designing new computer interfaces  thereby optimizing a design for a desired property such as learnability  findability  the efficiency of use 
Methods for implementing interfaces  e g   by means of software libraries 
Methods for evaluating and comparing interfaces with respect to their usability and other desirable properties 
Methods for studying human computer use and its sociocultural implications more broadly 
Methods for determining whether or not the user is human or computer 
Models and theories of human computer use as well as conceptual frameworks for the design of computer interfaces  such as cognitivist user models  Activity Theory  or ethnomethodological accounts of human computer use             
Perspectives that critically reflect upon the values that underlie computational design  computer use  and HCI research practice             
Visions of what researchers in the field seek to achieve might vary  When pursuing a cognitivist perspective  researchers of HCI may seek to align computer interfaces with the mental model that humans have of their activities  When pursuing a post cognitivist perspective  researchers of HCI may seek to align computer interfaces with existing social practices or existing sociocultural values 
Researchers in HCI are interested in developing design methodologies  experimenting with devices  prototyping software  and hardware systems  exploring interaction paradigms  and developing models and theories of interaction 

Design edit 
Principles edit 
The user interacts directly with hardware for the human input and output such as displays  e g  through a graphical user interface  The user interacts with the computer over this software interface using the given input and output  I O  hardware   Software and hardware are matched so that the processing of the user input is fast enough  and the latency of the computer output is not disruptive to the workflow 
The following experimental design principles are considered  when evaluating a current user interface  or designing a new user interface 

Early focus is placed on the user s  and task s   How many users are needed to perform the task s  is established and who the appropriate users should be is determined  someone who has never used the interface  and will not use the interface in the future  is most likely not a valid user   In addition  the task s  the users will be performing and how often the task s  need to be performed is defined 
Empirical measurement  the interface is tested with real users who come in contact with the interface daily  The results can vary with the performance level of the user and the typical human computer interaction may not always be represented  Quantitative usability specifics  such as the number of users performing the task s   the time to complete the task s   and the number of errors made during the task s  are determined 
Iterative design  After determining what users  tasks  and empirical measurements to include  the following iterative design steps are performed 
Design the user interface
Test
Analyze results
Repeat
The iterative design process is repeated until a sensible  user friendly interface is created             

Methodologies edit 
Various strategies delineating methods for human PC interaction design have developed since the conception of the field during the     s  Most plan philosophies come from a model for how clients  originators  and specialized frameworks interface  Early techniques treated clients  psychological procedures as unsurprising and quantifiable and urged plan specialists to look at subjective science to establish zones   for example  memory and consideration  when structuring UIs  Present day models  in general  center around a steady input and discussion between clients  creators  and specialists and push for specialized frameworks to be folded with the sorts of encounters clients need to have  as opposed to wrapping user experience around a finished framework 

Activity theory  utilized in HCI to characterize and consider the setting where human cooperations with PCs occur  Action hypothesis gives a structure for reasoning about activities in these specific circumstances and illuminates the design of interactions from an action driven perspective             
User centered design  UCD   a cutting edge  broadly rehearsed plan theory established on the possibility that clients must become the overwhelming focus in the plan of any PC framework  Clients  architects  and specialized experts cooperate to determine the requirements and restrictions of the client and make a framework to support these components  Frequently  client focused plans are informed by ethnographic investigations of situations in which clients will associate with the framework  This training is like participatory design  which underscores the likelihood for end clients to contribute effectively through shared plan sessions and workshops 
Principles of UI design  these standards may be considered during the design of a client interface  resistance  effortlessness  permeability  affordance  consistency  structure  and feedback             
Value sensitive design  VSD   a technique for building innovation that accounts for the individuals who utilize the design straightforwardly  and just as well for those who the design influences  either directly or indirectly  VSD utilizes an iterative planning process that includes three kinds of examinations  theoretical  exact  and specialized  Applied examinations target the understanding and articulation of the different parts of the design  and its qualities or any clashes that may emerge for the users of the design  Exact examinations are subjective or quantitative plans to explore things used to advise the creators  understanding regarding the clients  qualities  needs  and practices  Specialized examinations can include either investigation of how individuals use related advances or the framework plans

Social computing edit 
Main article  Social computing
Social computing is an interactive and collaborative behavior considered between technology and people  In recent years  there has been an explosion of social science research focusing on interactions as the unit of analysis  as there are a lot of social computing technologies that include blogs  emails   social networking  quick messaging  and various others  Much of this research draws from psychology  social psychology  and sociology  For example  one study found out that people expected a computer with a man s name to cost more than a machine with a woman s name              Other research finds that individuals perceive their interactions with computers more negatively than humans  despite behaving the same way towards these machines             

Knowledge driven human computer interaction edit 
In human and computer interactions  a semantic gap usually exists between human and computer s understandings towards mutual behaviors  Ontology  as a formal representation of domain specific knowledge  can be used to address this problem by solving the semantic ambiguities between the two parties             

Emotions and human computer interaction edit 
Main articles  Affective computing and Emotion recognition
In the interaction of humans and computers  research has studied how computers can detect  process  and react to human emotions to develop emotionally intelligent information systems  Researchers have suggested several  affect detection channels   The potential of telling human emotions in an automated and digital fashion lies in improvements to the effectiveness of human computer interaction  The influence of emotions in human computer interaction has been studied in fields such as financial decision making using ECG and organizational knowledge sharing using eye tracking and face readers as affect detection channels  In these fields  it has been shown that affect detection channels have the potential to detect human emotions and those information systems can incorporate the data obtained from affect detection channels to improve decision models 

Brain computer interfaces edit 
Main article  Brain computer interface
A brain computer interface  BCI   is a direct communication pathway between an enhanced or wired brain and an external device  BCI differs from neuromodulation in that it allows for bidirectional information flow  BCIs are often directed at researching  mapping  assisting  augmenting  or repairing human cognitive or sensory motor functions             

Security interactions edit 
Security interactions are the study of interaction between humans and computers specifically as it pertains to information security   Its aim  in plain terms  is to improve the usability of security features in end user applications 
Unlike HCI  which has roots in the early days of Xerox PARC during the     s  HCISec is a nascent field of study by comparison  Interest in this topic tracks with that of Internet security  which has become an area of broad public concern only in very recent years 
When security features exhibit poor usability  the following are common reasons 

they were added in casual afterthought
they were hastily patched in to address newly discovered security bugs
they address very complex use cases without the benefit of a software wizard
their interface designers lacked understanding of related security concepts
their interface designers were not usability experts  often meaning they were the application developers themselves 
Factors of change edit 
Traditionally  computer use was modeled as a human computer dyad in which the two were connected by a narrow explicit communication channel  such as text based terminals  Much work has been done to make the interaction between a computing system and a human more reflective of the multidimensional nature of everyday communication  Because of potential issues  human computer interaction shifted focus beyond the interface to respond to observations as articulated by Douglas Engelbart   If ease of use were the only valid criterion  people would stick to tricycles and never try bicycles              
How humans interact with computers continues to evolve rapidly  Human computer interaction is affected by developments in computing  These forces include 

Decreasing hardware costs leading to larger memory and faster systems
Miniaturization of hardware leading to portability
Reduction in power requirements leading to portability
New display technologies leading to the packaging of computational devices in new forms
Specialized hardware leading to new functions
Increased development of network communication and distributed computing
Increasingly widespread use of computers  especially by people who are outside of the computing profession
Increasing innovation in input techniques  e g   voice  gesture  pen   combined with lowering cost  leading to rapid computerization by people formerly left out of the computer revolution 
Wider social concerns leading to improved access to computers by currently disadvantaged groups
As of          update      the future for HCI is expected             to include the following characteristics 

Ubiquitous computing and communication  Computers are expected to communicate through high speed local networks  nationally over wide area networks  and portably via infrared  ultrasonic  cellular  and other technologies  Data and computational services will be portably accessible from many if not most locations to which a user travels 
High functionality systems  Systems can have large numbers of functions associated with them  There are so many systems that most users  technical or non technical  do not have time to learn about traditionally  e g   through thick user manuals  
The mass availability of computer graphics  Computer graphics capabilities such as image processing  graphics transformations  rendering  and interactive animation become widespread as inexpensive chips become available for inclusion in general workstations and mobile devices 
Mixed media  Commercial systems can handle images  voice  sounds  video  text  formatted data  These are exchangeable over communication links among users  The separate consumer electronics fields  e g   stereo sets  DVD players  televisions  and computers are beginning to merge  Computer and print fields are expected to cross assimilate 
High bandwidth interaction  The rate at which humans and machines interact is expected to increase substantially due to the changes in speed  computer graphics  new media  and new input output devices  This can lead to qualitatively different interfaces  such as virtual reality or computational video 
Large and thin displays  New display technologies are maturing  enabling huge displays and displays that are thin  lightweight  and low in power use  This has large effects on portability and will likely enable developing paper like  pen based computer interaction systems very different in feel from present desktop workstations 
Information utilities  Public information utilities  such as home banking and shopping  and specialized industry services  e g   weather for pilots  are expected to proliferate  The proliferation rate can accelerate with the introduction of high bandwidth interaction and the improvement in the quality of interfaces 
Scientific conferences edit 
One of the main conferences for new research in human computer interaction is the annually held Association for Computing Machinery s  ACM  Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems  usually referred to by its short name CHI  pronounced kai  or Khai   CHI is organized by ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Human Interaction  SIGCHI   CHI is a large conference  with thousands of attendants  and is quite broad in scope  It is attended by academics  practitioners  and industry people  with company sponsors such as Google  Microsoft  and PayPal
