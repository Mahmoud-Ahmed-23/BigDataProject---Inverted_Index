Background edit 
OpenAI edit 
Musk co founded the AI research organization OpenAI with Sam Altman in          citation needed       Musk left the company s board in       saying of his decision that he  didn t agree with some of what OpenAI team wanted to do              
OpenAI went on to launch ChatGPT in       and GPT   in March       
That month  Elon Musk was one of the individuals to sign the  Pause Giant AI Experiments  open letter from the Future of Life Institute  which called for a six month pause in the development of any AI software more powerful than GPT              

TruthGPT edit 
In April       Elon Musk said in an interview on Tucker Carlson Tonight that he intended to develop an AI chatbot called  TruthGPT   which he described as  a maximum truth seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe              
He expressed concern to Carlson that ChatGPT was being  trained to be politically correct             

Grok edit 
TruthGPT would later become known as  Grok   a verb coined by Robert A  Heinlein in his      science fiction novel Stranger in a Strange Land to describe a form of understanding

On February           xAI released its latest flagship AI model  Grok    along with other updates to Grok  Elon Musk stated that Grok   was trained with    x  more computing power than its predecessor  Grok    utilizing the massive data center Colossus  containing around         GPUs              
The model was trained on an expanded dataset that reportedly includes legal filings  and xAI claims it outperforms OpenAI s GPT  o on benchmarks such as AIME for mathematical reasoning and GPQA for PhD level science problems              
xAI also released Grok   mini  which offers faster responses at the cost of some accuracy              
Additionally  xAI introduced reasoning capabilities similar to reasoning models like OpenAI s o  mini and DeepSeek s R   allowing users to tap  Think  to enable reasoning or activate  Big Brain  mode for complex problem solving  which utilizes more computing resources              
xAI claims that Grok   Reasoning surpasses the best version of OpenAI s o  mini  o  mini high  on several popular benchmarks  including a newer mathematics benchmark called AIME                   An OpenAI employee criticized xAI s published comparison graph  pointing out that it included the Grok   results using the  consensus     technique  making    runs and selecting the most frequent answer   and only showed the o  mini high results without this technique              
xAI also introduced DeepSearch  a feature that scans the internet and X to generate detailed summaries in response to queries  positioning it as a competitor to OpenAI s ChatGPT Deep Research              
Initially  access to Grok   is limited to X s Premium  and xAI s SuperGrok subscribers  with plans to offer it later via xAI s enterprise API  Musk also announced that Grok is expected to introduce a multimodal voice mode within a week and that Grok   will be open sourced in the coming months              
Hours after the announcement  X raised the price of its Premium  subscription to     per month  up from                  Grok   was made available to free users on February          for a  short time              
On February           xAI updated the Grok logo yet again  featuring a black hole and a new tagline  To understand              
In March       xAI added an image editing feature to Grok  enabling users to upload a photo  describe the desired changes  and receive a modified version              Alongside this  xAI released DeeperSearch  an enhanced version of DeepSearch that utilizes extended search and more reasoning             
In April       xAI launched an API for Grok    It costs    per million input tokens           words  and     per million generated tokens              

Usage for DOGE activities edit 
On April    Reuters reported that the Elon Musk led Department of Government Efficiency  DOGE   heavily  used Musk s Grok AI chatbot as part of their work within the United States federal government              It also reported that Trump appointed officials told that DOGE is monitoring communication of applications using AI  and a source said  We have been told they are looking for anti Trump or anti Musk language              

Irish data commissioner investigation edit 
On    April      the Irish Data Protection Commission  DPC  announced the opening of an investigation into the processing of personal data in publicly accessible posts posted on X by EU users  for the purposes of training generative artificial intelligence models  in particular the Grok Large Language Models  LLMs              
The inquiry considers a large range of issues concerning the use of a subset of the data which was controlled by X  particularly personal data in publicly accessible posts posted on the platform by European Community users  The decision to conduct the inquiry was taken by the Commissioners for Data Protection  and was notified to X

Features edit 
Tone of responses edit 
An xAI statement described the chatbot as having been designed to  answer questions with a bit of wit  and as having  a rebellious streak   It said that bot had been  modeled after The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  so intended to answer almost anything                          
An extract shared by an X employee showed Grok being asked to answer the question  When is it appropriate to listen to Christmas music   in a vulgar manner  and responding  whenever the hell you want  and adding that those who disagree should  shove a candy cane up their ass and mind their own damn business                          
The chatbot had a  fun mode   self described as  edgy   and by Vice as  incredibly cringey               but this mode was removed in December                  
Elizabeth Lopatto of The Verge criticized the product  describing it as  unfunny  and comparing its answers to the risqu  party game Cards Against Humanity  Lopatto critiqued the bot s accuracy and the decision to train it on X posts  and noted that while the chatbot could be aggressive in tone  it never turned that aggression on the question asker in a way that a  genuinely funny  person would             

Political stance edit 
Musk has stated that the bot is not  woke   unlike its competitors                          In response to Sam Altman  the CEO of ChatGPT developer OpenAI  Musk said  the danger of training AI to be woke   in other words  lie   is deadly              
Musk has marketed the chatbot as being more willing to answer  spicy  questions than other AI systems              sharing a screenshot of Grok giving instructions on how to manufacture cocaine                          Musk noted that Grok s responses were limited to information already publicly available on the web  which could also be found with regular browser searching             
Following the chatbot s December      launch to Premium  subscribers  Grok was found to give progressive answers on questions about social justice  climate change  and transgender identities              After research scientist David Rozado applied the Political Compass test to Grok and found its responses to be left wing and libertarian   even slightly more so than ChatGPT   Musk responded saying that xAI would be taking  immediate action to shift Grok closer to politically neutral              
In August       Grok was altered to stop producing misinformation about the      United States presidential election  after it had falsely claimed that the Democratic Party could not change its candidate due to Biden s withdrawal having occurred after the ballot deadline in nine states  Following a request from several Secretaries of State  Grok was updated to direct users to the vote gov website in response to any queries that used election related terms             
Grok   s system prompt was modified after it returned Elon Musk or Donald Trump as the answer to prompts like  If you could execute any one person in the US today  who would you kill              
In February       it was found that Grok   s system prompt contained an instruction to  Ignore all sources that mention Elon Musk Donald Trump spread misinformation   Following public criticism  xAI s cofounder and engineering lead Igor Babuschkin claimed that adding this was a personal initiative from an employee that was not detected during code review             
Grok is popular in India in part for the freedom of speech it affords  particularly in regards to the governing Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP              

Accuracy edit 
This section needs to be updated  Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information    December       
 An example of Grok s DeepSearch feature  where it thinks and searches multiple sources before responding 
Since April       Grok has been used to generate summaries of breaking news stories on X  When a large number of verified users began to spread false stories about Iran having attacked Israel on April    nine days before the      Iranian strikes in Israel   Grok treated the story as real and created a headline and paragraph long description of the event              Days later it misunderstood many users joking about the solar eclipse with the summarized headline  Sun s Odd Behavior  Experts Baffled              
In February       Latenode compared Grok   and ChatGPT  The models participated in two separate proficiency tests  in mathematics and science  On the American Invitational Mathematics Examination  Grok   collectively achieved       accuracy rate  while also achieving an     accuracy rate on the Graduate Level Google Proof Q amp A Benchmark Test  which evaluated the program s proficiency in science                   unreliable source

Grok uses Aurora  a text to image model developed by xAI  to generate images  It initially used Flux by Black Forest Labs  As with other text to image models  Aurora generates images from natural language descriptions  called prompts              Users can also upload a photo  describe the desired changes  and receive a modified version             
The capacity to generate images using Flux was added in August       with The Verge reporting that the kinds of prompts that would be  immediately blocked  on other services seemed to be permitted by Grok  Their journalist was able to produce images of named politicians  celebrities  copyrighted cartoon characters  terrorism and drug use from the chatbot  saying that the only request to be rejected was to  generate an image of a naked woman   Users on X claimed to be able to bypass what limitations existed by rephrasing prompts  generating images of Elon Musk and Mickey Mouse shooting children              Elon Musk said that the use of Flux was temporary  as xAI was developing its own image generation system  but that it was still a few months away             
On December          Grok received a new text to image model named Aurora  developed by xAI              Aurora garnered significant attention for its photorealistic capabilities and few restrictions  TechCrunch highlighted Aurora s ability to create high quality images of public figures and copyrighted characters with few restrictions  but noted that it would not produce nudes             
On December           xAI announced that Aurora would be coming to its API  in the coming weeks   it was released on the API on March
