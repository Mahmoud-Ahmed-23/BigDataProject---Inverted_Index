            TS

    let message  string    quot Hello  World  quot  
console log message  

Tip  Simply copy and paste the code into your editor  and it will print  Hello World  in your terminal Why Learn TypeScript TypeScript is becoming the preferred language for modern web development due to its advantages over JavaScript Improved Code Quality  TypeScript adds type checking to JavaScript  which helps catch mistakes early and makes the code safer to use Better Scalability  TypeScript is used to manage and grow large projects  It makes it easier to maintain complex codebases over time Works Well with JavaScript   TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript  which means you can use both in the same project  You don t need to rewrite your existing JavaScript code to start using TypeScript Better Developer Tools  TypeScript works well with code editors and tools  It offers features like autocompletion  debugging  and type checking  which help developers write code faster and with fewer errors Works With Popular Frameworks  TypeScript is commonly used with frameworks like React  Angular  and Vue  which improves type safety and the overall developer experience  Catch Bugs Early  TypeScript helps find bugs at compile time  before the code runs   This saves time by catching errors early More Job Opportunities  As TypeScript becomes more popular  it opens more job opportunities  especially in companies working with large scale web applications Note  We are currently using TypeScript      which brings faster performance and new features  Check what s new in TypeScript      Getting Started with TypeScript  A Beginner s GuideThis TypeScript tutorial provides you with a
