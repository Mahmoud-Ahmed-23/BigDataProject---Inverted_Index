Propaganda is communication that is primarily used to influence or persuade an audience to further an agenda  which may not be objective and may be selectively presenting facts to encourage a particular synthesis or perception  or using loaded language to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information that is being presented             Propaganda can be found in a wide variety of different contexts            
Beginning in the twentieth century  the English term propaganda became associated with a manipulative approach  but historically  propaganda had been a neutral descriptive term of any material that promotes certain opinions or ideologies                       
A wide range of materials and media are used for conveying propaganda messages  which changed as new technologies were invented  including paintings  cartoons  posters  pamphlets  films  radio shows  TV shows  and websites  More recently  the digital age has given rise to new ways of disseminating propaganda  for example  in computational propaganda  bots and algorithms are  used to manipulate public opinion  e g   by creating fake or biased news to spread it on social media or using chat bots to  mimic real people in discussions in social networks 


Etymology edit 
Main article  Propaganda Fide
Propaganda is a modern Latin word  the neuter plural gerundive form of propagare  meaning  to spread  or  to propagate   thus propaganda means the things which are to be propagated             Originally this word derived from a new administrative body  congregation  of the Catholic Church created in      as part of the Counter Reformation  called the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide  Congregation for Propagating the Faith   or informally simply Propaganda                        Its activity was aimed at  propagating  the Catholic faith in non Catholic countries            
From the     s  the term began being used also to refer to propaganda in secular activities             In English  the cognate began taking a pejorative or negative connotation in the mid   th century  when it was used in the political sphere            
Non English cognates of propaganda as well as some similar non English terms retain neutral or positive connotations  For example  in official party discourse  xuanchuan is treated as a more neutral or positive term  though it can be used pejoratively through protest or other informal settings within China

Historian Arthur Aspinall observed that newspapers were not expected to be independent  organs of information when they began to play an important part in political life in the late     s  but were assumed to promote the views of their owners or government sponsors             In the   th century  the term propaganda emerged along with the rise of mass media  including newspapers and radio  As researchers began studying the effects of media  they used suggestion theory to explain how people could be influenced by emotionally resonant persuasive messages  Harold Lasswell provided a broad definition of the term propaganda  writing it as   the expression of opinions or actions carried out deliberately by individuals or groups with a view to influencing the opinions or actions of other individuals or groups for predetermined ends and through psychological manipulations              Garth Jowett and Victoria O Donnell theorize that propaganda
and persuasion are linked as humans use communication as a form of soft power through the development and cultivation of propaganda materials             
In a      literary debate with Edward Bernays  Everett Dean Martin argues that   Propaganda is making puppets of us  We are moved by hidden strings which the propagandist manipulates               In the     s and     s  propaganda was sometimes described as all powerful  For example  Bernays acknowledged in his book Propaganda that  The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society  Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country  We are governed  our minds are molded  our tastes formed  our ideas suggested  largely by men we have never heard of              
NATO s      guidance for military public affairs defines propaganda as  information  ideas  doctrines  or special appeals disseminated to influence the opinion  emotions  attitudes  or behaviour of any specified group in order to benefit the sponsor  either directly or indirectly              

History edit 
Main article  History of propaganda
Primitive forms of propaganda have been a human activity as far back as reliable recorded evidence exists  The Behistun Inscription  c            BCE  detailing the rise of Darius I to the Persian throne is viewed by most historians as an early example of propaganda              Another striking example of propaganda during ancient history is the last Roman civil wars        BCE  during which Octavian and Mark Antony blamed each other for obscure and degrading origins  cruelty  cowardice  oratorical and literary incompetence  debaucheries  luxury  drunkenness and other slanders              This defamation took the form of uituperatio  Roman rhetorical genre of the invective  which was decisive for shaping the Roman public opinion at this time  Another early example of propaganda was from Genghis Khan  The emperor would send some of his men ahead of his army to spread rumors to the enemy  In many cases  his army was actually smaller than his opponents              
Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I was the first ruler to utilize the power of the printing press for propaganda   in order to build his image  stir up patriotic feelings in the population of his empire  he was the first ruler who utilized one sided battle reports   the early predecessors of modern newspapers or neue zeitungen   targeting the mass                           and influence the population of his enemies                                      Propaganda during the Reformation  helped by the spread of the printing press throughout Europe  and in particular within Germany  caused new ideas  thoughts  and doctrine to be made available to the public in ways that had never been seen before the   th century  During the era of the American Revolution  the American colonies had a flourishing network of newspapers and printers who specialized in the topic on behalf of the Patriots  and to a lesser extent on behalf of the Loyalists               Academic Barbara Diggs Brown conceives that the negative connotations of the term  propaganda  are associated with the earlier social and political transformations that occurred during the French Revolutionary period movement of      to      between the start and the middle portion of the   th century  in a time where the word started to be used in a nonclerical and political context             

A      Finnish propaganda leaflet signed by General Mannerheim circulated by the Whites urging the Reds to surrender during the Finnish Civil War   To the residents and troops of Tampere  Resistance is hopeless  Raise the white flag and surrender  The blood of the citizen has been shed enough  We will not kill like the Reds kill our prisoners  Send your representative with a white flag  
The first large scale and organised propagation of government propaganda was occasioned by the outbreak of the First World War in       After the defeat of Germany  military officials such as General Erich Ludendorff suggested that British propaganda had been instrumental in their defeat  Adolf Hitler came to echo this view  believing that it had been a primary cause of the collapse of morale and revolts in the German home front and Navy in       see also  Dolchsto legende   In Mein Kampf        Hitler expounded his theory of propaganda  which provided a powerful base for his rise to power in       Historian Robert Ensor explains that  Hitler   puts no limit on what can be done by propaganda  people will believe anything  provided they are told it often enough and emphatically enough  and that contradicters are either silenced or smothered in calumny               This was to be true in Germany and backed up with their army making it difficult to allow other propaganda to flow in              Most propaganda in Nazi Germany was produced by the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda under Joseph Goebbels  Goebbels mentions propaganda as a way to see through the masses  Symbols are used towards propaganda such as justice  liberty and one s devotion to one s country              World War II saw continued use of propaganda as a weapon of war  building on the experience of WWI  by Goebbels and the British Political Warfare Executive  as well as the United States Office of War Information             
In the early   th century  the invention of motion pictures  as in movies  diafilms  gave propaganda creators a powerful tool for advancing political and military interests when it came to reaching a broad segment of the population and creating consent or encouraging rejection of the real or imagined enemy  In the years following the October Revolution of       the Soviet government sponsored the Russian film industry with the purpose of making propaganda films  e g   the      film The Battleship Potemkin glorifies Communist ideals   In WWII  Nazi filmmakers produced highly emotional films to create popular support for occupying the Sudetenland and attacking Poland  The     s and     s  which saw the rise of totalitarian states and the Second World War  are arguably the  Golden Age of Propaganda   Leni Riefenstahl  a filmmaker working in Nazi Germany  created one of the best known propaganda movies  Triumph of the Will  In       the propaganda song Niet Molotoff was made in Finland during the Continuation War  making fun of the Red Army s failure in the Winter War  referring the song s name to the Soviet s Minister of Foreign Affairs  Vyacheslav Molotov              In the US  animation became popular  especially for winning over youthful audiences and aiding the U S  war effort  e g   Der Fuehrer s Face         which ridicules Hitler and advocates the value of freedom  Some American war films in the early     s were designed to create a patriotic mindset and convince viewers that sacrifices needed to be made to defeat the Axis Powers              Others were intended to help Americans understand their Allies in general  as in films like Know Your Ally  Britain and Our Greek Allies  Apart from its war films  Hollywood did its part to boost American morale in a film intended to show how stars of stage and screen who remained on the home front were doing their part not just in their labors  but also in their understanding that a variety of peoples worked together against the Axis menace  Stage Door Canteen        features one segment meant to dispel Americans  mistrust of the Soviets  and another to dispel their bigotry against the Chinese  Polish filmmakers in Great Britain created the anti Nazi color film Calling Mr  Smith                                about Nazi crimes in German occupied Europe and about lies of Nazi propaganda             
The West and the Soviet Union both used propaganda extensively during the Cold War  Both sides used film  television  and radio programming to influence their own citizens  each other  and Third World nations  Through a front organization called the Bedford Publishing Company  the CIA through a covert department called the Office of Policy Coordination disseminated over one million books to Soviet readers over the span of    years  including novels by George Orwell  Albert Camus  Vladimir Nabokov  James Joyce  and Pasternak in an attempt to promote anti communist sentiment and sympathy of Western values              George Orwell s contemporaneous novels Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty Four portray the use of propaganda in fictional dystopian societies  During the Cuban Revolution  Fidel Castro stressed the importance of propaganda                  better      source      needed      Propaganda was used extensively by Communist forces in the Vietnam War as means of controlling people s opinions             
During the Yugoslav wars  propaganda was used as a military strategy by governments of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia  Propaganda was used to create fear and hatred  and particularly to incite the Serb population against the other ethnicities  Bosniaks  Croats  Albanians and other non Serbs   Serb media made a great effort in justifying  revising or denying mass war crimes committed by Serb forces during these wars             

Public perceptions edit 
In the early   th century the term propaganda was used by the founders of the nascent public relations industry to refer to their people  Literally translated from the Latin gerundive as  things that must be disseminated   in some cultures the term is neutral or even positive  while in others the term has acquired a strong negative connotation  The connotations of the term  propaganda  can also vary over time  For example  in Portuguese and some Spanish language speaking countries  particularly in the Southern Cone  the word  propaganda  usually refers to the most common manipulative media in business terms         advertising

In English  propaganda was originally a neutral term for the dissemination of information in favor of any given cause  During the   th century  however  the term acquired a thoroughly negative meaning in western countries  representing the intentional dissemination of often false  but certainly  compelling  claims to support or justify political actions or ideologies  According to Harold Lasswell  the term began to fall out of favor due to growing public suspicion of propaganda in the wake of its use during World War I by the Creel Committee in the United States and the Ministry of Information in Britain  Writing in       Lasswell observed   In democratic countries the official propaganda bureau was looked upon with genuine alarm  for fear that it might be suborned to party and personal ends  The outcry in the United States against Mr  Creel s famous Bureau of Public Information  or  Inflammation   helped to din into the public mind the fact that propaganda existed      The public s discovery of propaganda has led to a great of lamentation over it  Propaganda has become an epithet of contempt and hate  and the propagandists have sought protective coloration in such names as  public relations council    specialist in public education    public relations adviser                 In       political science professor Dayton David McKean wrote   After World War I the word came to be applied to  what you don t like of the other fellow s publicity   as Edward L  Bernays said                 

Contestation edit 
The term is essentially contested and some have argued for a neutral definition                          arguing that ethics depend on intent and context              while others define it as necessarily unethical and negative              Emma Briant defines it as  the deliberate manipulation of representations  including text  pictures  video  speech etc   with the intention of producing any effect in the audience  e g  action or inaction  reinforcement or transformation of feelings  ideas  attitudes or behaviours  that is desired by the propagandist               The same author explains the importance of consistent terminology across history  particularly as contemporary euphemistic synonyms are used in governments  continual efforts to rebrand their operations such as  information support  and strategic communication              Other scholars also see benefits to acknowledging that propaganda can be interpreted as beneficial or harmful  depending on the message sender  target audience  message  and context            
David Goodman argues that the      League of Nations  Convention on the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace  tried to create the standards for a liberal international public sphere  The Convention encouraged empathetic and neighborly radio broadcasts to other nations  It called for League prohibitions on international broadcast containing hostile speech and false claims  It tried to define the line between liberal and illiberal policies in communications  and emphasized the dangers of nationalist chauvinism  With Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia active on the radio  its liberal goals were ignored  while free speech advocates warned that the code represented restraints on free speech

Identifying propaganda has always been a problem              The main difficulties have involved differentiating propaganda from other types of persuasion  and avoiding a biased approach  Richard Alan Nelson provides a definition of the term   Propaganda is neutrally defined as a systematic form of purposeful persuasion that attempts to influence the emotions  attitudes  opinions  and actions of specified target audiences for ideological  political or commercial purposes             through the controlled transmission of one sided messages  which may or may not be factual  via mass and direct media channels               The definition focuses on the communicative process involved   or more precisely  on the purpose of the process  and allow  propaganda  to be interpreted as positive or negative behavior depending on the perspective of the viewer or listener 
Propaganda can often be recognized by the rhetorical strategies used in its design  In the     s  the Institute for Propaganda Analysis identified a variety of propaganda techniques that were commonly used in newspapers and on the radio  which were the mass media of the time period  Propaganda techniques include  name calling   using derogatory labels    bandwagon   expressing the social appeal of a message   or  glittering generalities   using positive but imprecise language               With the rise of the internet and social media  Renee Hobbs identified four characteristic design features of many forms of contemporary propaganda      it activates strong emotions      it simplifies information      it appeals to the hopes  fears  and dreams of a targeted audience  and     it attacks opponents             
Propaganda is sometimes evaluated based on the intention and goals of the individual or institution who created it  According to historian Zbyn k Zeman  propaganda is defined as either white  grey or black  White propaganda openly discloses its source and intent  Grey propaganda has an ambiguous or non disclosed source or intent  Black propaganda purports to be published by the enemy or some organization besides its actual origins              compare with black operation  a type of clandestine operation in which the identity of the sponsoring government is hidden   In scale  these different types of propaganda can also be defined by the potential of true and correct information to compete with the propaganda  For example  opposition to white propaganda is often readily found and may slightly discredit the propaganda source  Opposition to grey propaganda  when revealed  often by an inside source   may create some level of public outcry  Opposition to black propaganda is often unavailable and may be dangerous to reveal  because public cognizance of black propaganda tactics and sources would undermine or backfire the very campaign the black propagandist supported 
The propagandist seeks to change the way people understand an issue or situation for the purpose of changing their actions and expectations in ways that are desirable to the interest group  Propaganda  in this sense  serves as a corollary to censorship in which the same purpose is achieved  not by filling people s minds with approved information  but by preventing people from being confronted with opposing points of view  What sets propaganda apart from other forms of advocacy is the willingness of the propagandist to change people s understanding through deception and confusion rather than persuasion and understanding  The leaders of an organization know the information to be one sided or untrue  but this may not be true for the rank and file members who help to disseminate the propaganda

Religious edit 
Propaganda was often used to influence opinions and beliefs on religious issues  particularly during the split between the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant churches or during the Crusades             
The sociologist Jeffrey K  Hadden has argued that members of the anti cult movement and Christian counter cult movement accuse the leaders of what they consider cults of using propaganda extensively to recruit followers and keep them  Hadden argued that ex members of cults and the anti cult movement are committed to making these movements look bad             
Propaganda against other religions in the same community or propaganda intended to keep political power in the hands of a religious elite can incite religious hate on a global or national scale  It could make use of many propaganda mediums  War  terrorism  riots  and other violent acts can result from it  It can also conceal injustices  inequities  exploitation  and atrocities  leading to ignorance based indifference and alienation

A famous example of propaganda  this poster made by Paul Revere portrays the Boston Massacre in a way that he hoped would make Americans angry and support the Revolutionary War In the Peloponnesian War  the Athenians exploited the figures from stories about Troy as well as other mythical images to incite feelings against Sparta  For example  Helen of Troy was even portrayed as an Athenian  whose mother Nemesis would avenge Troy                          During the Punic Wars  extensive campaigns of propaganda were carried out by both sides  To dissolve the Roman system of socii and the Greek poleis  Hannibal released without conditions Latin prisoners that he had treated generously to their native cities  where they helped to disseminate his propaganda              The Romans on the other hand tried to portray Hannibal as a person devoid of humanity and would soon lose the favour of gods  At the same time  led by Q Fabius Maximus  they organized elaborate religious rituals to protect Roman morale

Post World War II usage of the word  propaganda  more typically refers to political or nationalist uses of these techniques or to the promotion of a set of ideas

Propaganda is a powerful weapon in war  in certain cases  it is used to dehumanize and create hatred toward a supposed enemy  either internal or external  by creating a false image in the mind of soldiers and citizens  This can be done by using derogatory or racist terms  e g   the racist terms  Jap  and  gook  used during World War II and the Vietnam War  respectively   avoiding some words or language or by making allegations of enemy atrocities  The goal of this was to demoralize the opponent into thinking what was being projected was actually true              Most propaganda efforts in wartime require the home population to feel the enemy has inflicted an injustice  which may be fictitious or may be based on facts  e g   the sinking of the passenger ship RMS      Lusitania by the German Navy in World War I   The home population must also believe that the cause of their nation in the war is just  In these efforts it was difficult to determine the accuracy of how propaganda truly impacted the war              In NATO doctrine  propaganda is defined as  Information  especially of a biased or misleading nature  used to promote a political cause or point of view               Within this perspective  the information provided does not need to be necessarily false but must be instead relevant to specific goals of the  actor  or  system  that performs it 
Propaganda is also one of the methods used in psychological warfare  which may also involve false flag operations in which the identity of the operatives is depicted as those of an enemy nation  e g   The Bay of Pigs Invasion used CIA planes painted in Cuban Air Force markings   The term propaganda may also refer to false information meant to reinforce the mindsets of people who already believe as the propagandist wishes  e g   During the First World War  the main purpose of British propaganda was to encourage men to join the army  and women to work in the country s industry  Propaganda posters were used because regular general radio broadcasting was yet to commence and TV technology was still under development               The assumption is that  if people believe something false  they will constantly be assailed by doubts  Since these doubts are unpleasant  see cognitive dissonance   people will be eager to have them extinguished  and are therefore receptive to the reassurances of those in power  For this reason  propaganda is often addressed to people who are already sympathetic to the agenda or views being presented  This process of reinforcement uses an individual s predisposition to self select  agreeable  information sources as a mechanism for maintaining control over populations

Propaganda may be administered in insidious ways  For instance  disparaging disinformation about the history of certain groups or foreign countries may be encouraged or tolerated in the educational system  Since few people actually double check what they learn at school  such disinformation will be repeated by journalists as well as parents  thus reinforcing the idea that the disinformation item is really a  well known fact   even though no one repeating the myth is able to point to an authoritative source  The disinformation is then recycled in the media and in the educational system  without the need for direct governmental intervention on the media  Such permeating propaganda may be used for political goals  by giving citizens a false impression of the quality or policies of their country  they may be incited to reject certain proposals or certain remarks or ignore the experience of others

In the Soviet Union during the Second World War  the propaganda designed to encourage civilians was controlled by Stalin  who insisted on a heavy handed style that educated audiences easily saw was inauthentic  On the other hand  the unofficial rumors about German atrocities were well founded and convincing              Stalin was a Georgian who spoke Russian with a heavy accent  That would not do for a national hero so starting in the     s all new visual portraits of Stalin were retouched to erase his Georgian facial characteristics     clarify                  and make him a more generalized Soviet hero  Only his eyes and famous moustache remained unaltered  Zhores Medvedev and Roy Medvedev say his  majestic new image was devised appropriately to depict the leader of all times and of all peoples              
Article    of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights prohibits any propaganda for war as well as any advocacy of national or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination  hostility or violence by law             

Naturally  the common people don t want war  neither in Russia nor in England nor in America  nor for that matter in Germany  That is understood  But  after all  it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along  whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship  The people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders  That is easy  All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger  It works the same way in any country         Hermann G ring            Simply enough the covenant specifically is not defining the content of propaganda  In simplest terms  an act of propaganda if used in a reply to a wartime act is not prohibited             
Advertising edit 
Propaganda shares techniques with advertising and public relations  each of which can be thought of as propaganda that promotes a commercial product or shapes the perception of an organization  person  or brand  For example  after claiming victory in the      Lebanon War  Hezbollah campaigned for broader popularity among Arabs by organizing mass rallies where Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah combined elements of the local dialect with classical Arabic to reach audiences outside Lebanon  Banners and billboards were commissioned in commemoration of the war  along with various merchandise items with Hezbollah s logo  flag color  yellow   and images of Nasrallah  T shirts  baseball caps and other war memorabilia were marketed for all ages  The uniformity of messaging helped define Hezbollah s brand             
In the journalistic context  advertisements evolved from the traditional commercial advertisements to include also a new type in the form of paid articles or broadcasts disguised as news  These generally present an issue in a very subjective and often misleading light  primarily meant to persuade rather than inform  Normally they use only subtle propaganda techniques and not the more obvious ones used in traditional commercial advertisements  If the reader believes that a paid advertisement is in fact a news item  the message the advertiser is trying to communicate will be more easily  believed  or  internalized   Such advertisements are considered obvious examples of  covert  propaganda because they take on the appearance of objective information rather than the appearance of propaganda  which is misleading  Federal law     where       specifically mandates that any advertisement appearing in the format of a news item must state that the item is in fact a paid advertisement 
Edmund McGarry illustrates that advertising is more than selling to an audience but a type of propaganda that is trying to persuade the public and not to be balanced in judgement             

Politics edit 
Propaganda and manipulation can be found in television  and in news programs that influence mass audiences  An example was the Dziennik  Journal  news cast  which criticised capitalism in the then communist Polish People s Republic using emotive and loaded language 
Propaganda has become more common in political contexts  in particular  to refer to certain efforts sponsored by governments  political groups  but also often covert interests  In the early   th century  propaganda was exemplified in the form of party slogans  Propaganda also has much in common with public information campaigns by governments  which are intended to encourage or discourage certain forms of behavior  such as wearing seat belts  not smoking  not littering  and so forth   Again  the emphasis is more political in propaganda  Propaganda can take the form of leaflets  posters  TV  and radio broadcasts and can also extend to any other medium  In the case of the United States  there is also an important legal  imposed by law  distinction between advertising  a type of overt propaganda  and what the Government Accountability Office  GAO   an arm of the United States Congress  refers to as  covert propaganda   Propaganda is divided into two in political situations  they are preparation  meaning to create a new frame of mind or view of things  and operational  meaning they instigate actions             
Roderick Hindery argues                         that propaganda exists on the political left  and right  and in mainstream centrist parties  Hindery further argues that debates about most social issues can be productively revisited in the context of asking  what is or is not propaganda   Not to be overlooked is the link between propaganda  indoctrination  and terrorism counterterrorism  He argues that threats to destroy are often as socially disruptive as physical devastation itself 
Since      and the appearance of greater media fluidity  propaganda institutions  practices and legal frameworks have been evolving in the US and Britain  Briant shows how this included expansion and integration of the apparatus cross government and details attempts to coordinate the forms of propaganda for foreign and domestic audiences  with new efforts in strategic communication              These were subject to contestation within the US Government  resisted by Pentagon Public Affairs and critiqued by some scholars              The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year       section       a   amended the US Information and Educational Exchange Act of       popularly referred to as the Smith Mundt Act  and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of       allowing for materials produced by the State Department and the Broadcasting Board of Governors  BBG  to be released within U S  borders for the Archivist of the United States  The Smith Mundt Act  as amended  provided that  the Secretary and the Broadcasting Board of Governors shall make available to the Archivist of the United States  for domestic distribution  motion pictures  films  videotapes  and other material    years after the initial dissemination of the material abroad       Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Department of State or the Broadcasting Board of Governors from engaging in any medium or form of communication  either directly or indirectly  because a United States domestic audience is or may be thereby exposed to program material  or based on a presumption of such exposure   Public concerns were raised upon passage due to the relaxation of prohibitions of domestic propaganda in the United States             
In the wake of this  the internet has become a prolific method of distributing political propaganda  benefiting from an evolution in coding called bots  Software agents or bots can be used for many things  including populating social media with automated messages and posts with a range of sophistication  During the      U S  election a cyber strategy was implemented using bots to direct US voters to Russian political news and information sources  and to spread politically motivated rumors and false news stories  At this point it is considered commonplace contemporary political strategy around the world to implement bots in achieving political goals

Common media for transmitting propaganda messages include news reports  government reports  historical revision  junk science  books  leaflets  movies  radio  television  and posters  Some propaganda campaigns follow a strategic transmission pattern to indoctrinate the target group  This may begin with a simple transmission  such as a leaflet or advertisement dropped from a plane or an advertisement  Generally  these messages will contain directions on how to obtain more information  via a website  hotline  radio program  etc   as it is seen also for selling purposes among other goals   The strategy intends to initiate the individual from information recipient to information seeker through reinforcement  and then from information seeker to opinion leader through indoctrination             
A number of techniques based in social psychological research are used to generate propaganda  Many of these same techniques can be found under logical fallacies  since propagandists use arguments that  while sometimes convincing  are not necessarily valid 
Some time has been spent analyzing the means by which the propaganda messages are transmitted  That work is important but it is clear that information dissemination strategies become propaganda strategies only when coupled with propagandistic messages  Identifying these messages is a necessary prerequisite to study the methods by which those messages are spread 
Theodor W  Adorno wrote that fascist propaganda encourages identification with an authoritarian personality characterized by traits such as obedience and extreme aggression                                   In The Myth of the State  Ernst Cassirer wrote that while fascist propaganda mythmaking flagrantly contradicted empirical reality  it provided a simple and direct answer to the anxieties of the secular present                                  
Propaganda can also be turned on its makers  For example  postage stamps have frequently been tools for government advertising  such as North Korea s extensive issues              The presence of Stalin on numerous Soviet stamps is another example              In Nazi Germany  Hitler frequently appeared on postage stamps in Germany and some of the occupied nations  A British program to parody these  and other Nazi inspired stamps  involved airdropping them into Germany on letters containing anti Nazi literature                         
In      a scandal broke in which the journalist Carole Cadwalladr  several whistleblowers and the academic Emma Briant revealed advances in digital propaganda techniques showing that online human intelligence techniques used in psychological warfare had been coupled with psychological profiling using illegally obtained social media data for political campaigns in the United States in      to aid Donald Trump by the firm Cambridge Analytica                                      The company initially denied breaking laws             but later admitted breaking UK law  the scandal provoking a worldwide debate on acceptable use of data for propaganda and influence             

Models edit 
Persuasion in social psychology edit 
Public reading of the anti Semitic newspaper Der St rmer  Worms  Germany      
The field of social psychology includes the study of persuasion  Social psychologists can be sociologists or psychologists  The field includes many theories and approaches to understanding persuasion  For example  communication theory points out that people can be persuaded by the communicator s credibility  expertise  trustworthiness  and attractiveness  The elaboration likelihood model  as well as heuristic models of persuasion  suggest that a number of factors  e g   the degree of interest of the recipient of the communication   influence the degree to which people allow superficial factors to persuade them  Nobel Prize winning psychologist Herbert A  Simon won the Nobel prize for his theory that people are cognitive misers  That is  in a society of mass information  people are forced to make decisions quickly and often superficially  as opposed to logically 
According to William W  Biddle s      article  A psychological definition of propaganda     t he four principles followed in propaganda are      rely on emotions  never argue      cast propaganda into the pattern of  we  versus an  enemy       reach groups as well as individuals      hide the propagandist as much as possible              
More recently  studies from behavioral science have become significant in understanding and planning propaganda campaigns  these include for example nudge theory which was used by the Obama Campaign in      then adopted by the UK Government Behavioural Insights Team              Behavioural methodologies then became subject to great controversy in      after the company Cambridge Analytica was revealed to have applied them with millions of people s breached Facebook data to encourage them to vote for Donald Trump             
Haifeng Huang argues that propaganda is not always necessarily about convincing a populace of its message  and may actually fail to do this  but instead can also function as a means of intimidating the citizenry and signalling the regime s strength and ability to maintain its control and power over society  by investing significant resources into propaganda  the regime can forewarn its citizens of its strength and deterring them from attempting to challenge it             

Propaganda theory and education edit 
During the     s  educators in the United States and around the world became concerned about the rise of anti Semitism and other forms of violent extremism  The Institute for Propaganda Analysis was formed to introduce methods of instruction for high school and college students  helping learners to recognize and desist propaganda by identifying persuasive techniques  This work built upon classical rhetoric and it was informed by suggestion theory and social scientific studies of propaganda and persuasion              In the     s  propaganda theory and education examined the rise of American consumer culture  and this work was popularized by Vance Packard in his      book  The Hidden Persuaders  European theologian Jacques Ellul s landmark work  Propaganda  The Formation of Men s Attitudes framed propaganda in relation to larger themes about the relationship between humans and technology  Media messages did not serve to enlighten or inspire  he argued  They merely overwhelm by arousing emotions and oversimplifying ideas  limiting human reasoning and judgement 
In the     s  academics recognized that news and journalism could function as propaganda when business and government interests were amplified by mass media  The propaganda model is a theory advanced by Edward S  Herman and Noam Chomsky which argues systemic biases exist in mass media that are shaped by structural economic causes  It argues that the way in which commercial media institutions are structured and operate  e g  through advertising revenue  concentration of media ownership  or access to sources  creates an inherent conflict of interest that make them act as propaganda for powerful political and commercial interests 

The   th century has been characterized by three developments of great political importance  the growth of democracy  the growth of corporate power  and the growth of corporate propaganda as a means of protecting corporate power against democracy                         
First presented in their book Manufacturing Consent  The Political Economy of the Mass Media         the propaganda model analyses commercial mass media as businesses that sell a product        access to readers and audiences        to other businesses  advertisers  and that benefit from access to information from government and corporate sources to produce their content  The theory postulates five general classes of  filters  that shape the content that is presented in news media  ownership of the medium  reliance on advertising revenue  access to news sources  threat of litigation and commercial backlash  flak   and anti communism and  fear ideology   The first three  ownership  funding  and sourcing  are generally regarded by the authors as being the most important  Although the model was based mainly on the characterization of United States media  Chomsky and Herman believe the theory is equally applicable to any country that shares the basic political economic structure  and the model has subsequently been applied by other scholars to study media bias in other countries              
By the     s  the topic of propaganda was no longer a part of public education  having been relegated to a specialist subject  Secondary English educators grew fearful of the study of propaganda genres  choosing to focus on argumentation and reasoning instead of the highly emotional forms of propaganda found in advertising and political campaigns               In       the European Commission funded Mind Over Media  a digital learning platform for teaching and learning about contemporary propaganda  The study of contemporary propaganda is growing in secondary education  where it is seen as a part of language arts and social studies education              

Self propaganda edit 
Self propaganda is a form of propaganda that refers to the act of an individual convincing themself of something  no matter how irrational that idea may be               Self propaganda makes it easier for individuals to justify their own actions as well as the actions of others  Self propaganda often works to lessen the cognitive dissonance felt by individuals when their personal actions or the actions of their government do not line up with their moral beliefs               Self propaganda is a type of self deception               Self propaganda can have a negative impact on those who perpetuate the beliefs created by using self propaganda

A      propaganda of the Estado Novo  New State  regime depicting Brazilian president Get lio Vargas flanked by children  The text reads   Children  Learning  at home and in school  the worship of the Fatherland  you will bring all chances of success to life  Only love builds and  strongly loving Brazil  you will lead it to the greatest of destinies among Nations  fulfilling the desires of exaltation nestled in every Brazilian heart  
Of all the potential targets for propaganda  children are the most vulnerable because they are the least prepared with the critical reasoning and contextual comprehension they need to determine whether message is a propaganda or not  The attention children give their environment during development  due to the process of developing their understanding of the world  causes them to absorb propaganda indiscriminately  Also  children are highly imitative  studies by Albert Bandura  Dorothea Ross and Sheila A  Ross in the     s indicated that  to a degree  socialization  formal education and standardized television programming can be seen as using propaganda for the purpose of indoctrination  The use of propaganda in schools was highly prevalent during the     s and     s in Germany in the form of the Hitler Youth 

Anti Semitic propaganda for children edit 
In Nazi Germany  the education system was thoroughly co opted to indoctrinate the German youth with anti Semitic ideology  From the     s on  the Nazi Party targeted German youth as one of their special audience for its propaganda messages               Schools and texts mirrored what the Nazis aimed of instilling in German youth through the use and promotion of racial theory  Julius Streicher  the editor of Der St rmer  headed a publishing house that disseminated anti Semitic propaganda picture books in schools during the Nazi dictatorship  This was accomplished through the National Socialist Teachers League  of which     of all German teachers were members in                   
The League encouraged the teaching of racial theory  Picture books for children such as Trust No Fox on his Green Heath and No Jew on his Oath  Der Giftpilz  translated into English as The Poisonous Mushroom  and The Poodle Pug Dachshund Pinscher were widely circulated  over         copies of Trust No Fox         were circulated during the late     s  and contained depictions of Jews as devils  child molesters and other morally charged figures  Slogans such as  Judas the Jew betrayed Jesus the German to the Jews  were recited in class  During the Nuremberg Trial  Trust No Fox on his Green Heath and No Jew on his Oath  and Der Giftpilz were received as documents in evidence because they document the practices of the Nazis              The following is an example of a propagandistic math problem recommended by the National Socialist Essence of Education   The Jews are aliens in Germany in      there were            inhabitants in the German Reich  of whom                 were Jews               

Comparisons with disinformation edit 
This section is an excerpt from Disinformation   Comparisons with propaganda  edit 
Whether and to what degree disinformation and propaganda overlap is subject to debate  Some  like U S  Department of State  define propaganda as the use of non rational arguments to either advance or undermine a political ideal  and use disinformation as an alternative name for undermining propaganda                   page      needed      while others consider them to be separate concepts altogether               One popular distinction holds that disinformation also describes politically motivated messaging designed explicitly to engender public cynicism  uncertainty  apathy  distrust  and paranoia  all of which disincentivize citizen engagement and mobilization for social or political change
