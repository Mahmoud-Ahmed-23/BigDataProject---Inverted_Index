							CAIRO  A Lebanese Hezbollah operative on trial in Egypt for allegedly plotting attacks in the country on Wednesday accused his interrogators of  brutal torture  that had left him deaf in one ear 
Mohamed Mansour  who is on trial with    other defendants  told AFP during a break in a Cairo court session that he and all the others had been  brutally tortured  
 All the detainees have been tortured  I lost hearing in my right ear because of the constant torture  I was electrocuted and beaten   he said 
The men are accused of plotting attacks against ships in the Suez Canal and tourist sites  Most of the group  including five Palestinian suspects and one Sudanese  were rounded up between late last year and January 
Four of the defendants  among them the alleged Lebanese ringleader Mohamed Qublan  are being tried in absentia by the state security court after they fled the country 
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has said Mansour is a Hezbollah agent in charge of smuggling weapons to Palestinian fighters in the Gaza Strip 
One of Mansour s lawyers said Mansour had admitted in questioning that he proposed attacks against  Israeli targets  in Egypt to avenge the assassination of a senior Hezbollah commander  but was turned down by his superiors 
 I am innocent of any charges regarding attacks towards Egypt   said Mansour  who was kept in a black metal cage in the courtroom along with the other defendants 
 My task was to send support for our brothers in Gaza  I am in the resistance  like  the late French president Charles  De Gaulle  He s the hero of France  right   said Mansour   AFP
