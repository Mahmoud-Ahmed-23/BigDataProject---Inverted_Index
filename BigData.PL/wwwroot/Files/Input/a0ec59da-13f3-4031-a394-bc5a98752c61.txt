							Over the past few years  we have licensed to some terrifying statistics about the rapidly increasing numbers of divorce cases  The Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics  CAPMAS  recently estimated one divorce is filed every four minutes 
Although divorce is considered a mutual responsibility between husband and wife in many countries  women are still blamed for it in Arab societies 
Aiming to shed light on women       s suffering before and after divorce  Marsel Nazmy and Doaa Helmy released their first short story collection  titled  I Want a Divorce  that generated waves of criticism and praise on social media because of its courageous way of tackling such a sensitive issue  The book was released at the Cairo International Book Fair and a signing party was held on   February to discuss the different stories mentioned in the book 
       The whole thing started a year ago when Doaa and I decided to write something about Egyptian women         said Nazmy  the co author of the book         When Doaa suggested publishing a short story collection about divorce  I was drawn to the idea because it tackles the suffering of thousands of women from different educational and social backgrounds         she added 
As journalists in Al Bawaba News  the two writers usually receive complaints regarding different family problems and their relevant legal procedures  Such experiences have helped them come closer to women       s struggles to get a divorce  Through the sentences of the book  the reader relates to a story or two as they depict the psychological and physical suffering of many women in our society 
       We didn       t want the book to provide statistics or information  however  we tackled the issue from a literary perspective by presenting    short stories where you can see the suffering of women who are asking for a divorce or divorced women who suffer from people       s judgmental views         she noted 
Although all of their stories are inspired by true events  collecting stories from women was an easy task 
       We were surprised that many women were interested in sharing their personal stories with us  so we decided to change their names and identities in order to protect them  When you read the book  you understand that divorce is not a luxury  it is always the last path to salvation         she added 
In her opinion  Egyptian women still have a hunger for telling their stories in spite of the pervasiveness of social media networks  Therefore  they are ready to share their experience  secrets  and sufferings with anyone they trust  because they need someone to listen to them 
However  creating harmony between the different stories was a big challenge that the two writers had to wrestle with 
       At the beginning  we were concerned about having two authors with two different writing styles and approaches in one book  however  we managed to overcome such a problem by creating a homogenous spirit for the different stories and melding some of them together   Nazmy explained 
Although this was the first book for the two writers  they didn       t face any problems in publishing it         We counseled our colleagues and they advised us to submit a draft to Atlas Publishing House because they support novice writers  They were excited to publish the book and the whole procedure went very smoothly         she said 
The success of the short story collection encouraged Nazmy and Helmy to start working on a second book that will be published soon 
       Doaa is my partner and I love working with her because we understand each other  Therefore  we are holding brainstorming meetings to come up with a new idea for our next literary work that will tackle women       s problems from a new perspective         she concluded
