Officers in the Los Angeles sheriff s station questioned Nakoula Basseley Nakoula  the man behind the Innocence of Muslims film  on Saturday  AP has reported  Nakoula was not under arrest  however  officials said 
Nakoula voluntarily went in for questioning with deputies in squad cars to Cerritos station  Officials were investigating if he had broken the terms of his parole  which banned him from using computers or the internet for purposes other than work for five years 
The    year old came under public scrutiny after segments of his film  Innocence of Muslims  sparked massive protests across the Middle East and elsewhere  leading to dozens deaths in Egypt  Libya  Tunisia  Sudan  and Yemen  including that of United States ambassador to Libya John Christopher Stevens 
Nakoula s involvement in the film was first revealed when AP originally identified one Sam Bacile  whose YouTube account first posted the movie online  as the main filmmaker 
Bacile told AP over the phone that he was an Israeli Jew and that the movie cost USD five million that he obtained from     Jewish donors  He also said  Islam was a cancer  
However  Sam Bacile turned out to be one of Nakoula s many aliases  AP later uncovered  after the Israeli government denied it had any registered citizens with that name and AP traced his number to Nakoula s California home 
He told AP he knew Bacile but denied being him  and showed AP his ID but covered his middle name  Nakoula is an Egyptian Coptic Christian  not an Israeli Jew as he first claimed  Sam Bacile is one of his many aliases 
Nakoula was convicted of federal bank fraud charges in      and was ordered to pay          as well as serving    months in federal prison  He was also arrested in      and charged with intent to manufacture methamphetamine  pleading guilty  according to The Daily Beast 
According to ABC  Nakoula told officers on Saturday he wrote the script in prison and produced it with his son  Abanob Basseley  He said it cost between         and         and that the money came from his wife s family in Egypt  Parts of the movie were filmed in Nakoula s house  which is registered under his son s name 
Actors who participated in the movie have spoken out condemning it  They said they had been tricked and that they had been asked to read a completely different script  There are indeed clear signs of crude overdubbing every time references to Muhammad or Islam are made in the film 
 The entire cast and crew are extremely upset and feel taken advantage of by the producer  We are     percent not behind this film and were grossly misled about its intent and purpose  We are shocked by the drastic rewrites of the script and lies that were told to all involved  We are deeply saddened by the tragedies that have occurred   read a statement by the cast that was published by CNN 
Actor Cindy Lee Garcia said the cast were told they were filming a movie called Desert Warriors depicting life in Egypt       years ago  She said there were no references to Muhammad at all and that the main character was called  Master George  
She said the producer referred to himself as Bacile and said he was a real estate mogul from Israel  but that she had seen him conversing in Arabic with others on the set 
A casting sheet obtained by AP confirms the actor       s claim  It has no references to Muhammad or Islam whatsoever 
Nakoula also seemingly deceived the film s director  Alan Robe  Robe  a director of soft core pornography has since gone into hiding  A friend described him as  non political  Gawker reporter 
Steve Klien  a man involved with anti Islam  hate groups  according to the Southern Poverty Law Centre  told AP he was asked by Nakoula to be the film s spokesperson  Klien is aware that Bacile is not the filmmaker s real identity and told AP it was an alias 
Media for Christ  a Christian charity based in Duarte  has been linked with the film s production  The organisation obtained permits to shoot the movie in August       Its founder  Joseph Nassralla Abdelmasih  who is also an Egyptian immigrant  has also gone into hiding 
The movie was up on Nakoula s YouTube account as early as June       It first gained attention when Islamist talk show host Khaled Abdallah played part of it dubbed in Arabic on the Egyptian Al Nas channel Nakoula said he did not know who dubbed it in Arabic but said he spoke enough Arabic to tell the translation was accurate
