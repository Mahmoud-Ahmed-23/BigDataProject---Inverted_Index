Computer science observation
Huang s law is the observation in computer science and engineering that advancements in graphics processing units  GPUs  are growing at a rate much faster than with traditional central processing units  CPUs   The observation is in contrast to Moore s law that predicted the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit  IC  doubles about every two years             Huang s law states that the performance of GPUs will more than double every two years             The hypothesis is subject to questions about its validity 


History edit 
Jensen Huang  the chief executive officer of Nvidia and the law s namesake  in     
The observation was made by Jensen Huang  the chief executive officer of Nvidia  at its      GPU Technology Conference  GTC  held in San Jose  California             He observed that Nvidia s GPUs were     times faster than five years ago  whereas Moore s law would have expected only a ten fold increase             As microchip components become smaller  it became harder for chip advancement to meet the speed of Moore s law            
In       Nvidia s GPU had a  x performance advantage over other CPUs  In      the Nvidia GPU was    times faster than a comparable CPU node  the GPUs were    x faster each year  Moore s law would predict a doubling every two years  however Nvidia s GPU performance was more than tripled every two years  fulfilling Huang s law             
Huang s law claims that a synergy between hardware  software  and artificial intelligence makes the new  law  possible      A      Huang said   The innovation isn t just about chips   he said   It s about the entire stack   He said that graphics processors especially are important to a new paradigm             Elimination of bottlenecks can speed up the process and create advantages in getting to the goal   Nvidia is a one trick pony   Huang has said             According to Huang   Accelerated computing is liberating      Let s say you have an airplane that has to deliver a package  It takes    hours to deliver it  Instead of making the plane go faster  concentrate on how to deliver the package faster  look at  D printing at the destination   The object    is to deliver the goal faster             
For artificial intelligence tasks  Huang said that training the convolutional network AlexNet took six days on two of Nvidia s GTX     processors to complete the training process but only    minutes on a modern DGX   AI server  resulting in a speed up factor of      Compared to Moore s law  which focuses purely on CPU transistors  Huang s law describes a combination of advances in architecture  interconnects  memory technology  and algorithms                       

Reception edit 
Bharath Ramsundar wrote that deep learning is being coupled with   i mprovements in custom architecture   For example  machine learning systems have been implemented in the blockchain world  where Bitmain assaulted  many cryptocurrencies by designing custom mining ASICs  application specific integrated circuits   which had been envisioned as undoable   Nvidia s grand achievement however is in making the case that these improvement in architectures are not merely isolated victories for specific applications but perhaps broadly applicable to all of computer science   They have suggested that broad harnessing of GPUs and the GPU stack  cf   CPU stack  can deliver  dramatic growth in deep learning architecture    The magic  of Huang s law promise is that as nascent deep learning powered software becomes more availed  the improvements from GPU scaling and more generally from architectural improvements  will concretely improve  performance and behavior of modern software stacks             
There has been criticism  Journalist Joel Hruska writing in ExtremeTech in      said  there is no such thing as Huang s Law   calling it an  illusion  that rests on the gains made possible by Moore s law  and that it is too soon to determine a law exists             The research nonprofit Epoch has found that  between      and       GPU price performance  in terms of FLOPS    has tended to double approximately every     years  much slower than predicted by Huang s law

  Contrary to other reports  it is said that  Huang s Law      is a term coined by The Wall Street Journal journalist Christopher Mims
