Technocracy is a form of government in which decision makers appoint knowledge experts in  specific domains to provide them with advice and guidance in various areas of their policy making responsibilities  Technocracy follows largely in the tradition of other meritocratic theories and works best when the state exerts strong control over social and economic issues 
This system is sometimes presented as explicitly contrasting with representative democracy  the notion that elected representatives should be the primary decision makers in government             despite the fact that technocracy does not imply eliminating elected representatives  In a technocracy  decision makers rely on individuals and institutions possessing specialized knowledge and data based evidence rather than advisors with political affiliations or loyalty 
The term technocracy was initially used to signify the application of the scientific method to solving social problems  In its most extreme form  technocracy is an entire government running as a technical or engineering problem and is mostly hypothetical  In more practical use  technocracy is any portion of a bureaucracy run by technologists  A government in which elected officials appoint experts and professionals to administer individual government functions  and recommend legislation  can be considered technocratic                        Some uses of the word refer to a form of meritocracy  where the ablest are in charge  ostensibly without the influence of special interest groups             Critics have suggested that a  technocratic divide  challenges more participatory models of democracy  describing these divides as  efficacy gaps that persist between governing bodies employing technocratic principles and members of the general public aiming to contribute to government decision making             


History of the term edit 
The term technocracy is derived from the Greek words        tekhne meaning skill and         kratos meaning power  as in governance  or rule  William Henry Smyth  a California engineer  is usually credited with inventing the word technocracy in      to describe  the rule of the people made effective through the agency of their servants  the scientists and engineers   although the word had been used before on several occasions                                   Smyth used the term Technocracy in his      article   Technocracy  Ways and Means to Gain Industrial Democracy  in the journal Industrial Management                  Smyth s usage referred to Industrial democracy  a movement to integrate workers into decision making through existing firms or revolution            
In the     s  through the influence of Howard Scott and the technocracy movement he founded  the term technocracy came to mean  government by technical decision making   using an energy metric of value  It was based on organising and directing economic activity within a geographical region nearly self sufficient in resources and with a highly developed technology  Scott proposed that money be replaced by energy certificates denominated in units such as ergs or joules  equivalent in total amount to an appropriate national net energy budget  and then distributed equally among the North American population  according to resource availability                       
There is in common usage found the derivative term technocrat  The word technocrat can refer to someone exercising governmental authority because of their knowledge               a member of a powerful technical elite   or  someone who advocates the supremacy of technical experts                                     McDonnell and Valbruzzi define a prime minister or minister as a technocrat if  at the time of their appointment to government  they  have never held public office under the banner of a political party  are not a formal member of any party  and are said to possess recognized non party political expertise which is directly relevant to the role occupied in government               In Russia  the President of Russia has often nominated ministers based on technical expertise from outside political circles  and these have been referred to as  technocrats                          

Precursors edit 
Before the term technocracy was coined  technocratic or quasi technocratic ideas involving governance by technical experts were promoted by various individuals  most notably early socialist theorists such as Henri de Saint Simon  This was expressed by the belief in state ownership over the economy  with the state s function being transformed from pure philosophical rule over men into a scientific administration of things and a direction of production processes under scientific management               According to Daniel Bell 

 St  Simon s vision of industrial society  a vision of pure technocracy  was a system of planning and rational order in which society would specify its needs and organize the factors of production to achieve them               Citing the ideas of St  Simon  Bell concludes that the  administration of things  by rational judgment is the hallmark of technocracy             
Alexander Bogdanov  a Russian scientist and social theorist  also anticipated a conception of technocratic process  Both Bogdanov s fiction and his political writings  which were highly influential  suggest that he  was concerned that a coming revolution against capitalism could lead to a technocratic society                                               
From      until       Bogdanov immersed himself in writing a lengthy philosophical treatise of original ideas  Tectology  Universal Organization Science  Tectology anticipated many basic ideas of systems analysis  later explored by cybernetics  In Tectology  Bogdanov proposed unifying all social  biological  and physical sciences by considering them as systems of relationships and seeking organizational principles that underlie all systems 
Arguably  the Platonic idea of philosopher kings represents a sort of technocracy in which the state is run by those with specialist knowledge  in this case  knowledge of the Good rather than scientific knowledge      citation needed      The Platonic claim is that those who best understand goodness should be empowered to lead the state  as they would lead it toward the path of happiness  Whilst knowledge of the Good differs from knowledge of science  rulers are here appointed based on a certain grasp of technical skill rather than democratic mandate 

Characteristics edit 
Technocrats are individuals with technical training and occupations who perceive many important societal problems as being solvable with the applied use of technology and related applications  The administrative scientist Gunnar K  A  Njalsson theorizes that technocrats are primarily driven by their cognitive  problem solution mindsets  and only in part by particular occupational group interests  Their activities and the increasing success of their ideas are thought to be a crucial factor behind the modern spread of technology and the largely ideological concept of the  information society   Technocrats may be distinguished from  econocrats  and  bureaucrats  whose problem solution mindsets differ from those of the technocrats             

Examples edit 
The former government of the Soviet Union has been referred to as a technocracy              Soviet leaders like Leonid Brezhnev often had a technical background  In           of Politburo members were engineers             
Leaders of the Chinese Communist Party used to be mostly professional engineers  According to surveys of municipal governments of cities with a population of   million or more in China  it has been found that over     of government personnel had a technical education                          Under the five year plans of the People s Republic of China  projects such as the National Trunk Highway System  the China high speed rail system  and the Three Gorges Dam have been completed                  page      needed      During China s   th National Congress  a class of technocrats in finance and economics are replaced in favor of high tech technocrats                         
In       a European Union library briefing on its legislative structure referred to the Commission as a  technocratic authority   holding a  legislative monopoly  over the EU lawmaking process              The briefing suggests that this system  which elevates the European Parliament to a vetoing and amending body  was  originally rooted in the mistrust of the political process in post war Europe   This system is unusual since the Commission s sole right of legislative initiative is a power usually associated with Parliaments 
Several governments in European parliamentary democracies have been labelled  technocratic  based on the participation of unelected experts   technocrats   in prominent positions             Since the     s  Italy has had several such governments  in Italian  governo tecnico  in times of economic or political crisis                          including the formation in which economist Mario Monti presided over a cabinet of unelected professionals                          The term  technocratic  has been applied to governments where a cabinet of elected professional politicians is led by an unelected prime minister  such as in the cases of the           Greek government led by economist Lucas Papademos and the Czech Republic s           caretaker government presided over by the state s chief statistician  Jan Fischer                         In December       in the framework of the national dialogue facilitated by the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet  political parties in Tunisia agreed to install a technocratic government led by Mehdi Jomaa             
The Syrian Salvation Government  the predecessor to the Syrian transitional government              was characterized by observers as an authoritarian technocracy                                                                      
The article  Technocrats  Minds Like Machines             states that Singapore is perhaps the best advertisement for technocracy  the political and expert components of the governing system there seem to have merged completely  This was underlined in a      article in Wired by Sandy Sandfort              where he describes the information technology system of the island even at that early date making it effectively intelligent 

Engineering edit 
Following Samuel Haber              Donald Stabile argues that engineers were faced with a conflict between physical efficiency and cost efficiency in the new corporate capitalist enterprises of the late nineteenth century United States  Because of their perceptions of market demand  the profit conscious  non technical managers of firms where the engineers work often impose limits on the projects that engineers desire to undertake 
The prices of all inputs vary with market forces  thereby upsetting the engineer s careful calculations  As a result  the engineer loses control over projects and must continually revise plans  To maintain control over projects  the engineer must attempt to control these outside variables and transform them into constant factors             

Technocracy movement edit 
Main article  Technocracy movement
The American economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen was an early advocate of technocracy and was involved in the Technical Alliance  as were Howard Scott and M  King Hubbert  the latter of whom later developed the theory of peak oil   Veblen believed technological developments would eventually lead to a socialistic reorganization of economic affairs  Veblen saw socialism as one intermediate phase in an ongoing evolutionary process in society that would be brought about by the natural decay of the business enterprise system and the rise of the engineers              Daniel Bell sees an affinity between Veblen and the Technocracy movement             
In       Howard Scott and Marion King Hubbert founded Technocracy Incorporated and proposed that money be replaced by energy certificates  The group argued that apolitical  rational engineers should be vested with the authority to guide an economy into a thermodynamically balanced load of production and consumption  thereby doing away with unemployment and debt            
The technocracy movement was briefly popular in the US in the early     s during the Great Depression  By the mid     s  interest in the movement was declining  Some historians have attributed the decline to the rise of Roosevelt s New Deal                         
Historian William E  Akin rejects this conclusion  Instead  Akin argues that the movement declined in the mid     s due to the technocrats  failure to devise a  viable political theory for achieving change               Akin postulates that many technocrats remained vocal  dissatisfied  and often sympathetic to anti New Deal third party efforts             

Critiques edit 
Critics have suggested that a  technocratic divide  exists between a governing body controlled to varying extents by technocrats and members of the general public             Technocratic divides are  efficacy gaps that persist between governing bodies employing technocratic principles and members of the general public aiming to contribute to government decision making              Technocracy privileges the opinions and viewpoints of technical experts  exalting them into a kind of aristocracy while marginalizing the opinions and viewpoints of the general public                         
As major multinational technology corporations  e g   FAANG  swell market caps and customer counts  critiques of technocratic government in the   st century see its manifestation in American politics not as an  authoritarian nightmare of oppression and violence  but rather as an  minence grise  a democratic cabal directed by Mark Zuckerberg and the entire cohort of  Big Tech  executives                          In his      Technology and Culture journal article   The Technocratic Image and the Theory of Technocracy   John G  Gunnell writes      politics is increasingly subject to the influence of technological change   with specific reference to the advent of The Long Boom and the genesis of the Internet  following the           recession                          Gunnel goes on to add three levels of analysis that delineate technology s political influence 

 Political power tends to gravitate towards technological elites  
 Technology has become autonomous  and thus impenetrable by political structures 
 Technology  and science  constitute a new legitimizing ideology   as well as triumphing over  tribalism  nationalism  the crusading spirit in religion  bigotry  censorship  racism  persecution  immigration and emigration restrictions  tariffs  and chauvinism                          
In each of the three analytical levels  Gunnell foretells technology s infiltration of political processes and suggests that the entanglement of the two  i e  technology and politics  will inevitably produce power concentrations around those with advanced technological training  namely the technocrats              Forty years after the publication of Gunnell s writings  technology and government have become  for better or for worse  increasingly intertwined                                      Facebook can be considered a technocratic microcosm  a  technocratic nation state  with a cyberspatial population that surpasses any terrestrial nation              In a broader sense  critics fear that the rise of social media networks  e g  Twitter  YouTube  Instagram  Pinterest   coupled with the  decline in mainstream engagement   imperil the  networked young citizen  to inconspicuous coercion and indoctrination by algorithmic mechanisms  and  less insidiously  to the persuasion of particular candidates based predominantly on  Social Media engagement                                      
In a      article published in Boston Review  political scientist Matthew Cole highlights two problems with technocracy  that it creates  unjust concentrations of power  and that the concept itself is poorly defined              With respect to the first point  Cole argues that technocracy excludes citizens from policy making processes while advantaging elites  With respect to the second  he argues that the value of expertise is overestimated in technocratic systems  and points to an alternative concept of  smart democracy  which enlists the knowledge of ordinary citizens
