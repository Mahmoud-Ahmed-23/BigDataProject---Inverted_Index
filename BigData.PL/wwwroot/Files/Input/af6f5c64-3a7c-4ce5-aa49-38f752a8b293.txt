Sir Demis Hassabis  born    July       is a British artificial intelligence  AI  researcher  and entrepreneur  He is the chief executive officer and co founder of Google DeepMind             and Isomorphic Labs                                     and a UK Government AI Adviser              In       Hassabis and John M  Jumper were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their AI research contributions for protein structure prediction                         
Hassabis is a Fellow of the Royal Society  and has won many prestigious awards for his research work including the Breakthrough Prize  the Canada Gairdner International Award  and the Lasker Award  In      he was appointed a CBE and listed in the Time     most influential people list  In      he was knighted for services to AI              and was listed in the Time     again in       this time featured in one of the five covers of the printed version             


Early life and education edit 
Hassabis was born to Costas and Angela Hassabis              His father is Greek Cypriot              and his mother is from Singapore              Demis grew up in North London                          In his early career  he was a video game AI programmer and designer  and an expert board games player                                      A child prodigy in chess from the age of four                          Hassabis reached master standard at the age of    with an Elo rating of      and captained many of the England junior chess teams              He represented the University of Cambridge in the Oxford Cambridge varsity chess matches of                                    and                   winning a half blue 
Between      and       Hassabis was educated at Queen Elizabeth s School  Barnet  a boys  grammar school in North London  He was subsequently home schooled by his parents  during which time he bought his first computer  a ZX Spectrum   K funded from chess winnings  and taught himself how to program from books              He wrote his first AI program on a Commodore Amiga based on the reversi board game               He then studied at the comprehensive school Christ s College  Finchley              He completed his A level exams two years early at                            

Bullfrog Productions edit 
Asked by Cambridge University to take a gap year due to his young age              Hassabis began his computer games career at Bullfrog Productions after entering an Amiga Power  Win a job at Bullfrog  competition              He began first by level designing on Syndicate  and then at    co designing and lead programming on the      game Theme Park  with the game s designer Peter Molyneux              Theme Park  a simulation video game  sold several million copies             and inspired a whole genre of simulation sandbox games  He earned enough from his gap year to pay his own way through university             

University of Cambridge edit 
Hassabis left Bullfrog to study at Queens  College  Cambridge  where he completed the Computer Science Tripos and graduated in      with a double first             

Career and research edit 
Lionhead edit 
After graduating from Cambridge  Hassabis worked at Lionhead Studios              Games designer Peter Molyneux  with whom Hassabis had worked at Bullfrog Productions  had recently founded the company  At Lionhead  Hassabis worked as lead AI programmer on the      god game Black  amp  White             

Elixir Studios edit 
Hassabis left Lionhead in      to found Elixir Studios  a London based independent games developer  signing publishing deals with Eidos Interactive  Vivendi Universal and Microsoft              In addition to managing the company  Hassabis served as executive designer of the games Republic  The Revolution and Evil Genius              Each received BAFTA Nominations for their interactive music scores  created by James Hannigan 
The release of Elixir s first game  Republic  The Revolution  a highly ambitious and unusual political simulation game              was delayed due to its huge scope  which involved an AI simulation of the workings of an entire fictional country  The final game was reduced from its original vision and greeted with lukewarm reviews  receiving a Metacritic score of                     Evil Genius  a tongue in cheek Bond villain simulator  fared much better with a score of                     In April      the intellectual property and technology rights were sold to various publishers and the studio was closed                         

Neuroscience research at University College London edit 
Demis Hassabis  left  with Blaise Ag era y Arcas  right  in       at the Wired conference in London
Following Elixir Studios  Hassabis returned to academia to obtain his PhD in cognitive neuroscience from UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology             in      supervised by Eleanor Maguire             He sought to find inspiration in the human brain for new AI algorithms             
He continued his neuroscience and artificial intelligence research as a visiting scientist jointly at Massachusetts Institute of Technology  MIT   in the lab of Tomaso Poggio  and Harvard University              before earning a Henry Wellcome postdoctoral research fellowship to the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at UCL in      working with Peter Dayan             
Working in the field of imagination  memory  and amnesia  he co authored several influential papers published in Nature  Science  Neuron  and PNAS             His very first academic work  published in PNAS              was a landmark paper that showed systematically for the first time that patients with damage to their hippocampus  known to cause amnesia  were also unable to imagine themselves in new experiences  The finding established a link between the constructive process of imagination and the reconstructive process of episodic memory recall  Based on this work and a follow up functional magnetic resonance imaging  fMRI  study              Hassabis developed a new theoretical account of the episodic memory system identifying scene construction  the generation and online maintenance of a complex and coherent scene  as a key process underlying both memory recall and imagination              This work received widespread coverage in the mainstream media             and was listed in the top    scientific breakthroughs of the year by the journal Science              He later generalised these ideas to advance the notion of a  simulation engine of the mind  whose role it was to imagine events and scenarios to aid with better planning                         

DeepMind edit 
Hassabis is the CEO and co founder of DeepMind  a machine learning AI startup  founded in London in      with Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman  Hassabis met Legg when both were postdocs at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit  and he and Suleyman had been friends through family              Hassabis also recruited his university friend and Elixir partner David Silver             
DeepMind s mission is to  solve intelligence  and then use intelligence  to solve everything else               More concretely  DeepMind aims to combine insights from systems neuroscience with new developments in machine learning and computing hardware to unlock increasingly powerful general purpose learning algorithms that will work towards the creation of an artificial general intelligence  AGI   The company has focused on training learning algorithms to master games  and in December      it announced that it had made a pioneering breakthrough by training an algorithm called a Deep Q Network  DQN  to play Atari games at a superhuman level by using only the raw pixels on the screen as inputs             
DeepMind s early investors included several high profile tech entrepreneurs                          In       Google purchased DeepMind for           million  Although most of the company has remained an independent entity based in London              DeepMind Health has since been directly incorporated into Google Health             
Since the Google acquisition  the company has notched up a number of significant achievements  perhaps the most notable being the creation of AlphaGo  a program that defeated world champion Lee Sedol at the complex game of Go  Go had been considered a holy grail of AI  for its high number of possible board positions and resistance to existing programming techniques                          However  AlphaGo beat European champion Fan Hui     in October      before winning     against former world champion Lee Sedol in March                               Additional DeepMind accomplishments include creating a neural Turing machine              reducing the energy used by the cooling systems in Google s data centers by                  advancing research on AI safety                          and the creation of a partnership with the National Health Service  NHS  of the United Kingdom and Moorfields Eye Hospital to improve medical service and identify the onset of degenerative eye conditions             
DeepMind has also been responsible for technical advances in machine learning  having produced a number of award winning papers  In particular  the company has made significant advances in deep learning and reinforcement learning  and pioneered the field of deep reinforcement learning which combines these two methods              Hassabis has predicted that artificial intelligence will be  one of the most beneficial technologies of mankind ever  but that significant ethical issues remain             
Hassabis has also warned of the potential dangers and risks of AI if misused  and has been a strong advocate of further AI safety research being needed              In       he signed the statement that  Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war               He considers however that a pause on AI progress would be very hard to enforce worldwide  and that the potential benefits  e g  for health and against climate change  make it worth continuing  He said that there is an urgent need for research on evaluation tests that measure how capable and controllable new AI models are             

AlphaFold edit 
In       DeepMind turned its artificial intelligence to protein folding  a    year grand challenge in science  to predict the  D structure of a protein from its  D amino acid sequence  This is an important problem in biology  as proteins are essential to life  almost every biological function depends on them  and the function of a protein is thought to be related to its structure  Knowing the structure of a protein can be very helpful in drug discovery and disease understanding  In December       DeepMind s tool AlphaFold won the   th Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction  CASP  by successfully predicting the most accurate structure for    out of    proteins   This is a lighthouse project  our first major investment in terms of people and resources into a fundamental  very important  real world scientific problem   Hassabis said to The Guardian             

Hassabis at      Nobel Week
In November       DeepMind again announced world beating results in the CASP   edition of the competition with AlphaFold    a new version of the system  It achieved a median global distance test  GDT  score of      across protein targets in the challenging free modeling category  much higher than the same      results with a median GDT  lt      and an overall error of less than the width of an atom   lt   Angstrom   making it competitive with experimental methods  and leading the organisers of CASP to declare the problem essentially solved                          Over the next year DeepMind used AlphaFold  to fold all     million proteins known to science  and made the system and these structures openly and freely available for anyone to use via the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database developed in collaboration with EMBL EBI             

Personal life edit 
Hassabis is married to Dr  Teresa Niccoli                          an Italian molecular biologist with whom he has two sons  He resides in North London with his family                                      He is also a lifelong fan of Liverpool FC              Hassabis is the main subject of the documentary called The Thinking Game  which premiered in      s Tribeca Festival  from the same filmmaker as the award winning documentary AlphaGo
