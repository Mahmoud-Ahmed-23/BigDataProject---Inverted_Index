The former MCC headquarters building in Austin  Texas
Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation  originally the Microelectronics and Computer Consortium and widely seen by the acronym MCC  was the first  and at one time one of the largest  computer industry research and development consortia in the United States  MCC ceased operations in      and was formally dissolved in      


Divisions edit 
MCC did research and development in the following areas     

System Architecture and Design  optimise hardware and software design  provide for scalability and interoperability  allow rapid prototyping for improved time to market  and support the re engineering of existing systems for open systems  
Advanced Microelectronics Packaging and Interconnection  smaller  faster  more powerful  and cost competitive  
Hardware Systems Engineering  tools and methodologies for cost efficient  up front design of advanced electronic systems  including modelling and design for test techniques to improve cost  yield  quality  and time to market  
Environmentally Conscious Technologies  process control and optimisation tools  information management and analysis capabilities  and non hazardous material alternatives supporting cost efficient production  waste minimisation  and reduced environmental impact  
Distributed Information Technology  managing and maintaining physically distributed corporate information resources on different platforms  building blocks for the national information infrastructure  networking tools and services for integration within and between companies  and electronic commerce  
Intelligent Systems  systems that  intelligently  support business processes and enhance performance  including decision support  data management  forecasting and prediction  
History edit 
The MCC was a response to the announcement of Japan s Fifth Generation Project  a large Japanese research project launched in      aimed at producing a new kind of computer by       The Japanese had formed similar industrial research consortia as early as          Many European and American computer companies saw this new Japanese initiative as an attempt to take full control of the world s high end computer market  and MCC was created  in part  as a defensive move against that threat 
In late       several major computer and semiconductor manufacturers in the United States banded together and founded MCC under the leadership of Admiral Bobby Ray Inman  whose previous positions had been Director of the National Security Agency and Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency  Such formations were illegal in the United States until the      Congressional passage of the  National Cooperative Research Act             
Several sites with relevant universities were considered  including Atlanta  Georgia  Georgia Tech   the Research Triangle  N C   UNC   the Washington  D C  area  George Mason   Stanford University and Austin  Texas  UT  which was the final selection  The University of Texas offered land upon which they would construct a new building specifically designed for the MCC within their Austin campus  Ross Perot also offered the use of his private plane for   years for staff recruitment  Austin was selected as the site for MCC in                 
Despite this purpose and the background of Inman and his senior staff  MCC accepted no government funding for many years and was a refuge for some avoiding work on Strategic Defense Initiative projects  MCC was part of the Artificial Intelligence boom of the     s  reportedly the single largest customer of both Symbolics and Lisp Machines  Inc   and like Symbolics  was one of the first companies to register a  com domain   In the     s its major programs were packaging  software engineering  CAD  and advanced computer architectures  The latter comprised artificial intelligence  human interface  database  and parallel processing  the latter two merging in the late     s 
Many of the early shareholder companies were mainframe computer companies under stress in the     s  Over the years  MCC s membership diversified to include a broad range of high profile corporations involved in information technology products  as well as government research and development agencies and leading universities 
In June       the MCC Board of Directors voted to dissolve the consortium  and the few remaining employees held a wake at Scholz s Beer Garden in Austin on October     Formal dissolution papers were reportedly not filed until      

Spinoffs edit 
While multiple technologies were transferred to member companies and government agencies in the final years  fourteen companies were spun out of MCC              Those spinoffs include 

TeraVicta Technologies  Austin s first MEMS company  its focus was to develop microscopic switch technology for fiber optic switching and radiofrequency switching in mobile phones specifically to dynamically switch between the future  G  GLTE future G wireless communication frequencies and ensure mobile phones were communicating over the strongest wireless signal to reduce dropped calls  Robert Miracky was the founding CEO who spun out the first commercial metal micromachining technology developed by MCC researchers Brent Lunceford  Jason Reed  Richard Nelson  K Hu  and C  Hilbert in a collaborative development program with IBM in a novel implementation and operational paradigm for solid state integrated circuit coolers integrated with conductive MEMS switches              TeraVicta was liquidated under Chapter   bankruptcy proceedings in                   The Austin region subsequently built up a MEMS  amp  Sensors value chain in the billions of dollars comprising companies such as  M  Cypress Semiconductor  NXP Semiconductor  Cirrus Logic  Silicon Labs  and the Austin division of the now defunct Silicon Valley Technology Center 
Portelligent  a company that provides reverse engineering teardown services   At the time  Portelligent was the first company to commercialize such services  they had been provided by MCC to its member companies   Today  there are at least twelve companies worldwide that sell reports known as  reverse engineering teardown reports    Modern day teardown reports provide detailed information about technology products such as the bill of materials  microchip  and printed circuit board design specifics  manufacturing details including manufacturing location details for the entire value chain responsible for making electronics  including the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy smartphones  Portelligent was acquired by CMP Technology in                            
Evolutionary Technologies International  a company focused on developing database tools and data warehousing  It was spun off from MCC in
