What are Data  amp  Databases 
Data refers to any piece of information  It can be numbers  words  images  sounds  or any other information that a computer can store and process  Data can be raw or processed 
A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way to facilitates efficient storage  retrieval  and manipulation of information  It acts as a centralized and organized repository where data can be stored  managed  and accessed by various applications or users 
What is DBMS 
A Database Management System  DBMS  is a software system that enables users to define  create  maintain  and manipulate databases  It provides an interface between the database and the users or applications  allowing them to access and manage data efficiently  

The primary functions of a DBMS include 

Data Definition  Defining the database structure  including specifying data types  relationships between data elements  and constraints 
Data Manipulation  Inserting  updating  deleting  and retrieving data from the database using queries and commands 
Data Security  Enforcing access control to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify the data 
Data Integrity  Maintaining the accuracy  consistency  and reliability of the data through validation rules and constraints 
Concurrency Control  Managing simultaneous access to the database by multiple users or applications to prevent conflicts and ensure data consistency 
Backup and Recovery  Providing mechanisms for backing up data and recovering it in case of system failures or data corruption 

Types of Databases
There are various types of databases  each designed for specific use cases and requirements  Here are some common types of databases 
   Relational Databases  SQL databases 
Relational databases RDBMS  organize data into tables  where each table has rows and columns  These databases use structured query language  SQL  for defining and manipulating data 

These are the following relational databases 

MySQL
PostgreSQL
Oracle  PL SQL  programming language extension for Oracle Database 
SQL Server
SQLite
MariaDB
IBM Db 

   NoSQL Databases
These databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured  semi structured  or structured data  NoSQL provide flexible schema designs and often offer horizontal scalability 

Types of NoSQL databases

Document databases  Store data in flexible  JSON like documents  

MongoDB
Couchbase


Key value stores  Simplest NoSQL databases  storing data as key value pairs  

Redis
Amazon DynamoDB 


Column family stores  Store data in columns rather than rows  

Apache Cassandra
HBase 


Graph databases  Optimize for data with complex relationships  

Neo j
Amazon Neptune 



   Cloud Databases
Cloud databases are online databases that store and manage data in a cloud computing environment  They offer various advantages such as scalability  reliability  and accessibility  
Cloud Database

Amazon RDS  Relational Database Service 
Amazon Aurora
Azure SQL Database
Google Cloud SQL
Microsoft Azure SQL Database
IBM Db  on Cloud
Amazon DynamoDB
Azure Cosmos DB
Cloud Firestore Google Cloud Firebase 

   In Memory Databases
In memory databases store data primarily in RAM rather than on disk  resulting in faster data access 

Redis
Memcached

   Time Series Databases
Time series databases are optimized for storing and querying time stamped data  such as sensor data  IoT data  and financial market data 

InfluxDB
Prometheus

   NewSQL Databases
NewSQL databases aim to combine the scalability and flexibility of NoSQL databases with the ACID compliance and SQL querying capabilities of traditional relational databases 

CockroachDB
Google Spanner 

   Object Oriented Databases
Object oriented databases organize and store data in a way that reflects the principles of object oriented programming  OOP   In OODBs  data is represented as objects  which encapsulate both data and the methods or functions that operate on that data 

db o
ObjectDB

   Hierarchical Databases
Hierarchical databases organize data in a tree like structure where each record has one parent record and multiple child records  forming a hierarchy  Records are linked together in parent child relationships  with each child record having only one parent 

IMS  Information Management System 

   Network databases
Network databases are a type of database model that represents data as collections of records and sets  with relationships defined between records  Unlike hierarchical databases  where records form a strict parent child hierarchy  network databases allow records to have multiple parent and child records  forming a network structure 

IDMS  Integrated Database Management System 

    Centralized Database
Centralized databases are a type of database architecture where data is stored and managed in a single location or server  In this architecture  all data processing and management tasks are performed on the central server  and clients access the database remotely 

ISAM  Indexed Sequential Access Method 

    Operational Database
Operational databases are databases optimized for supporting day to day operations and transactional processing within an organization  They are designed to efficiently handle tasks such as adding  modifying  and retrieving data in real time to support business operations 

Amazon Aurora
Teradata
