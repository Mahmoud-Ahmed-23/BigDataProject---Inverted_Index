            JavaScript

       pages index js

export default function Home    
    return  
         lt div gt 
             lt h  gt Welcome to the Next js Tutorial lt  h  gt 
         lt  div gt 
      
 

It will start a server  and when you visit http   localhost       it will displayWelcome to the Next js TutorialIn this exampleThe file index js inside the pages folder acts as the root route     The Home function is exported as the default export  making it accessible as a page There is no need for manual routing configuration  Next js handles it automatically In this Next js Tutorial  we ll learn all the basic to advanced concepts such as Routing  Data Fetching  Environment Variables  Meta Tags  Static File Serving  Pre Rendering  etc Why learn Next js Next js offers several advantages over traditional React development Built in Routing and SSR  Unlike React  which lacks native routing  Next js provides seamless routing functionality out of the box  Additionally  it supports server side rendering  improving performance and SEO Faster Development  Next js accelerates development by offering built in features and conventions  Developers can focus on building features rather than configuring complex setups SEO Optimization  Next js enhances SEO by addressing slow rendering and loading times associated with client side rendering  Its SSR capabilities ensure that search engines can efficiently crawl and index your content Additionally  Next js mitigates slow rendering and loading times inherent in client side rendering  important for optimizing SEO performance  Its integration of server side rendering out of the box enhances overall development efficiency and user experience Next js Tutorial Prerequisites  HTML  CSS  JavaScript and ReactNext js BasicLearn the

Next jsRecipe Generator using Next jsFeatures of Next jsNext js is a React framework that extends React s capabilities to build server rendered and statically generated web applications  Here are some of its key features Server side Rendering  SSR   This improves SEO and initial load performance by rendering pages on the server  Content is already available for search engines to index  and users see a fully rendered page on the first load Static Site Generation  SSG   This pre renders pages at build time  making them super fast to load  Ideal for content that changes infrequently  like blog posts or landing pages Automatic Code Splitting  This breaks down your application code into smaller bundles  improving load times by only loading the code needed for the current page Data Fetching  Next js offers several ways to fetch data  including getStaticProps for fetching data at build time and getServerSideProps for fetching data on each request  This flexibility allows you to choose the most appropriate method for your specific needs Routing  Routing is simplified in Next js  It automatically creates routes based on the file structure of your pages directory  making it easy to manage your application s URL structure Image Optimization  Next js automatically optimizes images  including resizing and compressing them  for faster loading times and improved SEO Built in CSS and JavaScript Bundling  Next js takes care of bundling and optimizing your CSS and JavaScript code  streamlining the development process API Routes  Next js allows you to create serverless functions directly within your application using API routes  This lets you add backend functionality to your React application without needing a separate server Next js vs ReactLet s compare Next js with React
