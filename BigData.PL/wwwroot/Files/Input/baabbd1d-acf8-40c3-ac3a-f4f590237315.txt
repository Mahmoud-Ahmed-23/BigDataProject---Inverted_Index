History edit 
Logotype edit 
The name comes from the Japanese term atari  used while playing the ancient board game Go  The word atari means  to hit a target  in Japanese  in Go  it indicates a situation where a player will be able to capture one or more stones of the opponent in the next move             
The Atari logo was designed by George Opperman  who was Atari s first in house graphic designer  and drawn by Evelyn Seto              The design is known as  Fuji  for its resemblance to the Japanese mountain  although the logo s origins are unrelated to it  Opperman designed the logo intending for the silhouette to look like the letter A as in Atari and for its three  prongs  to resemble players and the midline of the  court  in the company s first hit game  Pong

In       Atari secretly spawned a competitor called Kee Games  headed by Nolan s next door neighbor Joe Keenan  to circumvent pinball distributors  insistence on exclusive distribution deals  both Atari and Kee could market nearly the same game to different distributors  each getting an  exclusive  deal  Joe Keenan s management of the subsidiary led to his appointment as president of Atari when Kee was absorbed into the company in                  

Atari            
In       Atari s Grass Valley  California subsidiary Cyan Engineering started the development of a flexible console that was capable of playing the four existing Atari games  The result was the Atari Video Computer System  or VCS  later renamed      when the      was released   The introductory price of       equivalent to            in       included a console  two joysticks  a pair of paddles  and the Combat game cartridge              Bushnell knew he had another potential hit on his hands but bringing the machine to market would be extremely expensive  Looking for outside investors  Bushnell sold Atari to Warner Communications in      for     million  Nolan continued to have disagreements with Warner Management over the direction of the company  the discontinuation of the pinball division  and most importantly  the notion of discontinuing the       In December       Bushnell was fired as chairman and co CEO following an argument with Manny Gerard  He decided to leave the company rather than take an advisory role 

Atari            
The development of a successor to the      started as soon as it shipped  The original team estimated the      had a lifespan of about three years  it then set forth to build the most powerful machine possible within that time frame  Mid way into their effort the home computer revolution took off  leading to the addition of a keyboard and features to produce the Atari     and its smaller sibling  the      The new machines had some success when they finally became available in quantity in       From this platform Atari released their next generation game console in       the Atari       It was unsuccessful due to incompatibility with the      game library  a small quantity of dedicated games  and notoriously unreliable controllers  Porting arcade games to home systems with inferior hardware was difficult  The ported version of Pac Man for Atari      omitted many of the visual features of the original to compensate for the lack of ROM space and the hardware struggled when multiple ghosts appeared on the screen creating a flickering effect             
Under Warner and Atari s chairman and CEO  Raymond Kassar  the company achieved its greatest success  selling millions of     s and computers  At its peak  Atari accounted for a third of Warner s annual income and was the fastest growing company in US history at the time  It ran into problems in the early     s  Faced with fierce competition and price wars in the game console and home computer markets  Atari was never able to duplicate the success of the      
These problems were followed by the video game crash of       with losses that totaled more than      million  Warner s stock price slid from     to      and the company began searching for a buyer for its troubled division  In       Ray Kassar resigned  Financial problems continued to mount and Kassar s successor  James J  Morgan  had less than a year in which to tackle the company s problems  He began a massive restructuring of the company and worked with Warner Communications in May      to create  NATCO   an acronym for New Atari Company   NATCO further streamlined the company s facilities  personnel  and spending  Unknown to James Morgan and the senior management of Atari  Warner had been in talks with Tramel Technology to buy assets pertaining to Atari s consumer electronics and home computer businesses  Negotiating until close to midnight on July          Jack Tramiel completed the asset purchase for      million in promissory notes and stocks  Warner gained a     stake in Tramel Technology  which was renamed Atari Corporation              Warner also sold the Ataritel division to Mitsubishi

Atari ST       
Under Tramiel s ownership  Atari Corp  used the remaining stock of game console inventory to keep the company afloat while they finished development on a       bit computer system  the Atari ST    ST  stands for  sixteen thirty two   referring to the machines     bit bus and    bit processor core   In April       they released an update to the   bit computer line  the Atari   XE  the first in the Atari XE series  June      saw the release of the Atari    XE  Atari User Groups received early sneak preview samples of the new Atari    ST s  and major retailer shipments hit store shelves in September      of Atari s new    bit Atari ST computers  In       Atari launched two consoles designed under Warner        the Atari     jr and the Atari      console  which saw limited release in        Atari rebounded  earning a     million profit that year 

Atari Portfolio       
In       Atari acquired the Federated Group for       million  securing shelf space in over    stores in California  Arizona  Texas and Kansas             at a time when major American electronics outlets were reluctant to carry Atari branded computers  and two thirds of Atari s PC production was sold in Europe              The Federated Group  not related to Federated Department Stores  was sold to Silo in                  
In       the company unveiled the     STF and the Mega ST with a bit image manipulator chip  and launched its first parallel computer  The ATW     Transputer was based on the Inmos T    CPU  which had a       bit architecture  ran at    million instructions per second  MIPS  and housed a Charity videochip that supported    million colors  The company continued to experiment with parallel computing aiming at B B customers and graphic designers  but the transputer line failed to achieve commercial success 

Atari Lynx       
In       Atari released the Atari Lynx  the first ever handheld console with a color display and a backlit screen  to much fanfare  A shortage of parts kept the system from being released nationwide for the      Christmas season  and the Lynx lost market share to Nintendo s Game Boy  which  despite only having a black and white display  was cheaper  had better battery life and had much higher availability  Tramiel emphasized computers over game consoles  but Atari s proprietary computer architecture and operating system fell victim to the success of the Wintel platform while the game market revived  In       Atari Corp  sued Nintendo for      million  alleging it had an illegal monopoly              Atari eventually lost the case when it was rejected by a US district court in                  
In       Atari released its PCs ABC   SXII and ABC   DXII based on Intel s i    chip             

Atari Jaguar       
In       Atari positioned its Jaguar as the only    bit interactive media entertainment system available  but it sold poorly  It would be the last home console to be produced by Atari and the last to be produced by an American manufacturer until Microsoft s introduction of the Xbox in      
By       a series of successful lawsuits             had left Atari with millions of dollars in the bank  but the failure of the Lynx and Jaguar left Atari without a product to sell  Tramiel and his family also wanted out of the business  The result was a rapid succession of changes in ownership  In July       Atari merged with JTS Inc   a short lived maker of hard disk drives  to form JTS Corp                                                  Atari s role in the new company largely became that of holder for the Atari properties and minor support  and consequently the name largely disappeared from the market  Video game magazines reported it as Atari exiting the video game business             

The end of an era   Atari s story is one that certainly should never be forgotten by anyone who has ever enjoyed a videogame         from Next Generation magazine s special report on Atari
