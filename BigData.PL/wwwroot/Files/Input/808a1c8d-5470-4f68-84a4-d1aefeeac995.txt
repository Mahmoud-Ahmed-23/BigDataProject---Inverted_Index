organization can also use data analytics to make better business decisions and support analyzing customer trends and fulfillment  which can lead to unknown and better products and services  Executing it into the business model indicates businesses can help reduce costs by recognizing more efficient modes of doing business  nbsp Applications of Data AnalysisBetter decision making  The Key advantage of data analysis is better decision making in the long term  Rather than depending only on knowledge  businesses are increasingly looking at data before deciding  nbsp Identification of potential risks  Companies in today s world succeed in high risk conditions  but those environments require critical risk management processes  and extensive data has contributed to developing new risk management solutions  Data can enhance the effectiveness of actual simulations to predict future risks and create better planning Increase the efficiency of work  Data analysis allows you to analyze a large set of data and present it in a structured way to help reach your organization s objectives  Possibilities and progress within the organization are reflected  and activities can increase work efficiency and productivity  It enables a culture of efficiency and collaboration by allowing managers to share detailed data with employees Delivering relevant products  Products are the oil for every organization  and often the most important asset of organizations  The role of the product management team is to determine trends that drive strategic creation  and activity plans for unique functions and services Track customer behavioral changes  Consumers have a lot to choose from in products available in the markets  Organizations have to pay attention to consumer demands and expectations  So to analyze the behavior of the customer data analysis is very important
