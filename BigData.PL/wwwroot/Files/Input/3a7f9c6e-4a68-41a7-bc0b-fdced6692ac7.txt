							Bee for electronic payment solutions prepares to expand new products and services as well as increase the number of its outlets based on the investment recently obtained by the company for EGP    m for an acquisition by MM Group over     of the company 
According to Mohamed Abo Khadra  head of marketing in the company  said during an interview with Daily News Egypt that the payment market is witnessing several growth opportunities  supported by Egypt s vision for financial inclusion in which electronic payment companies are a cornerstone 
Abo Khadra revealed that the company is working to provide services of electricity metre cards recharging  in addition to a contract with two companies in the aviation sector to provide services of flight tickets payment through Bee s outlets 
How do you see the changes that took place in the electronic payment market 
This market has changed greatly over the past period  The changes are divided into two groups  where one is positive and the other negative 
Positive changes include an increased awareness of electronic payment services  Consumers started using these services albeit in a limited way to pay the bills of basic utilities  such as electricity  gas  and water 
All merchants and shop owners also have become fully aware of electronic payment services  Consumers  on the other hand  now have awareness of the services  their types  and the companies that offer them 
The government now has full awareness of the importance of electronic payments  About a year ago  President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi issued a decision to establish the Supreme Council for Electronic Payments  The decision was preceded by the collection of taxes and customs electronically  These are all strong decisions taken by decision makers in Egypt  and the proof is the launching of the financial inclusion week several days ago 
On the other hand  the Central Bank of Egypt  CBE  is exerting great efforts  There is a special unit in the CBE that works on preparing a draft law to organise the market of electronic payments  Meetings were held between banks and all companies that offer these kinds of services in order to be acquainted with their requirements before preparing the draft law 
The most recent positive change is the existence of many electronic payment companies  which helped increase the awareness between customers and lead to the spread of services and to the increase in the market s volume in terms of electronic payment operations and number of consumers who use the services 
Regarding negative changes  they include the delay of banks playing their roles as one of the parties implementing financial inclusion plans in Egypt  Financial inclusion in Egypt is no more than      The Principal Bank for Development and Agriculture Credit  PBDAC  contributes by     in the a loans agency for farmers and other services for the agricultural sector  whereas financial inclusion in some Gulf countries reached      such as the case in Saudi Arabia 
There are concerns from customers in terms of dealing with banks  A large segment does not have confidence in banks and little knowledge about the fact that a mistake made by the ATM can be fixed  This is negative for the entire electronic payment sector 
How can we overcome the negative side you mentioned 
All players have to work on enhancing the quality of services offered to the market and to work on an integrated solution  Providing banks with electronic payments is the only way to offer something tangible to customers 
It is inconceivable that the CBE plays this role  because it has more important tasks in regard with the monetary policy of Egypt 
From your point of view  what are the most prominent growth opportunities in the market 
The government       s vision of financial inclusion will not be possible without electronic wallets  because they represent one of the most important investment opportunities  The CBE has launched an advertising campaign during last Ramadan to promote e wallet services  The campaign targeted banks and electronic payment companies to prompt them to participate in providing e wallet services sponsored by the CBE 
In cooperation with MasterCard  the CBE formed a unified e wallet  and our company is the only electronic payment company that linked its services to the e wallet provided by MasterCard  Therefore  any bank willing to offer e wallet services will use Bee       s services  such as bills payment  university fees  and others 
There are three main axes of e wallet services  growth  First  the increase of payment service outlets  which depends on the spread of electronic payment companies  Second  the increase of e wallet services  which requires creating more distinctive service for customers to increase competitiveness  and the next period will witness the launch of new electronic payment services in many sectors  increasing the opportunity of growth  Third  the increase of electronic payments        volume  which depends on the other axes 
What are your expectations for e payments  growth rates in the next year 
I expect the electronic payment market will grow by        in the next year  especially since this year witnessed the recovery of the local market from the effects of floating the exchange rate 
Moreover  the CBE and electronic payment companies        initiatives will lead to a significant increase in this sector 
How do you intend to use the recently obtained investment 
BPE Partners  formerly Belton Private Equity  announced the acquisition of     of Bee jointly through its non banking financial services vehicle  Ebtikar and MTI 
We will use this investment to expand our services through increasing the number of outlets and creating new products to cover new sectors 
What products are now in the pipeline 
If you are asking about the Satellite Solutions Telecom  SST  in the Orabi Central Office  this is a pilot project with  We   Based on the results  we will both agree on the expansion plan  and we are proud to be part of the launching of  We  and the trust they put in our solutions  from the launching date with Bee SST machines spread in all Orange owned shops 
In       we made a breakthrough in terms of new products  We made our payment application available on PlayStore and iOS  We also allowed the payment service for Visa and MasterCard holders through the application  in which the customer recharge his account and use the application to pay any bills or transfer credit to other mobile phones 
We also have a partnership deal with MasterCard to provide our electronic payment services through MasterCard       s online wallet 
Regarding community services  we offered electronic donations through Bee       s outlets in favour of the Egyptian Food Bank  Misr El Kheir Foundation  and the Dar Al Orman Charity  The services included a sacrifice voucher programme  Ramadan bags and other services in the voluntary sector 
In addition  Bee launch a new service of the electronic collection of electricity bills in collaboration with the financial services company e finance to enable citizens to pay their electricity bills at the nearest outlet to smooth the payment process 
We also launched electronic payment service for travel booking companies  such as Travelstart Egypt and EgyptAir  and we have signed recently two more contracts with two airliners but they have not been officially announced 
The company offered its services as well in the collective transport sector in which we contracted with Go and Back company for smart collective transport  Bee also contracted with Mubasher in the stock market to pay the value of registration through Bee outlets 
We now aim to increase the number of our outlets  currently at
