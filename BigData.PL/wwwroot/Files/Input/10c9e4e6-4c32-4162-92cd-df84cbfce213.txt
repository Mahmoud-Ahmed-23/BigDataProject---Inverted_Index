Digital collections of natural language data

In linguistics and natural language processing  a corpus  pl   corpora  or text corpus is a dataset  consisting of  natively digital and older  digitalized  language resources  either annotated or unannotated 
Annotated  they have been used in corpus linguistics for statistical hypothesis testing  checking occurrences or validating linguistic rules within a specific language territory 


Overview edit 
A corpus may contain texts in a single language  monolingual corpus  or text data in multiple languages  multilingual corpus  
In order to make the corpora more useful for doing linguistic research  they are often subjected to a process known as annotation  An example of annotating a corpus is part of speech tagging  or POS tagging  in which information about each word s part of speech  verb  noun  adjective  etc   is added to the corpus in the form of tags  Another example is indicating the lemma  base  form of each word  When the language of the corpus is not a working language of the researchers who use it  interlinear glossing is used to make the annotation bilingual 
Some corpora have further structured levels of analysis applied  In particular  smaller corpora may be fully parsed  Such corpora are usually called Treebanks or Parsed Corpora  The difficulty of ensuring that the entire corpus is completely and consistently annotated means that these corpora are usually smaller  containing around one to three million words  Other levels of linguistic structured analysis are possible  including annotations for morphology  semantics and pragmatics 

Applications edit 
Corpora are the main knowledge base in corpus linguistics  Other notable areas of application include 

Language technology  natural language processing  computational linguistics
The analysis and processing of various types of corpora are also the subject of much work in computational linguistics  speech recognition and machine translation  where they are often used to create hidden Markov models for part of speech tagging and other purposes  Corpora and frequency lists derived from them are useful for language teaching  Corpora can be considered as a type of foreign language writing aid as the contextualised grammatical knowledge acquired by non native language users through exposure to authentic texts in corpora allows learners to grasp the manner of sentence formation in the target language  enabling effective writing            
Machine translation
Multilingual corpora that have been specially formatted for side by side comparison are called aligned parallel corpora  There are two main types of parallel corpora which contain texts in two languages  In a translation corpus  the texts in one language are translations of texts in the other language  In a comparable corpus  the texts are of the same kind and cover the same content  but they are not translations of each other             To exploit a parallel text  some kind of text alignment identifying equivalent text segments  phrases or sentences  is a prerequisite for analysis  Machine translation algorithms for translating between two languages are often trained using parallel fragments comprising a first language corpus and a second language corpus  which is an element for element translation of the first language corpus            
Philologies
Text corpora are also used in the study of historical documents  for example in attempts to decipher ancient scripts  or in Biblical scholarship  Some archaeological corpora can be of such short duration that they provide a snapshot in time  One of the shortest corpora in time may be the       year Amarna letters texts       BC   The corpus of an ancient city   for example the  K ltepe Texts  of Turkey   may go through a series of corpora  determined by their find site dates
