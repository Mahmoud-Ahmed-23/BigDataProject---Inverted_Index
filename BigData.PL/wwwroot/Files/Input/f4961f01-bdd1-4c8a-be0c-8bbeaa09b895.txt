Gemini  formerly known as Bard  is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by Google  Based on the large language model  LLM  of the same name  it was launched in      in response to the rise of OpenAI s ChatGPT  It was previously based on the LaMDA and PaLM LLMs 
LaMDA had been developed and announced in       but it was not released to the public out of an abundance of caution  OpenAI s launch of ChatGPT in November      and its subsequent popularity caught Google executives off guard  prompting a sweeping response in the ensuing months  After mobilizing its workforce  the company launched Bard in a limited capacity in March      before expanding to other countries in May  Bard took center stage during the      Google I O keynote in May and was upgraded to the Gemini LLM in December  In February       Bard and Duet AI  another artificial intelligence product from Google  were unified under the Gemini brand  coinciding with the launch of an Android app 
Gemini initially received lukewarm responses  It became the center of controversy in February       when social media users reported that it was generating historically inaccurate images of historical figures as people of color  with people commenting on its bias as  wokeness  


Background edit 
Further information  LaMDA        History
Google co founders Sergey Brin  L  and Larry Page  R  were summoned out of retirement to discuss Google s response to OpenAI s ChatGPT 
In November       OpenAI launched ChatGPT  a chatbot based on the GPT   family of large language models  LLMs                         ChatGPT gained worldwide attention  becoming a viral Internet sensation             Alarmed by ChatGPT s potential threat to Google Search  Google executives issued a  code red  alert  reassigning several teams to assist in the company s artificial intelligence  AI  efforts              Sundar Pichai  the CEO of Google and parent company Alphabet  was widely reported to have issued the alert  but Pichai later denied this to The New York Times              In a rare move  Google co founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin  who had stepped down from their roles as co CEOs of Alphabet in       attended emergency meetings with company executives to discuss Google s response to ChatGPT              Brin requested access to Google s code in February       for the first time in years             
Google had unveiled LaMDA  a prototype LLM  earlier in                               but it was not released to the public              When asked by employees at an all hands meeting whether LaMDA was a missed opportunity for Google to compete with ChatGPT  Pichai and Google AI chief Jeff Dean said that while the company had similar capabilities to ChatGPT  moving too quickly in that arena would represent a major  reputational risk  due to Google being substantially larger than OpenAI                          In January       Google Brain sister company DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis hinted at plans for a ChatGPT rival              and Google employees were instructed to accelerate progress on a ChatGPT competitor  intensively testing  Apprentice Bard  and other chatbots                          Pichai assured investors during Google s quarterly earnings investor call in February that the company had plans to expand LaMDA s availability and applications             

History edit 
Announcement edit 
On February          Google announced Bard  a generative artificial intelligence chatbot powered by LaMDA                                      Bard was first rolled out to a select group of         trusted testers               before a wide release scheduled at the end of the month                                      The project was overseen by product lead Jack Krawczyk  who described the product as a  collaborative AI service  rather than a search engine                          while Pichai detailed how Bard would be integrated into Google Search                                      Reuters calculated that adding ChatGPT like features to Google Search could cost the company         billion in additional expenses by       while research and consulting firm SemiAnalysis calculated that it would cost Google         billion              The technology was developed under the codename  Atlas               with the name  Bard  in reference to the Celtic term for a storyteller and chosen to  reflect the creative nature of the algorithm underneath                          
Multiple media outlets and financial analysts described Google as  rushing  Bard s announcement to preempt rival Microsoft s planned February   event unveiling its partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its Bing search engine in the form of Bing Chat  later rebranded as Microsoft Copilot                           as well as to avoid playing  catch up  to Microsoft                                      Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told The Verge   I want people to know that we made them dance               Tom Warren of The Verge and Davey Alba of Bloomberg News noted that this marked the beginning of another clash between the two Big Tech companies over  the future of search   after their six year  truce  expired in                               Chris Stokel Walker of The Guardian  Sara Morrison of Recode  and analyst Dan Ives of investment firm Wedbush Securities labeled this an AI arms race between the two                                     
After an  underwhelming  February   livestream in Paris showcasing Bard  Google s stock fell eight      percent  equivalent to a           billion loss in market value  and the YouTube video of the livestream was made private                                      Many viewers also pointed out an error during the demo in which Bard gives inaccurate information about the James Webb Space Telescope in response to a query                          Google employees criticized Pichai s  rushed  and  botched  announcement of Bard on Memgen  the company s internal forum              while Maggie Harrison of Futurism called the rollout  chaos   Pichai defended his actions by saying that Google had been  deeply working on AI for a long time   rejecting the notion that Bard s launch was a knee jerk reaction              Alphabet chairman John Hennessy acknowledged that Bard was not fully product ready  but expressed excitement at the technology s potential             
A week after the Paris livestream  Pichai asked employees to dedicate two to four hours to dogfood testing Bard              while Google executive Prabhakar Raghavan encouraged employees to correct any errors Bard makes              with        employees responding to Pichai s call to action              In the following weeks  Google employees roundly criticized Bard in internal messages  citing a variety of safety and ethical concerns and calling on company leaders not to launch the service  Prioritizing keeping up with competitors  Google executives decided to proceed with the launch anyway  overruling a negative risk assessment report conducted by its AI ethics team              After Pichai suddenly laid off        employees later that month due to slowing revenue growth  remaining workers shared memes and snippets of their humorous exchanges with Bard soliciting its  opinion  on the layoffs              Google employees began testing a more sophisticated version of Bard with larger parameters  dubbed  Big Bard   in mid March             

Launch edit 

      The logo for Bard
Google opened up early access for Bard on March           in a limited capacity  allowing users in the U S  and UK to join a waitlist  Unlike Microsoft s approach with Bing Chat  Bard was launched as a standalone web application featuring a text box and a disclaimer that the chatbot  may display inaccurate or offensive information that doesn t represent Google s views   Three responses are then provided to each question  with users prompted to submit feedback on the usefulness of each answer  Google vice presidents Sissie Hsiao and Eli Collins framed Bard as a complement to Google Search and stated that the company had not determined how to make the service profitable                                      Among those granted early access were those enrolled in Google s  Pixel Superfans  loyalty program              users of its Pixel and Nest devices  and Google One subscribers             
Bard is trained by third party contractors hired by Google  including Appen and Accenture workers  whom Business Insider and Bloomberg News reported were placed under extreme pressure  overworked  and underpaid                          Bard is also trained on data from publicly available sources  which Google disclosed by amending its privacy policy              Shortly after Bard s initial launch  Google reorganized the team behind Google Assistant  the company s virtual assistant  to focus on Bard instead              Google researcher Jacob Devlin resigned from the company after claiming that Bard had surreptitiously leveraged data from ChatGPT              Google denied the allegations              Meanwhile  a senior software engineer at the company published an internal memo warning that Google was falling behind in the AI  arms race   not to OpenAI but to independent researchers in open source communities              Pichai revealed on March    that the company intended to  upgrade  Bard by basing it on PaLM  a newer and more powerful LLM from Google  rather than LaMDA              The same day  Krawczyk announced that Google had added  math and logic capabilities  to Bard              Bard gained the ability to assist in coding in April  being compatible with more than    programming languages at launch                          Microsoft also began running advertisements in the address bar of a developer build of the Edge browser  urging users to try Bing whenever they visit the Bard web app               to Google reported that Google was working to integrate Bard into its ChromeOS operating system and Pixel devices                         

Updates edit 
Bard took center stage during the annual Google I O keynote in May                   with Pichai and Hsiao announcing a series of updates to Bard  including the adoption of PaLM    integration with other Google products and third party services  expansion to     countries  support for additional languages  and new features              In stark contrast to previous years  the Google Assistant was barely mentioned during the event              The expanded rollout did not include any nations in the European Union  EU   possibly reflecting concerns about compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation              Those with Google Workspace accounts also gained access to the service              Google attempted to launch Bard in the EU in June but was blocked by the Irish Data Protection Commission  who requested a  data protection impact assessment  from the company              Bard was launched in the region and Brazil the next month  adding support for dozens of new languages and introducing personalization and productivity features                          An invite only chatroom   server   on Discord was created in July  consisting of users who heavily used Bard  Over the next few months  the chatroom was flooded with comments questioning the usefulness of Bard             
Reflecting on Bard s launch in an interview with Wired in September  Pichai acknowledged that Google had been  cautious  to release LaMDA because of  the responsibility that comes with getting it right   commending OpenAI for ChatGPT s launch and firing back at Nadella s comment about  mak ing  Google dance               Google released a major update to the chatbot later that month  integrating it into many of its products through  extensions   adding a button to fact check AI generated responses through Google Search  and allowing users to share conversation threads              Google also introduced the  Google Extended  web crawler as part of its search engine s robots txt indexing file to allow web publishers to opt out of allowing Bard to scan them for training              Online users later discovered that Google Search was indexing Bard conversation threads on which users had enabled sharing  Google stated that this was an error and quickly moved to rectify the leaks             
In October  during the company s annual Made by Google event in which it announced the Pixel   series and the Pixel Watch    Hsiao unveiled  Assistant with Bard   an upgraded version of the Google Assistant which was deeply integrated with Bard  following in the footsteps of Amazon s approach with Alexa              When the U S  Copyright Office solicited public comment on potential new regulation on generative AI technologies  Google joined with OpenAI and Microsoft in arguing that the responsibility for generating copyrighted material lay with the user  not the developer              Accenture contractors voted to join the Alphabet Workers Union in November  in protest of suboptimal working conditions              while the company filed a lawsuit in the U S  District Court for the Northern District of California against a group of unidentified scammers who had been advertising malware disguised as a downloadable version of Bard

On December          Google announced Gemini  a multimodal and more powerful LLM touted as the company s  largest and most capable AI model                           A specially tuned version of the mid tier Gemini Pro was integrated into Bard  while the larger Gemini Ultra was set to power  Bard Advanced  in                               The Wall Street Journal reported that Bard was then averaging around          million monthly visitors              Google ended its contract with Appen in January                   while Bard gained the long awaited ability to generate images the next month  powered by Google Brain s Imagen   text to image model             
On February          Bard and Duet AI were unified under the Gemini brand  with a mobile app launched on Android and the service integrated into the Google app on iOS  On Android  users who downloaded the app saw Gemini replace Assistant as their device s default virtual assistant  though Assistant remained a standalone service                          Google also launched  Gemini Advanced with Ultra       available via a  Google One AI Premium  subscription               incorporated Gemini into its Messages app on Android                            and announced a partnership with Stack Overflow                           
Gemini again took center stage at the      Google I O keynote                            with traditionally emphasized topics such as Android    and the Pixel  a relegated to separate events the next day and prior week  respectively                                         Google announced Gemini integrations into a variety of products  including Android  Chrome  Photos  and Workspace               The Washington Post described the presentation as a  tsunami of new AI features                Gemini Advanced was upgraded to the  Gemini     Pro  language model  with Google previewing Gemini Live  a voice chat mode  and Gems  the ability to create custom chatbots                                         Beginning with the Pixel   series  Gemini replaced the Google Assistant as the default virtual assistant on Pixel devices               while Gemini Live debuted on the phones                            In February       Google introduced a feature for Gemini Advanced subscribers that can recall past chats and provide more tailored assistance based on previous interactions              

Name edit 
The name  Bard  was chosen to reflect the creative and storytelling nature of the underlying algorithm                Bard  is a term with Celtic origins  referring to a professional storyteller  poet  and singer composer who would often recite epics and histories  This name was fitting for an AI designed to generate human like text and engage in conversations 
Google s AI chatbot was initially launched as Bard in March                    The name was intended to be more approachable and less technical than some of Google s internal project names  However  in February       Bard was unified with another Google AI product  Duet AI  under a new brand name  Gemini               This rebranding aimed to signify a more comprehensive and integrated AI offering from Google  moving beyond a single chat interface to incorporate AI capabilities across various products and services  While the name Bard has been retired  it represents an important phase in the development of Google s conversational AI technology 
The name  Gemini  has historical roots in the Latin word for  twins   This connection extends to the prominent Gemini constellation  representing the mythological twins Castor and Pollux  known for their strong bond               The zodiac sign Gemini also carries associations with adaptability and communication  Furthermore  NASA s Project Gemini  a pivotal program involving two person spacecraft  served as another layer of inspiration for the name 
The selection of  Gemini  signifies the powerful collaboration of two major research teams  Brain and DeepMind  working in unison  much like twins  It also reflects the intended versatility in processing various forms of information and the ambitious technological leap it represents  echoing the innovation of NASA s Gemini missions  Before being named Gemini  it was known as Bard  a name that evoked the tradition of storytelling  poetry  and language 

Reception edit 
Critical response edit 
Gemini received mixed reviews upon its initial release               James Vincent of The Verge found it faster than ChatGPT and Bing Chat  but noted that the lack of Bing esque footnotes was  both a blessing and a curse               encouraging Google to be bolder when experimenting with AI               His colleague David Pierce was unimpressed by its uninteresting and sometimes inaccurate responses               adding that despite Google s insistence that Gemini was not a search engine  its user interface resembled that of one  which could cause problems for Google               Cade Metz of The New York Times described Gemini as  more cautious  than ChatGPT               while Shirin Ghaffary of Vox called it  dry and uncontroversial  due to the reserved nature of its responses              
The Washington Post columnist Geoffrey A  Fowler found Gemini a mixed bag  noting that it acted cautiously but could show Internet influenced bias               Writing for ZDNET  Sabrina Ortiz believed ChatGPT and Bing Chat were  more capable overall  in comparison to Gemini               while Wired journalist Lauren Goode found her conversation with Gemini  the most bizarre  of the three               After the introduction of extensions  The New York Times      Kevin Roose found the update underwhelming and  a bit of a mess                while Business Insider     s Lakshmi Varanasi found that Gemini often leaned more into flattery than facts              
In a    Minutes conversation with Hsiao  Google senior vice president James Manyika  and Pichai  CBS News correspondent Scott Pelley found Gemini  unsettling                Associate professor Ethan Mollick of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania was underwhelmed by its artistic ineptitude               The New York Times conducted a test with ChatGPT and Gemini regarding their ability to handle tasks expected of human assistants  and concluded that ChatGPT s performance was vastly superior to that of Gemini               NewsGuard  a tool that rates the credibility of news articles  found that Gemini was more skilled at debunking known conspiracy theories than ChatGPT               A report published by the Associated Press cautioned that Gemini and other chatbots were prone to generate  false and misleading information that threaten ed  to disenfranchise voters               

Image generation controversy edit 
Gemini s response when asked to  generate a picture of a U S  senator from the     s  in February       as shown by The Verge             
In February       social media users reported that Gemini was generating images that featured people of color and women in historically inaccurate contexts such as Vikings  Nazi soldiers  and the Founding Fathers and refusing prompts to generate images of white people  These images were derided on social media  including by conservatives and libertarians who cited them as evidence of Google s  wokeness                                          The business magnate Elon Musk  whose company xAI operates the chatbot Grok  was among those who criticized Google  denouncing its suite of products as biased and racist                                         Musk and other users targeted Krawczyk  resurfacing his past comments discussing race                            leading Krawczyk to withdraw from X and LinkedIn               The conservative leaning tabloid New York Post ran a cover story on the incident in the print edition of its newspaper                           
In response  Krawczyk said that Google was  working to improve these kinds of depictions immediately   and Google paused Gemini s ability to generate images of people                                         Raghavan released a lengthy statement addressing the controversy  explaining that Gemini had  overcompensate d   amid its efforts to strive for diversity and acknowledging that the images were  embarrassing and wrong                                          In an internal memo to employees  Pichai called the debacle offensive and unacceptable  promising structural and technical changes                                         Several employees in Google s trust and safety team were laid off days later                            Hassabis stated that Gemini s ability to generate images of people would be restored within two weeks                                         it was ultimately relaunched in late August  powered by its new Imagen   model                           
The market reacted negatively  with Google s stock falling by          percent               Pichai faced growing calls to resign  including from technology analysts Ben Thompson and Om Malik                                         House Republicans led by Jim Jordan subpoenaed Google  accusing the company of colluding with the Biden administration to censor speech                            In light of the fiasco and Google s overall response to OpenAI  Business Insider     s Hugh Langley and Lara O Reilly declared that Google was fast going  from vanguard to dinosaur                Bloomberg columnist Parmy Olson suggested that Google s  rushed  rollout of Gemini was the cause of its woes  not  wokeness                Martin Peers  writing for The Information  opined that Google needed a leader like Mark Zuckerberg to defuse the situation               Hugging Face scientist Sasha Luccioni and Surrey University professor Alan Woodward believed that the incident had  deeply embedded  roots in Gemini s training corpus and algorithms  making it difficult to rectify               Jeremy Kahn of Fortune called for researchers focused on safety and responsibility to work together to develop better guardrails               New York magazine contributor John Herrman wrote   It s a spectacular unforced error  a slapstick rake in the face moment  and a testament to how panicked Google must be by the rise of OpenAI and the threat of AI to its search business               

Advertisements edit 
During the      Summer Olympics in July  Google aired a commercial for Gemini entitled  Dear Sydney  depicting a father asking the chatbot to generate a fan letter to the star athlete Sydney McLaughlin Levrone for his young daughter  Similar to Apple s  Crush   commercial for the seventh generation iPad Pro  the advertisement drew heavy backlash online  with criticism for replacing authentic human expression and creativity with a computer                                         The Washington Post columnist Alexandra Petri lambasted the commercial as  missing the point                As a result  Google withdrew the commercial from NBC s rotation                           
Google aired two commercials during Super Bowl LIX in February       both promoting Gemini  The first  entitled     States     Stories   consisted of a national spot and    regional spots showcasing how small businesses in each U S  state leverage Gemini in Google Workspace                            Social media users noticed a factual error in Wisconsin s spot regarding gouda cheese  prompting Google to edit out the incorrect statistic                                         while The Verge claimed that Google had  faked  some of Gemini s output in the same commercial by plagiarizing text on the web                                         Garett Sloane of Ad Age commented that these blunders illustrated the risks of advertising AI technology               The other commercial was entitled  Dream Job  and featured a father using Gemini on his Pixel   to prepare for a job interview  Google also ran a third commercial entitled  Party Blitz  online  in which a man  attempts to impress his girlfriend s family by using Gemini  on his Pixel    to become a football expert                                         

Other incidents edit 
In the aftermath of the image generation controversy  some users began accusing Gemini s text responses of being biased toward the left  In one such example that circulated online  Gemini said that it was  difficult to say definitively  whether Musk or the Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler had more negatively affected society                            Others users reported that Gemini tended to promote left wing politicians and causes such as affirmative action and abortion rights while refusing to promote right wing figures  meat consumption  and fossil fuels                                         The Wall Street Journal     s editorial board wrote that Gemini s  apparently ingrained woke biases  were  fueling a backlash toward AI on the political right  which is joining the left in calling for more regulation               
Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology junior minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar alleged that Google had violated the country s Information Technology Rules by refusing to summarize an article by the right wing news website OpIndia               and for saying that some experts described Prime Minister Narendra Modi s policies as fascist               In France  Google was fined      million by the competition regulator Autorit  de la concurrence under the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market  in part due to its cited failure to inform local news publishers of when their content was used for Gemini s training               The U S  State media broadcaster Voice of America accused Gemini of  parroting  Chinese propaganda              
In November       CBS News reported that Gemini had responded to a college student in Michigan asking for help with homework in a threatening manner  Google blamed the incident on hallucination and took  action to prevent similar outputs from occurring
