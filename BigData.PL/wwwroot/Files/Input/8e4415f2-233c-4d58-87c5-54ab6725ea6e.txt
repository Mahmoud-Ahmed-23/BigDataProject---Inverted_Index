Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station  abbreviated as TMI  is a shut down nuclear power plant on Three Mile Island     a      in Pennsylvania on the Susquehanna River just south of Harrisburg  It has two separate units  TMI    owned by Constellation Energy  and TMI    owned by EnergySolutions             
The plant was the site of the most significant accident in United States commercial nuclear energy when  on March           TMI   suffered a partial meltdown  According to the U S  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  report  the accident resulted in no deaths or injuries to plant workers or in nearby communities             Follow up epidemiology studies did not find causality between the accident and any increase in cancers                                                One work related death has occurred on site during decommissioning             
The reactor core of TMI   has since been removed from the site  but the site has not been fully decommissioned              In July       Amergen Energy  now Exelon Generation  agreed to purchase TMI   from General Public Utilities for      million             
The plant was originally built by General Public Utilities Corporation  later renamed GPU Incorporated              The plant was operated by Metropolitan Edison Company  Met Ed   a subsidiary of the GPU Energy division  In       GPU Inc  merged with FirstEnergy Corporation              On December           FirstEnergy transferred Unit   s license to EnergySolutions  subsidiary  TMI   Solutions  after receiving approval from the NRC             
Exelon was operating Unit   at a financial loss since                   In       the company said it would consider ceasing operations at Unit   because of high costs unless there was action from the Pennsylvania government                          Unit   officially shut down at noon on September                      
Unit   decommissioning was expected to be completed in      and would have cost      billion                          but in September       Constellation Energy  the owner of the Unit  announced plans to invest      billion to bring the facility back online  The plant is expected to resume operations in                   The entirety of the plant s energy output will be sold to Microsoft Corporation  Microsoft entered into a    year agreement to purchase as much electricity as possible from the plant  which will support the company s growing energy needs for its expanding network of data centers             
Unit    which has been dormant since the accident in       is expected to close in                  


Emergency zones and nearby population edit 
The NRC defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants  a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of    miles          km   concerned primarily with exposure to  and inhalation of  airborne radioactive contamination  and an ingestion pathway zone of about    miles          km   concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity             
The      U S  population within    miles          km  of Three Mile Island was          an increase of      percent in a decade  according to an analysis of U S  Census data  The      U S  population within    miles          km  was            an increase of      percent since       Cities within    miles include Harrisburg     miles to city center   York     miles to city center   and Lancaster     miles to city center              

Electricity production edit 
During its last full year of operation in       Three Mile Island generated       GWh of electricity  In that same year  electricity from nuclear power produced approximately     of the total electricity generated in Pennsylvania       TWh nuclear of     TWh total   with Three Mile Island Generating Station contributing approximately    to the statewide total generation  In      electrical generating facilities in the state of Pennsylvania generated approximately     TWh of total electricity

Three Mile Island Unit   edit 
The Three Mile Island Unit   is a pressurized water reactor designed by Babcock  amp  Wilcox with a net generating capacity of          MWe  The initial construction cost for TMI   was US     million  equal to       billion in      dollars              Unit   first came online on April           and began commercial operations on September                      TMI   was licensed to operate for    years from its first run  and in       its license was extended by    years  which means it could have operated until April                                  

TMI   had a closed cycle cooling system for its main condenser using two natural draft cooling towers  Makeup water was drawn from the river to replace the water lost via evaporation in the cooling towers  Once through the cooling towers  river water was used in the service water system  cooling auxiliary components and removing decay heat when the reactor was shut down  On February           TMI   went offline for refueling  It was brought back online on October          after public opposition  several federal court injunctions  and some technical and regulatory complications   more than six years after it initially went offline             September      photo of Three Mile Island and Goldsboro  Pennsylvania
Unit   was scheduled to be shut down by September      after Exelon announced they did not receive any commitments for subsidies from the state  rendering Exelon financially unable to continue operating the reactor                          TMI   was shut down on September                       but may be brought back  The CEO of Constellation Energy  the owner of Unit    says the reactor is in  excellent shape   and estimated that it would go online within three years of committing to a restart  As of          update      Constellation is conducting tests for a potential decision to reopen             

Incidents edit 
In February       a man drove his car past a checkpoint at the TMI nuclear plant  then broke through an entry gate  He eventually crashed the car through a secure door and entered the Unit   turbine building  The intruder  who had a history of mental illness  hid in the turbine building and was apprehended after four hours             
During and following the September          attacks  there was a concern that United Airlines Flight    was headed towards Three Mile Island  On that day  the NRC placed all of the nation s nuclear power plants into the highest level of security  United Flight    crashed into a field  present day Flight    National Memorial  about     miles           km  west of Three Mile Island in Stonycreek Township  just outside Shanksville  Pennsylvania  with its actual target believed to have been Washington  D C

On November           a release of radioactivity occurred inside the containment building of TMI   while workers were cutting pipes  Exelon Corporation stated to the public that  A monitor at the temporary opening cut into the containment building wall to allow the new steam generators to be moved inside showed a slight increase in a reading and then returned to normal  Approximately    employees were treated for mild radiation exposure               As of November                       update       it was believed that no radiation escaped the containment building and the public was not in any danger      citation needed      The inside airborne contamination was caused by a change in air pressure inside the containment building that dislodged small irradiated particles in the reactor piping system  Some of the particles became airborne inside the building and were detected by an array of monitors in place to detect such material  The air pressure change occurred when inside building ventilation fans were started to support outage activities  The site modified the ventilation system to prevent future air pressure changes  Work continued on the project the following day  On January           TMI   was brought back online             

Material handling accident edit 
On September           a contractor from Alabama was fatally injured while unloading equipment from a truck  Fire and emergency medical personnel from Londonderry Township were dispatched and declared the contractor dead on arrival  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said the injury was work related  and the contractor was outside the radiological controlled area

Accident edit

Main article  Three Mile Island accident
On March           a cooling system malfunction caused a partial meltdown of the reactor core  This loss of coolant accident resulted in the release of an estimated        curies            PBq  of radioactive krypton    gas  with an approximate half life of    years   and less than    curies           GBq  of the especially hazardous iodine      with a half life of around   days   into the surrounding environment            
Nearly   million people were exposed to radiation from the accident              A review by the World Nuclear Association concluded that no deaths  injuries or adverse health effects resulted from the accident              and a report by Columbia University epidemiologist Maureen Hatch confirmed this finding                         Because of the health concerns  the Pennsylvania Department of Health kept a registry of more than        people that lived within   miles           km  of TMI at the time of the accident  The registry was kept for nearly    years until       when no evidence was found of unusual health effects              Further epidemiology studies have not shown any increase in cancer as a result of the accident                                     However  almost     million was paid in insurance settlements to people who then agreed not to discuss their injuries in ongoing litigation             
Unit   has not been operational since the accident occurred             
The New York Times reported on August              years after the accident  that the cleanup had finished  According to the United States NRC      million gallons of waste water had been removed             
The incident was widely publicized internationally  and had far reaching effects on public opinion  particularly in the United States  The China Syndrome  a movie about a nuclear disaster  which was released    days before the incident and received a glowing reception from the movie going public  became a blockbuster hit             

Unit   Generator edit 
On January           officials at the NRC announced the electrical generator from the damaged Unit   reactor at TMI will be used at Shearon Harris Nuclear Plant in New Hill  North Carolina  The generator was transported in two parts  weighing a combined     tons  It was refurbished and installed during a refueling outage at Shearon Harris NPP in November                  

Post accident edit 
Exelon Corporation was created in October      by the merger of PECO Energy Company and Unicom  of Philadelphia  Pennsylvania and Chicago  Illinois respectively              Unicom owned Commonwealth Edison  The PECO share in AmerGen was acquired by Exelon during late       Exelon acquired British Energy s share in AmerGen in                   and transferred Unit   under the direct ownership and operation of its Exelon Nuclear business unit                          According to Exelon Corporation   many people are surprised when they learn that Three Mile Island is still making electricity  enough to power         households  from its undamaged and fully functional reactor unit                Exelon viewed the plant s economics of     MWh as challenging due to the low price of natural gas at     MWh  As of       the average price of electricity in the area was     MWh             

Closure edit

On June           Exelon Generation  the owners of Three Mile Island s Unit    sent to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission a formal notice of its intention to shut down the plant on September                       unless the Pennsylvania legislature rescued the nuclear industry  which was struggling to compete as newfound natural gas resources drove down electricity prices              Exelon Generation s Senior Vice President Bryan Hanson noted that once Three Mile Island was closed  it could never be reopened for use again              Hanson explicitly stated the reason for the shutdown is because of the unprofitability of Unit    Unit   has lost the company over      million over the last half decade despite it being one of Exelon s best performing power plants 
About    state legislators signed the industry inspired Nuclear Caucus but made no financial commitments             
In April       Exelon stated it would cost      billion over nearly    years to completely decommission Unit                Unit   closed on September          
In       Unit   was transferred to Constellation Energy following separation from Exelon  Unit   was also transferred to TriArtisan ES Partners  LLC   following their acquisition of EnergySolutions 

Decommissioning edit 
This section needs to be updated  Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information    September      
In       TMI   Solutions begun active cleanup of the reactor site  A temporary building is planned to contain radioactive materials before being shipped to a disposal area  Remotely operated equipment is planned to take a large part in decommissioning due to radioactivity concerns  Originally TMI   Solutions planned to finish decommissioning in       but is now projected to finish by                  
Following the TMI   accident in       approximately     of the fuel and damaged core debris was removed from the reactor vessel and associated systems and shipped to the Idaho National Laboratory near Idaho Falls  Idaho  Since       when the initial cleanup of the plant was completed  TMI   has been in a condition known as Post Defueling Monitored Storage  PDMS  and is under constant monitoring to ensure the plant s safety and stability  The remaining    of residual fuel that still remains at the site is planned to be removed by                  
The cost of decommissioning a closed nuclear reactor and related structures at Three Mile Island is estimated at      million             

Reopening and Microsoft partnership edit 
On September           citing a resurgence in the need for nuclear generated carbon free electricity  Constellation Energy announced plans to reopen Three Mile Island Unit   in       It will be renamed the Christopher M  Crane Clean Energy Center  in honor of former Exelon Corporation CEO Chris Crane   Crane  who started his career in nuclear energy as a Reactor Operator with ComEd  retired from Exelon in December      and died on April                                  
As part of this plan  Microsoft entered into a    year agreement to purchase power from the facility once it resumes operation  aiming to support the energy demands of its expanding AI data centers  Constellation Energy will invest      billion into the plant s upgrades  pending regulatory approval             
When TMI   was shut down in       safety diesel fuel tanks were drilled into and filled with concrete to eliminate chances of leaks into the environment  Transformers had their oil drained and then were scrapped as Exelon saw little chance for reopening  Thus  replacement transformers for the reopening of TMI   cost      million in       The steam generators were drained and exposed to air during decommissioning  but were found to be in good condition during inspections in       During inspections  Constellation found no parts that would require so much time to have to push back the scheduled opening past                  

Seismic risk edit 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission s estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Three Mile Island was   in         according to an NRC study published in August
