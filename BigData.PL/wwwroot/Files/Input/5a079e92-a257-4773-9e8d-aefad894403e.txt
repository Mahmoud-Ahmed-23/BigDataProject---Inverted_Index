In this tutorial  we       ll guide you through the basics of MongoDB  from setting up your environment to performing CRUD operations and optimizing performance  Whether you       re new to databases or looking to expand your skills  this step by step guide to MongoDB will help you harness the full potential of MongoDB  Let       s get started and explore how MongoDB can revolutionize the way you handle data  But before this let       s have a quick look in MongoDB 

What is MongoDB 
As we already explain that  MongoDB is a document oriented NoSQL database system that provides high scalability  flexibility  and performance  Unlike standard relational databases  MongoDB stores data in a JSON document structure form  This makes it easy to operate with dynamic and unstructured data and MongoDB is an open source and cross platform database System   
Database

Database is a container for collections  
Each database gets its own set of files  
A single MongoDB server typically has multiple databases 

Collection

Collection is a group of documents  
Collection is equivalent to RDBMS table 
A collection consist inside a single database  
Collections do not enforce a schema  
A Collection can have different fields within a Documents 

Why Use MongoDB 
 Document Oriented Storage   Data is stored in the form of JSON documents  

Index on any attribute  Indexing in MongoDB allows for faster data retrieval by creating a searchable structure on selected attributes  optimizing query performance 
Replication and high availability  MongoDB       s replica sets ensure data redundancy by maintaining multiple copies of the data  providing fault tolerance and continuous availability even in case of server failures 
Auto Sharding  Auto sharding in MongoDB automatically distributes data across multiple servers  enabling horizontal scaling and efficient handling of large datasets 
Big Data and Real time Application  When dealing with massive datasets or applications requiring real time data updates  MongoDB       s flexibility and scalability prove advantageous 
Rich queries  MongoDB supports complex queries with a variety of operators  allowing you to retrieve  filter  and manipulate data in a flexible and powerful manner 
Fast in place updates  MongoDB efficiently updates documents directly in their place  minimizing data movement and reducing write overhead 
Professional support by MongoDB  MongoDB offers expert technical support and resources to help users with any issues or challenges they may encounter during their database operations 
Internet of Things  IoT  Applications  Storing and analyzing sensor data with its diverse formats often aligns well with MongoDB       s document structure
