							Former President Hosni Mubarak and his Minister of Interior Habib El Adly may yet again face trial over the killing of protestors during the    January      uprising 
A fact finding committee formed by President Mohamed Morsy has ordered the public prosecution to refer the case back to the same court that already sentenced Mubarak and El Adly to life in prison  but which acquitted all six assistant interior ministers 
The committee said the court had made a serious error in that it only examined the events taking place in Tahrir Square and ignored clashes in the rest of Cairo and in    other governorates 
Lawyers Ahmed Heshmat and Ahmed Ragheb  both members of the committee  confirmed that the committee ordered the case reopened 
Mubarak and El Adly were sentenced to life in prison on   June  They were not convicted of killing protestors  however  but rather for failing to protect them 
El Adly s six aides were all acquitted as the court ruled that only their bosses were culpable 
The sentence sparked demonstrations in Tahrir Square  and all over the country  with protestors calling for Mubarak to receive the death penalty 
Mubarak and El Adly have both filed for appeal  Their appeal is scheduled for December of this year and will not be affected by the committee s decision 
Reopening the case cannot result in a reduced sentence for the pair  They have already been convicted of wrong doing in one area of the case and the trial will be concerned with other areas  Their sentence can be extended  however 
The former president and his interior minister are now accused of killing about       protestors all over Egypt in the period between    January and    February of last year  when the popular uprising forced Mubarak to step down
