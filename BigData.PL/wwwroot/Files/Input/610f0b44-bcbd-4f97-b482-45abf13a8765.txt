A formal language  which comprises a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output  Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms 

Prolog
A logic programming language associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics                                          Prolog has its roots in first order logic  a formal logic  and unlike many other programming languages  Prolog is intended primarily as a declarative programming language  the program logic is expressed in terms of relations  represented as facts and rules  A computation is initiated by running a query over these relations              

propositional calculus
Also propositional logic  statement logic  sentential calculus  sentential logic  and zeroth order logic 
A branch of logic which deals with propositions  which can be true or false  and argument flow  Compound propositions are formed by connecting propositions by logical connectives  The propositions without logical connectives are called atomic propositions  Unlike first order logic  propositional logic does not deal with non logical objects  predicates about them  or quantifiers  However  all the machinery of propositional logic is included in first order logic and higher order logics  In this sense  propositional logic is the foundation of first order logic and higher order logic

Q edit 


Q learning
A model free reinforcement learning algorithm for learning the value of an action in a particular state 

qualification problem
In philosophy and artificial intelligence  especially knowledge based systems   the qualification problem is concerned with the impossibility of listing all of the preconditions required for a real world action to have its intended effect                            It might be posed as how to deal with the things that prevent me from achieving my intended result  It is strongly connected to  and opposite the ramification side of  the frame problem              

quantifier
In logic  quantification specifies the quantity of specimens in the domain of discourse that satisfy an open formula  The two most common quantifiers mean  for all  and  there exists   For example  in arithmetic  quantifiers allow one to say that the natural numbers go on forever  by writing that for all n  where n is a natural number   there is another number  say  the successor of n  which is one bigger than n

regression analysis
A set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable  often called the outcome or response variable  or label in machine learning  and one or more error free independent variables  often called regressors  predictors  covariates  explanatory variables  or features   The most common form of regression analysis is linear regression  in which one finds the line  or a more complex linear combination  that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion 

regularization

reinforcement learning  RL 
An area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward  Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms  alongside supervised and unsupervised learning  It differs from supervised learning in that labelled input output pairs need not be presented  and sub optimal actions need not be explicitly corrected  Instead the focus is finding a balance between exploration  of uncharted territory  and exploitation  of current knowledge               

reinforcement learning from human feedback  RLHF 
A technique that involve training a  reward model  to predict how humans rate the quality of generated content  and then training a generative AI model to satisfy this reward model via reinforcement learning  It can be used for example to make the generative AI model more truthful or less harmful

reservoir computing
A framework for computation that may be viewed as an extension of neural networks               Typically an input signal is fed into a fixed  random  dynamical system called a reservoir and the dynamics of the reservoir map the input to a higher dimension  Then a simple readout mechanism is trained to read the state of the reservoir and map it to the desired output  The main benefit is that training is performed only at the readout stage and the reservoir is fixed  Liquid state machines              and echo state networks              are two major types of reservoir computing

semantics
In programming language theory  semantics is the field concerned with the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of programming languages  It does so by evaluating the meaning of syntactically valid strings defined by a specific programming language  showing the computation involved  In such a case that the evaluation would be of syntactically invalid strings  the result would be non computation  Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language  This can be shown by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program  or an explanation of how the program will be executed on a certain platform  hence creating a model of computation

Turing test
A test of a machine s ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to  or indistinguishable from  that of a human  developed by Alan Turing in       Turing proposed that a human evaluator would judge natural language conversations between a human and a machine designed to generate human like responses  The evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation is a machine  and all participants would be separated from one another  The conversation would be limited to a text only channel such as a computer keyboard and screen so the result would not depend on the machine s ability to render words as speech               If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine from the human  the machine is said to have passed the test  The test results do not depend on the machine s ability to give correct answers to questions  only how closely its answers resemble those a human would give 

type system
In programming languages  a set of rules that assigns a property called type to the various constructs of a computer program  such as variables  expressions  functions  or modules               These types formalize and enforce the otherwise implicit categories the programmer uses for algebraic data types  data structures  or other components  e g   string    array of float    function returning boolean    The main purpose of a type system is to reduce possibilities for bugs in computer programs              by defining interfaces between different parts of a computer program  and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way  This checking can happen statically  at compile time   dynamically  at run time   or as a combination of static and dynamic checking  Type systems have other purposes as well  such as expressing business rules  enabling certain compiler optimizations  allowing for multiple dispatch  providing a form of documentation  etc
