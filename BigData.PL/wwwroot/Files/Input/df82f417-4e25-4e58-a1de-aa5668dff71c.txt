Computer science is the study of computation  information  and automation                                   Computer science spans theoretical disciplines  such as algorithms  theory of computation  and information theory  to applied disciplines  including the design and implementation of hardware and software                                    
Algorithms and data structures are central to computer science            
The theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them  The fields of cryptography and computer security involve studying the means for secure communication and preventing security vulnerabilities  Computer graphics and computational geometry address the generation of images  Programming language theory considers different ways to describe computational processes  and database theory concerns the management of repositories of data  Human computer interaction investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact  and software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing software  Areas such as operating systems  networks and embedded systems investigate the principles and design behind complex systems  Computer architecture describes the construction of computer components and computer operated equipment  Artificial intelligence and machine learning aim to synthesize goal orientated processes such as problem solving  decision making  environmental adaptation  planning and learning found in humans and animals  Within artificial intelligence  computer vision aims to understand and process image and video data  while natural language processing aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data 
The fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated                                                          The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz             developed logic in a binary number system and has been called the  founder of computer science              
Charles Babbage is sometimes referred to as the  father of computing               
Ada Lovelace published the first algorithm intended for processing on a computer              
The earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern digital computer  Machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the abacus have existed since antiquity  aiding in computations such as multiplication and division  Algorithms for performing computations have existed since antiquity  even before the development of sophisticated computing equipment             
Wilhelm Schickard designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator in                   In       Gottfried Leibniz demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator  called the Stepped Reckoner              Leibniz may be considered the first computer scientist and information theorist  because of various reasons  including the fact that he documented the binary number system  In       Thomas de Colmar launched the mechanical calculator industry     note        when he invented his simplified arithmometer  the first calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment  Charles Babbage started the design of the first automatic mechanical calculator  his Difference Engine  in       which eventually gave him the idea of the first programmable mechanical calculator  his Analytical Engine              He started developing this machine in       and  in less than two years  he had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern computer                A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the Jacquard loom              making it infinitely programmable      note        In       during the translation of a French article on the Analytical Engine  Ada Lovelace wrote  in one of the many notes she included  an algorithm to compute the Bernoulli numbers  which is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer              Around       Herman Hollerith invented the tabulator  which used punched cards to process statistical information  eventually his company became part of IBM  Following Babbage  although unaware of his earlier work  Percy Ludgate in      published             the  nd of the only two designs for mechanical analytical engines in history  In       the Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres Quevedo published his Essays on Automatics              and designed  inspired by Babbage  a theoretical electromechanical calculating machine which was to be controlled by a read only program  The paper also introduced the idea of floating point arithmetic                          In       to celebrate the    th anniversary of the invention of the arithmometer  Torres presented in Paris the Electromechanical Arithmometer  a prototype that demonstrated the feasibility of an electromechanical analytical engine              on which commands could be typed and the results printed automatically              In       one hundred years after Babbage s impossible dream  Howard Aiken convinced IBM  which was making all kinds of punched card equipment and was also in the calculator business             to develop his giant programmable calculator  the ASCC Harvard Mark I  based on Babbage s Analytical Engine  which itself used cards and a central computing unit  When the machine was finished  some hailed it as  Babbage s dream come true              

During the     s  with the development of new and more powerful computing machines such as the Atanasoff Berry computer and ENIAC  the term computer came to refer to the machines rather than their human predecessors              As it became clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations  the field of computer science broadened to study computation in general  In       IBM founded the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory at Columbia University in New York City  The renovated fraternity house on Manhattan s West Side was IBM s first laboratory devoted to pure science  The lab is the forerunner of IBM s Research Division  which today operates research facilities around the world              Ultimately  the close relationship between IBM and Columbia University was instrumental in the emergence of a new scientific discipline  with Columbia offering one of the first academic credit courses in computer science in                   Computer science began to be established as a distinct academic discipline in the     s and early     s                          The world s first computer science degree program  the Cambridge Diploma in Computer Science  began at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory in       The first computer science department in the United States was formed at Purdue University in                   Since practical computers became available  many applications of computing have become distinct areas of study in their own rights See also  History of computing and History of informatics
Etymology and scope
See also  Informatics        Etymology
Although first proposed in                   the term  computer science  appears in a      article in Communications of the ACM             
in which Louis Fein argues for the creation of a Graduate School in Computer Sciences analogous to the creation of Harvard Business School in                   Louis justifies the name by arguing that  like management science  the subject is applied and interdisciplinary in nature  while having the characteristics typical of an academic discipline             
His efforts  and those of others such as numerical analyst George Forsythe  were rewarded  universities went on to create such departments  starting with Purdue in                   Despite its name  a significant amount of computer science does not involve the study of computers themselves  Because of this  several alternative names have been proposed              Certain departments of major universities prefer the term computing science  to emphasize precisely that difference  Danish scientist Peter Naur suggested the term datalogy              to reflect the fact that the scientific discipline revolves around data and data treatment  while not necessarily involving computers  The first scientific institution to use the term was the Department of Datalogy at the University of Copenhagen  founded in       with Peter Naur being the first professor in datalogy  The term is used mainly in the Scandinavian countries  An alternative term  also proposed by Naur  is data science  this is now used for a multi disciplinary field of data analysis  including statistics and databases 
In the early days of computing  a number of terms for the practitioners of the field of computing were suggested  albeit facetiously  in the Communications of the ACM turingineer  turologist  flow charts man  applied meta mathematician  and applied epistemologist              Three months later in the same journal  comptologist was suggested  followed next year by hypologist              The term computics has also been suggested              In Europe  terms derived from contracted translations of the expression  automatic information   e g   informazione automatica  in Italian  or  information and mathematics  are often used  e g  informatique  French   Informatik  German   informatica  Italian  Dutch   inform tica  Spanish  Portuguese   informatika  Slavic languages and Hungarian  or pliroforiki               which means informatics  in Greek  Similar words have also been adopted in the UK  as in the School of Informatics  University of Edinburgh                In the U S   however  informatics is linked with applied computing  or computing in the context of another domain              
A folkloric quotation  often attributed to but almost certainly not first formulated by Edsger Dijkstra  states that  computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes       note        The design and deployment of computers and computer systems is generally considered the province of disciplines other than computer science  For example  the study of computer hardware is usually considered part of computer engineering  while the study of commercial computer systems and their deployment is often called information technology or information systems  However  there has been exchange of ideas between the various computer related disciplines  Computer science research also often intersects other disciplines  such as cognitive science  linguistics  mathematics  physics  biology  Earth science  statistics  philosophy  and logic 
Computer science is considered by some to have a much closer relationship with mathematics than many scientific disciplines  with some observers saying that computing is a mathematical science              Early computer science was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians such as Kurt G del  Alan Turing  John von Neumann  R zsa P ter and Alonzo Church and there continues to be a useful interchange of ideas between the two fields in areas such as mathematical logic  category theory  domain theory  and algebra             
The relationship between computer science and software engineering is a contentious issue  which is further muddied by disputes over what the term  software engineering  means  and how computer science is defined              David Parnas  taking a cue from the relationship between other engineering and science disciplines  has claimed that the principal focus of computer science is studying the properties of computation in general  while the principal focus of software engineering is the design of specific computations to achieve practical goals  making the two separate but complementary disciplines             
The academic  political  and funding aspects of computer science tend to depend on whether a department is formed with a mathematical emphasis or with an engineering emphasis  Computer science departments with a mathematics emphasis and with a numerical orientation consider alignment with computational science  Both types of departments tend to make efforts to bridge the field educationally if not across all research 

Philosophy
Main article  Philosophy of computer science
Epistemology of computer science
Despite the word science in its name  there is debate over whether or not computer science is a discipline of science              mathematics              or engineering              Allen Newell and Herbert A  Simon argued in       Computer science is an empirical discipline  We would have called it an experimental science  but like astronomy  economics  and geology  some of its unique forms of observation and experience do not fit a narrow stereotype of the experimental method  Nonetheless  they are experiments  Each new machine that is built is an experiment  Actually constructing the machine poses a question to nature  and we listen for the answer by observing the machine in operation and analyzing it by all analytical and measurement means available              It has since been argued that computer science can be classified as an empirical science since it makes use of empirical testing to evaluate the correctness of programs  but a problem remains in defining the laws and theorems of computer science  if any exist  and defining the nature of experiments in computer science              Proponents of classifying computer science as an engineering discipline argue that the reliability of computational systems is investigated in the same way as bridges in civil engineering and airplanes in aerospace engineering              They also argue that while empirical sciences observe what presently exists  computer science observes what is possible to exist and while scientists discover laws from observation  no proper laws have been found in computer science and it is instead concerned with creating phenomena             
Proponents of classifying computer science as a mathematical discipline argue that computer programs are physical realizations of mathematical entities and programs that can be deductively reasoned through mathematical formal methods              Computer scientists Edsger W  Dijkstra and Tony Hoare regard instructions for computer programs as mathematical sentences and interpret formal semantics for programming languages as mathematical axiomatic systems             

Paradigms of computer science
A number of computer scientists have argued for the distinction of three separate paradigms in computer science  Peter Wegner argued that those paradigms are science  technology  and mathematics              Peter Denning s working group argued that they are theory  abstraction  modeling   and design              Amnon H  Eden described them as the  rationalist paradigm   which treats computer science as a branch of mathematics  which is prevalent in theoretical computer science  and mainly employs deductive reasoning   the  technocratic paradigm   which might be found in engineering approaches  most prominently in software engineering   and the  scientific paradigm   which approaches computer related artifacts from the empirical perspective of natural sciences              identifiable in some branches of artificial intelligence              
Computer science focuses on methods involved in design  specification  programming  verification  implementation and testing of human made computing systems

As a discipline  computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms and the limits of computation to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and software                         
CSAB  formerly called Computing Sciences Accreditation Board which is made up of representatives of the Association for Computing Machinery  ACM   and the IEEE Computer Society  IEEE CS              identifies four areas that it considers crucial to the discipline of computer science  theory of computation  algorithms and data structures  programming methodology and languages  and computer elements and architecture  In addition to these four areas  CSAB also identifies fields such as software engineering  artificial intelligence  computer networking and communication  database systems  parallel computation  distributed computation  human computer interaction  computer graphics  operating systems  and numerical and symbolic computation as being important areas of computer science             

Theoretical computer science
Main article  Theoretical computer science
Theoretical computer science is mathematical and abstract in spirit  but it derives its motivation from practical and everyday computation  It aims to understand the nature of computation and  as a consequence of this understanding  provide more efficient methodologies 

Theory of computation
Main article  Theory of computation
According to Peter Denning  the fundamental question underlying computer science is   What can be automated              Theory of computation is focused on answering fundamental questions about what can be computed and what amount of resources are required to perform those computations  In an effort to answer the first question  computability theory examines which computational problems are solvable on various theoretical models of computation  The second question is addressed by computational complexity theory  which studies the time and space costs associated with different approaches to solving a multitude of computational problems 
The famous P   NP  problem  one of the Millennium Prize Problems              is an open problem in the theory of computation

Main articles  Programming language theory and Formal methods
Programming language theory is a branch of computer science that deals with the design  implementation  analysis  characterization  and classification of programming languages and their individual features  It falls within the discipline of computer science  both depending on and affecting mathematics  software engineering  and linguistics  It is an active research area  with numerous dedicated academic journals 
Formal methods are a particular kind of mathematically based technique for the specification  development and verification of software and hardware systems              The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that  as in other engineering disciplines  performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design  They form an important theoretical underpinning for software engineering  especially where safety or security is involved  Formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testing since they help avoid errors and can also give a framework for testing  For industrial use  tool support is required  However  the high cost of using formal methods means that they are usually only used in the development of high integrity and life critical systems  where safety or security is of utmost importance  Formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of theoretical computer science fundamentals  in particular logic calculi  formal languages  automata theory  and program semantics  but also type systems and algebraic data types to problems in software and hardware specification and verification

Discoveries
The philosopher of computing Bill Rapaport noted three Great Insights of Computer Science             

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz s  George Boole s  Alan Turing s  Claude Shannon s  and Samuel Morse s insight  there are only two objects that a computer has to deal with in order to represent  anything       note       
All the information about any computable problem can be represented using only   and    or any other bistable pair that can flip flop between two easily distinguishable states  such as  on off    magnetized de magnetized    high voltage low voltage   etc   
See also  Digital physics
Alan Turing s insight  there are only five actions that a computer has to perform in order to do  anything  
Every algorithm can be expressed in a language for a computer consisting of only five basic instructions             
move left one location 
move right one location 
read symbol at current location 
print   at current location 
print   at current location 
See also  Turing machine
Corrado B hm and Giuseppe Jacopini s insight  there are only three ways of combining these actions  into more complex ones  that are needed in order for a computer to do  anything              
Only three rules are needed to combine any set of basic instructions into more complex ones 
sequence  first do this  then do that 
 selection  IF such and such is the case  THEN do this  ELSE do that 
repetition  WHILE such and such is the case  DO this 
The three rules of Boehm s and Jacopini s insight can be further simplified with the use of goto  which means it is more elementary than structured programming  
See also  Structured program theorem
Programming paradigms
Main article  Programming paradigm
Programming languages can be used to accomplish different tasks in different ways  Common programming paradigms include 

Functional programming  a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data  It is a declarative programming paradigm  which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements             
Imperative programming  a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program s state              In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands  an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform  Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates 
Object oriented programming  a programming paradigm based on the concept of  objects   which may contain data  in the form of fields  often known as attributes  and code  in the form of procedures  often known as methods  A feature of objects is that an object s procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated  Thus object oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another             
Service oriented programming  a programming paradigm that uses  services  as the unit of computer work  to design and implement integrated business applications and mission critical software programs 
Many languages offer support for multiple paradigms  making the distinction more a matter of style than of technical capabilities             

Research
Further information  List of computer science conferences and Category Computer science journals
Conferences are important events for computer science research  During these conferences  researchers from the public and private sectors present their recent work and meet  Unlike in most other academic fields  in computer science  the prestige of conference papers is greater than that of journal publications                          One proposed explanation for this is the quick development of this relatively new field requires rapid review and distribution of results  a task better handled by conferences than by journals

Notes


  In     

   The introduction of punched cards into the new engine was important not only as a more convenient form of control than the drums  or because programs could now be of unlimited extent  and could be stored and repeated without the danger of introducing errors in setting the machine by hand  it was important also because it served to crystallize Babbage s feeling that he had invented something really new  something much more than a sophisticated calculating machine   Bruce Collier      

  See the entry
 Computer science  on Wikiquote for the history of this quotation 

  The word  anything  is written in quotation marks because there are things that computers cannot do  One example is  to answer the question if an arbitrary given computer program will eventually finish or run forever  the Halting problem
