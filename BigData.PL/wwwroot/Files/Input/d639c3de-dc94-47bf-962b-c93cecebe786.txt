Human Compatible  Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control is a      non fiction book by computer scientist Stuart J  Russell  It asserts that the risk to humanity from advanced artificial intelligence  AI  is a serious concern despite the uncertainty surrounding future progress in AI  It also proposes an approach to the AI control problem 


Summary edit 
Russell begins by asserting that the standard model of AI research  in which the primary definition of success is getting better and better at achieving rigid human specified goals  is dangerously misguided  Such goals may not reflect what human designers intend  such as by failing to take into account any human values not included in the goals  If an AI developed according to the standard model were to become superintelligent  it would likely not fully reflect human values and could be catastrophic to humanity  Russell asserts that precisely because the timeline for developing human level or superintelligent AI is highly uncertain  safety research should be begun as soon as possible  as it is also highly uncertain how long it would take to complete such research 
Russell argues that continuing progress in AI capability is inevitable because of economic pressures  Such pressures can already be seen in the development of existing AI technologies such as self driving cars and personal assistant software  Moreover  human level AI could be worth many trillions of dollars  Russell then examines the current debate surrounding AI risk  He offers refutations to a number of common arguments dismissing AI risk and attributes much of their persistence to tribalism AI researchers may see AI risk concerns as an  attack  on their field  Russell reiterates that there are legitimate reasons to take AI risk concerns seriously and that economic pressures make continued innovation in AI inevitable 
Russell then proposes an approach to developing provably beneficial machines that focus on deference to humans  Unlike in the standard model of AI  where the objective is rigid and certain  this approach would have the AI s true objective remain uncertain  with the AI only approaching certainty about it as it gains more information about humans and the world  This uncertainty would  ideally  prevent catastrophic misunderstandings of human preferences and encourage cooperation and communication with humans  Russell concludes by calling for tighter governance of AI research and development as well as cultural introspection about the appropriate amount of autonomy to retain in an AI dominated world 

Russell s three principles edit 
Russell lists three principles to guide the development of beneficial machines  He emphasizes that these principles are not meant to be explicitly coded into the machines  rather  they are intended for human developers  The principles are as follows                                  

   The machine s only objective is to maximize the realization of human preferences 
   The machine is initially uncertain about what those preferences are 

   The ultimate source of information about human preferences is human behavior 
The  preferences  Russell refers to  are all encompassing  they cover everything you might care about  arbitrarily far into the future                                    Similarly   behavior  includes any choice between options                                   and the uncertainty is such that some probability  which may be quite small  must be assigned to every logically possible human preference                                  
Russell explores inverse reinforcement learning  in which a machine infers a reward function from observed behavior  as a possible basis for a mechanism for learning human preferences                                      

Reception edit 
Several reviewers agreed with the book s arguments  Ian Sample in The Guardian called it  convincing  and  the most important book on AI this year              Richard Waters of the Financial Times praised the book s  bracing intellectual rigour              Kirkus Reviews endorsed it as  a strong case for planning for the day when machines can outsmart us             
The same reviewers characterized the book as  wry and witty              or  accessible             due to its  laconic style and dry humour              Matthew Hutson of the Wall Street Journal said  Mr  Russell s exciting book goes deep while sparkling with dry witticisms              A Library Journal reviewer called it  The right guide at the right time             
James McConnachie of The Times wrote  This is not quite the popular book that AI urgently needs  Its technical parts are too difficult  and its philosophical ones too easy  But it is fascinating and significant             
By contrast  Human Compatible was criticized in its Nature review by David Leslie  an Ethics Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute  and similarly in a New York Times opinion essay by Melanie Mitchell  One point of contention was whether superintelligence is possible  Leslie states Russell  fails to convince that we will ever see the arrival of a  second intelligent species               and Mitchell doubts a machine could ever  surpass the generality and flexibility of human intelligence  without losing  the speed  precision  and programmability of a computer              A second disagreement was whether intelligent machines would naturally tend to adopt so called  common sense  moral values  In Russell s thought experiment about a geoengineering robot that  asphyxiates humanity to deacidify the oceans   Leslie  struggles to identify any intelligence   Similarly  Mitchell believes an intelligent robot would naturally tend to be  tempered by the common sense  values and social judgment without which general intelligence cannot exist                          
The book was longlisted for the      Financial Times McKinsey Award
