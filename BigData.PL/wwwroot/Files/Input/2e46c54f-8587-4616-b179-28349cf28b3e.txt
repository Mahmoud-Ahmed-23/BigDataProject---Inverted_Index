Basic notion of sameness in mathematics
This article is about the concept of equality in mathematics  For the symbol  see equals sign 



The equals sign  used to represent equality symbolically in an equation
In mathematics  equality is a relationship between two quantities or expressions  stating that they have the same value  or represent the same mathematical object                        Equality between A and B is written A             B  and pronounced  A equals B   In this equality  A and B are distinguished by calling them left hand side  LHS   and right hand side  RHS              Two objects that are not equal are said to be distinct            
Equality is often considered a kind of primitive notion  meaning  it is not formally defined  but rather informally said to be  a relation each thing bears to itself and nothing else   This characterization is notably circular   nothing else    This makes equality a somewhat slippery idea to pin down  Basic properties about equality like reflexivity  symmetry  and transitivity have been understood intuitively since at least the ancient Greeks  but were not symbolically stated as general properties of relations until the late   th century by Giuseppe Peano  Other properties like substitution and function application weren t formally stated until the development of symbolic logic 
There are generally two ways that equality is formalized in mathematics  through logic or through set theory  In logic  equality is a primitive predicate  a statement that may have free variables  with the reflexive property  called the law of identity   and the substitution property  From those  one can derive the rest of the properties usually needed for equality  After the foundational crisis in mathematics at the turn of the   th century  set theory  specifically Zermelo Fraenkel set theory  became the most common foundation of mathematics  In set theory  any two sets are defined to be equal if they have all the same members  This is called the axiom of extensionality

 in modern notation  From The Whetstone of Witte        by Robert Recorde 
Recorde s introduction of     And to avoid the tedious repetition of these words   is equal to  I will set as I do often in work use  a pair of parallels  or twin lines of one  the same  length  thus      because no   things can be more equal             
In English  the word equal is derived from the Latin aequ lis   like    comparable    similar    which itself stems from aequus   level    just               The word entered Middle English around the   th century  borrowed from Old French equalit   modern  galit               More generally  the interlingual synonyms of equal have been used more broadly throughout history  see        Geometry  
Before the   th century  there was no common symbol for equality  and equality was usually expressed with a word  such as aequales  aequantur  esgale  faciunt  ghelijck  or gleich  and sometimes by the abbreviated form aeq  or simply   x  e     x  e   and   x  e     x  e               Diophantus s use of   x  e      x  e    short for        sos  equals    in Arithmetica  c                 AD  is considered one of the first uses of an equals sign            
The sign    now universally accepted in mathematics for equality  was first recorded by Welsh mathematician Robert Recorde in The Whetstone of Witte         The original form of the symbol was much wider than the present form  In his book  Recorde explains his symbol as  Gemowe lines   from the Latin gemellus   twin    using two parallel lines to represent equality because he believed that  no two things could be more equal                        
Recorde s symbol was not immediately popular  After its introduction  it wasn t used again in print until          years later   in an anonymous Appendix in Edward Wright s English translation of Descriptio  by John Napier  It wasn t until      that it received more than general recognition in England  being adopted as the symbol for equality in a few influential works  Later used by several influential mathematicians  most notably  both Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz  and due to the prevalence of calculus at the time  it quickly spread throughout the rest of Europe

Reflexivity
For every a  one has a   a

The first three properties are generally attributed to Giuseppe Peano for being the first to explicitly state these as fundamental properties of equality in his Arithmetices principia                                 However  the basic notions have always existed  for example  in Euclid s Elements  c                 BC   he includes  common notions    Things that are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another   transitivity    Things that coincide with one another are equal to one another   reflexivity   along with some operation application properties for addition and subtraction              The operation application property was also stated in Peano s Arithmetices principia              however  it had been common practice in algebra since at least Diophantus  c                 AD               The substitution property is generally attributed to Gottfried Leibniz  c               and often called Leibniz s Law                         

Equations edit

Balance scales  used in algebra education to help students visualize how equations can be transformed to determine unknown values 
An equation is a symbolic equality of two mathematical expressions connected with an equals sign                  Algebra is the branch of mathematics concerned with equation solving  the problem of finding values of some variable  called unknown  for which the specified equality is true  Each value of the unknown for which the equation holds is called a solution of the given equation  also stated as satisfying the equation  For example  the equation 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
             
          
        
          x     
         
        x

        x
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle x   
  
 and 
  
    
      
        x
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle x   
  
 as its only solutions  The terminology is used similarly for equations with several unknowns              The set of solutions to an equation or system of equations is called its solution set             
In mathematics education  students are taught to rely on concrete models and visualizations of equations  including geometric analogies  manipulatives including sticks or cups  and  function machines  representing equations as flow diagrams  One method uses balance scales as a pictorial approach to help students grasp basic problems of algebra  The mass of some objects on the scale is unknown and represents variables  Solving an equation corresponds to adding and removing objects on both sides in such a way that the sides stay in balance until the only object remaining on one side is the object of unknown mass             
Often  equations are considered to be a statement  or relation  which can be true or false  For example  
  
    
      
         
         
         
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle       
  
 is true  and 
  
    
      
         
         
         
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle       
  
 is false  Equations with unknowns are cosidered conditionally true  for example  
  
    
      
        
          x
          
             
          
        
          x     
         
        x
         
         
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle x      x     
  
 is true when 
  
    
      
        x
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle x   
  
 or 
  
    
      
        x
         
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle x    
  
 and false otherwise              There are several different terminologies for this  In mathematical logic  an equation is a binary predicate  i e  a logical statement  that can have free variables  which satisfies certain properties              In computer science  an equation is defined as a boolean valued expression  or relational operator  which returns   and   for true and false respectively             

Identities edit 
Main article  Identity  mathematics 
An identity is an equality that is true for all values of its variables in a given domain                          An  equation  may sometimes mean an identity  but more often than not  it specifies a subset of the variable space to be the subset where the equation is true  An example is 
  
    
      
        
           
          
            x
             
             
          
           
        
        
           
          
            x
             
             
          
           
        
         
        
          x

      displaystyle  left x   right  left x   right  x      x    
  
 which is true for each real number 
  
    
      
        x
         
      
    
      displaystyle x  
  
 There is no standard notation that distinguishes an equation from an identity  or other use of the equality relation  one has to guess an appropriate interpretation from the semantics of expressions and the context              Sometimes  but not always  an identity is written with a triple bar  
  
    
      
        
           
          
            x
             
             
          
           
        
        
           
          
            x
             
             
          
           
        
          x     
        
          x
          
             
          
        
         
         
        x
         
          
      
    
      displaystyle  left x   right  left x   right  equiv x      x    
  
             This notation was introduced by Bernhard Riemann in his      Elliptische Funktionen lectures  published in                                           
Alternatively  identities may be viewed as an equality of functions  where instead of writing 
  
    
      
        f
         
        a
         
         
        g
         
        a
         
        
            xa  for all  xa  
        
        a
         
      
    
      displaystyle f a  g a   text  for all   a  
  
 one may simply write 
  
    
      
        f
         
        g
         
      
    
      displaystyle f g  
  
                         This is called the extensionality of functions                          In this sense  the operation application property refers to operators  operations on a function space  functions mapping between functions  like composition             or the derivative  commonly used in operational calculus              An identity can contain an functions as  unknowns   which can be solved for similarly to a regular equation  called a functional equation              A functional equation involving derivatives is called a differential equation             

Definitions edit 
Equations are often used to introduce new terms or symbols for constants  assert equalities  and introduce shorthand for complex expressions  which is called  equal by definition   and often denoted with

In mathematical logic  this is called an extension by definition  by equality  which is a conservative extension to a formal system              This is done by taking the equation defining the new constant symbol as a new axiom of the theory  The first recorded symbolic use of  Equal by definition  appeared in Logica Matematica        by Cesare Burali Forti  an Italian mathematician  Burali Forti  in his book  used the notation

History edit 
Roman copy in marble of a Greek bronze bust of Aristotle by Lysippos  c                BC  with modern alabaster mantle
Equality is often considered a primitive notion  informally said to be  a relation each thing bears to itself and to no other thing               This tradition can be traced back to at least          BC by Aristotle  in his Categories  he defines the notion of quantity in terms of a more primitive equality  distinct from identity or similarity   stating             

The most distinctive mark of quantity is that equality and inequality are predicated of it  Each of the aforesaid quantities is said to be equal or unequal  For instance  one solid is said to be equal or unequal to another  number  too  and time can have these terms applied to them  indeed can all those kinds of quantity that have been mentioned That which is not a quantity can by no means  it would seem  be termed equal or unequal to anything else  One particular disposition or one particular quality  such as whiteness  is by no means compared with another in terms of equality and inequality but rather in terms of similarity  Thus it is the distinctive mark of quantity that it can be called equal and unequal           translated by E  M  Edghill 
Aristotle had separate categories for quantities  number  length  volume  and qualities  temperature  density  pressure   now called intensive and extensive properties  The Scholastics  particularly Richard Swineshead and other Oxford Calculators in the   th century  began seriously thinking about kinematics and quantitative treatment of qualities  For example  two flames have the same heat intensity if they produce the same effect on water  e g  warming vs boiling   Since two intensities could be shown to be equal  and equality was considered the defining feature of quantities  it meant those intensities were quantifiable                         
Around the   th century  with the growth of modern logic  it became necessary to have a more concrete description of equality  With the rise of predicate logic due to the work of Gottlob Frege  logic shifted from being focused on classes of objects to being property based  This was followed by a movement for describing mathematics in logical foundations  called logicism  This trend lead to the axiomatization of equality through the law of identity and the substitution property especially in mathematical logic                         and analytic philosophy             
The precursor to the substitution property of equality was first formulated by Gottfried Leibniz in his Discourse on Metaphysics         stating  roughly  that  No two distinct things can have all properties in common   This has since broken into two principles  the substitution property  if 
  
    
      
        x
         
        y
         
      
    
      displaystyle x y  
  
 then any property of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
      displaystyle x 
  
 is a property of 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
      displaystyle y 
  
   and its converse  the identity of indiscernibles  if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
      displaystyle x 
  
 and 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
      displaystyle y 
  
 have all properties in common  then 
  
    
      
        x
         
        y
      
    
      displaystyle x y 
  
               Its introduction to logic  and first symbolic formulation is due to Bertrand Russell and Alfred Whitehead in their Principia Mathematica         who claim it follows from their axiom of reducibility  but credit Leibniz for the idea

Substitution property  Sometimes referred to as Leibniz s law              generally states that if two things are equal  then any property of one must be a property of the other  It can be stated formally as  for every a and b  and any formula 
  
    
      
          x d

  with a free variable x   if

        b

Function application is also sometimes included in the axioms of equality              but isn t necessary as it can be deduced from the other two axioms  and similarly for symmetry and transitivity   See        Derivations of basic properties  In first order logic  these are axiom schemas  usually  see below   each of which specify an infinite set of axioms              If a theory has a predicate that satisfies the Law of Identity and Substitution property  it is common to say that it  has equality   or is  a theory with equality              
The use of  equality  here somewhat of a misnomer in that any system with equality can be modeled by a theory without standard identity  and with indiscernibles                          Those two axioms are strong enough  however  to be isomorphic to a model with idenitity  that is  if a system has a predicate staisfying those axioms without standard equality  there is a model of that system with standard equality              This can be done by defining a new domain whose objects are the equivalence classes of the original  equality               If the relation is interpreted as equality  then those properties are enough  since if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
      displaystyle x 
  
 has all the same properties as

 and 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
      displaystyle x 
  
 has the property of being equal to 
  
    
      
        x
         
      
    
      displaystyle x  
  
 then 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
      displaystyle y 
  
 has the property of being equal to

      displaystyle x  
  
                        
As axioms  one can deduce from the first using universal instantiation  and the from second  given

        b

      displaystyle  phi  a   
  
 by using modus ponens twice  Alternatively  each of these may be included in logic as rules of inference              The first called  equality introduction   and the second  equality elimination               also called paramodulation   used by some theoretical computer scientists like John Alan Robinson in their work on resolution and automated theorem proving

In set theory edit 
Main article  Axiom of extensionalityTwo sets of polygons in Euler diagrams  These sets are equal since both have the same elements  even though the arrangement differs 
Set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies sets  which can be informally described as  collections of objects               Although objects of any kind can be collected into a set  set theory                  as a branch of mathematics                  is mostly concerned with those that are relevant to mathematics as a whole 
Sets are uniquely characterized by their elements  this means that two sets that have precisely the same elements are equal  they are the same set               In a formalized set theory  this is usually defined by an axiom called the Axiom of extensionality             
For example  using set builder notation  the following states that  The set of all integers 
  
    
      
         
        
          Z

The term extensionality  as used in  Axiom of Extensionality  has its roots in logic and grammar  cf  Extension  semantics    In grammar  intensional definition describes the necessary and sufficient conditions for a term to apply to an object  For example   A Platonic solid is a convex  regular polyhedron in three dimensional Euclidean space   An extensional definition instead lists all objects where the term applies  For example   A Platonic solid is one of the following  Tetrahedron  Cube  Octahedron  Dodecahedron  or Icosahedron   In logic  the extension of a predicate is the set of all objects for which the predicate is true              Further  the logical principle of extensionality judges two objects to objects to be equal if they satisfy the same external properties  Since  by the axiom  two sets are defined to be equal if they satisfy membership  sets are extentional             
Jos  Ferreir s credits Richard Dedekind for being the first to explicitly state the principle  although he does not assert it as a definition             

It very frequently happens that different things a  b  c    considered for any reason under a common point of view  are collected together in the mind  and one then says that they form a system S  one calls the things a  b  c    the elements of the system S  they are contained in S  conversely  S consists of these elements  Such a system S  or a collection  a manifold  a totality   as an object of our thought  is likewise a thing  it is completely determined when  for every thing  it is determined whether it is an element of S or not

Background edit 
Further information  Set theory        History
Ernst Zermelo  a contributor to modern Set theory  was the first to explicitly formalize set equality in his Zermelo set theory  now obsolete   by his Axiom der Bestimmtheit             
Around the turn of the   th century  mathematics faced several paradoxes and counter intuitive results  For example  Russell s paradox showed a contradiction of naive set theory  it was shown that the parallel postulate cannot be proved  the existence of mathematical objects that cannot be computed or explicitly described  and the existence of theorems of arithmetic that cannot be proved with Peano arithmetic  The result was a foundational crisis of mathematics             
The resolution of this crisis involved the rise of a new mathematical discipline called mathematical logic  which studies formal logic within mathematics  Subsequent discoveries in the   th century then stabilized the foundations of mathematics into a coherent framework valid for all mathematics  This framework is based on a systematic use of axiomatic method and on set theory  specifically Zermelo Fraenkel set theory  developed by Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel  This set theory  and set theory in general  is now considered the most common foundation of mathematics             

Set equality based on first order logic with equality edit 
In first order logic with equality  See        Axioms   the axiom of extensionality states that two sets that contain the same elements are the same set

The first two are given by the substitution property of equality from first order logic  the last is a new axiom of the theory  Incorporating half of the work into the first order logic may be regarded as a mere matter of convenience  as noted by Azriel L vy 

 The reason why we take up first order predicate calculus with equality is a matter of convenience  by this  we save the labor of defining equality and proving all its properties  this burden is now assumed by the logic              
Set equality based on first order logic without equality edit 
In first order logic without equality  two sets are defined to be equal if they contain the same elements  Then the axiom of extensionality states that two equal sets are contained in the same sets

Or  equivalently  one may choose to define equality in a way that mimics  the substitution property explicitly  as the conjunction of all atomic formuals

Numerical analysis is the study of constructive methods and algorithms to find numerical approximations  as opposed to symbolic manipulations  of solutions to problems in mathematical analysis  Especially those which cannot be solved analytically             
Calculations are likely to involve rounding errors and other approximation errors  Log tables  slide rules  and calculators produce approximate answers to all but the simplest calculations  The results of computer calculations are normally an approximation  expressed in a limited number of significant digits  although they can be programmed to produce more precise results

  between real numbers or other things  if precisely defined  is not an equivalence relation since it s not transitive  even if modeled as a fuzzy relation             
In computer science  equality is given by some relational operator  Real numbers are often approximated by floating point numbers  A sequence of some fixed number of digits of a given base  scaled by an integer exponent of that base               thus it is common to store an expression that denotes the real number as to not lose precision  However  the equality of two real numbers given by an expression is known to be undecidable  specifically  real numbers defined by expressions involving the integers  the basic arithmetic operations  the logarithm and the exponential function   In other words  there cannot exist any algorithm for deciding such an equality  see Richardson s theorem              

Equivalence relation edit

Graph of an example equivalence with   classes
An equivalence relation is a mathematical relation that generalizes the idea of similarity or sameness  It is defined on a set 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
      displaystyle X 
  
 as a binary relation 
  
    
      
          x   c 
      
    
      displaystyle  sim  
  
 that satisfies the three properties  reflexivity  symmetry  and transitivity  Reflexivity means that every element in 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
      displaystyle X 
  
 is equivalent to itself  
  
    
      
        a
          x   c 
        a
      
    
      displaystyle a sim a 
  
 for all 
  
    
      
        a
          x     
        X
      
    
      displaystyle a in X 
  
   Symmetry requires that if one element is equivalent to another  the reverse also holds  
  
    
      
        a
          x   c 
        b
        
          x  f  
        
        b
          x   c 
        a
      
    
      displaystyle a sim b implies b sim a 
  
   Transitivity ensures that if one element is equivalent to a second  and the second to a third  then the first is equivalent to the third  
  
    
      
        a
          x   c 
        b
      
    
      displaystyle a sim b 
  
 and 
  
    
      
        b
          x   c 
        c
        
          x  f  
        
        a
          x   c 
        c
      
    
      displaystyle b sim c implies a sim c 
  
               These properties are enough to partition a set into disjoint equivalence classes  Conversely  every partition defines an equivalence class             
The equivalence relation of equality is a special case  as  if restricted to a given set

  specifically  equality partitions a set into equivalence classes consisting of all singleton sets              Other equivalence relations  since they re less restrictive  generalize equality by identifying elements based on shared properties or transformations  such as congruence in modular arithmetic or similarity in geometry                         

Congruence relation edit 
Main article  Congruence relation
In abstract algebra  a congruence relation extends the idea of an equivalence relation to include the operation application property  That is  given a set 
  
    
      
        X
         
      
    
      displaystyle X  
  
 and a set of operations on 
  
    
      
        X
         
      
    
      displaystyle X  
  
 then a congruence relation 
  
    
      
          x   c 
      
    
      displaystyle  sim  
  
 has the property that 
  
    
      
        a
          x   c 
        b
        
          x  f  
        
        f
         
        a
         
          x   c 
        f
         
        b
         
      
    
      displaystyle a sim b implies f a  sim f b  
  
 for all operations 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
      displaystyle f 
  
  here  written as unary to avoid cumbersome notation  but 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
      displaystyle f 
  
 may be of any arity   A congruence relation on an algebraic structure such as a group  ring  or module is an equivalence relation that respects the operations defined on that structure             

Isomorphism edit 
Main article  Isomorphism
In mathematics  especially in abstract algebra and category theory  it is common to deal with objects that already have some internal structure   An isomorphism describes a kind of structure preserving correspondence between two objects  establishing them as essentially identical in their structure or properties                         
More formally  an isomorphism is a bijective mapping  or morphism  
  
    
      
        f
      
    
      displaystyle f 
  
 between two sets or structures 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
      displaystyle A 
  
 and 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
      displaystyle B 
  
 such that 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
      displaystyle f 
  
 and its inverse 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
              x     
             
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle f      
  
 preserve the operations  relations  or functions defined on those structures              This means that any operation or relation valid in 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
      displaystyle A 
  
 corresponds precisely to the operation or relation in 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
      displaystyle B 
  
 under the mapping  For example  in group theory  a group isomorphism 
  
    
      
        f
         
        G
          x  a  
        H
      
    
      displaystyle f G mapsto H 
  
 satisfies 
  
    
      
        f
         
        a
          x     
        b
         
         
        f
         
        a
         
          x     
        f
         
        b
         
      
    
      displaystyle f a b  f a  f b  
  
 for all elements 
  
    
      
        a
         
        b
         
      
    
      displaystyle a b  
  
 where 
  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle   
  
 denotes the group operation             
When two objects or systems are isomorphic  they are considered indistinguishable in terms of their internal structure  even though their elements or representations may differ  For instance  all cyclic groups of order 
  
    
      
          x   e 
      
    
      displaystyle  infty  
  
 are isomorphic to the integers  
  
    
      
        
          Z
        
         
      
    
      displaystyle  mathbb  Z    
  
 with addition              Similarly  in linear algebra  two vector spaces are isomorphic if they have the same dimension  as there exists a linear bijection between their elements             
The concept of isomorphism extends to numerous branches of mathematics  including graph theory  graph isomorphism   topology  homeomorphism   and algebra  group and ring isomorpisms   among others  Isomorphisms facilitate the classification of mathematical entities and enable the transfer of results and techniques between similar systems  Bridging the gap between isomorphism and equality was one motivation for the development of category theory  as well as for homotopy type theory and univalent foundations                                     

Geometry edit 
The two triangles on the left are congruent  The third is similar to them  The last triangle is neither congruent nor similar to any of the others  
In geometry  formally  two figures are equal if they contain exactly the same points  However  historically  geometric equality has always been taken to be much broader  Euclid and Archimedes used  equal        isos  often referring to figures with the same area or those that could be cut and rearranged to form one another  For example  Euclid stated the Pythagorean theorem as  the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the squares on the sides  taken together   and Archimedes said that  a circle is equal to the rectangle whose sides are the radius and half the circumference              
This notion persisted until Adrien Marie Legendre  who introduced the term  equivalent  to describe figures of equal area and restricted  equal  to what we now call  congruent  the same shape and size  or if one has the same shape and size as the mirror image of the other                          Euclid s terminology continued in the work of David Hilbert in his Grundlagen der Geometrie  who further refined Euclid s ideas by introducing the notions of polygons being  divisibly equal   zerlegungsgleich  if they can be cut into finitely many triangles which are congruent  and  equal in content   inhaltsgleichheit  if one can add finitely many divisibly equal polygons to each such that the resulting polygons are divisibly equal              
After the rise of set theory  around the     s  there was a push for a reform in mathematics education called New Math  following Andrey Kolmogorov  who  in an effort to restructure Russian geometry courses  proposed presenting geometry through the lens of transformations and set theory  Since a figure was seen as a set of points  it could only be equal to itself  as a result of Kolmogorov  the term  congruent  became standard in schools for figures that were previously called  equal   which popularized the term              
While Euclid addressed proportionality and figures of the same shape  it was not until the   th century that the concept of similarity was formalized in the modern sense  Similar figures are those that have the same shape but can differ in size  they can be transformed into one another by scaling and congruence               Later a concept of equality of directed line segments  equipollence  was advanced by Giusto Bellavitis in
