							His goal helped knock Germany out of the World Cup  but for Son Heung min the Asian Games could have a greater impact  The South Korean forward must lead his country to victory to earn a reprieve from military service One of three nominated overage players in his country       s squad for the under    tournament  Son laid on two goals for hat trick hero Hwang Ui jo on Monday before a late penalty sent the Koreans through to the semifinals with a     extra time win over Uzbekistan 
The    year old also scored the second as South Korea confirmed Germany       s early exit from Russia      and started his career in Germany       s Bundesliga with Hamburg  before moving to Bayer Leverkusen in       He now plys his trade for English Premier League outfit Tottenham Hotspur  having joined the London club in

South Korean men between the ages of    and    must perform two years compulsary military service unless granted an exemption  something Son has not yet done  Despite the Asian Games not being an official FIFA registered competition  gold at the tournament will earn Son just such an exemption  as would Olympic gold or other significant sporting achievements with national teams  That       s the reason Tottenham  who were not obliged to release the forward  have allowed Son to miss up to three early Premier League fixtures in order to captain his country in Indonesia 
South Korea were among the pre tournament favorites and  as Asia       s all time Premier League top scorer and a huge celebrity in his homeland  Son is a huge draw for fans  His country won the last edition  beating North Korea in a tense final  but Leverkusen refused to release Son 
       I can       t say I       m     percent sure to win the gold medal  We are on the way to make something  and to win some trophies         Son said ahead of Monday       s quarterfinal win 
Should South Korea fail to win gold  Son could expect to receive a military call up in the next    months  in the prime of his footballing career  meaning another chance to sidestep service is unlikely 
Should the attacker fulfill his military service  he will be paid         won              per month and could be assigned a range of duties  from riding tanks to standing patrol at the heavily fortified border with North Korea         with whom the South remains technically at war 
While most top South Korean footballers can spend their service playing for the K League       s military side Sangju Sangmu  Son is not eligible as he has never appeared in the domestic league  South Korea face Vietnam in the last four on Wednesday and the winner will play Japan or the United Arab Emirates in the final on Saturday
