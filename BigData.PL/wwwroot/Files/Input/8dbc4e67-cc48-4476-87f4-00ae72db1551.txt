							HONG KONG  Inflation is becoming a top concern to sovereign funds  which are looking at ways to guard their portfolios against price pressures  State Street Global Advisors  head of institutions business in Asia said  
Persistent weakness in the US dollar and the extent to which many benchmark bond yields have fallen because of emergency policies are signals that inflation could become a bigger concern for sovereign funds  which typically have a longer time horizon  in about a year  
 Inflation is getting to be a concern  That s more of a medium  to long term issue obviously  If you re a savvy investor  you can see it coming   said Hon Cheung  regional director  Asia official institutions group for the firm  
State Street Global Advisors is the institutional asset management business of State Street Corp  
Cheung said in an interview on Monday that his firm was advising sovereign funds it was not a good time to keep relatively large bond overweights  and to hedge against price pressures with stocks  commodities and inflation linked asset classes  
The role of sovereign wealth funds around the world  which oversee about    trillion in assets  has been changed by the financial crisis  At the start of the crisis they were a key source of capital for struggling Western banks  injecting about     billion into the industry  
But after Lehman Brothers collapsed and panic spread through financial markets  many funds were redeployed by their respective governments to stabilize their home markets  
For example  in September China s      billion sovereign fund began to take stakes in domestically listed banks for the first time in its modern history to support the market  In March  the fund said if needed it would continue to boost its bank stakes  
However  Cheung said the need for sovereign funds to take emergency measures such as these on behalf of the government would ease as the financial crisis subsided  In Asia  they would likely return to make investments mainly on the basis of returns  
 The worst seems to be over so therefore the needs for support mechanisms now are perhaps less than before   
 As the financial crisis subsides  I am very comfortable with the notion that the degree of government oversight would also subside   he added  
Cheung said sovereign investors  like many other market participants  have been shifting money from cash equivalents to riskier assets  contributing to a six month global equity rally  
However  he said sovereign funds are likely still heavy on what he called  virtual cash   meaning they have not brought their portfolio allocations back near target benchmark levels  
 Although a lot of the actual cash has already been invested  there s still a lot of  virtual cash  just sitting there   
Some funds are indeed already trying to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by the crisis  
China s state fund is planning to invest up to    billion in US mortgages through asset managers involved with the US Treasury designated Public Private Investment Plan  sources told Reuters last week  
These funds are subsidized by US taxpayers and meant to absorb as much as     billion in illiquid securities from banks  balance sheets  
State Street Global Advisors manages more than      billion for    central banks and government clients
