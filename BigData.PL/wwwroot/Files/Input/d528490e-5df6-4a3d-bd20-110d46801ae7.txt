US government initiative related to developing computer hardware and artificial intelligence
This article is about the artificial intelligence initiative of            For the exascale computing initiative started in       see National Strategic Computing Initiative 
The United States government s  Strategic Computing Initiative funded research into advanced computer hardware and artificial intelligence from      to       The initiative was designed to support various projects that were required to develop machine intelligence in a prescribed ten year time frame  from chip design and manufacture  computer architecture to artificial intelligence software  The Department of Defense spent a total of    billion on the project            
The inspiration for the program was Japan s fifth generation computer project  an enormous initiative that set aside billions for research into computing and artificial intelligence  As with Sputnik in       the American government saw the Japanese project as a challenge to its technological dominance             The British government also funded a program of their own around the same time  known as Alvey  and a consortium of U S  companies funded another similar project  the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation                       
The goal of SCI  and other contemporary projects  was nothing less than full machine intelligence   The machine envisioned by SC   according to Alex Roland and Philip Shiman   would run ten billion instructions per second to see  hear  speak  and think like a human  The degree of integration required would rival that achieved by the human brain  the most complex instrument known to man             
The initiative was conceived as an integrated program  similar to the Apollo moon program              where different subsystems would be created by various companies and academic projects and eventually brought together into a single integrated system  Roland and Shiman wrote that  While most research programs entail tactics or strategy  SC boasted grand strategy  a master plan for an entire campaign             
The project was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and directed by the Information Processing Technology Office  IPTO   By      it had spent      million  and    projects were underway at    institutions  half in industry  half in universities and government labs             Robert Kahn  who directed IPTO in those years  provided the project with its early leadership and inspiration             Clint Kelly managed the SC Initiative for three years and developed many of the specific application programs for DARPA  such as the Autonomous Land Vehicle            
By the late     s  it was clear that the project would fall short of realizing the hoped for levels of machine intelligence  Program insiders pointed to issues with integration  organization  and communication              When Jack Schwarz ascended to the leadership of IPTO in       he cut funding to artificial intelligence research  the software component   deeply and brutally    eviscerating  the program  wrote Pamela McCorduck              Schwarz felt that DARPA should focus its funding only on those technologies which showed the most promise  In his words  DARPA should  surf   rather than  dog paddle   and he felt strongly AI was not  the next wave             
The project was superseded in the     s by the Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative and then by the Advanced Simulation and Computing Program  These later programs did not include artificial general intelligence as a goal  but instead focused on supercomputing for large scale simulation  such as atomic bomb simulations  The Strategic Computing Initiative of the     s is distinct from the      National Strategic Computing Initiative the two are unrelated 


Results edit 
Although the program failed to meet its goal of high level machine intelligence             it did meet some of its specific technical objectives  for example those of autonomous land navigation             The Autonomous Land Vehicle program and its sister Navlab project at Carnegie Mellon University  in particular  laid the scientific and technical foundation for many of the driverless vehicle programs that came after it  such as the Demo II and III programs  ALV being Demo I   Perceptor  and the DARPA Grand Challenge              The use of video cameras plus laser scanners and inertial navigation units pioneered by the SCI ALV program form the basis of almost all commercial driverless car developments today  It also helped to advance the state of the art of computer hardware to a considerable degree 
On the software side  the initiative funded development of the Dynamic Analysis and Replanning Tool  DART   a program that handled logistics using artificial intelligence techniques  This was a huge success  saving the Department of Defense billions during Desert Storm             Introduced in       DART had by      offset the monetary equivalent of all funds DARPA had channeled into AI research for the previous    years combined
