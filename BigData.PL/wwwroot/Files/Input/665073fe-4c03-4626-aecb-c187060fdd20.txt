Claude is a family of large language models developed by Anthropic             The first model was released in March      
The Claude   family  released in March       consists of three models  Haiku  optimized for speed  Sonnet  which balances capability and performance  and Opus  designed for complex reasoning tasks  These models can process both text and images  with Claude   Opus demonstrating enhanced capabilities in areas like mathematics  programming  and logical reasoning compared to previous versions            


Training edit 
Claude models are generative pre trained transformers  They have been pre trained to predict the next word in large amounts of text  Then  they have been fine tuned  notably using constitutional AI and reinforcement learning from human feedback  RLHF                        

Constitutional AI edit 
Constitutional AI is an approach developed by Anthropic for training AI systems  particularly language models like Claude  to be harmless and helpful without relying on extensive human feedback             The method  detailed in the paper  Constitutional AI  Harmlessness from AI Feedback  involves two phases  supervised learning and reinforcement learning                       
In the supervised learning phase  the model generates responses to prompts  self critiques these responses based on a set of guiding principles  a  constitution    and revises the responses  Then the model is fine tuned on these revised responses            
For the reinforcement learning from AI feedback  RLAIF  phase  responses are generated  and an AI compares their compliance with the constitution  This dataset of AI feedback is used to train a preference model that evaluates responses based on how much they satisfy the constitution  Claude is then fine tuned to align with this preference model  This technique is similar to RLHF  except that the comparisons used to train the preference model are AI generated  and that they are based on the constitution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          According to Anthropic this has allowed for Claude to be more ethical and polite                       
The  constitution  for Claude included    points  including sections from the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights

Claude is named after Claude Shannon  a pioneer in AI research             

Claude edit 
Claude was the initial version of Anthropic s language model released in March                   Claude demonstrated proficiency in various tasks but had certain limitations in coding  math  and reasoning capabilities              Anthropic partnered with companies like Notion  productivity software  and Quora  to help develop the Poe chatbot              

Claude Instant edit 
Claude was released as two versions  Claude and Claude Instant  with Claude Instant being a faster  less expensive  and lighter version  Claude Instant has an input context length of         tokens  which corresponds to around        words              

Claude   edit 
Claude   was the next major iteration of Claude  which was released in July      and available to the general public  whereas the Claude   was only available to selected users approved by Anthropic             
Claude   expanded its context window from       tokens to         tokens              Features included the ability to upload PDFs and other documents that enables Claude to read  summarize  and assist with tasks 

Claude     edit 
Claude     doubled the number of tokens that the chatbot could handle  increasing it to a window of         tokens  which equals around     pages of written material             
Anthropic states that the new model is less likely to produce false statements compared to its predecessors             

Criticism edit 
Claude   received criticism for its stringent ethical alignment that may reduce usability and performance  Users have been refused assistance with benign requests  for example with the system administration question  How can I kill all python processes in my ubuntu server   This has led to a debate over the  alignment tax   the cost of ensuring an AI system is aligned  in AI development  with discussions centered on balancing ethical considerations and practical functionality  Critics argued for user autonomy and effectiveness  while proponents stressed the importance of ethical AI                         

Claude   edit 
Claude   was released on March          with claims in the press release to have set new industry benchmarks across a wide range of cognitive tasks  The Claude   family includes three state of the art models in ascending order of capability  Haiku  Sonnet  and Opus  The default version of Claude    Opus  has a context window of         tokens  but this is being expanded to   million for specific use cases                        
Claude   drew attention for demonstrating an apparent ability to realize it is being artificially tested during needle in a haystack tests             

Claude     edit 
Example of Claude     Sonnet output
On June           Anthropic released Claude     Sonnet  which demonstrated significantly improved performance on benchmarks compared to the larger Claude   Opus  notably in areas such as coding  multistep workflows  chart interpretation  and text extraction from images  Released alongside     Sonnet was the new Artifacts capability in which Claude was able to create code in a dedicated window in the interface and preview the rendered output in real time  such as SVG graphics or websites              Anthropic also announced that Claude     Opus would be released later that year  and added it to their models page              However  as of February       Claude     Opus has not been released  and Anthropic has removed mention of it from the models page             
An  upgraded Claude     Sonnet   billed as  Claude     Sonnet  New   in the web interface and benchmarks  was introduced on October           along with Claude     Haiku              A feature   computer use   was also unveiled in public beta  This capability enables Claude     Sonnet to interact with a computer s desktop environment  performing tasks such as moving the cursor  clicking buttons  and typing text  effectively mimicking human computer interactions  This development allows the AI to autonomously execute complex  multi step tasks across various applications                         
Upon release  Anthropic claimed Claude     Haiku would remain the same price as its predecessor  Claude   Haiku              However  on November  th        Anthropic announced that they would be increasing the price of the model  to reflect its increase in intelligence                          

Claude     edit 
Claude     Sonnet was released on February           It is a pioneering hybrid AI reasoning model that allows users to choose between rapid responses and more thoughtful  step by step reasoning  This model integrates both capabilities into a single framework  eliminating the need for multiple models  Users can control how long the model  thinks  about a question  balancing speed and accuracy based on their needs              
Anthropic also launched a research preview of Claude Code  an agentic command line tool that enables developers to delegate coding tasks directly from their terminal                         

Features edit 
In July       Anthropic released the Artifacts feature  allowing users to generate and interact with code snippets and documents             
In October       Anthropic released the  computer use  feature  allowing Claude to attempt to navigate computers by interpreting screen content and simulating keyboard and mouse input             
In March       Anthropic added a web search feature to Claude  starting with only paying users located in the United States
