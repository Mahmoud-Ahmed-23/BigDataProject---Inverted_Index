							Alaa Farouk  Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation  and Yasmine Fouad  Minister of Environment  met to strategize on optimizing agricultural and animal waste for organic feed and fertilizer production  This initiative aims to enhance sustainability and reduce dependence on imported feed 
Minister Farouk directed ministry officials to coordinate closely with the Ministry of Environment to streamline implementation and eliminate regulatory or logistical hurdles  He also encouraged private sector investment  assuring that the Ministry of Agriculture is ready to provide technical support through its research centers 
Minister Fouad reaffirmed the government s dedication to agricultural waste management  noting that a strategic framework had already been presented to the Prime Minister  This effort led to Cabinet Resolution No       of       which established a high level committee chaired by the Ministry of Agriculture to oversee the integration of agricultural residues into feed production 
She outlined the Ministry of Environment s initiatives  including legislative advancements  regulatory reforms  and awareness campaigns aimed at curbing harmful practices like agricultural waste burning  One of the ministry s key achievements is the air pollution management system for rice straw burning  which has successfully collected and compacted     of rice straw  creating investment opportunities by supporting contractors with specialized waste collection equipment 
Fouad also highlighted the ministry s push for bioenergy  biogas  production  citing the installation of       biogas units that collectively generate       million cubic meters of gas annually equivalent to        butane gas cylinders  These units process      tonnes of biowaste  producing approximately        tons of organic fertilizer 
Investment opportunities in the agricultural waste sector were a focal point of the discussion  Projects include a     million palm frond recycling factory in the New Valley aimed at wood production  initiatives to extract oils from prickly pear seeds  and efforts to produce amorphous silica from rice straw  Additionally  developments in non traditional animal feed derived from agricultural residues were explored 
During the meeting  officials reviewed challenges in agricultural residue utilization and deliberated on solutions  A detailed presentation revealed that Egypt produces       million tons of agricultural waste annually  much of which is already used in compost production  bioenergy generation  and industries such as wood manufacturing 
The ministers reaffirmed their commitment to expanding these initiatives  strengthening regulatory frameworks  and attracting more investors to maximize the economic and environmental benefits of agricultural waste utilization
