							Renowned for her profound artistry and unwavering commitment to creativity  Sawsan Badr has long been a celebrated figure in the world of cinema and television  Known as  the Nefertiti of Egyptian cinema   Badr views her artistic journey as a continuous exploration of life through her unique lens  With a career spanning decades  she has consistently championed meaningful storytelling  aligning her work with social causes and contemporary issues 
Fresh from the success of her latest series         Al Bahth Ann Ola         Badr continues to inspire audiences with her versatile performances  Recently  she was honored at the inaugural Very Short Film Festival  VS FILM  and served as a jury member at the Bahrain Festival  affirming her stature as a pivotal figure in Arab cinema  In her interview with Daily News Egypt  Badr reflects on her passion for innovative storytelling  the evolution of cinema  and her commitment to nurturing young talent

How do you perceive your recognition at the VS FILM 
Receiving recognition is always a wonderful feeling as it reflects appreciation for my artistic journey  into which I have poured my heart and efforts  The VS FILM is particularly significant to me as it celebrates cinema from fresh  innovative perspectives and fosters creativity  It is an honor to be part of this unique artistic landscape 

 nbsp 
The VS FILM Festival focuses on very short films  with durations of just   to    minutes  How was your experience with this genre 
It was a truly special experience  Very short films are a unique challenge for filmmakers  requiring them to craft a complete and impactful narrative within a brief timeframe  This demands a high level of focus and innovation  I believe these films hold an essential place in the future of cinema  especially as viewing habits shift toward more concise formats 
Do you think very short films can rival feature length films in terms of impact 
Absolutely  Very short films possess a unique power  By condensing their message and utilizing every second efficiently  they leave a profound impact  Their brevity compels directors to be precise and innovative  which often leads to unforgettable storytelling 

 nbsp 
How do you view the future of cinema with the rise of these short films 
The future of cinema will be diverse  While very short films will likely grow in popularity  especially with the rise of digital platforms  feature length films will remain vital  The two formats will complement each other  offering audiences a richer cinematic experience 
Are you supportive of festivals dedicated to short films 
Absolutely  Festivals like this provide a platform for emerging filmmakers to showcase their talents  Young creators use contemporary tools and styles that reflect their generation       s rhythm and technological advancements  I am grateful to the VS FILM Festival for honoring me during its inaugural edition  and I applaud their dedication to nurturing creative talent 
What message would you like to share with young filmmakers 
Believe in your ideas and pursue them with courage  Don t be afraid to create something new or different  Cinema demands bravery  and even the smallest idea can grow into a significant work when approached with sincerity  Respect every creative effort and embrace art with passion  love  and intellectual curiosity  Read broadly and expand your knowledge it will enrich your art and all aspects of your work 
You actively engage with young filmmakers and their projects  Why is this important to you 
Collaborating with young filmmakers gives me fresh energy and exposes me to new ideas  Short projects are particularly invigorating  allowing me to experiment and explore diverse experiences  Engaging with younger generations also helps me stay attuned to evolving artistic trends and perspectives 
How was your experience as a jury member at the Bahrain Festival 
Being part of a jury is both challenging and immensely rewarding  I enjoy analyzing the intricacies of artistic works and discovering emerging talents  The Bahrain Festival has a distinctive spirit and serves as an essential platform for Arab filmmakers  fostering innovation and collaboration 
What is your opinion of the Cairo International Film Festival and its impact on cinema 
The Cairo International Film Festival is one of the most prestigious in the region  consistently affirming its global reputation  It is a hub for cultural dialogue and artistic exchange  offering a platform for both Arab and international cinema  Each edition introduces me to inspiring works and remarkable talents 

Why did you choose to participate in the series Al Bahth Ann Ola 
When I was offered the role  I was immediately captivated by the script  The character of Suhair was rich in detail  offering me the opportunity to explore new dimensions of a mother s role that I hadn t portrayed before 
What makes the role of Suhair unique compared to your previous characters 
Suhair s character resonated deeply with middle class Egyptian women striving to uplift their families and support their daughters  Her authenticity mirrors real life individuals and carries similarities to my earlier role as Aida in Abu Al Arousa  Every character I portray carries aspects of my true self  making the process deeply personal 

Did you undertake any special preparation for Suhair       s character 
Definitely  I envisioned her physical traits  demeanor  and way of speaking as someone from a middle class background  Her clothing and mannerisms were carefully discussed with the director to ensure authenticity  allowing audiences to connect with her 

Were you surprised by the audience       s reaction to Al Bahth Ann Ola 
I was delighted by the overwhelming response from the very first episode  The intense moments and surprises in the storyline resonated with viewers more than I expected  I m incredibly grateful for the positive feedback 
 Recently  there has been a trend of television series focusing on family dynamics  such as Abu Al Arousa and Haddouta Mansiya  What are your thoughts on this trend 
Art mirrors reality  and family centered narratives resonate deeply with audiences  These stories reflect the essence of life  touching on relatable issues and societal challenges  I find such projects fulfilling  as they captivate viewers and highlight the importance of familial bonds
