The organisation is distinct from the European Union  EU   although people sometimes confuse the two organisations   partly because the EU has adopted the original European flag  designed for the Council of Europe in                  as well as the European anthem             No country has ever joined the EU without first belonging to the Council of Europe             The Council of Europe is an official United Nations observer            
Unlike the EU  the Council of Europe cannot make binding laws  however  the council has produced a number of international treaties  including the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms  European Convention on Human Rights  ECHR  of       Provisions from the convention are incorporated in domestic law in many participating countries             The best known body of the Council of Europe is the European Court of Human Rights  which rules on alleged violations of the ECHR             
The council s two statutory bodies are the Committee of Ministers  which comprises the foreign ministers of each member state  and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe  PACE   which is composed of members of the national parliaments of each member state              The Commissioner for Human Rights is an institution within the Council of Europe  mandated to promote awareness of and respect for human rights within the member states  The secretary general presides over the secretariat of the organisation  Other major CoE bodies include the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines  amp  HealthCare  EDQM              and the European Audiovisual Observatory 
The headquarters of the Council of Europe  as well as its Court of Human Rights  are situated in Strasbourg  France  The Council uses English and French as its two official languages  The Committee of Ministers  the PACE  and the Congress of the Council of Europe also use German and Italian for some of their work             

Member states of the Council of Europe  In addition  the European Convention on Human Rights  ECHR  applies in Kosovo as a result of domestic incorporation of the ECHR             

History edit

Founding edit 
In a speech in       French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand floated the idea of an organisation which would gather European nations together in a  federal union  to resolve common problems              The United Kingdom s wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill first publicly suggested the creation of a  Council of Europe  in a BBC radio broadcast on    March                   while the Second World War was still raging  In his own words              he tried to  peer through the mists of the future to the end of the war   and think about how to rebuild and maintain peace on a shattered continent  Given that Europe had been at the origin of two world wars  the creation of such a body would be  he suggested   a stupendous business   He returned to the idea during a well known speech at the University of Zurich on    September                               throwing the full weight of his considerable post war prestige behind it 
Additionally  there were also many other statesmen and politicians across the continent  many of them members of the European Movement  who were quietly working towards the creation of the council  Some regarded it as a guarantee that the horrors of war   or the human rights violations of the Nazi regime   could never again be visited on the continent  others came to see it as a  club of democracies   built around a set of common values that could stand as a bulwark against totalitarian states belonging to the Eastern Bloc  Others again saw it as a nascent  United States of Europe   the resonant phrase that Churchill had reached for at Zurich in      

Session of the Council of Europe s Parliamentary Assembly in the former House of Europe in Strasbourg in       Willy Brandt  German Minister for Foreign Affairs  is speaking 
The future structure of the Council of Europe was discussed at the Congress of Europe  which brought together several hundred leading politicians  government representatives and members of civil society in The Hague  Netherlands  in                   Responding to the conclusions of the Congress of Europe  the Consultative Council of the Treaty of Brussels convened a Committee for the Study of European Unity  which met eight times from November      to January      to draw up the blueprint of a new broad based European organisation             
There were two competing schools of thought  some favoured a classical international organisation with representatives of governments  while others preferred a political forum with parliamentarians  Both approaches were finally combined through the creation of a Committee of Ministers  in which governments were represented  and a Consultative Assembly  in which parliaments were represented   the two main bodies mentioned in the Statute of the Council of Europe  This dual intergovernmental and inter parliamentary structure was later copied for the European Communities  NATO and OSCE             
The Council of Europe was signed into existence on   May      by the Treaty of London  the organisation s founding Statute which set out the three basic values that should guide its work  democracy  human rights and the rule of law              It was signed in London on that day by ten states  Belgium  Denmark  France  Ireland  Italy  Luxembourg  the Netherlands  Norway  Sweden and the United Kingdom  though Turkey and Greece joined three months later  On    August           members of the council s Consultative Assembly  parliamentarians drawn from the twelve member nations  met in Strasbourg for its first plenary session  held over    sittings and lasting nearly a month  They debated how to reconcile and reconstruct a continent still reeling from war  yet already facing a new East West divide  launched the radical concept of a trans national court to protect the basic human rights of every citizen  and took the first steps in a process that would eventually lead to the creation of an offshoot organisation  the European Union             
In August       Paul Henri Spaak resigned as Belgium s foreign minister in order to be elected as the first president of the assembly  Behind the scenes  he too had been quietly working towards the creation of the council  and played a key role in steering its early work  However  in December       after nearly three years in the role  Spaak resigned in disappointment after the Assembly rejected proposals for a  European political authority               Convinced that the Council of Europe was never going to be in a position to achieve his long term goal of a unified Europe              he soon tried again in a new and more promising format  based this time on economic integration  becoming one of the founders of the European Union             

Early years edit 
There was huge enthusiasm for the Council of Europe in its early years  as its pioneers set about drafting what was to become the European Convention on Human Rights  a charter of individual rights which   it was hoped   no member government could ever again violate  They drew  in part  on the tenets of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  signed only a few months earlier in Paris  But crucially  where the Universal Declaration was essentially aspirational  the European Convention from the beginning featured an enforcement mechanism   an international Court   which was to adjudicate on alleged violations of its articles and to hold governments to account  a dramatic leap forward for international justice  Today  this is the European Court of Human Rights  whose rulings are binding on    European nations  the most far reaching system of international justice anywhere in the world 
One of the council s first acts was to welcome West Germany into its fold on   May                   setting a pattern of post war reconciliation that was to become a hallmark of the council  and beginning a long process of  enlargement  which was to see the organisation grow from its original ten founding member states to the    nations that make up the Council of Europe today              Iceland had already joined in       followed in      by Austria  Cyprus in       Switzerland in      and Malta in      

Historic speeches at the Council of Europe edit 
Winston Churchill s inaugural speech of the Council of Europe in The Hague
In       an archive of all speeches made to the PACE by heads of state or government since the Council of Europe s creation in      appeared online  the fruit of a two year project entitled  Voices of Europe               At the time of its launch              the archive comprised     speeches delivered over a    year period by some     presidents  prime ministers  monarchs and religious leaders from    countries   though it continues to expand  as new speeches are added every few months 
Some very early speeches by individuals considered to be  founding figures  of the European institutions  even if they were not heads of state or government at the time  are also included  such as Sir Winston Churchill or Robert Schuman   Addresses by eight monarchs appear in the list  such as King Juan Carlos I of Spain  King Albert II of Belgium and Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg  as well as the speeches given by religious figures  such as Pope John Paul II  and Pope Francis  and several leaders from countries in the Middle East and North Africa  such as Shimon Peres  Yasser Arafat  Hosni Mubarak  L opold S dar Senghor or King Hussein of Jordan  
The full text of the speeches is given in both English and French  regardless of the original language used  The archive is searchable by country  by name  and chronologically             

Aims and achievement edit 
Article   a  of the Statute states that  The aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity between its members for the purpose of safeguarding and realising the ideals and principles which are their common heritage and facilitating their economic and social progress               Membership is open to all European states who seek harmony  cooperation  good governance and human rights  accepting the principle of the rule of law and are able and willing to guarantee democracy  fundamental human rights and freedoms 
Whereas the member states of the European Union transfer part of their national legislative and executive powers to the European Commission and the European Parliament  Council of Europe member states maintain their sovereignty but commit themselves through conventions treaties  international law  and co operate on the basis of common values and common political decisions  Those conventions and decisions are developed by the member states working together at the Council of Europe  Both organisations function as concentric circles around the common foundations for European cooperation and harmony  with the Council of Europe being the geographically wider circle  The European Union could be seen as the smaller circle with a much higher level of integration through the transfer of powers from the national to the EU level   The Council of Europe and the European Union  different roles  shared values               Council of Europe conventions treaties are also open for signature to non member states  thus facilitating equal co operation with countries outside Europe 
The Council of Europe s most famous achievement is the European Convention on Human Rights  which was adopted in      following a report by the PACE  and followed on from the United Nations  Universal Declaration of Human Rights   UDHR               The Convention created the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg  The Court supervises compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights and thus functions as the highest European court  It is to this court that Europeans can bring cases if they believe that a member country has violated their fundamental rights and freedoms 
The various activities and achievements of the Council of Europe can be found in detail on its official website  The Council of Europe works in the following areas

The CoE has granted some countries a status that allows them to participate in CoE activities without being full members  There are three types of nonmember status  associate member  special guest and observer              Associate member status was created for former Axis states which had not yet regained their sovereignty since their defeat in the Second World War  as such  it is no longer used  although there have been proposals to reactivate it to permit enhanced participation by the current observer states               Special guest  status was used as a transitional status for post Soviet countries that wished to join the council after the fall of the Berlin Wall and is no longer commonly used               Observer  status is for non European nations who accept democracy  rule of law  and human rights  and wish to participate in Council initiatives              The United States became an observer state in                   Currently  Canada  the Holy See  Japan  Mexico  and the United States are observer states  while Israel is an observer to the PACE             Additionally Kosovo is a member of the Council of Europe Development Bank and a member of the Council of Europe s Venice Commission              The Assembly of Kosovo was invited to take part in the work of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and its committees as an observer in                               Two representatives of local government in Kosovo participate in the work of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities as observers             

Withdrawal  suspension  and expulsion edit 
Further information  Withdrawal from the Council of Europe
The Statute of the Council of Europe provides for the voluntary suspension  involuntary suspension  and exclusion of members              Article   of the Statute provides that any member who has  seriously violated  Article   may be suspended from its rights of representation  and that the Committee of Ministers may request that such a member withdraws from the Council under Article     The Statute does not define the  serious violation  phrase              Under Article   of the Statute  if a member state fails to withdraw upon request  the Committee may terminate its membership  in consultation with the PACE             
The Council suspended Greece in       after a military coup d  tat  and the Greek junta withdrew from the CoE              Greece was readmitted to the council in                  

Suspension and exclusion of Russia edit 
Main article  Russia in the Council of Europe
Russia became a member of the Council of Europe in       In       after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine and supported separatists in eastern Ukraine  the Council stripped Russia of its voting rights in the PACE              In response  Russia began to boycott the Assembly in       and beginning from      ceased paying its annual membership dues of      million euros  US      million  to the Council                         placing the institution under financial strain             
Russia stated that its suspension by the council was unfair  and demanded the restoration of its voting rights              Russia had threatened to withdraw from the Council unless its voting rights were restored in time for the election of a new secretary general              European Council secretary general Thorbj rn Jagland organized a special committee to find a compromise with Russia in early       a move that was criticised by some as giving in to alleged Russian pressure by Council members and academic observers  especially if voting sanctions were lifted                                      In June       an approximately two thirds majority of the Council voted  on a        vote  with    abstentions  to restore Russia s voting rights in the council                          Opponents of lifting the suspension included Ukraine and other post Soviet countries  such as the Baltic states  who argued that readmission amounted to normalizing Russia s malign activity              Supporters of restoring Russia s council rights included France and Germany               which argued that a Russian withdrawal from the council would be harmful because it would deprive Russian citizens of their ability to initiate cases in the European Court of Human Rights             
On   March       after Russia launched a full scale military invasion of Ukraine  the council suspended Russia for violations of the council s statute and the European Convention on Human Rights  ECHR   The suspension blocked Russia from participation in the council s ministerial council  the PACE  and the Council of the Baltic Sea States  but still left Russia obligated to follow the ECHR                                         On    March       hours before the vote to expel the country  Russia initiated a voluntary withdrawal procedure from the council  The Russian delegation planned to deliver its formal withdrawal on    December       and announced its intent to denounce the ECHR  However  on the same day  the council s Committee of Ministers decided Russia s membership in the council would be terminated immediately  and determined that Russia had been excluded from the Council instead under its exclusion mechanism rather than the withdrawal mechanism               After being excluded from the Council of Europe  Russia s former president and prime minister Dmitry Medvedev endorsed restoring the death penalty in Russia                           

Co operation edit 
Conventions  European Treaty Series edit 
Main article  List of Council of Europe treaties
The Council of Europe works mainly through international treaties  usually called conventions in its system  By drafting conventions or international treaties  common legal standards are set for its member states  The conventions are collected in the European Treaty Series 

Non member states edit 
Several conventions have also been opened for signature to non member states  Important examples are the Convention on Cybercrime  signed for example  by Canada  Japan  South Africa and the United States   the Lisbon Recognition Convention on the recognition of study periods and degrees  signed for example  by Australia  Belarus  Canada  the Holy See  Israel  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  New Zealand and the United States   the Anti doping Convention  signed  for example  by Australia  Belarus  Canada and Tunisia  and the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats  signed for example  by Burkina Faso  Morocco  Tunisia and Senegal as well as the European Community   Non member states also participate in several partial agreements  such as the Venice Commission  the Group of States Against Corruption  GRECO   the European Pharmacopoeia Commission and the North South Centre              
Invitations to sign and ratify relevant conventions of the Council of Europe on a case by case basis are sent to three groups of non member entities

European Union edit 
Main article  Council of Europe European Union relations

An Euler diagram showing the relationships between various multinational European organisations and agreements vte
The Council of Europe is not to be confused with the Council of the European Union  the  Council of Ministers   or the European Council  which belong to the European Union  an entirely separate body from the Council of Europe               although they have shared the same European flag and anthem since the     s since they both work for European integration              
Cooperation between the European Union and the Council of Europe was reinforced in the mid     s  notably on culture and education as well as on the international enforcement of justice and Human Rights              
The European Union is expected to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights  the convention   There are also concerns about consistency in case law   the European Court of Justice  the EU s court in Luxembourg  is treating the convention as part of the legal system of all EU member states in order to prevent conflict between its judgements and those of the European Court of Human Rights  the court in Strasbourg interpreting the convention   Protocol No     of the convention is designed to allow the EU to accede to it and the EU Treaty of Lisbon contains a protocol binding the EU to join  The EU would thus be subject to its human rights law and external monitoring as its member states currently are                           

Schools of Political Studies edit 
The Council of Europe Schools of Political Studies were established to train future generations of political  economic  social and cultural leaders in countries in transition  With the participation of national and international experts  they run annual series of seminars and conferences on topics such as European integration  democracy  human rights  the rule of law and globalisation  The first School of Political Studies was created in Moscow in       By          other schools had been set up along the same lines  forming an association               a network covering the whole of Eastern and South Eastern Europe and the Caucasus  as well as some countries in the Southern Mediterranean region  The schools are part of the Education Department  which is part of the Directorate of Democratic Participation within the Directorate General of Democracy   DGII   of the Council of Europe              

United Nations edit 
Cooperation between the CoE and the UN started with the agreement signed by the Secretariats of these institutions on    December       On    October       the General Assembly of the United Nations approved a resolution on granting observer status to the Council of Europe which was proposed by several member states of the CoE               Currently  the Council of Europe holds observer status with the United Nations and is regularly represented in the UN General Assembly  It has organised the regional UN conferences against racism and on women  It co operates with the United Nations at many levels  in particular in the areas of human rights  minorities  migration and counter terrorism  In November       the UN General Assembly adopted by consensus Resolution  A Res        on Cooperation between the United Nations and the Council of Europe whereby it acknowledged the contribution of the Council of Europe to the protection and strengthening of human rights and fundamental freedoms  democracy and the rule of law  welcomed the ongoing co operation in a variety of fields 

Non governmental organisations edit 
Non governmental organisations  NGOs  can participate in the INGOs Conference of the Council of Europe and become observers to inter governmental committees of experts  The Council of Europe drafted the European Convention on the Recognition of the Legal Personality of International Non Governmental Organisations in       which sets the legal basis for the existence and work of NGOs in Europe  Article    of the European Convention on Human Rights protects the right to freedom of association  which is also a fundamental norm for NGOs  The rules for consultative status for INGOs appended to the resolution         On relation between the Council of Europe and non governmental organisations   adopted by the Committee of Ministers on    October      at the    th meeting of the Ministers  Deputies  On    November       the Committee of Ministers changed the consultative status into a participatory status   considering that it is indispensable that the rules governing the relations between the Council of Europe and NGOs evolve to reflect the active participation of international non governmental organisations  INGOs  in the Organisation s policy and work programme               

Others edit 
On    May       the Council of Europe signed a memorandum of understanding with the European football confederation UEFA              
The Council of Europe also signed an agreement with FIFA in which the two agreed to strengthen future cooperation in areas of common interests  The deal which included cooperation between member states in the sport of football and safety and security at football matches was finalized in October                   

Characteristics edit 
Privileges and immunities edit 
The General Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the Council of Europe grants the organisation certain privileges and immunities              
The working conditions of staff are governed by the council s staff regulations  which are public               Salaries and emoluments paid by the Council of Europe to its officials are tax exempt on the basis of Article         of the General Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the Council of Europe              

Symbol and anthem edit 
Main articles  Symbols of Europe and Flag of Europe
The Council of Europe created  and has since      used as its official symbol  the European Flag with    golden stars arranged in a circle on a blue background 
Its musical anthem since       the  European anthem   is based on the  Ode to Joy  theme from Ludwig van Beethoven s ninth symphony 
On   May       the   th anniversary of its founding  the Council of Europe established   May as Europe Day              
The wide private and public use of the European Flag is encouraged to symbolise a European dimension  To avoid confusion with the European Union which subsequently adopted the same flag in the     s  as well as other European institutions  the Council of Europe often uses a modified version with a lower case  e  surrounding the stars which are referred to as the  Council of Europe Logo                            

Criticism and controversies edit 
Both Human Rights Watch and the European Stability Initiative have called on the Council of Europe to undertake concrete actions to show that it is willing and able to return to its  original mission to protect and ensure human rights                despite launching political and economic activities that could generate redundancies with other international organizations  including the European Union and OCSE                                         
In October       a new and different Pan European meeting of    states was held  as the  inaugural summit of the European Political Community   a new forum largely organized by French President Emmanuel Macron  The Council of Europe  sidelined  reportedly was  perplexed  with this development  with a spokesperson stating  In the field of human rights  democracy and the rule of law  such a pan European community already exists  it is the Council of Europe                A feature of the new forum is that Russia and Belarus are deliberately excluded               which was not seen as explaining the need for a different entity  given that at the time  Russia was no longer a member of the Council of Europe and Belarus only participated partially  as a non member      citation needed

After Azerbaijan joined the CoE in       both the Council and its Parliamentary Assembly were criticised for having a weak response to election rigging and human rights violations in Azerbaijan               The Human Rights Watch criticised the Council of Europe in      for allowing Azerbaijan to assume the six month rotating chairmanship of the council s Committee of Ministers  writing that the Azeri government s repression of human rights defenders  dissidents  and journalists  shows sheer contempt for its commitments to the Council of Europe                An internal inquiry was set up in      amid allegations of bribery by Azerbaijan government officials and criticism of  caviar diplomacy  at the council                            A     page report was issued in      after a ten month investigation               It concluded that several members of the Parliamentary Assembly broke CoE ethical rules and were  strongly suspected  of corruption  it strongly criticised former Parliamentary Assembly president Pedro Agramunt and suggested that he had engaged in  corruptive activities  before his resignation under pressure in                    The inquiry also named Italian member Luca Volont  as a suspect in  activities of a corruptive nature                Volont  was investigated by Italian police and accused by Italian prosecutors in      of receiving over      million euros in bribes in exchange for working for Azerbaijan in the parliamentary assembly  and that in      he played a key role in orchestrating the defeat of a highly critical report on the abuse of political prisoners in Azerbaijan                                         In       Volont  was convicted of accepting bribes from Azerbaijani officials to water down critiques of the nation s human rights record  and he was sentenced by a court in Milan to four years in prison
