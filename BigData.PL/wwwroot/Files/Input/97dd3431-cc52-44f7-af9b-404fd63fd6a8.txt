Mass surveillance is the intricate surveillance of an entire or a substantial fraction of a population in order to monitor that group of citizens             The surveillance is often carried out by local and federal governments or governmental organizations  but it may also be carried out by corporations  either on behalf of governments or at their own initiative   Depending on each nation s laws and judicial systems  the legality of and the permission required to engage in mass surveillance varies  It is the single most indicative distinguishing trait of totalitarian regimes  It is often distinguished from targeted surveillance 
Mass surveillance has often been cited by agencies like the National Security Agency  NSA  as necessary to fight terrorism  prevent crime and social unrest  protect national security  and control the population             At the same time  mass surveillance has equally often been criticized for violating privacy rights  limiting civil and political rights and freedoms  and being illegal under some legal or constitutional systems             Another criticism is that increasing mass surveillance could potentially lead to the development of a surveillance state  an electronic police state  or a totalitarian state wherein civil liberties are infringed or political dissent is undermined by COINTELPRO like programs            
In       the practice of mass surveillance by world governments            was called into question after Edward Snowden s      global surveillance disclosure on the practices by the NSA of the United States  Reporting based on documents Snowden leaked to various media outlets triggered a debate about civil liberties and the right to privacy in the Digital Age             Mass surveillance is considered a global issue                                               The Aerospace Corporation of the United States describes a near future event  the GEOINT Singularity  in which everything on Earth will be monitored at all times  analyzed by artificial intelligence systems  and then redistributed and made available to the general public globally in real time                         


By country edit 
Privacy International s      survey  covering    countries  indicated that there had been an increase in surveillance and a decline in the performance of privacy safeguards  compared to the previous year  Balancing these factors  eight countries were rated as being  endemic surveillance societies   Of these eight  China  Malaysia and Russia scored lowest  followed jointly by Singapore and the United Kingdom  then jointly by Taiwan  Thailand and the United States  The best ranking was given to Greece  which was judged to have  adequate safeguards against abuse              
Many countries throughout the world have already been adding thousands of surveillance cameras to their urban  suburban and even rural areas                          For example  in September      the American Civil Liberties Union  ACLU  stated that we are  in danger of tipping into a genuine surveillance society completely alien to American values  with  the potential for a dark future where our every move  our every transaction  our every communication is recorded  compiled  and stored away  ready to be examined and used against us by the authorities whenever they want              
On    March       Reporters Without Borders published a Special report on Internet Surveillance  The report included a list of  State Enemies of the Internet   countries whose governments are involved in active  intrusive surveillance of news providers  resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights  Five countries were placed on the initial list  Bahrain  China  Iran  Syria  until December        and Vietnam

Bahrain edit 
Bahrain is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders  March      list of  State Enemies of the Internet   countries whose governments are involved in active  intrusive surveillance of news providers  resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights  The level of Internet filtering and surveillance in Bahrain is one of the highest in the world  The royal family is represented in all areas of Internet management and has sophisticated tools at its disposal for spying on its subjects  The online activities of dissidents and news providers are closely monitored and the surveillance is increasing             
Media reports published in July      exposed the use of NSO Group s phone malware software  Pegasus  for spying on rights activists  lawyers  and journalists  globally  by authoritarian governments  Bahrain was among the many countries listed as the Israeli firm s clients accused of hacking and conducting unauthorized mass surveillance using phone malware despite a poor human rights record  The software is said to infect devices  allowing its operators to get access to the target s messages  photos  record calls  and activate the microphone and camera             
Yusuf al Jamri had no idea that even after fleeing Bahrain  he won t be able to escape the government s prying eyes  even after taking asylum in the UK  After moving to the UK and getting his asylum request accepted  Al Jamri legally filed charges against Bahrain along with the notorious spyware firm  NSO Group for infecting his phone with a malware  built with military grade technology in August       The hacking was verified by the researchers at Toronto based CitizenLab  As a result of which Yusuf complained of being subjected to personal injury  loss of privacy  distress and anxiety  Al Jamri s lawyers made claims about the same in a pre claim letter sent to both the accused  NSO Group and the Bahraini government  No response was received from the two on being approached for comments

Surveillance cameras at Tiananmen Square in       In       Comparitech reported that   out of    of the most monitored cities in the world are in China             
Mass surveillance in the People s Republic of China  PRC  is the network of monitoring systems used by the Chinese central government to monitor Chinese citizens  It is primarily conducted through the government  although corporate surveillance in connection with the Chinese government has been reported to occur  China monitors its citizens through Internet surveillance  camera surveillance  and through other digital technologies                          It has become increasingly widespread and grown in sophistication under General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party  CCP  Xi Jinping s administration                                                 
East Germany edit 
Main article  Mass surveillance in East Germany
Before the Digital Revolution  one of the world s biggest mass surveillance operations was carried out by the Stasi  the secret police of the former East Germany  By the time the state collapsed in       the Stasi had built up an estimated civilian network of         informants  who monitored even minute hints of political dissent among other citizens              Many West Germans visiting friends and family in East Germany were also subject to Stasi spying  as well as many high ranking West German politicians and persons in the public eye 
Most East German citizens were well aware that their government was spying on them  which led to a culture of mistrust  touchy political issues were only discussed in the comfort of their own four walls and only with the closest of friends and family members  while widely maintaining a fa ade of unquestioning followership in public      citation needed     

European Union edit 
The right to privacy is a highly developed area of law in Europe  The Data Protection Directive used to regulate the processing of personal data within the European Union  before it was replaced by the GDPR  For comparison  the US has no data protection law that is comparable to this  instead  the US regulates data protection on a sectoral basis             
Since early       the European Union has been working on a General Data Protection Regulation to replace the Data Protection Directive and harmonise data protection and privacy law  On    October       a committee at the European Parliament backed the measure  which  if it is enacted  could require American companies to seek clearance from European officials before complying with United States warrants seeking private data  The vote is part of efforts in Europe to shield citizens from online surveillance in the wake of revelations about a far reaching spying program by the U S  National Security Agency              European Union justice and rights commissioner Viviane Reding said  The question has arisen whether the large scale collection and processing of personal information under US surveillance programmes is necessary and proportionate to meet the interests of national security   The EU is also asking the US for changes to US legislation to match the legal redress offered in Europe  American citizens in Europe can go to the courts if they feel their rights are infringed but Europeans without right of residence in America cannot              When the EU   US arrangement to implement International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles were struck down by the European Court of Justice  a new framework for transatlantic data flows  called the  EU US Privacy Shield   was adopted in July                              
In April       the European Court of Justice declared invalid the EU Data Retention Directive  The Court said it violates two basic rights   respect for private life and protection of personal data              The legislative body of the European Union passed the Data Retention Directive on    December       It required that telecommunication operators retain metadata for telephone  Internet  and other telecommunication services for periods of not less than six months and not more than two years from the date of the communication as determined by each EU member state and  upon request  to make the data available to various governmental bodies  Access to this information is not limited to investigation of serious crimes  nor was a warrant required for access                         Protection
Undertaken under the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development  FP    Science in Society              some multidisciplinary and mission oriented mass surveillance activities  for example INDECT and HIDE  were funded by the European Commission             in association with industrial partners                                                 
The INDECT Project   Intelligent information system supporting observation  searching and detection for security of citizens in urban environment               develops an intelligent urban environment observation system to register and exchange operational data for the automatic detection  recognition and intelligent processing of all information of abnormal behaviour or violence                         
The main expected results of the INDECT project are 

Trial of intelligent analysis of video and audio data for threat detection in urban environments 
Creation of tools and technology for privacy and data protection during storage and transmission of information using quantum cryptography and new methods of digital watermarking 
Performing computer aided detection of threats and targeted crimes in Internet resources with privacy protecting solutions 
Construction of a search engine for rapid semantic search based on watermarking of content related to child pornography and human organ trafficking 
Implementation of a distributed computer system that is capable of effective intelligent processing 
HIDE   Homeland Security  Biometric Identification  amp  Personal Detection Ethics               was a research project funded by the European Commission within the scope of the Seventh RTD Framework Programme  FP    The consortium  coordinated by Emilio Mordini              explored the ethical and privacy implications of biometrics and personal detection technologies  focusing on the continuum between personal detection  authentication  identification and mass surveillance

As per the initial plan  access to the combined data will be given to    agencies  including the Research and Analysis Wing  the Intelligence Bureau  the Enforcement Directorate  the National Investigation Agency  the Central Bureau of Investigation  the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and the Narcotics Control Bureau      citation needed     
Several states within India have already installed CCTV surveillance systems with face matching capabilities using biometrics in Aadhaar              Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are using information linked with Aadhaar across different agencies to create a     degree profile of a person  calling it the Integration Information Hub  Other states are now planning to follow this model             

Iran edit 
Main article  Mass surveillance in Iran
Iran is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders  March      list of  State Enemies of the Internet   countries whose governments are involved in naturally active efforts to news providers   The government runs or controls almost all of the country s institutions for regulating  managing or legislating on telecommunications  The Supreme Council for Cyberspace  which was headed by President Ahmadinejad  was established in March      and now determines digital policy  The construction of a parallel  Iranian Internet   with a high connection speed but fully monitored and censored  is almost complete             
The tools used by the Iranian authorities to monitor and control the Internet include data interception tools capable of deep packet inspection  Interception products from leading Chinese companies such as ZTE and Huawei are in use  The products provided by Huawei to Mobin Net  the leading national provider of mobile broadband  can be used to analyze email content  track browsing history and block access to sites  The products that ZTA sold to the Telecommunication Company of Iran  TCI  offer similar services plus the possibility of monitoring the mobile network  European companies are the source of other spying and data analysis tools  Products designed by Ericsson and Nokia Siemens Networks  later Trovicor  are in use  These companies sold SMS interception and user location products to Mobile Communication Company of Iran and Irancell  Iran s two biggest mobile phone companies  in      and they were used to identify Iranian citizens during the post election uprising in       The use of Israeli surveillance devices has also been detected in Iran  The network traffic management and surveillance device NetEnforcer was provided by Israel to Denmark and then resold to Iran  Similarly  US equipment has found its way to Iran via the Chinese company ZTE             
In September      The Iranian government approved a law enabling it to have instant undeniable access every single thing in digital online life of citizens including location  photos  data and other vital record tied to people s real identity  The persistent monitoring system is part of Iranian seventh quinquennial development program bill package             

Malaysia edit 
In July       the Malaysian police announced the creation of the Malaysian Intercept Crimes Against Children Unit  icacu  that is equipped with real time mass internet surveillance software developed in the United States and is tasked with the monitoring of all Malaysian internet users  with a focus on pornography and child pornography  The system creates a  data library  of users which includes details such as IP addresses  websites  locations  duration and frequency of use and files uploaded and downloaded                                     

Mexico edit 
After struggling with drug trafficking and criminal groups for decades Mexico has been strengthening their military mass surveillance  Approximately half of the population in Mexico does not support democracy as a form of government  and believe an authoritarian system is better if social matters are solved through it              The relevance of these political beliefs may make it easier for mass surveillance to spread within the country   This does not necessarily mean the end of democratic institutions as a whole such as free elections or the permanence of critical mass media but it means strengthening the mechanisms for exercising power that exclude dialogue  transparency and social agreement              

Netherlands edit 
According to a      report  the Netherlands has the second highest number of wiretaps per capita in the Western world              The Dutch military intelligence service MIVD operates a satellite ground station to intercept foreign satellite links and also a facility to eavesdrop on foreign high frequency radio traffic 
An example of mass surveillance carried out by corporations in the Netherlands is an initiative started by five Dutch banks  ABN AMRO  ING  Rabobank  Triodos Bank and de Volksbank   In July      these five banks             have decided to establish Transaction Monitoring Netherlands  TMNL  in the collective fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism              The goal of TMNL organization is to gather all transaction information provided by Dutch banks in a centralized database to enable full scale collective transaction monitoring  Preparations have been started but the actual monitoring by TMNL can start after an amendment of the Dutch Anti Money Laundering and Anti Terrorist Financing Act 

North Korea edit

Russia edit 
Main article  Mass surveillance in RussiaCertificate of state registration of the  monitoring  control  tracking the target of ground vehicles      AMERTON The SORM  and SORM    laws enable complete monitoring of any communication  electronic or traditional  by eight state agencies  without warrant  These laws seem to be in conflict with Article    of the Constitution of Russia which states             

Everyone shall have the right to the inviolability of private life  personal and family secrets  the protection of honour and good name 
Everyone shall have the right to privacy of correspondence  of telephone conversations  postal  telegraph and other messages  Limitations of this right shall be allowed only by court decision

Singapore edit 
Singapore is known as a city of sensors  Singapore s surveillance structure spreads widely from closed circuit television  CCTV  in public areas even around the neighbourhood  internet monitoring traffic monitoring and to the use of surveillance metadata for government initiatives  In Singapore  SIM card registration is mandatory even for prepaid card  Singapore s government have the rights to access communication data  Singapore s largest telecompany  Singtel  has close relations to the government and Singapore s laws are broadly phrased to allow the government to obtain sensitive data such as text messages  email  call logs  and web surfing history from its people without the need for court permission             
The installation of mass surveillance cameras in Singapore is an effort to act as a deterrence not only for terror attacks             but also for public security such as loan sharks  illegal parking  and more              As part of Singapore s Smart Nation initiative to build a network of sensors to collect and connect data from city life  including the citizen s movement   the Singapore government rolled out      sensors ranging from computer chips to surveillance cameras              to track almost everything in Singapore from air quality to public safety in                  
In       in a bid to increase security  the Singapore Police Force installed        police cameras in        Housing and Development Board  HDB  blocks covering the lifts and multi storey car parks              With rising security concerns  the number of CCTV cameras in public areas such as monitoring of the public transport system and commercial  government buildings in Singapore is set to increase             
In       the Singapore government rolled out new and more advanced surveillance systems  Starting with Singapore s maritime borders  new panoramic electro optic sensors were put in place on the north and south coasts  monitoring a     degree view of the area              A tethered unmanned aerial vehicle  UAV  was unveiled by the Singapore Police Force to be used during search and rescue operations including hostage situations and public order incidents             

Spain edit 
According to a      report by Privacy International  Spain may be part of a group of    European countries that is withholding information  also known as data retention              In       many defense lawyers tried to overturn multiple cases that used mass storage as their evidence to convict  according to the European Agency for Fundamental Rights             

Sweden edit 
Prior to       the National Defence Radio Establishment  FRA  was limited to wireless signals intelligence  SIGINT   although it was left largely unregulated              In December       new legislation went into effect  allowing the FRA to monitor cable bound signals passing the Swedish border              Communications service providers are legally required  under confidentiality  to transfer cable communications crossing Swedish borders to specific  interaction points   where data may be accessed after a court order             
The FRA has been contested since the change in its legislation  mainly because of the public perception the change would enable mass surveillance              The FRA categorically deny this allegation                          as they are not allowed to initialize any surveillance on their own              and has no direct access to communication lines              All SIGINT has to be authorized by a special court and meet a set of narrow requirements  something Minister for Defence Sten Tolgfors have been quoted as saying   should render the debate on mass surveillance invalid                                       Due to the architecture of Internet backbones in the Nordic area  a large portion of Norwegian and Finnish traffic will also be affected by the Swedish wiretapping             

Syria edit 
Photograph of Salah Jadid  de facto leader of Syria from      and until       His short regime was characterized by the imposition of radical socialist ideas and the strengthening of totalitarianism

The general intelligence  political security  and military intelligence divisions of the Ba athist secret police have several branches in all governorates controlled by the Assad regime  with headquarters in Damascus  With state impunity granted by the Hafez Assad s government  Mukhabarat officers wield pervasive influence over local bodies  civil associations  and bureaucracy  playing a major role in shaping Ba athist administrative decisions  Additionally  intense factional rivalries and power struggles exist among various branches of the secret police              Several academics have described the military  bureaucratic  and secret police apparatus of the Ba athist state as constituting a pyramidal socio political structure with an Orwellian surveillance system designed to neutralize independent civic activities and political dissent from its very onset                         
Syria is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders  March      list of  State Enemies of the Internet   countries whose governments are involved in active  intrusive surveillance of news providers  resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights  Syria has stepped up its web censorship and cyber monitoring as the country s civil war has intensified  At least    Blue Coat proxy servers are in use  Skype calls are intercepted  and social engineering techniques  phishing  and malware attacks are all in use             

United Arab Emirates edit 
In October       The Intercept released a report detailing the experience of an Italian security researcher Simone Margaritelli  of allegedly being hired for mass surveillance operations run by United Arab Emirates  According to Margaritelli  he was called for an interview with the Abu Dhabi based cybersecurity firm called DarkMatter  Margaritelli says he declined the offer and instead wrote a blog post titled  How the United Arab Emirates Intelligence Tried to Hire Me to Spy on Its People   In response to The Intercept inquiries  DarkMatter responded by stating   No one from DarkMatter or its subsidiaries have ever interviewed Mr  Margaritelli   Kevin Healy  director of communications for DarkMatter  wrote in an email responding to The Intercept that the man Margaritelli says interviewed him was previously only an advisory consultant to DarkMatter and is currently no longer an advisor to the company  Dark Matter responded by saying  While we respect an author s right to express a personal opinion  we do not view the content in question as credible  and therefore have no further comment              
In January       Reuters released a detailed account of a      state surveillance operation   dubbed as Project Raven   led by the United Arab Emirates with the help of former NSA officials like Lori Stroud  an ex NSA cyberspy  Counter terrorism strategy was the primary motive of setting up the unit  However  soon the project began being used as a surveillance program to spy on rival leaders  critical dissidents and journalists             
In December       Google Play Store and Apple App Store removed an Emirati messaging application called ToTok following allegations that it was a state surveillance application  according to The New York Times report                            The application s privacy policy clearly stated that it may share personal data of the users with  regulatory agencies  law enforcement  and other lawful access requests   The allegations were denied by the co founders of ToTok  Giacomo Ziani and Long Ruan  respectively  The application was restored on Google Play Store later on              
In July       the United Arab Emirates came under renewed questions about mass surveillance amidst the coronavirus outbreak  Experts highlighted that the country has one of the highest per capita concentrations of surveillance cameras in the world  In a statement  the Emirati government acknowledged that cameras are used to counter the threat of terrorism and have helped the country rank as one of the safest countries in the world              

United Kingdom edit 
Main article  Mass surveillance in the United Kingdom
State surveillance in the United Kingdom has formed part of the public consciousness since the   th century  The postal espionage crisis of      sparked the first panic over the privacy of citizens               However  in the   th century  electronic surveillance capabilities grew out of wartime signal intelligence and pioneering code breaking               In       the Government Communications Headquarters  GCHQ  was formed  The United Kingdom and the United States signed the bilateral UKUSA Agreement in       It was later broadened to include Canada  Australia and New Zealand  as well as cooperation with several  third party  nations  This became the cornerstone of Western intelligence gathering and the  Special Relationship  between the UK and the US              
After the growth of the Internet and development of the World Wide Web  a series of media reports in      revealed more recent programs and techniques involving GCHQ  such as Tempora              
The use of these capabilities is controlled by laws made in the UK Parliament  In particular  access to the content of private messages  that is  interception of a communication  must be authorized by a warrant signed by a Secretary of State                                         In addition European Union data privacy law applies in UK law  The UK exhibits governance and safeguards as well as use of electronic surveillance                                        
The Investigatory Powers Tribunal  a judicial oversight body for the intelligence agencies  ruled in December      that the legislative framework in the United Kingdom does not breach the European Convention on Human Rights                                         However  the Tribunal stated in February      that one particular aspect  the data sharing arrangement that allowed UK Intelligence services to request data from the US surveillance programs Prism and Upstream  had been in contravention of human rights law prior to this until two paragraphs of additional information  providing details about the procedures and safeguards  were disclosed to the public in December                                             
In its December      ruling  the Investigatory Powers Tribunal found that the legislative framework in the United Kingdom does not permit mass surveillance and that while GCHQ collects and analyses data in bulk  it does not practice mass surveillance                                         A report on Privacy and Security published by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament also came to this view  although it found past shortcomings in oversight and said the legal framework should be simplified to improve transparency                                         This view is supported by independent reports from the Interception of Communications Commissioner               However  notable civil liberties groups continue to express strong views to the contrary and plan to appeal the ruling to the European Court of Human Rights               while others have criticised these viewpoints in turn

The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act       RIP or RIPA  is a significant piece of legislation that granted and regulated the powers of public bodies to carry out surveillance and investigation               In      the UK government announced plans to extend the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act so that at least    government departments would be given powers to access metadata about citizens  web  e mail  telephone and fax records  without a warrant and without a subject s knowledge              
The Protection of Freedoms Act      includes several provisions related to controlling and restricting the collection  storage  retention  and use of information in government databases              
Supported by all three major political parties  the UK Parliament passed the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act in July      to ensure police and security services retain existing powers to access phone and Internet records                           
This was superseded by the Investigatory Powers Act       a comprehensive statute which made public a number of previously secret powers  equipment interference  bulk retention of metadata  intelligence agency use of bulk personal datasets   and enables the Government to require internet service providers and mobile phone companies to maintain records of  but not the content of  customers  Internet connections for    months  In addition  it created new safeguards  including a requirement for judges to approve the warrants authorised by a Secretary of State before they come into force                            The Act was informed by two reports by David Anderson QC  the UK s Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation  A Question of Trust                     and the report of his Bulk Powers Review                      which contains a detailed appraisal  with    case studies  of the operational case for the powers often characterised as mass surveillance  It may yet require amendment as a consequence of legal cases brought before the Court of Justice of the European Union              and the European Court of Human Rights              
Many advanced nation states have implemented laws that partially protect citizens from unwarranted intrusion  such as the Human Rights Act       the Data Protection Act        updated as the Data Protection Act       to include the General Data Protection Regulation   and the Privacy and Electronic Communications  EC Directive  Regulations      in the United Kingdom  and laws that require a formal warrant before private data may be gathered by a government 
The vast majority of video surveillance cameras in the UK are not operated by government bodies  but by private individuals or companies  especially to monitor the interiors of shops and businesses  According to      Freedom of Information Act requests  the total number of local government operated CCTV cameras was around        over the entirety of the UK               The prevalence of video surveillance in the UK is often overstated due to unreliable estimates being requoted               for example one report in      extrapolated from a very small sample to estimate the number of cameras in the UK at     million  of which         in London                More reliable estimates put the number of private and local government operated cameras in the United Kingdom at around      million in

Historically  mass surveillance was used as part of wartime censorship to control communications that could damage the war effort and aid the enemy  For example  during the world wars  every international telegram from or to the United States sent through companies such as Western Union was reviewed by the US military  After the wars were over  surveillance continued in programs such as the Black Chamber following World War I and project Shamrock following World War II               COINTELPRO projects conducted by the U S  Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI  between      and      targeted various  subversive  organizations  including peaceful anti war and racial equality activists such as Albert Einstein and Martin Luther King Jr 
Billions of dollars per year are spent  by agencies such as the National Security Agency  NSA  and the Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI   to develop  purchase  implement  and operate systems such as Carnivore  ECHELON  and NarusInsight to intercept and analyze the immense amount of data that traverses the Internet and telephone system every day              
Under the Mail Isolation Control and Tracking program  the U S  Postal Service photographs the exterior of every piece of paper mail that is processed in the United States   about     billion pieces in       The U S  Postmaster General stated that the system is primarily used for mail sorting  but the images are available for possible use by law enforcement agencies               Created in      following the anthrax attacks that killed five people  it is a sweeping expansion of a     year old program called  mail cover  which targets people suspected of crimes              
The FBI developed the computer programs  Magic Lantern  and CIPAV  which they can remotely install on a computer system  in order to monitor a person s computer activity              
The NSA has been gathering information on financial records  Internet surfing habits  and monitoring e mails  They have also performed extensive analysis of social networks such as Myspace              
The PRISM special source operation system legally immunized private companies that cooperate voluntarily with U S  intelligence collection  According to The Register  the FISA Amendments Act of       specifically authorizes intelligence agencies to monitor the phone  email  and other communications of U S  citizens for up to a week without obtaining a warrant  when one of the parties is outside the U S               PRISM was first publicly revealed on   June       after classified documents about the program were leaked to The Washington Post and The Guardian by American Edward Snowden 
The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act  CALEA  requires that all U S  telecommunications and Internet service providers modify their networks to allow easy wiretapping of telephone  VoIP  and broadband Internet traffic                                        
In early       USA Today reported that several major telephone companies were providing the telephone call records of U S  citizens to the National Security Agency  NSA   which is storing them in a large database known as the NSA call database  This report came on the heels of allegations that the U S  government had been conducting electronic surveillance of domestic telephone calls without warrants               In       the existence of the Hemisphere Project  through which AT amp T provides telephone call data to federal agencies  became publicly known 
Traffic cameras  which were meant to help enforce traffic laws at intersections  may be used by law enforcement agencies for purposes unrelated to traffic violations               Some cameras allow for the identification of individuals inside a vehicle and license plate data to be collected and time stamped for cross reference with other data used by police               The Department of Homeland Security is funding networks of surveillance cameras in cities and towns as part of its efforts to combat terrorism              
The New York City Police Department infiltrated and compiled dossiers on protest groups before the      Republican National Convention  leading to over       arrests              
Modern surveillance in the United States was thought of more of a wartime effort before Snowden disclosed in depth information about the National Security Agency in June                    The constant development and improvements of the Internet and technology has made it easier for mass surveillance to take hold  Such revelations allow critical commentators to raise questions and scrutinize the implementation  use  and abuse of networking technologies  devices  and software systems that partake in a  global surveillant assemblage   Bogard       Collier and Ong       Haggerty and Ericson       Murakami Wood                     The NSA collected millions of Verizon user s telephone records in between      and       The NSA also collected data through Google and Facebook with a program called  Prism   Journalists through Snowden published nearly       top secret documents since then  yet the information disclosed is less than    of the entire information 

Vietnam edit 
Vietnam is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders  March      list of  State Enemies of the Internet   countries whose governments are involved in active  intrusive surveillance of news providers  resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights  Most of the country s    service providers are directly or indirectly controlled by the Vietnamese Communist Party  The industry leader  Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group  which controls    per cent of the market  is state owned  So is Viettel  an enterprise of the Vietnamese armed forces  FPT Telecom is a private firm  but is accountable to the Party and depends on the market leaders for bandwidth             
Service providers are the major instruments of control and surveillance  Bloggers monitored by the government frequently undergo man in the middle attacks  These are designed to intercept data meant to be sent to secure  https  sites  allowing passwords and other communication to be intercepted              According to a July      Freedom House report     percent of survey respondents connected to the Internet on their mobile devices believe that the government monitors conversations and tracks the calls of  activists  or  reactionaries                In       the Vietnam National Assembly also passed a cybersecurity law closely resembling one passed in China  requiring localisation of user data and censorship of anti state content              

Commercial mass surveillance edit 
Further information  Mass surveillance industry
As a result of the digital revolution  many aspects of life are now captured and stored in digital form  Concern has been expressed that governments may use this information to conduct mass surveillance on their populations  Commercial mass surveillance often makes use of copyright laws and  user agreements  to obtain  typically uninformed   consent  to surveillance from consumers who use their software or other related materials  This allows gathering of information which would be technically illegal if performed by government agencies  This data is then often shared with government agencies  thereby  in practice  defeating the purpose of such privacy protections 
One of the most common forms of mass surveillance is carried out by commercial organizations  Many people are willing to join supermarket and grocery loyalty card programs  trading their personal information and surveillance of their shopping habits in exchange for a discount on their groceries  although base prices might be increased to encourage participation in the program 
Through programs like Google s AdSense  OpenSocial and their increasing pool of so called  web gadgets    social gadgets   and other Google hosted services many web sites on the Internet are effectively feeding user information about sites visited by the users  and now also their social connections  to Google  Facebook also keep this information  although its acquisition is limited to page views within Facebook  This data is valuable for authorities  advertisers and others interested in profiling users  trends and web site marketing performance  Google  Facebook and others are increasingly becoming more guarded about this data as their reach increases and the data becomes more all inclusive  making it more valuable              
New features like geolocation give an even increased admission of monitoring capabilities to large service providers like Google  where they also are enabled to track one s physical movements while users are using mobile devices  especially those which are syncing without any user interaction  Google s Gmail service is increasingly employing features to work as a stand alone application which also might activate while a web browser is not even active for synchronizing  a feature mentioned on the Google I O      developer conference while showing the upcoming HTML  features which Google and others are actively defining and promoting              
In      at the World Economic Forum in Davos  Google CEO Eric Schmidt  said   The arrival of a truly mobile Web  offering a new generation of location based advertising  is set to unleash a  huge revolution                 At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on    February       Google presented their vision of a new business model for mobile operators and trying to convince mobile operators to embrace location based services and advertising  With Google as the advertising provider  it would mean that every mobile operator using their location based advertising service would be revealing the location of their mobile customers to Google              

Google will also know more about the customer because it benefits the customer to tell Google more about them  The more we know about the customer  the better the quality of searches  the better the quality of the apps  The operator one is  required   if you will  and the Google one will be optional  And today I would say  a minority choose to do that  but I think over time a majority will    because of the stored values in the servers and so forth and so on                 Mobile World Congress keynote speech  Google CEO Eric Schmidt             
Organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation are constantly informing users on the importance of privacy  and considerations about technologies like geolocation 
Computer company Microsoft patented in      a product distribution system with a camera or capture device that monitors the viewers that consume the product  allowing the provider to take  remedial action  if the actual viewers do not match the distribution license              
Reporters Without Borders  March      Special report on Internet Surveillance contained a list of  Corporate Enemies of the Internet   companies that sell products that are liable to be used by governments to violate human rights and freedom of information  The five companies on the initial list were  Amesys  France   Blue Coat Systems  U S    Gamma Group  UK and Germany   Hacking Team  Italy   and Trovicor  Germany   but the list was not exhaustive and is likely to be expanded in the future             
EFF found that a company by the name of Fog Data Science purchases location data from apps and sells it to the law enforcement agencies in the U S  without requiring a warrant or a court order              

Surveillance state edit 
A surveillance state is a country where the government engages in pervasive surveillance of large numbers of its citizens and visitors  Such widespread surveillance is usually justified as being necessary for national security  such as to prevent crime or acts of terrorism  but may also be used to stifle criticism of and opposition to the government 

Germans protesting against the NSA surveillance program PRISM at Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin
Examples of early surveillance states include the former Soviet Union and the former East Germany  which had a large network of informers and an advanced technology base in computing and spy camera technology               However  these states did not have today s technologies for mass surveillance  such as the use of databases and pattern recognition software to cross correlate information obtained by wire tapping  including speech recognition and telecommunications traffic analysis  monitoring of financial transactions  automatic number plate recognition  the tracking of the position of mobile telephones  and facial recognition systems and the like which recognize people by their appearance  gait  DNA profiling  etc 

Smart cities edit 
Main article  Smart city
The development of smart cities has seen the increased adoption of surveillance technologies by governments  although the primary purpose of surveillance in such cities is to use information and communication technologies to control the urban environment  The implementation of such technology by a number of cities has resulted in increased efficiencies in urban infrastructure as well as improved community participation  Sensors and systems monitor a smart city s infrastructure  operations and activities and aim to help it run more efficiently  For example  the city could use less electricity  its traffic run more smoothly with fewer delays  its citizens use the city with more safety  hazards can be dealt with faster  citizen infractions of rules can be prevented  and the city s infrastructure  power distribution and roads with traffic lights for example  dynamically adjusted to respond to differing circumstances              
The development of smart city technology has also led to an increase in potential unwarranted intrusions into privacy and restrictions upon autonomy  The widespread incorporation of information and communication technologies within the daily life of urban residents results in increases in the surveillance capacity of states   to the extent that individuals may be unaware of what information is being accessed  when the access occurs and for what purpose  It is possible that such conditions could give rise to the development of an electronic police state  Shanghai  Amsterdam  San Jose  Dubai  Barcelona  Madrid  Stockholm  and New York are all cities that use various techniques from smart city technology

An electronic police state is a state in which the government aggressively uses electronic technologies to record  collect  store  organize  analyze  search  and distribute information about its citizens  The first use of the term  electronic police state  was likely in a posting by Jim Davis                Electronic police states also engage in mass government surveillance of landline and cellular telephone traffic  mail  email  web surfing  Internet searches  radio  and other forms of electronic communication as well as widespread use of video surveillance  The information is usually collected in secret 
The crucial elements are not politically based  so long as the government can afford the technology and the populace will permit it to be used  an electronic police state can form  The continual use of electronic mass surveillance can result in constant low level fear within the population  which can lead to self censorship and exerts a powerful coercive force upon the populace              

In popular culture edit
