A cyborg    sa b  r    a portmanteau of cybernetic and organism  is a being with both organic and biomechatronic body parts  The term was coined in      by Manfred Clynes and Nathan S  Kline             In contrast to biorobots and androids  the term cyborg applies to a living organism that has restored function or enhanced abilities due to the integration of some artificial component or technology that relies on feedback            


Description and definition edit 
Alternative names for a cyborg include cybernetic organism  cyber organism  cyber organic being  cybernetically enhanced organism  cybernetically augmented organism  technorganic being  techno organic being  and techno organism 
Unlike bionics  biorobotics  or androids  a cyborg is an organism that has restored function or  especially  enhanced abilities due to the integration of some artificial component or technology that relies on some sort of feedback  for example  prostheses  artificial organs  implants or  in some cases  wearable technology             Cyborg technologies may enable or support collective intelligence             A related idea is the  augmented human                                    While cyborgs are commonly thought of as mammals  including humans  the term can apply to any organism 

Placement and distinctions edit 
D  S  Halacy s Cyborg  Evolution of the Superman        featured an introduction which spoke of a  new frontier  that was  not merely space  but more profoundly the relationship between  inner space  to  outer space    a bridge   between mind and matter             
In  A Cyborg Manifesto   Donna Haraway rejects the notion of rigid boundaries between humanity and technology  arguing that  as humans depend on more technology over time  humanity and technology have become too interwoven to draw lines between them  She believes that since we have allowed and created machines and technology to be so advanced  there should be no reason to fear what we have created  and cyborgs should be embraced because they are part of human identities             However  Haraway has also expressed concern over the contradictions of scientific objectivity and the ethics of technological evolution  and has argued that  There are political consequences to scientific accounts of the world             

Biosocial definition edit 
According to some definitions of the term  the physical attachments that humans have with even the most basic technologies have already made them cyborgs              In a typical example  a human with an artificial cardiac pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator would be considered a cyborg  since these devices measure voltage potentials in the body  perform signal processing  and can deliver electrical stimuli  using a synthetic feedback mechanism to keep that person alive  Implants  especially cochlear implants  that combine mechanical modification with any kind of feedback response are also cybernetic enhancements  Some theorists     who       cite such modifications as contact lenses  hearing aids  smartphones              or intraocular lenses as examples of fitting humans with technology to enhance their biological capabilities 
The emerging trend of implanting microchips inside the body  mainly the hands   to make financial operations like a contactless payment  or basic tasks like opening a door  has been erroneously marketed as more recent examples of cybernetic enhancement  The latter has not yet seen significant traction outside niche areas in Scandinavia and in actual function is little more than a pre programmed Radio frequency identification  RFID  microchip encased in glass that does not interact with the human body  it is the same technology used in the microchips injected into animals for ease of identification   thus not fitting the definition of a cybernetic implant 
As cyborgs currently are on the rise  some theorists     who       argue there is a need to develop new definitions of aging  For instance  a bio techno social definition of aging has been suggested             
The term is also used to address human technology mixtures in the abstract  This includes not only commonly used pieces of technology such as phones  computers  the Internet  and so on  but also artifacts that are not usually considered technology  for example  pen and paper  and speech and language  When augmented with these technologies and connected in communication with people in other times and places  a person becomes capable of more than they were before  An example is a computer  which gains power by using Internet protocols to connect with other computers  Another example is a social media bot either a bot assisted human or a human assisted bot used to target social media with likes and shares              Cybernetic technologies thus include highways  pipes  electrical wiring  buildings  electrical plants  libraries  and other infrastructural constructs 
Bruce Sterling  in his Shaper Mechanist universe  suggested an idea of an alternative cyborg called  Lobster   which is made not by using internal implants  but by using an external shell  e g  a powered exoskeleton               Unlike human cyborgs  who appear human externally but are synthetic internally  e g   the Bishop type in the Alien franchise   Lobster looks inhuman externally but contains a human internally  such as in Elysium and RoboCop   The computer game Deus Ex  Invisible War prominently features cyborgs called Omar  Russian for  lobster  

Evolutionary perspective edit 
In       Hans Hass formulated a scientific view of the human machine hybrids he called  hypercells               They can expand their biological cell body with artificial artifacts and thus expand their performance body  The theory of hypercells or  Homo proteus   as Hass called the human machine hybrid to distinguish Homo sapiens  extends Charles Darwin s theory of evolution and deals with the course of evolution beyond humans 
In his      book Novacene  James Lovelock used the term  cyborgs  to refer to the next generation of beings who will become the  understanders of the future  and  lead the cosmos to self knowledge   While acknowledging the organic component in Clynes  and Kline s definition  he proposed that these cyborgs  will have designed and built themselves from the artificial intelligence systems we have already constructed   and used the term cyborg  to emphasize that the new intelligent beings will have arisen  like us  from Darwinian evolution              

Origins edit 
Engraving by an unknown author depicting a man machine hybrid      
The concept of a man machine mixture was widespread in science fiction before World War II  As early as       Edgar Allan Poe described a man with extensive prostheses in the short story  The Man That Was Used Up   In       Jean de La Hire introduced the Nyctalope  a science fiction hero who was perhaps the first literary cyborg  in Le Myst re des XV           fr       later translated as The Nyctalope on Mars                                       Nearly two decades later  Edmond Hamilton presented space explorers with a mixture of organic and machine parts in his      novel The Comet Doom  He later featured the talking  living brain of an old scientist  Simon Wright  floating in a transparent case  and in all the adventures of his famous hero  Captain Future  In       in the short story  No Woman Born   C  L  Moore wrote of Deirdre  a dancer  whose body was burned completely and whose brain was placed in a faceless but beautiful and supple mechanical body 
In       the term  cyborg  was coined by Manfred E  Clynes and Nathan S  Kline to refer to their conception of an enhanced human being who could survive in extraterrestrial environments            

For the exogenously extended organizational complex functioning as an integrated homeostatic system unconsciously  we propose the term  Cyborg  
Their concept was the outcome of thinking about the need for an intimate relationship between human and machine as the new frontier of space exploration was beginning to develop  A designer of physiological instrumentation and electronic data processing systems  Clynes was the chief research scientist in the Dynamic Simulation Laboratory at Rockland State Hospital in New York 
The term first appears in print   months earlier when The New York Times reported on the  Psychophysiological Aspects of Space Flight Symposium  where Clynes and Kline first presented their paper 

A cyborg is essentially a man machine system in which the control mechanisms of the human portion are modified externally by drugs or regulatory devices so that the being can live in an environment different from the normal one             
Thereafter  Hamilton would first use the term  cyborg  explicitly in the      short story   After a Judgment Day   to describe the  mechanical analogs  called  Charlies   explaining that   c yborgs  they had been called from the first one in the     s   cybernetic organisms  
In       a book titled Cyborg  Digital Destiny and Human Possibility in the Age of the Wearable computer was published by Doubleday              Some of the ideas in the book were incorporated into the documentary film Cyberman that same year 

Cyborg tissues in engineering edit 
Cyborg tissues structured with carbon nanotubes and plant or fungal cells have been used in artificial tissue engineering to produce new materials for mechanical and electrical uses 
Such work was presented by Raffaele Di Giacomo  Bruno Maresca  and others  at the Materials Research Society s spring conference on   April                   The cyborg obtained was inexpensive  light and had unique mechanical properties  It could also be shaped in the desired forms  Cells combined with multi walled carbon nanotubes  MWCNTs  co precipitated as a specific aggregate of cells and nanotubes that formed a viscous material  Likewise  dried cells still acted as a stable matrix for the MWCNT network  When observed by optical microscopy  the material resembled an artificial  tissue  composed of highly packed cells  The effect of cell drying was manifested by their  ghost cell  appearance  A rather specific physical interaction between MWCNTs and cells was observed by electron microscopy  suggesting that the cell wall  the outermost part of fungal and plant cells  may play a major active role in establishing a carbon nanotube s network and its stabilization  This novel material can be used in a wide range of electronic applications  from heating to sensing  For instance  using Candida albicans cells  a species of yeast that often lives inside the human gastrointestinal tract  cyborg tissue materials with temperature sensing properties have been reported

In current prosthetic applications  the C Leg system developed by Otto Bock HealthCare  is used to replace a human leg that has been amputated because of injury or illness  The use of sensors in the artificial C Leg aids in walking significantly by attempting to replicate the user s natural gait  as it would be prior to amputation              A similar system is being developed by the Swedish orthopedic company Integrum  the OPRA Implant System  which is surgically anchored and integrated by means of osseointegration into the skeleton of the remainder of the amputated limb              The same company has developed e OPRA  a will powered upper limb prosthesis system that is being evaluated in a clinical trial to allow sensory input to the central nervous system using pressure and temperature sensors in the prosthesis  finger tips                          Prostheses like the C Leg  the e OPRA Implant System  and the iLimb  are considered by some to be the first real steps towards the next generation of real world cyborg applications      citation needed      Additionally  cochlear implants and magnetic implants  which provide people with a sense that they would not otherwise have had  can additionally be thought of as creating cyborgs      citation needed     
In vision science  direct brain implants have been used to treat non congenital  acquired  blindness  One of the first scientists to come up with a working brain interface to restore sight was private researcher William Dobelle 
Dobelle s first prototype was implanted into  Jerry   a man blinded in adulthood  in       A single array BCI containing    electrodes was implanted onto Jerry s visual cortex and succeeded in producing phosphenes  the sensation of seeing light  The system included cameras mounted on glasses to send signals to the implant  Initially  the implant allowed Jerry to see shades of grey in a limited field of vision at a low frame rate  This also required him to be hooked up to a two ton mainframe  but shrinking electronics and faster computers made his artificial eye more portable and now enable him to perform simple tasks unassisted             
In       Philip Kennedy  a scientist and physician  created the world s first human cyborg from Johnny Ray  a Vietnam War veteran who suffered a stroke  Ray s body  as doctors called it  was  locked in   Ray wanted his old life back so he agreed to Kennedy s experiment  Kennedy embedded an implant he designed  and named a  neurotrophic electrode   near the injured part of Ray s brain so that Ray would be able to have some movement back in his body  The surgery went successfully  but in       Ray died             
In       Canadian Jens Naumann  also blinded in adulthood  became the first in a series of    paying patients to receive Dobelle s second generation implant  marking one of the earliest commercial uses of BCIs  The second generation device used a more sophisticated implant enabling better mapping of phosphenes into coherent vision  Phosphenes are spread out across the visual field in what researchers call the starry night effect  Immediately after his implant  Naumann was able to use his imperfectly restored vision to drive slowly around the parking area of the research institute             
In contrast to replacement technologies  in       under the heading Project Cyborg  a British scientist  Kevin Warwick  had an array of     electrodes fired into his nervous system to link his nervous system into the internet to investigate enhancement possibilities  With this in place  Warwick successfully carried out a series of experiments including extending his nervous system over the internet to control a robotic hand  also receiving feedback from the fingertips to control the hand s grip  This was a form of extended sensory input  Subsequently  he investigated ultrasonic input to remotely detect the distance to objects  Finally  with electrodes also implanted into his wife s nervous system  they conducted the first direct electronic communication experiment between the nervous systems of two humans                         
Since       British artist Neil Harbisson has had a cyborg antenna implanted in his head that allows him to extend his perception of colors beyond the human visual spectrum through vibrations in his skull              His antenna was included within his      passport photograph which has been said to confirm his cyborg status              In      at TEDGlobal              Harbisson explained that he started to feel like a cyborg when he noticed that the software and his brain had united and given him an extra sense              Harbisson is a co founder of the Cyborg Foundation                    and cofounded the Transpecies Society in       which is an association that empowers individuals with non human identities and supports them in their decisions to develop unique senses and new organs              Neil Harbisson is a global advocate for the rights of cyborgs 
Rob Spence  a Toronto based filmmaker  who titles himself a real life  Eyeborg   severely damaged his right eye in a shooting accident on his grandfather s farm as a child             
Many years later  in       he decided to have his ever deteriorating and now technically blind eye surgically removed              whereafter he wore an eyepatch for some time before he later  after having played for some time with the idea of installing a camera instead  contacted professor Steve Mann at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  an expert in wearable computing and cyborg technology             
Under Mann s guidance  Spence  at age     created a prototype in the form of the miniature camera which could be fitted inside his prosthetic eye  an invention that would come to be named by Time magazine as one of the best inventions of       The bionic eye records everything he sees and contains a          mm   low resolution video camera  a small round printed circuit board  a wireless video transmitter  which allows him to transmit what he is seeing in real time to a computer  and a   volt rechargeable VARTA microbattery  The eye is not connected to his brain and has not restored his sense of vision  Additionally  Spence has also installed a laser like LED light in one version of the prototype             
Furthermore  many people with multifunctional radio frequency identification  RFID  microchips injected into a hand are known to exist  With the chips they are able to swipe cards  open or unlock doors  operate devices such as printers or  with some using cryptocurrency  buy products  such as drinks  with a wave of the hand                                                             

bodyNET edit 
bodyNET is an application of human electronic interaction currently     when       in development by researchers from Stanford University              The technology is based on stretchable semiconductor materials  Elastronic   According to their article in Nature  the technology is composed of smart devices  screens  and a network of sensors that can be implanted into the body  woven into the skin or worn as clothes  It has been suggested that this platform can potentially replace the smartphone in the future

In medicine  there are two important and different types of cyborgs  the restorative and the enhanced  Restorative technologies  restore lost function  organs  and limbs               The key aspect of restorative cyborgization is the repair of broken or missing processes to revert to a healthy or average level of function  There is no enhancement to the original faculties and processes that were lost 
On the contrary  the enhanced cyborg  follows a principle  and it is the principle of optimal performance  maximising output  the information or modifications obtained  and minimising input  the energy expended in the process                Thus  the enhanced cyborg intends to exceed normal processes or even gain new functions that were not originally present 

Prosthetics edit 
Although prostheses in general supplement lost or damaged body parts with the integration of a mechanical artifice  bionic implants in medicine allow model organs or body parts to mimic the original function more closely  Michael Chorost wrote a memoir of his experience with cochlear implants  or bionic ears  titled Rebuilt  How Becoming Part Computer Made Me More Human              Jesse Sullivan became one of the first people to operate a fully robotic limb through a nerve muscle graft  enabling him a complex range of motions beyond that of previous prosthetics              By       a fully functioning artificial heart was developed              The continued technological development of bionic and  bio  nanotechnologies begins to raise the question of enhancement  and of the future possibilities for cyborgs which surpass the original functionality of the biological model  The ethics and desirability of  enhancement prosthetics  have been debated  their proponents include the transhumanist movement  with its belief that new technologies can assist the human race in developing beyond its present  normative limitations such as aging and disease  as well as other  more general inabilities  such as limitations on speed  strength  endurance  and intelligence  Opponents of the concept describe what they believe to be biases which propel the development and acceptance of such technologies  namely  a bias towards functionality and efficiency that may compel assent to a view of human people which de emphasizes as defining characteristics actual manifestations of humanity and personhood  in favor of definition in terms of upgrades  versions  and utility                         
Retinal implants are another form of cyborgization in medicine  The theory behind retinal stimulation to restore vision for those suffering from retinitis pigmentosa and vision loss due to aging  conditions in which people have an abnormally low number of retinal ganglion cells   is that the retinal implant and electrical stimulation would act as a substitute for the missing ganglion cells  cells which connect the eye to the brain  
While the work to perfect this technology is still being done  there have already been major advances in the use of electronic stimulation of the retina to allow the eye to sense patterns of light  A specialized camera is worn by the subject  such as on the frames of their glasses  which converts the image into a pattern of electrical stimulation  A chip located in the user s eye would then electrically stimulate the retina with this pattern by exciting certain nerve endings which transmit the image to the optic centers of the brain  and the image would then appear to the user  If technological advances proceed as planned  this technology may be used by thousands of blind people and restore vision to most of them 
A similar process has been created to aid people who have lost their vocal cords  This experimental device would do away with previously used robotic sounding voice simulators  The transmission of sound would start with a surgery to redirect the nerve that controls the voice and sound production to a muscle in the neck  where a nearby sensor would be able to pick up its electrical signals  The signals would then move to a processor which would control the timing and pitch of a voice simulator  That simulator would then vibrate producing a multi tonal sound that could be shaped into words by the mouth             
An article published in Nature Materials in      reported research on  cyborg tissues   engineered human tissues with embedded three dimensional mesh of nanoscale wires   with possible medical implications             
In       researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign and Washington University in St  Louis had developed a device that could keep a heart beating endlessly  By using  D printing and computer modeling  these scientists developed an electronic membrane that could successfully replace pacemakers  The device uses a  spider web like network of sensors and electrodes  to monitor and maintain a normal heart rate with electrical stimuli  Unlike traditional pacemakers that are similar from patient to patient  the elastic heart glove is made custom by using high resolution imaging technology  The first prototype was created to fit a rabbit s heart  operating the organ in an oxygen and nutrient rich solution  The stretchable material and circuits of the apparatus were first constructed by Professor John A  Rogers in which the electrodes are arranged in an s shape design to allow them to expand and bend without breaking  Although the device is only currently used as a research tool to study changes in heart rate  in the future the membrane may serve as a safeguard against heart attacks             

Neural enhancement and restoration edit 
A brain computer interface  or BCI  provides a direct path of communication from the brain to an external device  effectively creating a cyborg  Research into invasive BCIs  which use electrodes implanted directly into the grey matter of the brain  has focused on restoring damaged eyesight in the blind and providing functionality to paralyzed people  most notably those with severe cases  such as locked in syndrome  This technology could enable people who are missing a limb or are in a wheelchair the power to control the devices that aid them through neural signals sent from the brain implants directly to computers or the devices  It is possible that this technology will also eventually be used with healthy people             
Deep brain stimulation is a neurological surgical procedure used for therapeutic purposes  This process has aided in treating patients diagnosed with Parkinson s disease  Alzheimer s disease  Tourette syndrome  epilepsy  chronic headaches  and mental disorders  After the patient is unconscious  through anesthesia  brain pacemakers or electrodes  are implanted into the region of the brain where the cause of the disease is present  The region of the brain is then stimulated by bursts of electric current to disrupt the oncoming surge of seizures  Like all invasive procedures  deep brain stimulation may put the patient at a higher risk  However  there have been more improvements in recent years with deep brain stimulation than any available drug treatment             

Pharmacology edit 
Automated insulin delivery systems  colloquially also known as the  artificial pancreas   are a substitute for the lack of natural insulin production by the body  most notably in Type   Diabetes  Currently available systems combine a continuous glucose monitor with an insulin pump that can be remote controlled  forming a control loop that automatically adjusts the insulin dosage depending on the current blood glucose level  Examples of commercial systems that implement such a control loop are the MiniMed    G from Medtronic             and the t slim x  from Tandem Diabetes Care              Do it yourself artificial pancreas technologies also exist  though these are not verified or approved by any regulatory agency              Upcoming next generation artificial pancreas technologies include automatic glucagon infusion in addition to insulin  to help prevent hypoglycemia and improve efficiency  One example of such a bi hormonal system is the Beta Bionics iLet

Military organizations  research has recently focused on the use of cyborg animals for the purposes of a supposed tactical advantage  DARPA has announced its interest in developing  cyborg insects  to transmit data from sensors implanted into the insect during the pupa stage  The insect s motion would be controlled from a microelectromechanical system  MEMS  and could conceivably survey an environment or detect explosives and gas              Similarly  DARPA is developing a neural implant to remotely control the movement of sharks  The shark s unique senses would then be exploited to provide data feedback in relation to enemy ship movement or underwater explosives             
In       researchers at Cornell University invented             a new surgical procedure to implant artificial structures into insects during their metamorphic development                          The first insect cyborgs  moths with integrated electronics in their thorax  were demonstrated by the same researchers                          The initial success of the techniques has resulted in increased research and the creation of a program called Hybrid Insect MEMS  HI MEMS   Its goal  according to DARPA s Microsystems Technology Office  is to develop  tightly coupled machine insect interfaces by placing micro mechanical systems inside the insects during the early stages of metamorphosis              
The use of neural implants has recently been attempted  with success  on cockroaches  Surgically applied electrodes were put on the insect  which was remotely controlled by a human  The results  although sometimes different  basically showed that the cockroach could be controlled by the impulses it received through the electrodes  DARPA is now funding this research because of its obvious beneficial applications to the military and other areas            
In      at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  IEEE  MEMS conference in Italy  researchers demonstrated the first  wireless  flying beetle cyborg              Engineers at the University of California  Berkeley  have pioneered the design of a  remote controlled beetle   funded by the DARPA HI MEMS Program              This was followed later that year by the demonstration of wireless control of a  lift assisted  moth cyborg             
Eventually researchers plan to develop HI MEMS for dragonflies  bees  rats  and pigeons                          For the HI MEMS cybernetic bug to be considered a success  it must fly     metres           ft  from a starting point  guided via computer into a controlled landing within   metres          ft  of a specific end point  Once landed  the cybernetic bug must remain in place             
In       an article published in Science Robotics             by researchers at the University of Washington reported a mechanically steerable wireless camera attached to beetles              Miniature cameras weighing          mg were attached to live beetles of the Tenebrionid genera Asbolus and Eleodes  The camera wirelessly streamed video to a smartphone via Bluetooth for up to   hours and the user could remotely steer the camera to achieve a bug s eye view

In       Cybathlon became the first cyborg  Olympics   celebrated in Zurich  Switzerland  it was the first worldwide and official celebration of cyborg sports  In this event     teams of people with disabilities used technological developments to turn themselves into cyborg athletes  There were   different events and its competitors used and controlled advanced technologies such as powered prosthetic legs and arms  robotic exoskeletons  bikes  and motorized wheelchairs             
This was already a remarkable improvement  as it allowed disabled people to compete and showed the several technological enhancements that are already making a difference  however  it showed that there is still a long way to go  For instance  the exoskeleton race still required its participants to stand up from a chair and sit down  navigate a slalom and other simple activities such as walking over stepping stones and climbing up and down stairs  Despite the simplicity of these activities    of the    teams that participated in the event drop off before the start             
Nonetheless  one of the main goals of this event and such simple activities is to show how technological enhancements and advanced prosthetics can make a difference in people s lives  The next Cybathlon that was expected to occur in       was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic

The concept of the cyborg is often associated with science fiction  However  many artists have incorporated and reappropriated the idea of cybernetic organisms into their work  using disparate aesthetics and often realising actual cyborg constructs  their works range from performances  to paintings and installations  Some of the pioneering artists who created such works are H  R  Giger  Stelarc  Orlan  Shu Lea Cheang  Lee Bul  Tim Hawkinson  Steve Mann  Patricia Piccinini  More recently  this type of artistic practice has been expanded upon by artists such as Marco Donnarumma  Wafaa Bilal  Neil Harbisson  Moon Ribas  Manel De Aguas and Quimera Rosa 
Stelarc is a performance artist who has visually probed and acoustically amplified his body  He uses medical instruments  prosthetics  robotics  virtual reality systems  the Internet and biotechnology to explore alternate  intimate and involuntary interfaces with the body  He has made three films of the inside of his body and has performed with a third hand and a virtual arm  Between      and      he completed    body suspension performances with hooks into the skin  For  Third Ear   he surgically constructed an extra ear within his arm that was internet enabled  making it a publicly accessible acoustical organ for people in other places              He is presently performing as his avatar from his second life site             
Tim Hawkinson promotes the idea that bodies and machines are coming together as one  where human features are combined with technology to create the Cyborg  Hawkinson s piece Emoter presented how society is now dependent on technology             
Marco Donnarumma is a performance artist and new media artist  In his work the body becomes a morphing language to speak critically of ritual  power and technology  For his    Configurations  cycle  between      and       he engineered and created six AI prostheses  each embodying an uncanny configuration of the machinic with the organic              The prostheses   designed together with a team of artists and scientists   are useless prostheses  paradoxical objects designed for the body  but not to enhance it  rather to subtract functions from it  a skin cutting robot with a steel metal knife  a facial prosthesis which blocks the wearer s gaze with a mechanical arm  and two robotic spines that function as additional limbs without a body  The prostheses have been created to act as performers with their own agency  that is  to interact with their human partners without being controlled externally  The machines are embedded with biomimetic neural networks  information processing algorithms inspired by the biological nervous system of mammals  Developed by Donnarumma in collaboration with the Neurorobotics Research Laboratory  DE   these neural networks endow the machines with artificial cognitive and sensorimotor skills             
Wafaa Bilal is an Iraqi American performance artist who had a small    megapixel digital camera surgically implanted into the back of his head  part of a project entitled  rd I              For one year  beginning    December       an image was captured once per minute    hours a day and streamed live to www  rdi me and the Mathaf  Arab Museum of Modern Art  The site also displays Bilal s location via GPS  Bilal says that the reason why he put the camera in the back of the head was to make an  allegorical statement about the things we don t see and leave behind               As a professor at NYU  this project raised privacy issues  and so Bilal was asked to ensure that his camera did not take photographs in NYU buildings             
Machines are becoming more ubiquitous in the artistic process itself  with computerized drawing pads replacing pen and paper  and drum machines becoming nearly as popular as human drummers  Composers such as Brian Eno have developed and used software that can build entire musical scores from a few basic mathematical parameters             
Scott Draves is a generative artist whose work is explicitly described as a  cyborg mind   His Electric Sheep project generates abstract art by combining the work of many computers and people over the internet             

Artists as cyborgs edit 
Artists have explored the term cyborg from a perspective involving imagination  Some work to make an abstract idea of technological and human bodily union apparent to reality in an art form using varying mediums  from sculptures and drawings to digital renderings 
Artists who seek to make cyborg based fantasies a reality often call themselves cyborg artists  or may consider their artwork  cyborg   How an artist or their work may be considered cyborg will vary depending upon the interpreter s flexibility with the term 
Scholars that rely upon a strict  technical description of a cyborg  often going by Norbert Wiener s cybernetic theory and Manfred E  Clynes and Nathan S  Kline s first use of the term  would likely argue that most cyborg artists do not qualify to be considered cyborgs              Scholars considering a more flexible description of cyborgs may argue it incorporates more than cybernetics              Others may speak of defining subcategories  or specialized cyborg types  that qualify different levels of cyborg at which technology influences an individual  This may range from technological instruments being external  temporary  and removable to being fully integrated and permanent              Nonetheless  cyborg artists are artists  Being so  it can be expected for them to incorporate the cyborg idea rather than a strict  technical representation of the term              seeing how their work will sometimes revolve around other purposes outside of cyborgism             

In body modification edit 
As medical technology becomes more advanced  some techniques and innovations are adopted by the body modification community  While not yet cyborgs in the strict definition of Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline  technological developments like implantable silicon silk electronics              augmented reality             and QR codes             are bridging the disconnect between technology and the body  Hypothetical technologies such as digital tattoo interfaces                          would blend body modification aesthetics with interactivity and functionality  bringing a transhumanist way of life into present day reality 
In addition  it is quite plausible for anxiety expression to manifest  Individuals may experience pre implantation feelings of fear and nervousness  To this end  individuals may also embody feelings of uneasiness  particularly in a socialized setting  due to their post operative  technologically augmented bodies  and mutual unfamiliarity with the mechanical insertion  Anxieties may be linked to notions of otherness or a cyborged identity              

In space edit 
Sending humans to space is a dangerous task in which the implementation of various cyborg technologies could be used in the future for risk mitigation               Stephen Hawking  a renowned physicist  stated  Life on Earth is at the ever increasing risk of being wiped out by a disaster such as sudden global warming  nuclear war     I think the human race has no future if it doesn t go into space   The difficulties associated with space travel could mean it might be centuries before humans ever become a multi planet species      citation needed      There are many effects of spaceflight on the human body  One major issue of space exploration is the biological need for oxygen  If this necessity was taken out of the equation  space exploration would be revolutionized  A theory proposed by Manfred E  Clynes and Nathan S  Kline is aimed at tackling this problem  The two scientists theorized that the use of an inverse fuel cell that is  capable of reducing CO  to its components with the removal of the carbon and re circulation of the oxygen                   could make breathing unnecessary  Another prominent issue is radiation exposure  Yearly  the average human on earth is exposed to approximately      rem of radiation  while an astronaut aboard the International Space Station for    days is exposed to   rem               To tackle the issue  Clynes and Kline theorized a cyborg containing a sensor that would detect radiation levels and a Rose osmotic pump  which would automatically inject protective pharmaceuticals in appropriate doses   Experiments injecting these protective pharmaceuticals into monkeys have shown positive results in increasing radiation resistance              
Although the effects of spaceflight on our bodies are an important issue  the advancement of propulsion technology is just as important  With our current technology  it would take us about     days to get to Mars               A study backed by NASA proposes an interesting way to tackle this issue through deep sleep  or torpor  With this technique  it would  reduce astronauts  metabolic functions with existing medical procedures                So far experiments have only resulted in patients being in torpor state for one week  Advancements to allow for longer states of deep sleep would lower the cost of the trip to Mars as a result of reduced astronaut resource consumption 

In cognitive science edit

Theorists such as Andy Clark suggest that interactions between humans and technology result in the creation of a cyborg system  In this model  cyborg is defined as a part biological  part mechanical system that results in the augmentation of the biological component and the creation of a more complex whole  Clark argues that this broadened definition is necessary to an understanding of human cognition  He suggests that any tool which is used to offload part of a cognitive process may be considered the mechanical component of a cyborg system  Examples of this human and technology cyborg system can be very low tech and simplistic  such as using a calculator to perform basic mathematical operations or pen and paper to make notes  or as high tech as using a personal computer or phone  According to Clark  these interactions between a person and a form of technology integrate that technology into the cognitive process in a way that is analogous to the way that a technology that would fit the traditional concept of cyborg augmentation becomes integrated with its biological host  Because all humans in some way use technology to augment their cognitive processes  Clark comes to the conclusion that we are  natural born cyborgs                Professor Donna Haraway also theorizes that people  metaphorically or literally  have been cyborgs since the late twentieth century  If one considers the mind and body as one  much of humanity is aided with technology in almost every way  which hybridizes humans with technology              

Future scope and regulation of implantable technologies edit 
See also  Mobile security and Medical device        Regulation and oversight
Given the technical scope of current and future implantable sensory telemetric devices  such devices will be greatly proliferated  and will have connections to commercial  medical  and governmental networks  For example  in the medical sector  patients will be able to log in to their home computer  and thus visit virtual doctor s offices  medical databases  and receive medical prognoses from the comfort of their own home from the data collected through their implanted telemetric devices               However  this online network presents large security concerns because it has been proven by several U S  universities that hackers could get onto these networks and shut down peoples  electronic prosthetics               Cyborg data mining refers to the collection of data produced by implantable devices 
These sorts of technologies are already present in the U S  workforce as a firm in River Falls  Wisconsin  called Three Square Market partnered with a Swedish firm Biohacks Technology to implant RFID microchips  which are about the size of a grain of rice  in the hands of its employees that allow employees to access offices  computers  and even vending machines  More than    of the firm s    employees were chipped  It was confirmed that the American Food and Drug Administration approved of these implantations               If these devices are to be proliferated within society  then the question that begs to be answered is what regulatory agency will oversee the operations  monitoring  and security of these devices  According to this case study of Three Square Market  it seems that the FDA is assuming a role in regulating and monitoring these devices  It has been argued that a new regulatory framework needs to be developed so that the law keeps up with developments in implantable technologies              

Cyborg Foundation edit 
In       the Cyborg Foundation became the world s first international organization dedicated to help humans become cyborgs               The foundation was created by cyborg Neil Harbisson and Moon Ribas as a response to the growing number of letters and emails received from people around the world interested in becoming cyborgs               The foundation s main aims are to extend human senses and abilities by creating and applying cybernetic extensions to the body               to promote the use of cybernetics in cultural events and to defend cyborg rights               In       the foundation  based in Matar   Barcelona   was the overall winner of the Cre tic Awards  organized by Tecnocampus Matar               
In       Spanish film director Rafel Duran Torrent  created a short film about the Cyborg Foundation  In       the film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival s Focus Forward Filmmakers Competition and was awarded US

Remote controlled rechargeable cyborg insects             
The US based company Backyard Brains released what they refer to as the  world s first commercially available cyborg  called the RoboRoach  The project started as a senior design project for a University of Michigan biomedical engineering student in                    and was launched as an available beta product on    February                    The RoboRoach was officially released into production via a TED talk at the TED Global conference               and via the crowdsourcing website Kickstarter in                    the kit allows students to use microstimulation to momentarily control the movements of a walking cockroach  left and right  using a Bluetooth enabled smartphone as the controller 
Other groups have developed cyborg insects  including researchers at North Carolina State University                            UC Berkeley                            and Nanyang Technological University  Singapore                                                                   but the RoboRoach was the first kit available to the general public and was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health as a device to serve as a teaching aid to promote an interest in neuroscience               Several animal welfare organizations including the RSPCA              and PETA              have expressed concerns about the ethics and welfare of animals in this project  In       remote controlled cyborg cockroaches functional if moving  or moved  to sunlight for recharging were presented  They could be used e g  for purposes of inspecting hazardous areas or quickly finding humans underneath hard to access rubbles at disaster sites                                                     
In the late     s  scientists created cyborg jellyfish using a microelectronic prosthetic that propels the animal to swim almost three times faster while using just twice the metabolic energy of their unmodified peers  The prosthetics can be removed without harming the jellyfish                           

Bacterial cyborg cells edit 
A combination of synthetic biology  nanotechnology and materials science approaches have been used to create a few different iterations of bacterial cyborg cells                                         These different types of mechanically enhanced bacteria are created with so called bionic manufacturing principles that combine natural cells with abiotic materials  In       researchers from the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Nebraska  Lincoln created a super sensitive humidity sensor by coating the bacteria Bacillus cereus with gold nanoparticles  being the first to use a microorganism to make an electronic device and presumably the first cyborg bacteria or cellborg circuit               Researchers from the Department of Chemistry at the University of California  Berkeley published a series of articles in      describing the development of cyborg bacteria capable to harvest sunlight more efficiently than plants               In the first study  the researchers induced the self photosensitization of a nonphotosynthetic bacterium  Moorella thermoacetica  with cadmium sulfide nanoparticles  enabling the photosynthesis of acetic acid from carbon dioxide               A follow up article described the elucidation of the mechanism of semiconductor to bacterium electron transfer that allows the transformation of carbon dioxide and sunlight into acetic acid               Scientists of the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of California  Davis and Academia Sinica in Taiwan  developed a different approach to create cyborg cells by assembling a synthetic hydrogel inside the bacterial cytoplasm of Escherichia  coli cells rendering them incapable of dividing and making them resistant to environmental factors  antibiotics and high oxidative stress               The intracellular infusion of synthetic hydrogel provides these cyborg cells with an artificial cytoskeleton and their acquired tolerance makes them well placed to become a new class of drug delivery systems positioned between classical synthetic materials and cell based systems
