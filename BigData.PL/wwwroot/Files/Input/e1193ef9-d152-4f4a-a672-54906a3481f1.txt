							The Democratic Coalition has rejected the recent presidential decree regarding regulatory bodies  and called on President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi to withdraw it 
The decree institutes Law          which allows for the president to dismiss heads and members of independent bodies and regulatory authorities  Dismissals can come under four circumstances  according to the decree 
The coalition which contains eight liberal and leftist parties and political movements such as Al Dostour  Al Karama  and the Popular Current  said in an official statement on Monday   The decree violates the constitution and basic principles that build democratic nations  
Khaled Daoud  spokesperson of the Al Dostour Party  told Daily News Egypt   There is no clear urgency for issuing such a decree before the parliament  which is initially mandated to draft such a law  is formed  
Article     of the      constitution states that there is an administrative authority  an independent authority mandated to investigate in administrative and financial violations  It has the right to take disciplinary acts in those violations  and appeals on its decisions are submitted through the state council  It is also responsible for proceeding with and following up on all discipline lawsuits in front of the state council according to the law  All its members are subject to the rights given to the judicial power members 
The statement also added that this decree extends the president s power over the three branches of the government which disturbs the state concept and threats all its institutions including the president himself 
Following the Muslim Brotherhood regime s ouster in       at least     decrees were issued by former interim president Adly Mansour and current President Al Sisi  Many of them were unconstitutional  such as the controversial protest law and the electoral districts law  the latter of which was rejected by the Supreme Constitutional Court in March
