Deep learning facial recognition system
DeepFace is a deep learning facial recognition system created by a research group at Facebook  It identifies human faces in digital images  The program employs a nine layer neural network with over     million connection weights and was trained on four million images uploaded by Facebook users                         The Facebook Research team has stated that the DeepFace method reaches an accuracy of                on Labeled Faces in the Wild  LFW  data set where human beings have                    This means that DeepFace is sometimes more successful than human beings  As a result of growing societal concerns Meta announced            that it plans to shut down Facebook facial recognition system  deleting the face scan data of more than one billion users             This change will represent one of the largest shifts in facial recognition usage in the technology s history  Facebook planned to delete by December      more than one billion facial recognition templates  which are digital scans of facial features  However  it did not plan to eliminate DeepFace which is the software that powers the facial recognition system  The company has also not ruled out incorporating facial recognition technology into future products  according to Meta spokesperson            


Commercial rollout edit 
Origin edit 
DeepFace was produced by a collection of scientists from Facebook s artificial intelligence research team  The team includes Yainiv Taigman and a Facebook research scientist Ming Yang  They were also joined by Lior Wolf  a faculty member from Tel Aviv University  Yaniv Taigman  came to Facebook when Facebook acquired Face com in      
Facebook started rolling out DeepFace  to its users in early       and have continuously expanding DeepFace s use and software              DeepFace  according to the director of Facebook s artificial intelligence research  is not intended to invade individual privacy  Instead  DeepFace alerts individuals when their face appears in any photo posted on Facebook  When they receive this notification  they have the option of removing their face from the photo            

European Union edit 
When the DeepFace technology was initially deployed  users had the option to turn DeepFace off  However  they were not notified that it was on             Because of this  DeepFace was not released in the European Union  A data privacy law in the EU argued that Facebook s facial recognition did not comply with EU data protection laws  Because users do not consent to all the uses of their biometric data  it does not comply            

Accuracy edit 
DeepFace systems can identify faces with     accuracy  almost the same accuracy as a human in the same position  Facebook s facial recognition is more effective than the FBI s technology  which has     accuracy             Google s technology  FaceNet is more successful than DeepFace using the same data sets  FaceNet set a record for accuracy          Google s FaceNet incorporates data from Google Photos             

Applications edit 
Facebook uses individual facial recognition templates to find photos that an individual is in so they can review  engage  or share the content  DeepFace protects individuals from impersonation or identity theft  Take  for example  an instance where an individual used someone s profile photo as their own  Through DeepFace        Facebook can identify and alert the person whose      information is being misused              To ensure that individuals have control over their facial recognition  Facebook does not share facial templates  Additionally  Facebook will remove images from facial recognition templates if someone has deleted their account or untagged themself from a photo  Individuals also have the ability to turn their facial recognition off on Facebook  If the feature is turned off  Facebook will cease facial recognition for that individual        
Following the release of DeepFace in       its uses have remained fairly stagnant  Because more individuals have uploaded images to Facebook  the algorithm has gotten more accurate  Facebook s DeepFace is the largest facial recognition dataset that currently exists  Because of this  some individuals argue that      Facebook s facial ID database could be distributed to government agencies              These uses  however  would be prohibited by most data privacy laws  In response to privacy concerns  Facebook removed their automatic facial recognition feature   allowing individuals to opt in to tagging through DeepFace  This change was implemented in      

Architecture edit 
The DeepFace system consists of four modules   D alignment   D alignment  frontalization  and neural network  An image of a face is passed through them in sequence  resulting in a      dimensional feature vector representing the face  The feature vector can then be further processed for many different tasks  For example  to identify the face  one can compare it against a list of feature vectors of known faces  and identify the face with the most similar feature vector 
DeepFace uses fiducial point detectors based on existing databases to direct the alignment of faces  The facial alignment begins with a  D alignment  and then continues with  D alignment and frontalization  That is  DeepFace s process is two steps  First  it corrects the angles of an image so that the face in the photo is looking forward  To accomplish this  it uses a   D model of a face             

 D alignment edit 
The  D alignment module detects   fiducial points on the detected face   the center of the eyes  tip of the nose and mouth location  These points are translated onto a warped image to help detect the face  However   D transformation fails to compensate for rotations that are out of place 

 D alignment edit 
In order to align faces  DeepFace uses a generic  D model wherein  D images are cropped as  D versions  The  D image has    fiducial points  After the image has been warped  there are    anchor points manually placed on the image to match the    fiducial points  A  D to  D camera is then fitted that minimizes losses  Because  D detected points on the contour of the face can be inaccurate  this step is important 

Frontalization edit 
Because full perspective projections are not modeled  the fitted camera is only an approximation of the individual s actual face  To reduce errors  DeepFace aims to warp the  D images with smaller distortions  Also  thee camera P is capable of replacing parts of the image and blending them with their symmetrical counterparts 

Neural network edit 
The neural network is a sequence of layers  arranged as follows  convolutional layer   max pooling   convolutional layer     locally connected layers   fully connected layer 
The input is an RGB image of the face  scaled to resolution

      displaystyle     times     
  
  and the output is a real vector of dimension       being the feature vector of the face image 
In the      paper              an additional fully connected layer is added at the end to classify the face image into one of      possible persons that the network had seen during training time 

Reactions edit 
Industry edit 
AI researcher Ben Goertzel said Facebook had  pretty convincingly solved face recognition  with the project  but said it would be incorrect to conclude that deep learning is the entire solution to AI 
Neeraj Kumar  a researcher at the University of Washington said that Facebook s DeepFace shows how large sets of outside data can result in a  higher capacity  model  Because of Facebook s wide access to images of individuals  their facial recognition software can perform better than other software with much smaller data sets                         

Media edit 
A Huffington Post piece called the technology  creepy   citing data privacy concerns  noted that some European governments had already required Facebook to delete facial recognition data              According to Broadcasting  amp  Cable  both Facebook and Google had been invited by the Center for Digital Democracy to attend a      National Telecommunications and Information Administration  stakeholder meeting  to help develop a consumer privacy Bill of Rights  but they both declined  Broadcasting  amp  Cable also noted that Facebook had not released any press announcements concerning DeepFace  although their research paper had been published earlier in the month  Slate said that DeepFace was not being publicized by Facebook because it is wary of another round of headlines decrying DeepFace s creepiness 

Users edit 
Many individuals fear facial recognition technology                         
The technology s nearly perfect accuracy allows social media companies to create digital profiles of millions of Americans             
However  an individual s fear of facial recognition and other privacy concerns does not correspond to a decrease in social media use  Instead  attitudes towards privacy and privacy settings do not have a large impact on an individual s intention to use Facebook apps                                      Because Facebook is a social media site  individual fears about privacy get over ruled by a desire to participate in social media             

Privacy concerns edit 
BIPA lawsuit edit 
Facebook users raised a class action lawsuit against Facebook under Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act  BIPA               Illinois has the most comprehensive biometric privacy legislation  regulating the collection of biometric information by commercial entities              Illinois  BIPA requires a corporation that obtains a person s biometric information to obtain a written release  provide them notice that their information is being collected  and state the duration the information will be collected  The lawsuit raised against DeepFace alleges that Facebook s collection of facial identification information for the purpose of the tag suggestion tool violates BIPA              Because Facebook does not give notice or consent to individuals when they use this tool  Facebook users argue that it violates BIPA                    The Ninth Circuit denied Facebook s motion to dismiss the case and ultimately certified the case  Facebook sought to appeal to the certification of the Ninth Circuit decision which was ultimately granted  Facebook claims that the case should not have been verified because Plaintiffs have no alleged any harm beyond Facebook s violation of BIPA  Facebook removed their automatic facial recognition tagging feature in       in response to the concerns raised in the lawsuit              Facebook proposed a      million settlement to the case  which was rejected  When Facebook increased the settlement to      million  the court accepted it  Facebook was ordered to pay their      million       settlement in early March           million residents of Illinois will receive at least                  
In July       Facebook announced that it is building teams that will look into racism in its algorithms              Facebook s teams will work with Facebook s Responsible AI team to study bias in their systems  The implementation of these programs is recent  and it is still unclear what reforms will be made             

Ten year challenge edit 
In       a Facebook challenge went viral asking users to post a photo from    years ago and one from       The challenge was coined the     Year challenge   More than   million people participated in the challenge  including many celebrities  Worry arose that Facebook s    year challenge was designed to train Facebook s facial recognition database  Kate O Neill  a writer for Wired  wrote an op ed that echoed this possibility              Facebook denied that they played a role in generating the challenge              However  individuals have argued that the concerns that underscore theories around the    year challenge are echoed by broader concerns about Facebook and the right to privacy             

Racism in facial identification technology edit 
Facial recognition algorithms are not universally successful              While the algorithms are capable of classifying faces with over     accuracy in some cases  accuracy is lower when the algorithms are applied to women  black individuals  and young people               The systems falsely identify black and Asian faces    to     times more than they do with white faces              Because algorithms are primarily trained with white men  systems like DeepFace have a more difficult time identifying them               It is projected that once facial recognition data bases are trained to identify people of color   exposing them to more diverse faces   they will be more successful at identification
