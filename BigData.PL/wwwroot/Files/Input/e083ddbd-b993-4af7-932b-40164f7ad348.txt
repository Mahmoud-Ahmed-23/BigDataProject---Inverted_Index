 Psychology     portalvte
Human intelligence is the intellectual capability of humans  which is marked by complex cognitive feats and high levels of motivation and self awareness  Using their intelligence  humans are able to learn  form concepts  understand  and apply logic and reason  Human intelligence is also thought to encompass their capacities to recognize patterns  plan  innovate  solve problems  make decisions  retain information  and use language to communicate 
There are conflicting ideas about how intelligence should be conceptualized and measured  In psychometrics  human intelligence is commonly assessed by intelligence quotient  IQ  tests  although the validity of these tests is disputed  Several subcategories of intelligence  such as emotional intelligence and social intelligence  have been proposed  and there remains significant debate as to whether these represent distinct forms of intelligence             
There is also ongoing debate regarding how an individual s level of intelligence is formed  ranging from the idea that intelligence is fixed at birth to the idea that it is malleable and can change depending on a person s mindset and efforts

Correlates edit 
As a construct and as measured by intelligence tests  intelligence is one of the most useful concepts in psychology  because it correlates with many relevant variables  for instance the probability of suffering an accident  or the amount of one s salary             Other examples include 

Education

Further information  Intelligence and education
According to a      metastudy of educational effects on intelligence  education appears to be the  most consistent  robust  and durable method  known for raising intelligence            

Personality
A landmark set of meta analyses synthesizing thousands of studies including millions of people from over    countries found that many personality traits are intricately related to cognitive abilities  Neuroticism related traits display the most negative relations  whereas traits like activity  industriousness  compassion  and openness are positively related to various abilities            
Myopia
A number of studies have shown a correlation between IQ and myopia             Some suggest that the reason for the correlation is environmental  either people with a higher IQ are more likely to damage their eyesight with prolonged reading  or people who read more are more likely to attain a higher IQ  others contend that a genetic link exists            
Aging
There is evidence that aging causes a decline in cognitive functions  In one cross sectional study  various cognitive functions measured declines by about     in z score from age    to age     the cognitive functions included speed of processing  working memory  and long term memory            
Genes
A number of single nucleotide polymorphisms in human DNA are correlated with higher IQ scores            
Motivation
Motivation is a factor that influences the results of the IQ test  People with higher motivation tend to obtain higher IQ scores             
Theories edit 
Relevance of IQ tests edit 
Further information         Insufficiency of measurement via IQ
In psychology  human intelligence is commonly assessed by IQ scores that are determined by IQ tests  In general  higher IQ scores are associated with better outcomes in life              However  while IQ test scores show a high degree of inter test reliability  and predict certain forms of achievement effectively  their construct validity as a holistic measure of human intelligence is considered dubious                          While IQ tests are generally understood to measure some forms of intelligence  they may fail to serve as an accurate measure of broader definitions of human intelligence inclusive of creativity and social intelligence              According to psychologist Wayne Weiten   IQ tests are valid measures of the kind of intelligence necessary to do well in academic work  But if the purpose is to assess intelligence in a broader sense  the validity of IQ tests is questionable              

Theory of multiple intelligences edit 
Main article  Theory of multiple intelligences
Howard Gardner s theory of multiple intelligences is based on studies of normal children and adults  of gifted individuals  including so called  savants    of persons who have suffered brain damage  of experts and virtuosos  and of individuals from diverse cultures  Gardner breaks intelligence down into components  In the first edition of his book Frames of Mind         he described seven distinct types of intelligence  logical mathematical  linguistic  spatial  musical  kinesthetic  interpersonal  and intrapersonal  In a second edition  he added two more types of intelligence  naturalist and existential intelligences  He argues that psychometric  IQ  tests address only linguistic and logical plus some aspects of spatial intelligence              A criticism of Gardner s theory is that it has never been tested  or subjected to peer review  by Gardner or anyone else  and indeed that it is unfalsifiable              Others  e g  Locke                    suggest that recognizing many specific forms of intelligence  specific aptitude theory  implies a political rather than scientific agenda  intended to appreciate the uniqueness in all individuals  rather than recognizing potentially true and meaningful differences in individual capacities  Schmidt and Hunter             suggest that the predictive validity of specific aptitudes over and above that of general mental ability  or  g   has not received empirical support  On the other hand  Jerome Bruner agreed with Gardner that the intelligences were  useful fictions   and went on to state that  his approach is so far beyond the data crunching of mental testers that it deserves to be cheered              

Triarchic theory of intelligence edit 
Main article  Triarchic theory of intelligence
Robert Sternberg proposed the triarchic theory of intelligence to provide a more comprehensive description of intellectual competence than traditional differential or cognitive theories of human ability              The triarchic theory describes three fundamental aspects of intelligence 

Analytic intelligence comprises the mental processes through which intelligence is expressed 
Creative intelligence is necessary when an individual is confronted with a challenge that is nearly  but not entirely  novel or when an individual is engaged in automatizing the performance of a task 
Practical intelligence is bound to a sociocultural milieu and involves adaptation to  selection of  and shaping of the environment to maximize fit in the context 
The triarchic theory does not argue against the validity of a general intelligence factor  instead  the theory posits that general intelligence is part of analytic intelligence  and only by considering all three aspects of intelligence can the full range of intellectual functioning be understood 
Sternberg updated the triarchic theory and renamed it to the Theory of Successful Intelligence              He now defines intelligence as an individual s assessment of success in life by the individual s own  idiographic  standards and within the individual s sociocultural context  Success is achieved by using combinations of analytical  creative  and practical intelligence  The three aspects of intelligence are referred to as processing skills  The processing skills are applied to the pursuit of success through what were the three elements of practical intelligence  adapting to  shaping of  and selecting of one s environments  The mechanisms that employ the processing skills to achieve success include utilizing one s strengths and compensating or correcting for one s weaknesses 
Sternberg s theories and research on intelligence remain contentious within the scientific community             

PASS theory of intelligence edit 
Main article  PASS Theory of Intelligence
Based on A  R  Luria s        seminal work on the modularization of brain function              and supported by decades of neuroimaging research  the PASS Theory of Intelligence   Planning Attention Simultaneous Successive  proposes that cognition is organized in three systems and the following four processes              

Planning involves executive functions responsible for controlling and organizing behavior  selecting and constructing strategies  and monitoring performance 
Attention is responsible for maintaining arousal levels and alertness  and ensuring focus on relevant stimuli 
Simultaneous processing is engaged when the relationship between items and their integration into whole units of information is required  Examples of this include recognizing figures  such as a triangle within a circle vs  a circle within a triangle  or the difference between  he had a shower before breakfast  and  he had breakfast before a shower  
Successive processing is required for organizing separate items in a sequence such as remembering a sequence of words or actions exactly in the order in which they had just been presented 
These four processes are functions of four areas of the brain  Planning is broadly located in the front part of our brains  the frontal lobe  Attention and arousal are combined functions of the frontal lobe and the lower parts of the cortex  although the parietal lobes are also involved in attention as well  Simultaneous processing and Successive processing occur in the posterior region or the back of the brain  Simultaneous processing is broadly associated with the occipital and the parietal lobes while Successive processing is broadly associated with the frontal temporal lobes  The PASS theory is heavily indebted both to Luria                         and to studies in cognitive psychology involved in promoting a better look at intelligence             

Piaget s theory and Neo Piagetian theories edit 
Main articles  Piaget s theory of cognitive development and Neo Piagetian theories of cognitive development
In Piaget s theory of cognitive development the focus is not on mental abilities but rather on a child s mental models of the world  As a child develops  the child creates increasingly more accurate models of the world which enable the child to interact with the world more effectively  One example is object permanence with which the child develops a model in which objects continue to exist even when they cannot be seen  heard  or touched 
Piaget s theory described four main stages and many sub stages in the development  These four main stages are 

sensorimotor stage  birth   years 
pre operational stage      years 
concrete operational stage       years 
formal operations stage        years             
Progress through these stages is correlated with  but not identical to psychometric IQ              Piaget conceptualizes intelligence as an activity more than as a capacity 
One of Piaget s most famous studies focused purely on the discriminative abilities of children between the ages of two and a half years old  and four and a half years old  He began the study by taking children of different ages and placing two lines of sweets  one with the sweets in a line spread further apart  and one with the same number of sweets in a line placed more closely together  He found that   Children between   years    months old and   years    months old correctly discriminate the relative number of objects in two rows  between   years    months and   years    months they indicate a longer row with fewer objects to have  more   after   years    months they again discriminate correctly               Initially younger children were not studied  because if at the age of four years a child could not conserve quantity  then a younger child presumably could not either  The results show however that children that are younger than three years and two months have quantity conservation  but as they get older they lose this quality  and do not recover it until four and a half years old  This attribute may be lost temporarily because of an overdependence on perceptual strategies  which correlates more candy with a longer line of candy  or because of the inability for a four year old to reverse situations             
This experiment demonstrated several results  First  younger children have a discriminative ability that shows the logical capacity for cognitive operations exists earlier than previously acknowledged  Also  young children can be equipped with certain qualities for cognitive operations  depending on how logical the structure of the task is  Research also shows that children develop explicit understanding at age five and as a result  the child will count the sweets to decide which has more  Finally the study found that overall quantity conservation is not a basic characteristic of humans  native inheritance             
Piaget s theory has been criticized on the grounds that the age of appearance of a new model of the world  such as object permanence  is dependent on how the testing is done  see the article on object permanence   More generally  the theory may be very difficult to test empirically because of the difficulty of proving or disproving that a mental model is the explanation for the results of the testing             
Neo Piagetian theories of cognitive development expand Piaget s theory in various ways such as also considering psychometric like factors such as processing speed and working memory   hypercognitive  factors like self monitoring  more stages  and more consideration on how progress may vary in different domains such as spatial or social             

Parieto frontal integration theory of intelligence edit 
Main article  Parieto frontal integration theory
Based on a review of    neuroimaging studies  Jung and Haier proposed that the biological basis of intelligence stems from how well the frontal and parietal regions of the brain communicate and exchange information with each other              Subsequent neuroimaging and lesion studies report general consensus with the theory              A review of the neuroscience and intelligence literature concludes that the parieto frontal integration theory is the best available explanation for human intelligence differences             

Investment theory edit 
Based on the Cattell Horn Carroll theory  the tests of intelligence most often used in the relevant     clarification needed      studies include measures of fluid ability  gf  and crystallized ability  gc   that differ in their trajectory of development in people              The  investment theory  by Cattell             states that the individual differences observed in the procurement of skills and knowledge  gc  are partially attributed to the  investment  of gf  thus suggesting the involvement of fluid intelligence in every aspect of the learning process              The investment theory suggests that personality traits affect  actual  ability  and not scores on an IQ test             
Hebb s theory of intelligence suggested a bifurcation as well  Intelligence A  physiological   that could be seen as a semblance of fluid intelligence and Intelligence B  experiential   similar to crystallized intelligence             

Intelligence compensation theory  ICT  edit 
The intelligence compensation theory             states that individuals who are comparatively less intelligent work harder and more methodically  and become more resolute and thorough  more conscientious  in order to achieve goals  to compensate for their  lack of intelligence  whereas more intelligent individuals do not require traits behaviours associated with the personality factor conscientiousness to progress as they can rely on the strength of their cognitive abilities as opposed to structure or effort              The theory suggests the existence of a causal relationship between intelligence and conscientiousness  such that the development of the personality trait of conscientiousness is influenced by intelligence  This assumption is deemed plausible as it is unlikely that the reverse causal relationship could occur              implying that the negative correlation would be higher between fluid intelligence  gf  and conscientiousness  This is justified by the timeline of development of gf  gc  and personality  as crystallized intelligence would not have developed completely when personality traits develop  Subsequently  during school going ages  more conscientious children would be expected to gain more crystallized intelligence  knowledge  through education  as they would be more efficient  thorough  hard working  and dutiful             
This theory has recently been contradicted by evidence that identifies compensatory sample selection which attributes the findings to the bias that comes from selecting samples containing people above a certain threshold of achievement             

Bandura s theory of self efficacy and cognition edit 
The view of cognitive ability has evolved over the years  and it is no longer viewed as a fixed property held by an individual  Instead  the current perspective describes it as a general capacity     clarification needed       comprising not only cognitive  but motivational  social  and behavioural aspects as well  These facets work together to perform numerous tasks  An essential skill often overlooked is that of managing emotions and aversive experiences that can compromise one s quality of thought and activity  Bandura bridges the link between intelligence and success by crediting individual differences in self efficacy  Bandura s theory identifies the difference between possessing skills and being able to apply them in challenging situations  The theory suggests that individuals with the same level of knowledge and skill may perform badly  averagely  or excellently based on differences in self efficacy 
A key role of cognition is to allow for one to predict events and in turn devise methods to deal with these events effectively  These skills are dependent on processing of unclear and ambiguous stimuli  People must be able to rely on their reserve of knowledge to identify  develop  and execute options  They must be able to apply the learning acquired from previous experiences  Thus  a stable sense of self efficacy is essential to stay focused on tasks in the face of challenging situations             
Bandura s theory of self efficacy and intelligence suggests that individuals with a relatively low sense of self efficacy in any field will avoid challenges  This effect is heightened when they perceive the situations as personal threats  When failure occurs  they recover from it more slowly than others  and credit the failure to an insufficient aptitude  On the other hand  persons with high levels of self efficacy hold a task diagnostic aim     clarification needed      that leads to effective performance

Predicted growth curves for Intelligence as process  crystallized intelligence  occupational knowledge  and avocational knowledge based on Ackerman s PPIK Theory     citation needed     
Developed by Ackerman  the PPIK  process  personality  intelligence  and knowledge  theory further develops the approach on intelligence as proposed by Cattell  the Investment theory  and Hebb  suggesting a distinction between intelligence as knowledge and intelligence as process  two concepts that are comparable and related to gc and gf respectively  but broader and closer to Hebb s notions of  Intelligence A  and  Intelligence B   and integrating these factors with elements such as personality  motivation  and interests                         
Ackerman describes the difficulty of distinguishing process from knowledge  as content cannot be eliminated from any ability test                                     
Personality traits are not significantly correlated with the intelligence as process aspect except in the context of psychopathology  One exception to this generalization has been the finding of sex differences in cognitive abilities  specifically abilities in mathematical and spatial form                         
On the other hand  the intelligence as knowledge factor has been associated with personality traits of Openness and Typical Intellectual Engagement                          which also strongly correlate with verbal abilities  associated with crystallized intelligence

Because intelligence appears to be at least partly dependent on brain structure and the genes shaping brain development  it has been proposed that genetic engineering could be used to enhance intelligence  a process sometimes called biological uplift in science fiction  Genetic enhancement experiments on mice have demonstrated superior ability in learning and memory in various behavioral tasks             

Education edit 
Higher IQ leads to greater success in education              but independently  education raises IQ scores              A      meta analysis suggests education increases IQ by     points per year of education  or at least increases IQ test taking ability

Measured results of the study
Brain training edit 
Attempts to raise IQ with brain training have led to increases on aspects related with the training tasks   for instance working memory   but it is yet unclear if these increases generalize to increased intelligence per se             
A      research paper claimed that practicing a dual n back task can increase fluid intelligence  gf   as measured in several different standard tests              This finding received some attention from popular media  including an article in Wired              However  a subsequent criticism of the paper s methodology questioned the experiment s validity and took issue with the lack of uniformity in the tests used to evaluate the control and test groups              For example  the progressive nature of Raven s Advanced Progressive Matrices  APM  test may have been compromised by modifications of time restrictions  i e      minutes were allowed to complete a normally    minute test  

Philosophy edit 
Efforts to influence intelligence raise ethical issues  Neuroethics considers the ethical  legal  and social implications of neuroscience  and deals with issues such as the difference between treating a human neurological disease and enhancing the human brain  and how wealth impacts access to neurotechnology  Neuroethical issues interact with the ethics of human genetic engineering 
Transhumanist theorists study the possibilities and consequences of developing and using techniques to enhance human abilities and aptitudes 
Eugenics is a social philosophy that advocates the improvement of human hereditary traits through various forms of intervention              Eugenics has variously been regarded as meritorious or deplorable in different periods of history  falling greatly into disrepute after the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II             

Measuring edit 
Main article  Intelligence quotient
Further information  Psychometrics
Score distribution chart for sample of     children tested on      Stanford Binet Test
The approach to understanding intelligence with the most supporters and published research over the longest period of time is based on psychometric testing  It is also by far the most widely used in practical settings              Intelligence quotient  IQ  tests include the Stanford Binet  Raven s Progressive Matrices  the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children  There are also psychometric tests that are not intended to measure intelligence itself but some closely related construct such as scholastic aptitude  In the United States examples include the SSAT  the SAT  the ACT  the GRE  the MCAT  the LSAT  and the GMAT              Regardless of the method used  almost any test that requires examinees to reason and has a wide range of question difficulty will produce intelligence scores that are approximately normally distributed in the general population                         
Intelligence tests are widely used in educational              business  and military settings because of their efficacy in predicting behavior  IQ and g  discussed in the next section  are correlated with many important social outcomes individuals with low IQs are more likely to be divorced  have a child out of marriage  be incarcerated  and need long term welfare support  while individuals with high IQs are associated with more years of education  higher status jobs and higher income              Intelligence as measured by Psychometric tests has been found to be highly correlated with successful training and performance outcomes  e g   adaptive performance                                       and IQ g is the single best predictor of successful job performance  however  some researchers although largely concurring with this finding have advised caution in citing the strength of the claim due to a number of factors  these include  statistical assumptions imposed underlying some of these studies  studies done prior to      which appear inconsistent with more recent studies  and ongoing debates within the Psychology literature as to the validity of current IQ measurement tools                         

General intelligence factor or g edit 
Main article  g factor  psychometrics 
There are many different kinds of IQ tests using a wide variety of test tasks  Some tests consist of a single type of task  others rely on a broad collection of tasks with different contents  visual spatial              verbal  numerical  and asking for different cognitive processes  e g   reasoning  memory  rapid decisions  visual comparisons  spatial imagery  reading  and retrieval of general knowledge   The psychologist Charles Spearman early in the   th century carried out the first formal factor analysis of correlations between various test tasks  He found a trend for all such tests to correlate positively with each other  which is called a positive manifold  Spearman found that a single common factor explained the positive correlations among tests  Spearman named it g for  general intelligence factor   He interpreted it as the core of human intelligence that  to a larger or smaller degree  influences success in all cognitive tasks and thereby creates the positive manifold  This interpretation of g as a common cause of test performance is still dominant in psychometrics   Although  an alternative interpretation was recently advanced by van der Maas and colleagues              Their mutualism model assumes that intelligence depends on several independent mechanisms  none of which influences performance on all cognitive tests  These mechanisms support each other so that efficient operation of one of them makes efficient operation of the others more likely  thereby creating the positive manifold  
IQ tests can be ranked by how highly they load on the g factor  Tests with high g loadings are those that correlate highly with most other tests  One comprehensive study investigating the correlations between a large collection of tests and tasks             has found that the Raven s Progressive Matrices have a particularly high correlation with most other tests and tasks  The Raven s is a test of inductive reasoning with abstract visual material  It consists of a series of problems  sorted approximately by increasing difficulty  Each problem presents a   x   matrix of abstract designs with one empty cell  the matrix is constructed according to a rule  and the person must find out the rule to determine which of   alternatives fits into the empty cell  Because of its high correlation with other tests  the Raven s Progressive Matrices are generally acknowledged as a good indicator of general intelligence  This is problematic  however  because there are substantial gender differences on the Raven s              which are not found when g is measured directly by computing the general factor from a broad collection of tests             
Several critics  such as Stephen Jay Gould  have been critical of g  seeing it as a statistical artifact  and that IQ tests instead measure a number of unrelated abilities                          The      American Psychological Association s report  Intelligence  Knowns and Unknowns  stated that IQ tests do correlate and that the view that g is a statistical artifact was a minority one 

General collective intelligence factor or c edit 
Main article  Collective intelligence
A recent scientific understanding of collective intelligence  defined as a group s general ability to perform a wide range of tasks              expands the areas of human intelligence research applying similar methods and concepts to groups  Definition  operationalization and methods are similar to the psychometric approach of general individual intelligence where an individual s performance on a given set of cognitive tasks is used to measure intelligence indicated by the general intelligence factor g extracted via factor analysis              In the same vein  collective intelligence research aims to discover a c factor  explaining between group differences in performance as well as structural and group compositional causes for it             

Historical psychometric theories edit 
Main article  Intelligence quotient        History
Several different theories of intelligence have historically been important for psychometrics  Often they emphasized more factors than a single one like in g factor 

Cattell Horn Carroll theory edit 
Main article  Cattell Horn Carroll theory
Many of the broad  recent IQ tests have been greatly influenced by the Cattell Horn Carroll theory  It is argued to reflect much of what is known about intelligence from research  A hierarchy of factors for human intelligence is used  g is at the top  Under it there are    broad abilities that in turn are subdivided into    narrow abilities  The broad abilities are             

Fluid intelligence  Gf   includes the broad ability to reason  form concepts  and solve problems using unfamiliar information or novel procedures 
Crystallized intelligence  Gc   includes the breadth and depth of a person s acquired knowledge  the ability to communicate one s knowledge  and the ability to reason using previously learned experiences or procedures 
Quantitative reasoning  Gq   the ability to comprehend quantitative concepts and relationships and to manipulate numerical symbols 
Reading  amp  writing ability  Grw   includes basic reading and writing skills 
Short term memory  Gsm   is the ability to apprehend and hold information in immediate awareness and then use it within a few seconds 
Long term storage and retrieval  Glr   is the ability to store information and fluently retrieve it later in the process of thinking 
Visual processing  Gv   is the ability to perceive  analyze  synthesize  and think with visual patterns  including the ability to store and recall visual representations 
Auditory processing  Ga   is the ability to analyze  synthesize  and discriminate auditory stimuli  including the ability to process and discriminate speech sounds that may be presented under distorted conditions 
Processing speed  Gs   is the ability to perform automatic cognitive tasks  particularly when measured under pressure to maintain focused attention 
Decision reaction time speed  Gt   reflect the immediacy with which an individual can react to stimuli or a task  typically measured in seconds or fractions of seconds  not to be confused with Gs  which typically is measured in intervals of     minutes   See Mental chronometry 
Modern tests do not necessarily measure of all of these broad abilities  For example  Gq and Grw may be seen as measures of school achievement and not IQ              Gt may be difficult to measure without special equipment 
g was earlier often subdivided into only Gf and Gc which were thought to correspond to the nonverbal or performance subtests and verbal subtests in earlier versions of the popular Wechsler IQ test  More recent research has shown the situation to be more complex

Reliability and validity are very different concepts  While reliability reflects reproducibility  validity refers to whether the test measures what it purports to measure              While IQ tests are generally considered to measure some forms of intelligence  they may fail to serve as an accurate measure of broader definitions of human intelligence inclusive of  for example  creativity and social intelligence  For this reason  psychologist Wayne Weiten argues that their construct validity must be carefully qualified  and not be overstated              According to Weiten   IQ tests are valid measures of the kind of intelligence necessary to do well in academic work  But if the purpose is to assess intelligence in a broader sense  the validity of IQ tests is questionable              
Some scientists have disputed the value of IQ as a measure of intelligence altogether  In The Mismeasure of Man        expanded edition        evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould compared IQ testing with the now discredited practice of determining intelligence via craniometry  arguing that both are based on the fallacy of reification   our tendency to convert abstract concepts into entities               Gould s argument sparked a great deal of debate                          and the book is listed as one of Discover Magazine     s     Greatest Science Books of All Time              
Along these same lines  critics such as Keith Stanovich do not dispute the capacity of IQ test scores to predict some kinds of achievement  but argue that basing a concept of intelligence on IQ test scores alone neglects other important aspects of mental ability                          Robert Sternberg  another significant critic of IQ as the main measure of human cognitive abilities  argued that reducing the concept of intelligence to the measure of g does not fully account for the different skills and knowledge types that produce success in human society             

Despite these objections  clinical psychologists generally regard IQ scores as having sufficient statistical validity for many clinical purposes      specify                             
A study suggested that intelligence is composed of distinct cognitive systems  each of which having its own capacity and being  to some degree  independent of other components  with the cognitive profile being emergent from anatomically distinct cognitive systems  such as brain regions or neural networks                           For example  IQ and reading  language related traits skills appear to be influenced  at least partly  by  distinct genetic factors                            
Various types of potential measures related to some definitions of intelligence but not part of IQ measurement include 

Cognitive flexibility   abilities in switching between different concepts  or to adapt behaviour in novel or changing environments             
Moral intelligence                          
Prioritization and goal selection
Direct measures of brain activity              and other neuroimaging intelligence testing   partly investigated in the neuroscience of intelligence
Intelligence across cultures edit 
Psychologists have shown that the definition of human intelligence is unique to the culture that one is studying  Robert Sternberg is among the researchers who have discussed how one s culture affects the person s interpretation of intelligence  and he further believes that to define intelligence in only one way without considering different meanings in cultural contexts may cast an investigative and unintentionally egocentric view on the world  To negate this  psychologists offer the following definitions of intelligence 

Successful intelligence is the skills and knowledge needed for success in life  according to one s own definition of success  within one s sociocultural context 
Analytical intelligence is the result of intelligence s components applied to fairly abstract but familiar kinds of problems 
Creative intelligence is the result of intelligence s components applied to relatively novel tasks and situations 
Practical intelligence is the result of intelligence s components applied to experience for purposes of adaption  shaping and selection              
Although typically identified by its western definition  multiple studies support the idea that human intelligence carries different meanings across cultures around the world  In many Eastern cultures  intelligence is mainly related with one s social roles and responsibilities  A Chinese conception of intelligence would define it as the ability to empathize with and understand others   although this is by no means the only way that intelligence is defined in China 
In several African communities  intelligence is shown similarly through a social lens  However  rather than through social roles  as in many Eastern cultures  it is exemplified through social responsibilities  For example  in the language of Chi Chewa  which is spoken by some ten million people across central Africa  the equivalent term for intelligence implies not only cleverness but also the ability to take on responsibility  Furthermore  within American culture there are a variety of interpretations of intelligence present as well  One of the most common views on intelligence within American societies defines it as a combination of problem solving skills  deductive reasoning skills  and Intelligence quotient  IQ   while other American societies point out that intelligent people should have a social conscience  accept others for who they are  and be able to give advice or wisdom              

Motivational intelligence edit 
Motivational intelligence refers to an individual s capacity to comprehend and utilize various motivations  such as the need for achievement  affiliation  or power  It involves understanding tacit knowledge related to these motivations  This concept encompasses the ability to recognize and appreciate the diverse values  behaviors  and cultural differences of others  driven by intrinsic interest rather than solely to enhance interaction effectiveness                           
Research suggests a relationship between motivational intelligence  international experiences  and leadership  Individuals with higher levels of motivational intelligence tend to exhibit greater enthusiasm for learning about other cultures  thereby contributing to their effectiveness in cross cultural settings  However  studies have also revealed variations in motivational intelligence across ethnicities  with Asian students demonstrating higher cognitive cultural intelligence but lower motivational intelligence compared to other groups              
Investigations have explored the impact of motivational intelligence on job motivation  A study conducted on employees of Isfahan Gas Company indicated a positive and significant relationship between motivational intelligence and two of its indicators  namely adaptability and social relationship  with job motivation  These findings highlight the potential influence of motivational intelligence on individuals  motivation levels within work contexts              
Motivational intelligence has been identified as a strong predictor  superseding knowledge intelligence  behavioral intelligence  and strategic intelligence  It holds a crucial role in promoting cooperation  which is considered the ideal and essential element of motivational intelligence 
Therapeutic approaches grounded in motivational intelligence emphasize a collaborative partnership between the therapist and client  The therapist creates an environment conducive to change without imposing their views or attempting to force awareness or acceptance of reality onto the client              
Motivational intelligence encompasses the understanding of motivations  such as achievement  affiliation  and power  as well as the appreciation of cultural differences and values  It has been found to impact areas such as international experiences  leadership  job motivation  and cooperative therapeutic interventions
