Franzen was born in Western Springs  Illinois             the son of Irene  n e Super  and Earl T  Franzen                        His father  raised in Minnesota  was the son of an immigrant from Sweden  his mother s ancestry was Eastern European  Franzen grew up in an affluent neighborhood in Webster Groves  a suburb of St  Louis  Missouri  and graduated with high honors from Swarthmore College  receiving a degree in German in                  As part of his undergraduate education  he studied abroad in Germany during the         academic year with Wayne State University s Junior Year in Munich program  While there  he met Michael A  Martone  on whom he would later base the character Walter Berglund in Freedom              He also studied on a Fulbright Scholarship at Freie Universit t Berlin in Berlin in                      he speaks fluent German 
Franzen married in      and moved with his wife to Somerville  Massachusetts to pursue a career as a novelist  While writing his first novel  The Twenty Seventh City  he worked as a research assistant at Harvard University s Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences  coauthoring several dozen papers              In September       a month after he and his wife moved to New York City  Franzen sold The Twenty Seventh City to Farrar Straus  amp  Giroux             

Career edit 
Early novels edit 
Franzen in     
The Twenty Seventh City  published in       is set in Franzen s hometown  St  Louis  and deals with the city s fall from grace  St  Louis having been the  fourth city  in the     s  This sprawling novel was warmly received and established Franzen as an author to watch              In a conversation with novelist Donald Antrim for Bomb Magazine  Franzen described The Twenty Seventh City as  a conversation with the literary figures of my parents  generation    the great sixties and seventies Postmoderns               adding in a later interview  I was a skinny  scared kid trying to write a big novel  The mask I donned was that of a rhetorically airtight  extremely smart  extremely knowledgeable middle aged writer              
Strong Motion        focuses mainly on a dysfunctional family  the Hollands  and uses seismic events on the American East Coast as a metaphor for the quakes that occur in family life  as Franzen put it   I imagined static lives being disrupted from without literally shaken  I imagined violent scenes that would strip away the veneer and get people shouting angry moral truths at each other                 A  systems novel   the key  systems  of Strong Motion according to Franzen are      the systems of science and religion two violently opposing systems of making sense in the world               The novel was not a financial success at the time of its publication  Franzen subsequently defended the novel in his      Paris Review interview  remarking  I think they  critics and readers  may be overlooking Strong Motion a little bit              
Franzen taught a fiction writing seminar at Swarthmore in the spring of      and      

On that first day of class  Franzen wrote two words on the blackboard   truth  and  beauty   and told his students that these were the goals of fiction  Haslett describes Franzen s classroom manner as  serious    He meant what he said and didn t suffer fools gladly   But this seriousness was leavened by a  great relish for words and writing   adds Kathleen Lawton Trask      a      workshop student who is now a writer and high school English teacher   People who teach fiction workshops aren t always starry eyed about writing  but he was  He read our stories so closely that he often started class with a rundown of words that were not used quite correctly in stories from that week s workshop   I still remember him explaining to us the difference between cement and concrete   At the same time  he was eminently supportive and sympathetic  I don t remember those corrections ever feeling condescending              
For the      class  Franzen invited David Foster Wallace to be a guest judge of the workshop pieces 

The Corrections edit 
Main article  The Corrections
Franzen s The Corrections  a novel of social criticism  garnered considerable critical acclaim in the United States  winning both the      National Book Award for Fiction            
and the      James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction              The novel was also a finalist for the      National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction              the      PEN Faulkner Award              and the      Pulitzer Prize for Fiction  won by Richard Russo for Empire Falls              
In September       The Corrections was selected for Oprah Winfrey s book club  Franzen initially participated in the selection  sitting down for a lengthy interview with Oprah and appearing in B roll footage in his hometown of St  Louis  described in an essay in How To Be Alone titled  Meet Me In St  Louis    In October       however  The Oregonian printed an article in which Franzen expressed unease with the selection  In an interview on National Public Radio s Fresh Air  he expressed his worry that the Oprah logo on the cover dissuaded men from reading the book 

I had some hope of actually reaching a male audience and I ve heard more than one reader in signing lines now at bookstores say  If I hadn t heard you  I would have been put off by the fact that it is an Oprah pick  I figure those books are for women  I would never touch it   Those are male readers speaking  I see this as my book  my creation             
Soon afterward  Franzen s invitation to appear on Oprah s show was rescinded  Winfrey announced   Jonathan Franzen will not be on the Oprah Winfrey show because he is seemingly uncomfortable and conflicted about being chosen as a book club selection  It is never my intention to make anyone uncomfortable or cause anyone conflict  We have decided to skip the dinner and we re moving on to the next book              
These events gained Franzen and his novel widespread media attention  The Corrections soon became one of the decade s best selling works of literary fiction  At the National Book Award ceremony  Franzen said  I d also like to thank Oprah Winfrey for her enthusiasm and advocacy on behalf of The Corrections              
Following the success of The Corrections and the publication of The Discomfort Zone and How to Be Alone  Franzen began work on his next novel  In the interim  he published two short stories in The New Yorker   Breakup Stories   published November          concerned the disintegration of four relationships  and  Two s Company   published May           concerned a couple who write for TV  then split up             
In       it was announced that Franzen would write a multi part television adaptation of The Corrections in collaboration with The Squid and the Whale director Noah Baumbach for HBO                          HBO has since passed on Corrections  citing  difficulty  in  adapting the book s challenging narrative  which moves through time and cuts forwards and back   that would be  difficult to sustain in a series and challenging for viewers to follow  hampering the potential show s accessibility              
In September       The Corrections was voted sixteenth in a list of the     best books of the twenty first century so far by writers and critics of the Guardian newspaper             

Freedom edit

On June          Franzen published an excerpt from Freedom  his novel in progress  in The New Yorker  The excerpt  titled  Good Neighbors   concerned the trials and tribulations of a couple in St  Paul  Minnesota  On May           a second excerpt   titled  Agreeable    was published  also in The New Yorker             
On October           Franzen made an appearance alongside David Bezmozgis at the New Yorker Festival at the Cedar Lake Theatre  reading a portion of his forthcoming novel                          Sam Allard  writing for North By Northwestern about the event  said that the     material from his new  reportedly massive  novel  was  as buoyant and compelling as ever  and  marked by his familiar undercurrent of tragedy   Franzen read  an extended clip from the second chapter              
On September          Franzen appeared on Fresh Air to discuss Freedom in the wake of its release  Franzen has drawn what he describes as a  feminist critique  for the attention that male authors receive over female authors a critique he supports  Franzen also discussed his friendship with David Foster Wallace and the impact of Wallace s suicide on his writing process             
Freedom was the subject of a highly unusual  recall  in the United Kingdom starting in early October       An earlier draft of the manuscript  to which Franzen had made over     changes  had been published by mistake  The publisher  HarperCollins  initiated an exchange program  but thousands of books had been distributed by that time             
While promoting the book  Franzen became the first American author to appear on the cover of Time magazine since Stephen King in       Franzen appeared alongside the headline  Great American Novelist              He discussed the implications of the Time coverage  and the reasoning behind the title of Freedom in an interview in Manchester  England  in October                  
On September           Oprah Winfrey announced that Jonathan Franzen s Freedom would be an Oprah book club selection  the first of the last season of The Oprah Winfrey Show              On December          he appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show to promote Freedom where they discussed that book and the controversy over his reservations about her picking The Corrections and what that would entail             
Franzen has stated the writing of Freedom was influenced by the death of his close friend and fellow novelist David Foster Wallace             

Purity edit 
Main article  Purity  novel 
In an interview with Portland Monthly on December           Franzen revealed that he currently had  a four page  single spaced proposal  for a fifth novel he was currently working on              although he went on to suggest that while he had a proposal there was no guarantee that what was proposed would make the final cut  saying of similar proposals for previous novels   I look at the old proposals now  and I see the one part of them that actually got made into a book  and I think   How come I couldn t see that  What is all this other stuff                 Franzen also hinted that the new novel would probably also be long  adding  I ve let go of any illusion that I m a writer of     page novels  I need room to let things turn around over time and see them from the whole lives of other characters  not just the single character  For better or worse  one point of view never seems to do it for me               In October       during a discussion at Colgate University  Franzen read a  self contained first person narrative  that is part of a novel that he hoped will be out in the summer of                  
On November           The New York Times Artsbeat Blog reported that the novel  titled Purity  would be out in September              Jonathan Galassi  president and publisher of Farrar  Straus  amp  Giroux  described Purity as a multigenerational American epic that spans decades and continents  The story centers on a young woman named Purity Tyler  or Pip  who doesn t know who her father is and sets out to uncover his identity  The narrative stretches from contemporary America to South America to East Germany before the collapse of the Berlin Wall  and hinges on the mystery of Pip s family history and her relationship with a charismatic 
hacker and whistleblower             
In       Daily Variety reported that the novel was in the process of being adapted into a    hour limited series for Showtime by Todd Field who would share writing duties with Franzen and the playwright Sir David Hare  It would star Daniel Craig as Andreas Wolf and be executive produced by Field  Franzen  Craig  Hare  amp  Scott Rudin             
However  in a February      interview with The Times London  Hare said that  given the budget for Field s adaptation      million   he doubted it would ever be made  but added  It was one of the richest and most interesting six weeks of my life  sitting in a room with Todd Field  Jonathan Franzen and Daniel Craig bashing out the story  They re extremely interesting people              
Purity was a relative commercial disappointment compared to Franzen s two previous novels  selling only         copies  compared to      million copies of Freedom and     million copies of The Corrections             

A Key to All Mythologies edit 
On November           Franzen s publisher Farrar  Straus and Giroux announced the publication of Franzen s new novel  Crossroads  the first volume in a trilogy titled A Key to All Mythologies                                     
Crossroads was published October                     

The novel received mostly favorable reviews  with a cumulative  Positive  rating at the review aggregator website Book Marks  based on    book reviews from mainstream literary critics              Bookforum called it Franzen s  finest novel yet   his  greatest and most perfect novel               and Dwight Garner of the New York Times said it was  warmer than anything he s yet written  wider in its human sympathies  weightier of image and intellect               According to the Times Literary Supplement Crossroads is largely free from the vices to which Franzen s previous work has been addicted  the self conscious topicality  the show off sophistication  the formal heavy handedness  It retains many of his familiar virtues  the robust characterization  the escalating comedy  the virtuosic command of narrative rhythm             Critics especially praised the character of Marion  whom Garner called  one of the glorious characters in recent American fiction                                                                          
The novel is about a pastor  his wife  and four children  It s split into two sections called  Advent  and  Easter   Writing for The Nation  Rumaan Alam says  in Crossroads  every plotline leads to God              

Other works edit 
 Franzen in     
In       while still working on The Corrections  Franzen published a literary manifesto in Harper s Magazine entitled  Perchance to Dream   Referencing manifestos written by Philip Roth and Tom Wolfe  among others  Franzen grappled with the novelist s role in an advanced media culture which seemed to no longer need the novel  In the end  Franzen rejects the goal of writing a great social novel about issues and ideas  in favor of focusing on the internal lives of characters and their emotions  Given the huge success of The Corrections  this essay offers a prescient look into Franzen s goals as both a literary and commercially minded author             
In       Franzen published a critique of the novels of William Gaddis  entitled  Mr  Difficult   in The New Yorker  He begins by recounting how some readers felt The Corrections was spoiled by being too high brow in parts  and summarizes his own views of reading difficult fiction  He proposes a  Status model   whereby the point of fiction is to be Art  and also a  Contract model   whereby the point of fiction is to be Entertainment  and finds that he subscribes to both models  He praises The Recognitions  admits that he only got halfway through J R  and explains why he does not like the rest of Gaddis s novels             
In       Franzen published  The Discomfort Zone   a personal essay about his childhood and family life in Missouri and his love of Charles M  Schulz s Peanuts  in The New Yorker  Susan Orlean selected it for the subsequent volume of The Best American Essays

Since The Corrections Franzen has published How to Be Alone         a collection of essays including  Perchance To Dream   and The Discomfort Zone         a memoir  How To Be Alone is essentially an apologia for reading  articulating Franzen s uncomfortable relationship with the place of fiction in contemporary society  It also probes the influence of his childhood and adolescence on his creative life  which is then further explored in The Discomfort Zone 
In September       Franzen s translation of Frank Wedekind s play Spring Awakening  German  Fr hlings Erwachen  was published  In his introduction  Franzen describes the Broadway musical version as  insipid  and  overpraised   In an interview with New York magazine  Franzen stated that he had in fact made the translation for Swarthmore College s theater department for     in      and that it had sat in a drawer for    years since  After the Broadway show stirred up so much interest  Franzen said he was inspired to publish it because  I knew it was a good translation  better than anything else out there              
Franzen published a social commentary on cell phones  sentimentality  and the decline of public space   I Just Called To Say I Love You                      in the September October      issue of MIT Technology Review 
In      he published Farther Away  a collection of essays dealing with such topics as his love of birds  his friendship with David Foster Wallace  and his thoughts on technology             
In       Franzen published The Kraus Project  It consists of three major essays by the  Perennially     impossible to translate              Austrian  playwright  poet  social commentator and satirical genius              Karl Kraus    Heine and the Consequences  a takedown of the beloved German poet   Nestroy and Posterity  which established that playwright s reputation in Austria to this day  and  Afterword to Heine and the Consequences                The essays are accompanied by  Franzen s  own  plentiful  trenchant yet off beat annotations              taking on      Kraus  mantle commenting on what Kraus would say  and what Franzen s opinion is  about Macs and PCs  decrying Twitter s claim of credit for the Arab Spring  and unfurling how media conglomerates influence politics in their quest for profits              
Franzen published his third essay collection  The End of the End of the Earth  Essays  in November                   According to advance press for the book  the collection  gathers essays and speeches written mostly in the past five years   and  Jonathan Franzen returns with renewed vigor to the themes both human and literary that have long preoccupied him  Whether exploring his complex relationship with his uncle  recounting his young adulthood in New York  or offering an illuminating look at the global seabird crisis  these pieces contain all the wit and disabused realism that we ve come to expect from Franzen 
Taken together  these essays trace the progress of a unique and mature mind wrestling with itself  with literature  and with some of the most important issues of our day  made more pressing by the current political milieu  The End of the End of the Earth is remarkable  provocative  and necessary              
In September       Franzen published an essay on climate change in The New Yorker entitled  What If We Stopped Pretending                which generated controversy among scientists and online pundits because of its alleged pessimism                          The term doomerism became popular amid the response to the piece              A Sierra Club interview with Franzen  from January      further explores Franzen s feelings about climate change and action                  example needed     
In an interview with Transatlantica conducted in March       Franzen mentioned that he had just started work on a new novel  having recently sold it to publishers on the basis of a three page proposal              Later that year  in a profile piece for The New York Times Magazine in June       Franzen confirmed that he was currently at work on the early stages of his sixth novel  which he speculated could be his last   So  I may be wrong     But somehow this new one really does feel like my last                Subsequently  in an interview reproduced on The Millions website in April       Franzen mentioned that he was  almost done  with writing this sixth novel              Crossroads  A Novel was published on October
