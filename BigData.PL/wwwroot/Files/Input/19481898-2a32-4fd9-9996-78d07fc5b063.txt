							In an interview with Daily News Egypt  Hussein Sabbour  Chairman of Al Ahly For Real Estate Development  described the investment climate in Egypt s real estate market 
What efforts has the state committed to in solving the housing crisis 
The Central Bank of Egypt acknowledged interest rates for cheap popular housing at between    and     instead of between     and      and the government provides EGP       as a non refundable grant in support of economic housing for young people  However  the state is poor and doesn t have the possibilities  so it provides some advantages for low class and middle class housing  but these tranches need millions of housing units to solve the housing crisis 
What are the most promising of Egypt s investment sectors 
The real estate sector is the best and the most promising sector for investment in Egypt  Based on the evidence presented at the Sharm El Sheikh Economic Summit  six real estate projects were signed  but not in the agriculture or industry sectors  which demonstrates that  real estate  is the most attractive sector for investors  Real estate projects are comprehensive and include not only residential units  but also commercial real estate projects  administrative or industrial units  Therefore  investment in this sector is the destination for Arabs  Egyptians and foreigners 
Why is there no significant investment in the industrial real estate sector 
That is because this sector faces many problems and has lower profits 
Will the change in government affect projects that were announced at Sharm El Sheikh s Economic Summit 
Of course not  because the government will not affect  projects          whether or not they have changed   while being under the management of one president  The ministers will change  but the philosophy will not 
Will your company coordinate with the government in building middle income residential units projects 
Dealing with the government now has become dangerous  and the cooperation with it happens to a strict extent  because of bureaucracy and the lack of state respect for its commitments  After the    January Revolution  the state cancelled its contracts with investors on the pretext that they had bought land cheaply  which feeds investor fear and instability 
The Egyptian government tricks real estate investors in the name of settling investment disputes  and it must stop this if it wants reform and growth in the sector  The settlement of disputes regarding the lands or companies sold by the government to investors in a final deal is being solved through a re pricing of these lands and companies to the highest price  which considered explicit fraud   and leads to a loss of investors not only in the real estate sector  The administrative body in Egypt is still weighed down by bureaucracy and must be resolved quickly  as this is the main obstacle to the growth of real estate investment in Egypt 
What are the reasons for non implementation of the Cairo Capital project with Mohamed Al Abbar 
Al Abbar signed a Memorandum of Understanding  MoU  during the Sharm El Sheikh Economic Summit  which is a non completed agreement  but the government and Al Abbar disagreed over the final agreement  Therefore  the government decided to be both the developer and manager of the project  by bringing in another developer to take the role of the development but under state control  I do not know where the government will get the finance for the project  and the advisory Egyptian alliance would only plan the project  Egyptian companies are able to carry out the project  but it needs good planning  good management as well as finance 
Was there a proposal from the developers to gain land to facilitate in return for allocating     of the facilitated lands for the government as participation in solving and addressing the depletion of land for building real estate projects 
The state does not have facilitated lands  and this issue is risky  The developers would involve themselves in cases and disputes with the government  similar to what happened with the Talaat Mostafa Group in the Madinaty project  The solution is in the hands of the government 
What is your vision for the Egyptian real estate market 
 The Egyptian real estate market has great potential  and market prices have been competitive in the regional Arab market since       These prices achieved revenues for real estate developers  However  the sector faces constraints and challenges represented in the lack of facilitated lands in light of government domination on offering lands  The government has to allow the private sector to facilitate lands to solve the problem of land availability  The developer  who can adapt to these obstacles  may benefit from the growth rates and growing demand in the property sector  in the light of opening new business with competed prices in coastal regions  which is supposed to attract foreign customers as well
