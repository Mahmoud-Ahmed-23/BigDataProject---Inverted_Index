							The new      collection features many colourful designs
The plastic slipper known as abo sba a  or the one with a finger  toe  is big in Egypt  It is the same kind of slipper that the west calls flip flop  Yet  in Egypt  it has a magical power  The slippers  or as more commonly known shibshib is used for walking  going to the bathroom and in the case of Bedouins  climbing up mountains  It is also used to ward off the evil eye  hanging a shibshib  usually abo sba a  on a new car is essential  The dangling shibshib attracts the evil eye and so the rest of the car remains out of focus 
Given how engrained the shibshib is in our culture  it was very sad to see less and less of them produced in Egypt and most are imported from abroad  However  the company Shibshibi  my slippers   founded in       is trying to change that  All the merchandise is designed and produced in Egypt  We caught up with Nadia Ahmed  partner at Shibshibi  for more information 
 Sara Hamza  partner  wanted to re design a product that has been a part of the Egyptian culture for a long time  The shibshib can be traced back over a hundred years  When Sara talked to me about it  I was immediately taken by the idea and encouraged the project s take off  They are      designed and made in Egypt   Nadia said   The materials used in our previous collections are rubber and PVC  The new collection is made from leather and leather board  which are made here in Egypt  The fabrics are a blend of Egyptian fabrics and fabrics from Turkey and the Middle East  
Flip flops are usually a summer product  but winters here in Egypt are not of the freezing variety  so you might find the odd one in the street now and then   The process of design consists of three phases  inspiration  brainstorming and prototyping  In the prototyping phase we adjust for comfort  aesthetics and quality  As we are more of a summer product  we usually release our collection in spring   Nadia explained 
Shibshibi uses conventional and modern ways to bring attention to their products   We seek to create customer awareness of our product and on building customer loyalty  We do our advertising and marketing mainly through social networks such as Facebook and this year we will be adding Instagram  We target women from the age group of       years   Nadia said 
The new collection encourages customer s creativity by offering a customisable flip flop   This year our collection will be limited in sizes per style but with a variation of fabric straps that you can tie in many different ways  making the flip flop look different depending on how you tie it   We will also add a small drawing to help show a few different ways you can tie the flip flops    Nadia explained   Our new collection will be available by the end of next week
