The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  is an independent agency of the United States government tasked with protecting public health and safety related to nuclear energy  Established by the Energy Reorganization Act of       the NRC began operations on January           as one of two successor agencies to the United States Atomic Energy Commission  Its functions  include overseeing reactor safety and security  administering reactor licensing and renewal  licensing and oversight for fuel cycle facilities  licensing radioactive materials  radionuclide safety  and managing the storage  security  recycling  and disposal of spent fuel 


History edit 
The commission meets in      
Prior to      the Atomic Energy Commission was in charge of matters regarding radionuclides  The AEC was dissolved  because it was perceived as unduly favoring the industry it was charged with regulating             The NRC was formed as an independent commission to oversee nuclear energy matters  oversight of nuclear medicine  and nuclear safety and security 
The U S  AEC became the Energy Research and Development Administration  ERDA  in       responsible for development and oversight of nuclear weapons  Research and promotion of civil uses of radioactive materials  such as for nuclear non destructive testing  nuclear medicine  and nuclear power  was split into the Office of Nuclear Energy  Science  amp  Technology within ERDA by the same act  In       ERDA became the United States Department of Energy  DOE   In       the National Nuclear Security Administration was created as a subcomponent of DOE  responsible for nuclear weapons            
Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in       the NRC developed a guidance strategy known as  Diverse and Flexible Coping Strategies  FLEX   which requires licensee nuclear power plants to account for beyond design basis external events  seismic  flooding  high winds  etc   that are most
impactful to reactor safety through loss of power and loss of ultimate heat sink  FLEX Strategies have been implemented at all operating nuclear power plants in the United States            
The origins and development of NRC regulatory processes and policies are explained in five volumes of history published by the University of California Press  These are            

Controlling the Atom  The Beginnings of Nuclear Regulation                  
Containing the Atom  Nuclear Regulation in a Changing Environment                   
Permissible Dose  A History of Radiation Protection in the Twentieth Century       
Three Mile Island  A Nuclear Crisis in Historical Perspective       
The Road to Yucca Mountain   The Development of Radioactive Waste Policy in the United States        
The NRC has produced a booklet  A Short History of Nuclear Regulation            which outlines key issues in NRC history             Thomas Wellock  a former academic  is the NRC historian  Before joining the NRC  Wellock wrote Critical Masses  Opposition to Nuclear Power in California                       

Mission and commissioners edit 
The NRC protects public health and safety and advances the nation s common defense and security by enabling the safe and secure use and deployment of civilian nuclear energy technologies and radioactive materials through efficient and reliable licensing  oversight  and regulation for the benefit of society and the environment 
The NRC s regulatory mission covers three main areas     citation needed      

Reactors   Commercial reactors for generating electric power and research and test reactors used for research  testing  and training
Materials   Uses of nuclear materials in medical  industrial  and academic settings and facilities that produce nuclear fuel
Waste   Transportation  storage  and disposal of nuclear materials and waste  and decommissioning of nuclear facilities from service 
The NRC is headed by five commissioners appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate for five year terms  One of them is designated by the president to be the chairman and official spokesperson of the commission  The chairman is the principal executive officer of the NRC  who exercise all of the executive and administrative functions of the commission 
The current chairman is David A  Wright  President Trump designated Wright as chairman of the NRC effective January

Organization edit 
NRC Organizational Chart in February     
The three building that comprise NRC s North Bethesda campus  with North Bethesda station in the right bottom corner
The NRC consists of the commission on the one hand and offices of the executive director for Operations on the other             
The commission is divided into two committees  Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards and Advisory Committee on the Medical Uses of Isotopes  and one Board  the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel  as well as eight commission staff offices  Office of Commission Appellate Adjudication  Office of Congressional Affairs  Office of the General Counsel  Office of International Programs  Office of Public Affairs  Office of the Secretary  Office of the Chief Financial Officer  Office of the Executive Director for Operations  
Christopher T  Hanson is the chairman of the NRC              There are    Executive Director for Operations offices 
Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards  Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation  Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research  Office of Enforcement  which investigates reports by nuclear power whistleblowers  specifically the Allegations Program              Office of Investigations  Office of Nuclear Security and Incident Response  Region I  Region II  Region III  Region IV  Office of the Chief Information Officer  Office of Administration  Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer  and Office of Small Business and Civil Rights 
Of these operations offices  NRC s major program components are the first two offices mentioned above 
NRC s proposed FY      budget is        million  with        full time equivalents  FTE      percent of which is recovered by fees  This is an increase of     million  compared to FY                  
NRC headquarters offices are located in unincorporated North Bethesda  Maryland  although the mailing address for two of the three main buildings in the complex list the city as Rockville  MD   and there are four regional offices 

Regions edit 
Main article  Regions of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
Map of the NRC regions
The NRC territory is broken down into four geographical regions  until the late     s  there was a Region V office in Walnut Creek  California which was absorbed into Region IV  and Region V was dissolved 

Region I  located in King of Prussia  Pennsylvania  oversees the northeastern states 
Region II  located in Atlanta  Georgia  oversees most of the southeastern states 
Region III  located in Lisle  Illinois  oversees the Midwest 
Region IV  located in Arlington  Texas  oversees the  western and south central states 
In these four regions NRC oversees the operation of US nuclear reactors  namely    power producing reactors              and    non power producing  or research and test reactors              Oversight is done on several levels  For example 

Each power producing reactor site has resident inspectors  who monitor day to day operations 
Numerous special inspection teams  with many different specialties  routinely conduct inspections at each site 
Agreement States edit 
Agreement States have entered into agreements with the NRC that give them the authority to license and inspect byproduct  source  or special nuclear materials used or possessed within their borders  Any applicant  other than a Federal agency or Federally recognized Indian tribe  who wishes to possess or use licensed material in one of these Agreement States should contact the responsible officials in that State for guidance on preparing an application  These applications should be filed with State officials  not with the NRC 

Recordkeeping system edit 
NRC has a library  which also contains online document collections              In      it started an electronic repository called ADAMS  the Agencywide Documents Access and Management System              for its public inspection reports  correspondence  and other technical documents written by NRC staff  contractors  and licensees  It was upgraded in October      and is now web based  Of documents from      to      only some have abstracts and or full text  most are citations  Documents from before      are available in paper or microfiche formats  Copies of these older documents or classified documents can be applied for with a FOIA request 

Training and accreditation edit 
Commission headquarters
NRC conducts audits and training inspections  observes the National Nuclear Accrediting Board meetings  and nominates some members 
The      Kemeny Commission s report             after the Three Mile Island accident recommended that the nuclear energy industry  set and police its own standards of excellence               The nuclear industry founded the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations  INPO  within   months to establish personnel training and qualification  The industry through INPO created the  National Academy for Nuclear Training Program  either as early as                  or in September      per the International Atomic Energy Agency              INPO refers to NANT as  our National Academy for Nuclear Training  on its website              NANT integrates and standardizes the training programs of INPO and US nuclear energy companies  offers training scholarships and interacts with the  National Nuclear Accrediting Board   This Board is closely related to the National Academy for Nuclear Training  not a government body  and referred to as independent by INPO              the Nuclear Energy Institute  and nuclear utilities              but not by the NRC  all of whom are represented on the board 
The      Nuclear Waste Policy Act directed NRC in Section     to issue regulations or  other appropriate regulatory guidance  on training of nuclear plant personnel  Since the nuclear industry already had developed training and accreditation  NRC issued a policy statement in       endorsing the INPO program  NRC has a memorandum of agreement with INPO and  monitors INPO activities by observing accreditation team visits and the monthly NNAB meetings              
In       NRC endorsed the industry s approach to training that had been used for nearly a decade through its  Training Rule               In February       NRC passed the  Operator Requalification Rule     FR       Feb                       allowing each nuclear power plant company to conduct the operator licensing renewal examination every six years  eliminating the requirement of NRC administered written requalification examination 
In       NRC issued a final rule on operator initial licensing examination              that allows companies to prepare  proctor  and grade their own operator initial licensing examinations  Facilities can  upon written request  continue to have the examinations prepared and administered by NRC staff  but if a company volunteers to prepare the examination  NRC continues to approve and administer it             
Since      meetings between NRC and applicants or licensees have been open to the public             

Prospective nuclear units edit 
Main article  Nuclear renaissance in the United States
Between      and          companies applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for construction and operating licenses to build    new nuclear power reactors in the United States 
However  the case for widespread nuclear plant construction was eroded due to abundant natural gas supplies                          Many license applications for proposed new reactors were suspended or cancelled                          These will not be the cheapest energy options available  therefore not an attractive investment                                      In       four reactors were permanently closed  San Onofre   and   in California  Crystal River   in Florida  and Kewaunee in Wisconsin                          Vermont Yankee  in Vernon  was shut down on December           New York state eventually closed Indian Point Energy Center  in Buchanan     miles from New York City  on April                      
In      the NRC approved a second    year license extension for Turkey Point units   and    the first time NRC had extended licenses to    years total lifetime  Similar extensions for about    reactors are planned or intended  with more expected in the future  This will reduce demand for replacement new builds             

Controversy  concerns  and criticisms edit 
Byrne and Hoffman wrote in       that since the     s the NRC has generally favored the interests of nuclear industry  and been unduly responsive to industry concerns  while failing to pursue tough regulation  The NRC has often sought to hamper or deny public access to the regulatory process  and created new barriers to public participation             
Barack Obama  when running for president in       said that the five member NRC had become  captive of the industries that it regulates              
Numerous different observers have criticized the NRC as an example of regulatory capture                         The NRC has been accused of having conflicting roles as regulator and  salesman  in a      Reuters article              doing an inadequate job by the Union of Concerned Scientists              and the agency approval process has been called a  rubber stamp              
Frank N  von Hippel wrote in March       that despite the      Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania  the NRC has often been too timid in ensuring that America s commercial reactors are operated safely 


Nuclear power regulation is a textbook example of the problem of  regulatory capture    in which an industry gains control of an agency meant to regulate it  Regulatory capture can be countered only by vigorous public scrutiny and Congressional oversight  but in the    years since Three Mile Island  interest in nuclear regulation has declined precipitously             


An article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists stated that many forms of NRC regulatory failure exist  including regulations ignored by the common consent of NRC and industry 


A worker  named George Galatis  at the Millstone Nuclear Power Plant in Connecticut kept warning management  that the spent fuel rods were being put too quickly into the spent storage pool and that the number of rods in the pool exceeded specifications  Management ignored him  so he went directly to the NRC  which eventually admitted that it knew of both of the forbidden practices  which happened at many plants  but chose to ignore them  The whistleblower was fired and blacklisted             


Terrorism concerns and threats edit 
NRC headquarters outside Rockville  Maryland
Terrorist attacks such as those executed by al Qaeda on New York City and Washington  D C   on September                and in London on July               have prompted fears that extremist groups might use radioactive dirty bombs in further attacks in the United States and elsewhere                                     
In March       undercover investigators from the Government Accountability Office set up a false company and obtained a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that would have allowed them to buy the radioactive materials needed for a dirty bomb  According to the GAO report  NRC officials did not visit the company or attempt to personally interview its executives  Instead  within    days  the NRC mailed the license to the West Virginia postal box  Upon receipt of the license  GAO officials were able to easily modify its stipulations and remove a limit on the amount of radioactive material they could buy  A spokesman for the NRC said that the agency considered the radioactive devices a  lower level threat   a bomb built with the materials could have contaminated an area about the length of a city block but would not have presented an immediate health hazard             

     congressional report edit 
Twelve years into NRC operations  a      congressional report entitled  NRC Coziness with Industry              concluded  that the NRC  has not maintained an arms length regulatory posture with the commercial nuclear power industry      and  has  in some critical areas  abdicated its role as a regulator altogether              To cite three examples 
A      Congressional report found that NRC staff had provided valuable technical assistance to the utility seeking an operating license for the controversial Seabrook plant  In the late     s  the NRC  created a policy  of non enforcement by asserting its discretion not to enforce license conditions  between September      and       the  NRC has either waived or chosen not to enforce regulations at nuclear power reactors over     times   Finally  critics charge that the NRC has ceded important aspects of regulatory authority to the industry s own Institute for Nuclear Power Operations  INPO   an organization formed by utilities in response to the Three Mile Island Accident            


Nuclear Reactor License Renewal Program edit 
One example involves the license renewal program that NRC initiated to extend the operating licenses for the nation s fleet of commercial nuclear reactors  Environmental impact statements  EIS  were prepared for each reactor to extend the operational period from    to    years  One study examined the EISs and found significant flaws  included failure to consider significant issues of concern              It also found that the NRC management had significantly underestimated the risk and consequences posed by a severe reactor accident such as a full scale nuclear meltdown  NRC management asserted  without scientific evidence  that the risk of such accidents were so  Small  that the impacts could be dismissed and therefore no analysis of human and environmental was even performed  Such a conclusion is scientifically indefensible given the experience of the Three Mile Island  Chernobyl  and Fukushima accidents  Another finding was that NRC had concealed the risk posed to the public at large by disregarding one of the most important EIS requirements  mandating that cumulative impacts be assessed     Code of Federal Regulations           By disregarding this basic requirement  NRC effectively misrepresented the risk posed to the nation by approximately two orders of magnitude  i e   the true risk is about     greater than NRC represented   These findings were corroborated in a final report prepared by a special Washington State Legislature Nuclear Power Task Force  titled   Doesn t NRC Address Consequences of Severe Accidents in EISs for re licensing                                                  

Post Fukushima edit 
In Vermont  the day before the      T hoku earthquake and tsunami that damaged Japan s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant  the NRC approved a    year extension for the license of Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant  although the Vermont state legislature voted overwhelmingly to deny an extension              The plant had been found to be leaking radioactive materials through a network of underground pipes  which Entergy had denied under oath even existed  At a hearing in       Tony Klein  chairman of the Vermont House Natural Resources and Energy Committee had asked the NRC about the pipes and the NRC also did not know they existed             
In March       the Union of Concerned Scientists released a study critical of the NRC s      performance as a regulator  The UCS said that over the years  it had found the NRC s enforcement of safety rules has not been  timely  consistent  or effective  and it cited     near misses  at U S  plants in      alone             
In April       Reuters reported that diplomatic cables showed NRC sometimes being used as a sales tool to help push American technology to foreign governments  when  lobbying for the purchase of equipment made by Westinghouse Electric Company and other domestic manufacturers   This gives the appearance of a regulator which is acting in a commercial capacity   raising concerns about a potential conflict of interest              
San Clemente Green  an environmental group opposed to the continued operation of the San Onofre Nuclear Plant  said in      that instead of being a watchdog  the NRC too often rules in favor of nuclear plant operators                  independent source needed     
In       the T hoku earthquake and tsunami led to unprecedented damage and flooding of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant  The subsequent loss of offsite power and flooding of onsite emergency diesel generators led to loss of coolant and subsequent Nuclear meltdown of three reactor cores  The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster led to an uncontrolled release of radioactive contamination  and forced the Japanese Government to evacuate approximately         citizens             
Gregory Jaczko was chairman of the NRC when the      Fukushima disaster occurred in Japan  Jaczko looked for lessons for the US  and strengthened security regulations for nuclear power plants  For example  he supported the requirement that new plants be able to withstand an aircraft crash              On February          Jaczko cast the lone dissenting vote on plans to build the first new nuclear power plant in more than    years when the NRC voted     to allow Atlanta based Southern Co to build and operate two new nuclear power reactors at its existing Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia  He cited safety concerns stemming from Japan s      Fukushima nuclear disaster  saying  I cannot support issuing this license as if Fukushima never happened               In July       Mark Cooper said that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is  on the defensive to prove it is doing its job of ensuring safety               In October       Jaczko described  a tension between wanting to move in a timely manner on regulatory questions  and not wanting to go too fast              
In      Edward J  Markey  Democrat of Massachusetts  criticized the NRC s response to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster and the decision making on the proposed Westinghouse AP     reactor design                         
In       a total of    groups and individuals from across the nation formally asked the NRC to suspend all licensing and other activities at    proposed nuclear reactor projects in    states until the NRC completed a thorough post Fukushima nuclear disaster examination                         

 The petition seeks suspension of six existing reactor license renewal decisions  Columbia Generating Station  WA Davis Besse Nuclear Power Station  OH  Diablo Canyon Power Plant  CA  Indian Point Energy Center  NY  Pilgrim Nuclear Generating Station  MA  and Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant  NH      new reactor combined construction permit and operating license decisions  Bellefonte Nuclear Generating Station Units   and    AL  Bell Bend  Callaway Nuclear Generating Station  MO  Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Generating Station  MD  Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant  TX  Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station  MI  Levy County Nuclear Power Plant  FL North Anna Nuclear Generating Station  VA  Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant  NC  South Texas Nuclear Generating Station  TX  Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station  FL  Alvin W  Vogtle Electric Generating Plant  GA  and William States Lee III Nuclear Generating Station  SC  a construction permit decision  Bellefonte Units   and     and an operating license decision  Watts Bar Nuclear Generating Station  TN   In addition  the petition asks the NRC to halt proceedings to approve the standardized AP     and Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor designs             
The petitioners asked the NRC to supplement its own investigation by establishing an independent commission comparable to that set up in the wake of the less severe       Three Mile Island accident  The petitioners included Public Citizen  Southern Alliance for Clean Energy  and San Luis Obispo Mothers for Peace             

Intentionally concealing reports concerning the risks of flooding edit

Following the Fukushima disaster  the NRC prepared a report in      to examine the risk that dam failures posed on the nation s fleet of nuclear reactors  A redacted version of NRC s report on dam failures was posted on the NRC website on March    The original  un redacted version was leaked to the public 
The un redacted version which was leaked to the public highlights the threat that flooding poses to nuclear power plants located near large dams and substantiates claims that NRC management has intentionally misled the public for years about the severity of the flooding 
The leaked version of the report concluded that one third of the U S  nuclear fleet     plants  may face flooding hazards greater than they were designed to withstand  It also shows that NRC management was aware of some aspects of this risk for    years and yet it had done nothing to effectively address the problem  Some flooding events are so serious that they could result in a  severe  nuclear accident  up to  and including  a nuclear meltdown 
This criticism is corroborated by two NRC whistleblowers who accused their management of deliberately covering up information concerning the vulnerability of flooding  and of failing to take corrective actions despite being aware of these risks for years  Richard Perkins  a second risk engineer with the NRC and the lead author of the leaked report  filed a complaint with the agency s Inspector General  asserting that NRC staff had improperly redacted information from the public version of his report  to prevent the disclosure of this safety information to the public because it will embarrass the agency   Perkins wrote   Concurrently  the NRC concealed the information from the public              
Larry Criscione  a second NRC risk engineer also raised concerns about the NRC withholding information concerning the risk of flooding  He stated that assertions by NRC s management that plants are  currently able to mitigate flooding events   was false 
David Lochbaum  a nuclear engineer and safety advocate with the Union of Concerned Scientists   The redacted information shows that the NRC is lying to the American public about the safety of U S  reactors              
The Oconee Nuclear Station has been shown to be at particular risk from flooding  An NRC letter dated      states that  a Jocassee Dam failure is a credible event   It goes on to state that  NRC staff expressed concerns that Duke has not demonstrated that the  null Oconee Nuclear Station  units will be adequately protected              
NRC s      leaked report notes that  dam failure incidents are common   NRC estimated the odds that dams constructed like Jocassee will fail is about   in       failures per year  Oconee is licensed to operate for another    years  The odds of the Jocassee Dam failing over that period are   in      NRC requires risks to be investigated if they have a frequency of more than   in        years  For a reactor operating over a period of    years  these risks must be evaluated if they have a chance greater than a   in     of occurring 
NRC identified    reactors that lie downstream from a total of more than    dams  More than half of these dams are roughly the size of the Jocassee dam  Assuming the NRC s failure rate applies to all of these dams  the chance that one will fail over the next    years is about one in four or    percent chance  This dam failure rate does not include risks posed by earthquakes or terrorism  Thus  the true probability may be much higher             
This raised a second and potentially larger issue  NRC recently completed its license renewal program which extended the operating licenses of the nation s fleet of nuclear reactors for an additional    years  NRC stated that the probability of a severe accident is so incredible that the consequences can be dismissed from the analysis of impacts in its relicensing environmental impact statements  EIS   Yet this conflicts with NRC s internal analyses which concluded that flooding presented a serious human and environmental risk  Critics charge that if these relicensing EISs failed to evaluate the risks of flooding  then how can the public be confident that NRC did not mislead stakeholders concerning other risks such as the potential for a nuclear meltdown 
NRC officials stated in June      that US nuclear safety rules do not adequately weigh the risk of a single event that would knock out electricity from the grid and from emergency generators  as a quake and tsunami did in Japan              In October          update       and NRC instructed agency staff to move forward with seven of the    safety recommendations put forward by a federal task force in July       The recommendations include  new standards aimed at strengthening operators  ability to deal with a complete loss of power  ensuring plants can withstand floods and earthquakes and improving emergency response capabilities   The new safety standards will take up to five years to fully implement             
In November          update       Jaczko warned power companies against complacency and said the agency must  push ahead with new rules prompted by the nuclear crisis in Japan  while also resolving long running issues involving fire protection and a new analysis of earthquake risks              

The U S  Nuclear Regulatory Commission has also been criticized for its reluctance to allow for innovation and experimentation  even controlled for and purportedly safe methods of deploying nuclear power that countries such as Poland are approving before the United States  As reported by Reason magazine in May       Oregon s NuScale Power signed an agreement with the Polish mining and processing firm KGHM to deploy NuScale s innovative small modular nuclear reactors  SMRs  in Poland by       At the U N  s Glasgow Climate Change Conference in November  NuScale contracted with a Romanian energy company to deploy its SMR technology in that country by       NuScale has signed similar memoranda of understanding with electric power companies in Bulgaria  the Czech Republic  and Ukraine 
This kind of advanced energy technology will likely be powering homes and businesses in Europe before the first reactor is completed in the United States  That s because the U S  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  is in no hurry to help             


Exceeding powers licensing off site interim storage facility edit 
In September      the NRC issued a license for a privately operated temporary consolidated interim storage facility  CISF  for spent nuclear fuel in Andrews County  Texas  However a group including the State of Texas  which had passed a law in      prohibiting the storage of high level waste in the state  petitioned for a court review of the license  In August      the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the NRC does not have the authority from Congress under the Atomic Energy Act or the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to license such a temporary storage facility that is not at a nuclear power station or federal site  nullifying the purported license  Another CISF in New Mexico is similarly being challenged in the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit
