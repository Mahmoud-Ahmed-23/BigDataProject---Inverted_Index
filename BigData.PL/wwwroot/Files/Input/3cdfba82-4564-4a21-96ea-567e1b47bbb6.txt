Allen Newell  March                  July           was an American researcher in computer science and cognitive psychology at the RAND Corporation and at Carnegie Mellon University s School of Computer Science  Tepper School of Business  and Department of Psychology  He  Herbert A  Simon  and Cliff Shaw contributed to the Information Processing Language        and two of the earliest AI programs  the Logic Theorist        and the General Problem Solver         He and Simon were awarded the ACM s A M  Turing Award in      for their contributions to artificial intelligence and the psychology of human cognition                       


Early studies edit 
Newell completed his bachelor s degree in physics from Stanford in       He was a graduate student at Princeton University from      to       where he studied mathematics  Due to his early exposure to an unknown field known as game theory and the experiences from the study of mathematics  he was convinced that he would prefer a combination of experimental and theoretical research to pure mathematics  
In       he left Princeton and joined the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica where he worked for  a group that was studying logistics problems of the Air Force              His work with Joseph Kruskal led to the creation of two theories  A Model for Organization Theory and Formulating Precise Concepts in Organization Theory   Newell eventually earned his PhD from the now Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon with Herbert Simon serving as his advisor 
Afterwards  Newell  turned to the design and conduct of laboratory experiments on decision making in small groups              He was dissatisfied  however  with the accuracy and validity of their findings produced from small scale laboratory experiments  He joined with fellow RAND teammates John Kennedy  Bob Chapman  and Bill Biel at an Air Force Early Warning Station to study organizational processes in flight crews  They received funding from the Air Force in      to build a simulator that would enable them to examine and analyze the interactions in the cockpit related to decision making and information handling  From these studies  Newell came to believe that information processing is the central activity in organizations            

Artificial intelligence edit 
In September       Newell enrolled in a seminar where Oliver Selfridge  described a running computer program that learned to recognize letters and other patterns              This was when Allen came to believe that systems may be created and contain intelligence and have the ability to adapt  With this in mind  Allen  after a couple of months  wrote in      The Chess Machine  An Example of Dealing with a Complex Task by Adaptation  which  outlined an imaginative design for a computer program to play chess in humanoid fashion             
His work came to the attention of economist  and future nobel laureate  Herbert A  Simon  and  together with programmer J  C  Shaw  they developed the first true artificial intelligence program            see notes   the Logic Theorist  Newell s work on the program laid the foundations of the field  His inventions included  list processing  the most important programming paradigm used by AI ever since   the application of means ends analysis to general reasoning  or  reasoning as search    and the use of heuristics to limit the search space 
They presented the program at the Dartmouth conference of       an informal gathering of researchers who were interested in simulating intelligence with machines  The conference  now widely considered the  birth of artificial intelligence              was enormously influential and those who attended became the leaders of AI research for the next two decades  Newell included 

Later achievements edit 
Newell and Simon formed a lasting partnership  They founded an artificial intelligence laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University and produced a series of important programs and theoretical insights throughout the late fifties and sixties  This work included the General Problem Solver  a highly influential implementation of means ends analysis  and the physical symbol systems hypothesis  the controversial philosophical assertion that all intelligent behavior could be reduced to the kind of symbol manipulation that Newell s programs demonstrated 
Newell s work culminated in the development of a cognitive architecture known as Soar and his unified theory of cognition  published in       but their improvement was the objective of his efforts up to his death  one of the last Newell s letters Archived            at the Wayback Machine   The field of cognitive architectures  that he initiated  is still active in both the artificial intelligence and computational cognitive science communities
