What is Competitive Programming 

Competitive programming nbsp is a nbsp mind sport  where people compete against each other to solve some programming questions logic with an efficient approach and within a time constraint  The goal of competitive programming is to write code to solve a problem within a given timeframe  nbsp 

For those aiming to dive into competitive programming  the GeeksforGeeks Practice Platform offers a wide variety of problems to help you build speed and accuracy 
Why Should You Do Competitive Programming 
Competitive programming is the best way to master your nbsp analytical thinking  nbsp and nbsp logical thinking nbsp and improve your coding skills  It is now being considered by many tech giants like nbsp Google nbsp and nbsp Facebook  nbsp Also  Facebook nbsp organizes the nbsp Meta Hacker Cup annually to promote all the Competitive Programmers around the world to compete against one another and earn a chance to get hired at Meta 
Here are some reasons about why you should start Competitive Programming 

Mental Agility and Quick Thinking  By practicing competitive programming  you start thinking quickly and within the given timeframe and this improves your mental agility and helps enhance your thinking ability 
Competitive Spirit  Competitive programming can be fun for those who enjoy the thrill of competition  Solving challenging problems that too within a timeframe nbsp boosts confidence nbsp and a sense of accomplishment  
Career Prospect  Competitive programming nbsp is very important when it comes to technical interviews for software engineering related jobs  nbsp Many tech giants use competitive programming contests as a medium of recruitment  Companies like Google  nbsp ServiceNow  nbsp Atlassian  etc  have nbsp technical interviews nbsp based on competitive programming problems  
Learning Opportunity  In Competitive programming  we get a wide range of variety of problems and nbsp various arithmetic concepts  Competitive programming exposes various data structures and algorithms which help us better understand the complexity of problems  
Personal Growth as a Programmer  Competitive programming is one of the best ways to grow as a programmer  It helps you get a command over problem solving  as you ve to solve challenging problems within a time limit  nbsp 
Networking  Participating in various coding contests gives you a chance to be a part of communities with like minded people  Here in these communities  you get various important resources and guidance from experts who can help you get so many opportunities like referrals  job opening information  mentorship  etc  nbsp
