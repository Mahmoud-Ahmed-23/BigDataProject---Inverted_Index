The right to privacy is an element of various legal traditions that intends to restrain governmental and private actions that threaten the privacy of individuals                 failed verification                 Over     national constitutions mention the right to privacy             
Since the global surveillance disclosures of       the right to privacy has been a subject of international debate  Government agencies  such as the NSA  FBI  CIA  R amp AW  and GCHQ  have engaged in mass  global surveillance  Some current debates around the right to privacy include whether privacy can co exist with the current capabilities of intelligence agencies to access and analyze many details of an individual s life  whether or not the right to privacy is forfeited as part of the social contract to bolster defense against supposed terrorist threats  and whether threats of terrorism are a valid excuse to spy on the general population  Private sector actors can also threaten the right to privacy                  particularly technology companies  such as Amazon  Apple  Meta  Google  Microsoft  and Yahoo that use and collect personal data 


International edit 
The right to privacy is a fundamental human right firmly grounded in international law  On         December       the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  UDHR   while the right to privacy does not appear in the document  Article    mentions privacy  

No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with their privacy  family  home or correspondence  nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation  Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks 
        Universal Declaration of Human Rights  Article   
Privacy is later codified in successive  hard  international human human rights treaties  including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights                       

No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy  family  home or correspondence  nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation 
Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks 
        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  Article   
History edit 
The concept of a human  right to privacy  begins when the Latin word ius expanded from meaning  what is fair  to include  a right   an entitlement a person possesses to control or claim something   by the Decretum Gratiani in Bologna  Italy in the   th century            
In the United States  an article in the    December       issue of the Harvard Law Review entitled  The Right to Privacy   written by attorney Samuel D  Warren II and future U S  Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis  is often cited as the first explicit finding of a U S  right to privacy  Warren II and Brandeis wrote that privacy is the  right to be let alone   and focused on protecting individuals  This approach was a response to recent technological developments of the time  such as photography and sensationalist journalism  also known as  yellow journalism             
Privacy rights are inherently intertwined with information technology  In his widely cited dissenting opinion in Olmstead v  United States         Brandeis relied on thoughts he developed in the article  The Right to Privacy              In that dissent  he urged that personal privacy matters were more relevant to constitutional law  going so far as to say that  the government was identified as a potential privacy invader   He writes   Discovery and invention have made it possible for the Government  by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack  to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet   At that time  telephones were often community assets  with shared party lines and potentially eavesdropping switchboard operators  By the time of Katz  in       telephones had become personal devices with lines not shared across homes and switching was electro mechanical  In the     s  new computing and recording technologies raised more concerns about privacy  resulting in the Fair Information Practice Principles 
In recent years  there have been few attempts to clearly and precisely define the  right to privacy             

As an individual right edit 
 Don t take pictures of me   drawing school  Russia      
Alan Westin believes that new technologies alter the balance between privacy and disclosure and that privacy rights may limit government surveillance to protect democratic processes  Westin defines privacy as  the claim of individuals  groups  or institutions to determine for themselves when  how  and to what extent information about them is communicated to others   Westin describes   states of privacy  solitude  intimacy  anonymity  and reserve  These states must balance participation against norms 

Each individual is continually engaged in a personal adjustment process in which he balances the desire for privacy with the desire for disclosure and communication of themself to others  in light of the environmental conditions and social norms set by the society in which they live 
  Alan Westin  Privacy and Freedom                 
Under liberal democratic systems  privacy creates a space separate from political life  and allows personal autonomy  while ensuring democratic freedoms of association and expression  Privacy to individuals is the ability to behave  think  speak  and express ideas without the monitoring or surveillance of someone else  Individuals exercise their freedom of expression through attending political rallies and choosing to hide their identities online by using pseudonyms 
David Flaherty believes networked computer databases pose threats to privacy  He develops  data protection  as an aspect of privacy  which involves  the collection  use  and dissemination of personal information   This concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally  Flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control   individuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is used              
Marc Rotenberg has described the modern right to privacy as Fair Information Practices   the rights and responsibilities associated with the collection and use of personal information   Rotenberg emphasizes that the allocation of rights are to the data subject and the responsibilities are assigned to the data collectors because of the transfer of the data and the asymmetry of information concerning data practices             
Richard Posner and Lawrence Lessig focus on the economic aspects of personal information control  Posner criticizes privacy for concealing information  which reduces market efficiency  For Posner  employment is selling oneself in the labor market  which he believes is like selling a product  Any  defect  in the  product  that is not reported is fraud              For Lessig  privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law   Lessig claims that  the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right   and that  individuals should be able to control information about themselves               Economic approaches to privacy make communal conceptions of privacy difficult to maintain 
Adam D  Moore has argued that privacy  the right to control access to and use of personal information is closely connected to human well being  He notes that  having the ability and authority to regulate access to and uses of locations  bodies  and personal information  is an essential part of human flourishing  and while  the forms of privacy may be culturally relative       the need for privacy is not              

As a collective value and a human right edit 
There have been attempts to reframe privacy as a fundamental human right  whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societies             
Priscilla Regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy  She supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions  shared perceptions  public values  and collective components  Shared ideas about privacy allow freedom of conscience and diversity in thought  Public values guarantee democratic participation  including freedoms of speech and association  and limit government power  Collective elements describe privacy as a collective good that cannot be divided  Regan s goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making   if we did recognize the collective or public good value of privacy  as well as the common and public value of privacy  those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protection              
Leslie Regan Shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation  and ensures human dignity and autonomy  Privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed  and if this is appropriate  Violations of privacy depend on context  The human right to privacy has precedent in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights  Shade believes that privacy must be approached from a people centered perspective  and not through the marketplace             

Privacy laws in different jurisdictions edit 
Privacy laws apply to both public and private sector actors 

Australia edit 
See also  Privacy in Australian law
Australia does not have a constitutional right to privacy  However  the Privacy Act       Cth  provides a degree of protection over an individual s personally identifiable information and its usage by the government and large companies              The Privacy Act also outlines the    Australian Privacy Principles             
Australia also lacks a tort against invasions of privacy  In the      case of Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd              CLR          the High Court of Australia explained that there stood the possibility of  a tort identified as unjustified invasion of privacy               but that this case lacked the facts to establish it              Since       there have been some state based cases namely the      case Grosse v Purvis           QDC          and the      case Doe v Australian Broadcasting Corporation           VCC         that attempted to establish a tortious invasion of privacy  but these cases were settled before decisions could be made  Further  they have received conflicting analyses in later cases             

Canada edit 
Main article  Canadian privacy lawCanadian privacy law is derived from the common law  statutes of the Parliament of Canada and the various provincial legislatures  and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  Perhaps ironically  Canada s legal conceptualization of privacy  along with most modern legal Western conceptions of privacy  can be traced back to Warren and Brandeis s  The Right to Privacy  published in the Harvard Law Review in       Holvast states  Almost all authors on privacy start the discussion with the famous article  The Right to Privacy  of Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis  
China edit 
The Constitution is the highest law in China  Privacy rights have been applied throughout China              The Constitution provides direction for all states in China and it further stipulates that  all states must abide by and be held accountable for any violation of the Constitution and the law  the law specifically protects civil rights of a citizen s personal dignity and confidentiality of correspondence               China has a new standard and the first of its kind for the country coming into effect   January       the Civil Code is the first of its kind sweeping law replacing all laws covering general provisions  real property  contracts  personality rights  marriage and family  inheritance  tort liability  and supplementary provisions             
In many cases raised in the legal system  these rights have been overlooked as the courts have not treated each case with the same legal precedent for each case   China deploys mass surveillance on its population including through the use of closed circuit television             
The      Data Security Law classifies data into different categories and establishes corresponding levels of protection                                    It imposes significant data localization requirements  in a response to the extraterritorial reach of the United States CLOUD Act or similar foreign laws                                       
The      Personal Information Protection Law is China s first comprehensive law on personal data rights and is modeled after the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation                                   

European Union edit

The right to privacy is protected in the EU by European Convention on Human Rights Article   

   Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life  his home and his correspondence 
   There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security  public safety or the economic well being of the country  for the prevention of disorder or crime  for the protection of health or morals  or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others 

        European Convention on Human Rights
Compared to the United States  the European Union  EU  has more extensive data protection laws             
The General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR  is an important component of EU privacy law and of human rights law  in particular Article      of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union 
Under GDPR  data about citizens may only be gathered or processed under specific cases  and with certain conditions  Requirements of data controller parties under the GDPR include keeping records of their processing activities  adopting data protection policies  transparency with data subjects  appointing a Data Protection Officer  and implementing technical safeguards to mitigate security risks      citation needed     

Council of Europe edit 
The Council of Europe gathered to discuss the protection of individuals when the Convention Treaty No     was created and opened for signature by member states and for accession by non member States             
The Convention closed and was then renamed Convention      Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data 
Convention     has undergone   ratifications with the last ratification    January      officially changing the name to Convention      and providing the summary stating the intent of the treaty as 

The first binding international instrument which protects the individual against abuses which may accompany the collection and processing of personal data  and which seeks to regulate at the same time the transfrontier flow of personal data             
Increase use of the Internet and technological advancement in products lead to the Council of Europe to look at Convention      and the relevance of the Treaty in the wake of the changes 
In      the modernization of Convention      started and completed in      amending the treaty with Protocol CETS No                
This modernization of Convention      was in progress while the EU data protection rules were developed  the EU data protection rules would be adapted to become the GDPR 

India edit 
Main articles  Right to Privacy verdict and Digital Personal Data Protection Act      
The new data sharing policy of WhatsApp with Facebook after Facebook acquired WhatsApp in      has been challenged in the Supreme Court  The Supreme Court must decide if the right to privacy can be enforced against private entities             
The Indian Supreme Court with nine judge bench under JS Khehar  ruled on    August       that the right to privacy is a fundamental right for Indian citizens per Article    of the Constitution and additionally under Part III rights  Specifically  the court adopted the three pronged test required for the encroachment of any Article    right   legality                  i e  through an existing law  necessity  in terms of a legitimate state objective and proportionality  that ensures a rational nexus between the object of the invasion and the means adopted to achieve that object             
This clarification was crucial to prevent the dilution of the right in the future on the whims and fancies of the government in power              The Court adopted a liberal interpretation of the fundamental rights to meet the challenges posed an increasing digital age  It held that individual liberty must extend to digital spaces and individual autonomy and privacy must be protected             
This ruling by the Supreme Court paved the way for decriminalization of homosexuality in India on   September       thus legalizing same sex sexual intercourse between two consenting adults in private              India is the world s biggest democracy and with this ruling  it has joined United States  Canada  South Africa  the European Union  and the UK in recognizing this fundamental right             
India s Data Protection law is known as Digital Personal Data Protection Act       

Israel edit 
In Israel privacy protection is a constitutional basic right and is therefore protected by the Basic Law  Basic Law  the Knesset passed on    February       by the Third Knesset              The Twelfth Knesset update to the Basic Law occurred on    March       This update added to the law Human Dignity and Liberty by defining  Human freedom in Israel as being the right to leave the country and enter it  as well as the right to privacy and intimacy  refrainment from searches relating to one s private property  body and possessions  and avoidance of violations of the privacy of one s speech  writings and notes 
October      Israel established a regulatory authority  the PPA  part of the Ministry of Justice  PPA defined the Privacy Law and associated regulates based on two principles  general right to online privacy and the protection of personal data stored in databases             

New Zealand edit 
This section is an excerpt from Right to privacy in New Zealand  edit 
New Zealand is committed to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and has ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  both of which contain a right to privacy              Privacy law in New Zealand is dealt with by statute and the common law  The Privacy Act      addresses the collection  storage and handling of information   A general right to privacy has otherwise been created in the tort of privacy  Such a right was recognised in Hosking v Runting          NZLR      a case that dealt with publication of private facts  In the subsequent case C v Holland        NZHC      the Court recognised a right to privacy in the sense of seclusion or a right to be free from unwanted intrusion      note       
Russia edit 
The Constitution of the Russian Federation  Article    states             

State protection of human and civil rights and freedoms in the Russian Federation shall be guaranteed 
Everyone shall the right to protect his  her  rights and freedoms by all means not prohibited by law 
Main article  Data protection  privacy  laws in Russia
The Russian Constitution specifically articles    and     institutes individual citizen the right to privacy   Russia  a member of the Strasbourg Convention  ratified processing of personal data against automatic processing and afterwards adopted a new convention  The new Russian Federal Law No     FZ R implemented on    July       was updated to cover Personal Data and this law extends privacy to include personal and family secrets  Its main target is to protect individuals  personal data 
Privacy entered the forefront of Russian legislature in      when the approach to privacy turned to the goal of protecting privacy of government operations and the people of Russia  The amendments originally modified the Personal Data Law which has since been renamed The Data Localisation Law  The new law requires business operators who collect any information on Russian citizens  must maintain the collected data locally  This means that data transmission  processing  and storage must be in a database in Russia    March       the new amendment came into effect  Consent from the data subject is required if the data operator wants to use the data publicly             

United States edit 
Main article  Privacy laws of the United States
The Constitution of the United States and United States Bill of Rights do not explicitly include a right to privacy              Currently no federal law takes a holistic approach to privacy regulation 
In the US  privacy and expectations of privacy have been determined via court cases  Those protections have been established through court decisions provide a reasonable expectations of privacy 
The Supreme Court in Griswold v  Connecticut      U S             found that the Constitution guarantees a right to privacy against governmental intrusion via penumbras located in the founding text             
In       Warren and Brandeis drafted an article published in the Harvard Law Review titled  The Right To Privacy  that is often cited as the first implicit finding of a U S  stance on the right to privacy            
Right to privacy has been the justification for decisions involving a wide range of civil liberties cases  including Pierce v  Society of Sisters  which invalidated a successful      Oregon initiative requiring compulsory public education  Roe v  Wade  which struck down an abortion law from Texas  and thus restricted state powers to enforce laws against abortion  and Lawrence v  Texas  which struck down a Texas sodomy law  and thus eliminated state powers to enforce laws against sodomy  Dobbs v  Jackson Women s Health Organization later overruled Roe v  Wade  in part due to the Supreme Court finding that the right to privacy was not mentioned in the constitution              leaving the future validity of these decisions uncertain             
Legally  the right of privacy is a basic law             which includes 

The right of persons to be free from unwarranted publicity
Unwarranted appropriation of one s personality
Publicizing one s private affairs without a legitimate public concern
Wrongful intrusion into one s private activities
However  outside of recognized private locations  American law  for the most part  grants next to no privacy for those in public areas  In other words  no verbal or written consent is needed to take photos or videos of those in public areas              This laxness extends to potentially embarrassing situations such as when actress Jennifer Garner bent over to retrieve something from her car and revealed her thong underwear to create a whale tail  Because the photographer took the photo in a public location  in this case a pumpkin patch  circulating the photo online was a legal act             
For the health care sector where medical records are part of an individual s privacy  The Privacy Rule of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act was passed in       This act safeguards medical data of the patient which also includes giving individuals rights over their health information  like getting a copy of their records and seeking correction              Medical anthropologist Khiara Bridges has argued that the US Medicare system requires so much personal disclosure from pregnant women that they effectively do not have privacy rights             

CCPA edit 
In       California set out to create a policy promoting data protection  the first state in the United States to pursue such protection  The resulting effort is the California Consumer Privacy Act  CCPA   reviewed as a critical juncture where the legal definition of what privacy entails from California lawmakers  perspective  The California Consumer Protection Act is a privacy law protecting the residents of California and their Personal identifying information  The law enacts regulation over all companies regardless of operational geography protecting the six Intentional Acts included in the law             
The intentions included in the Act provide California residents with the right to 

Know what personal data is being collected about them 
Know whether their personal data is sold or disclosed and to whom 
Say no to the sale of personal data 
Access their personal data 
Request a business to delete any personal information about a consumer collected from that consumer 
Not be discriminated against for exercising their privacy rights 
Mass surveillance edit 
Further information  Global surveillance  Edward Snowden  and Global surveillance disclosures       present 
United States edit 
Governmental organizations such as the National Security Agency  NSA   CIA  and GCHQ amongst others are authorized to conduct mass surveillance throughout other nations in the world  Programs such as PRISM  MYSTIC  and other operations conducted by NATO member states are capable of collecting a vast quantity of metadata  internet history  and even actual recordings of phone calls from various countries              Domestic law enforcement at the federal level is conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation  so these agencies have never been authorized to collect US data              PRISM has faced criticism for privacy concerns  in that it collects  metadata and communication content   However  scholars have argued that programs like PRISM do more good than harm  in that they protect Americans from foreign threats             
After the September    attacks  the NSA turned its surveillance apparatus on the US and its citizens             
In March       James Clapper  the Director of National Intelligence at the time  testified under oath that the NSA does not  wittingly  collect data on Americans  Clapper later retracted this statement             
The US Government s own Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board  PCLOB  reviewed the confidential security documents  and found in      that the program did not have  a single instance involving a threat to the United States in which the program made a concrete difference  in counterterrorism or the disruption of a terrorist attack             

China edit 
The Chinese government is conducting mass surveillance in Xinjiang province for detention of Muslims  As part of its  Strike Hard Campaign against Violent Terrorism  policy the authorities in China have subjugated    million Turkish Muslims to the highest order of restrictions             
During the COVID    pandemic the Chinese authorities documented the contact information and travel history of every individual and issued red  yellow and green badges codes for transportation and entering stores  These badges codes were also sometimes misused to freeze bank accounts and pressurize the protestors who were angry about the severe restrictions  The privacy of these health codes remain unacknowledged and unaddressed

It is often claimed  particularly by those in the eye of the media  that their right to privacy is violated when information about their private lives is reported in the press  The point of view of the press  however  is that the general public has a right to know personal information about those with status as a public figure  This distinction is encoded in most legal traditions as an element of freedom of speech 

Publication of private facts edit 
Publication of private facts speaks of the newsworthiness of private facts according to the law and the protections that private facts have              If a fact has significant newsworthiness to the public  it is protected by law under the freedom of the press  However  even if the fact is true  if it is not newsworthy  it is not necessarily protected  Digital Media Law Project uses examples such as sexual orientation  HIV status  and financial status to show that these can be publicly detrimental to the figure being posted about              The problem arises from the definition of newsworthiness 

Newsworthiness edit 
Main article  Newsworthiness
According to Digital Media Law Project  the courts will usually side with the press in the publication of private facts              This helps to uphold the freedom of the press in the US Constitution   there is a legitimate public interest in nearly all recent events  as well as in the private lives of prominent figures such as movie stars  politicians  and professional athletes               Digital Media Law Project supports these statements with citations to specific cases   While most recent events and prominent figures are considered newsworthy  it cannot go too far and too deep with a morbid curiosity              The media gain a lot of leverage once a person becomes a prominent figure and many things about their lives become newsworthy  Multiple cases such as Strutner v  Dispatch Printing Co       N E  d      Ohio Ct  App                    show that the publication of a person s home address and full name who is being questioned by the police is valid and  a newsworthy item of legitimate public concern   The last part to consider is whether this could be considered a form of doxxing  With the court upholding the newspaper s right to publish  this is much harder to change in the future   Newsworthiness has much around it that is held up by court rulings and case law  This is not in legislation but is created through the courts  as many other laws and practices are  These are still judged on a case by case basis as they are often settled through a lawsuit of some form              While there is a fair amount of case law supporting newsworthiness of subjects  it is hardly comprehensive and  news publications can publish things not covered and defend themselves in court for their right to publish these facts 

Technology edit 
This section needs expansion  You can help by adding to it    September      
Private sector actors can also threaten the right to privacy                  particularly technology companies  such as Amazon  Apple  Facebook  Google  and Yahoo that use and collect personal data  These private sector threats are more acute due to AI data processing             
In some American jurisdictions  the use of a person s name as a keyword under Google s AdWords for advertising or trade purposes without the person s consent             has raised certain personal privacy concerns              The right to privacy and social media content laws have been considered and enacted in several states  such as California s  online erasure  law protecting minors from leaving a digital trail  State laws  such as the CPPA in California  have granted more comprehensive protection             
However  the United States is behind that of European Union countries in protecting privacy online  For example  the  right to be forgotten  ruling by the EU Court of Justice protects both adults and minors              The General Data Protection Regulation has made significant progress to protect privacy from these risks  and it has led to a wave of privacy and data protection laws around the world  
Privacy is a major issue in the health care sector with technology becoming an essential component of it  Connecting personal data of patients to internet makes them vulnerable to cyber attacks  There are also concerns about how much data should be stored and who should have access to it             

Protection of minors edit 
United Kingdom edit 
Laws and courts in the UK uphold the protection of minors in the journalistic space  The Independent Press Standards Organisation  IPSO  in the UK have shown that the usage of footage of a    year old girl being bullied in      can be retroactively taken down due to fears of cyber bullying and potential harm done to the child in the future              This was after the Mail Online published the video without any attempt to hide the identity of the child  Following the newsworthiness point  it is possible that content like this would be allowed in the United States due to the recentness of the event              Protection of minors is a different matter in the United States with new stories about minors doing certain things and their faces are shown in a news publication  The Detroit Free Press  as an example  chose to do a hard hitting story about prostitution and drugs from a teenager but never named her or showed her face  only referring to her and the     year old from Taylor               In the UK  during the case of Campbell v MGN  Lord Hope stated that the protection of minors will be handled on a case by case basis and affected by the child s awareness of the photo and their expectation of privacy              Many factors will be considered such as the age of the children  activity  usage of real names  etc             

United States edit 
The protection of minors in the United States often falls on the shoulders of the Children s Online Privacy Protection Act  COPPA               This protects any children under the age of    from the collection of their data without their parent s or guardian s permission  This law is the reason why many sites will ask if you are under    or require you to be    to sign up  While this law is intended to protect preteen children  it fails to protect the information of anyone older than     including teenage minors  It also begins to overlap with other privacy protection laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  HIPAA
