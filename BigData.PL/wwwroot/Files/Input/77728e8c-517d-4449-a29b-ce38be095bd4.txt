project or collaborating with a team  Git keeps everything organized and under control  This Git Tutorial from beginner to advanced  will walk you through the basics of Git  making it easy to learn and implement in your projects  You will learn about GitHub fundamentals and advanced concepts like branches  pushing merge conflicts  and many useful Git CommandsIn a Distributed Version Control System  everyone working on a project has their complete copy of the project and its history about every change made by anyone  They can clone the git repository in their local machine and make the changes and also check the history where the previous changes were made in the project Suppose the SDE team of GeeksforGeeks is working on a large project  and    members are working together in this team  Here  a distributed version control system helps this team to create a local copy of the complete git repository on every team member s computer so they can easily commit  branch  and merge locally  Table of ContentPrerequisitesWhat is Git Why Use Git Working with GitWhat is Github Introduction to GitGit BasicsGit InstallationGit CommandsGit and GitHubGit and GitHub in VS CodeGit and

GitHubBest Practices for GitCommon Git Problems and Their FixesPrerequisites A Command Line Interface  CLI  installed Text Editor  e g   Visual Studio Code  Sublime Text  Basic Understanding of Programming ConceptsWhat is Git Git is an open source distributed version control system  DVCS  that allows developers to track and manage changes to their codebase  You can easily manage small as well as large projects with high speed and efficiency by Git  Unlike traditional version control systems  Git allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other s work  We can use Git privately as well as publically Let s try to understand it by taking an example   Geeksforgeeks Web Development team is building a website in which two developers are working one is Developer A who is working on the homepage and another is Developer B who works on the contact form  They both clone the Github repository  create separate branches  make changes and commit their work  After completion of their code  they push their code and open pull requests for review  After approval  the changes are merged into the main branch  By using Git they can easily track the changes without any kind of interference in each other s work and keep the project organized Git was developed by Linus Torvalds in      for Linux kernel development  Git        is the Latest Versions of GIT  released on March       Why Use Git Git offers numerous benefits to developers and development teams  Version Control  Git helps in tracking changes  allowing you to go back to previous states if something goes wrong Collaboration  It enables multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other s work Backup  Your entire project history is saved in a Git repository  providing a backup of all versions Branching and Merging  Git s branching model allows you to experiment with new features or bug fixes independently from the main project Open Source Projects  Most open source projects use Git for version control  Learning Git allows you to contribute to these projects Industry Standard  Git is widely used in the software industry  making it an essential skill for developers Working with GitInitializing a Repository  When you initialize a folder with Git  it becomes a repository  Git logs all changes made to a hidden folder within that repository Staging Changes  Git marks modified files as  staged   Staging prepares changes for a snapshot you want to keep Committing Changes  Once staged changes are satisfactory  commit them  Git maintains a complete record of each commit What is Github GitHub  a hosting service for Git repositories  allows you to access and download projects from any computer  Here s what you can do with GitHub Store Repositories  GitHub hosts your repositories Collaborate  Work with other developers from any location Version Control  Manage collaborative workflows using Git and GitHub

Workflow  A more structured workflow involving feature  release  and hotfix branches Forking Workflow  Fork the project  make changes  and then create a pull request Internal Working of GitGit uses a decentralized model where each developer has their own copy of the repository and works immediately on the project  Git manages the projects with repositories and can clone a project to operate locally on it  With staging and committing it track changes and control  You can pull the latest code of the project to the local copy  and push local updates to the main projects Git vs GitHub
