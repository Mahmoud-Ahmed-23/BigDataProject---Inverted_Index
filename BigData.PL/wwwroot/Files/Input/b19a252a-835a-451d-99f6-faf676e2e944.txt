British government information technology research program
This article is about the research programme  For people with this name  see Alvey  surname  
The Alvey Programme was a British government sponsored research programme in information technology that ran from      to       The programme was a reaction to the Japanese Fifth Generation project  which aimed to create a computer using massively parallel computing processing  The programme was not focused on any specific technology such as robotics  but rather supported research in knowledge engineering in the United Kingdom             It has been likened in operations to the U S  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  DARPA  and Japan s ICOT 

Background edit 
During the early     s  Japan invited the United Kingdom to become a part of the Fifth Generation Project             In October       a Department of Industry mission to Japan consisting of academics  civil servants and business representatives explored collaboration opportunities and attended the Fifth Generation conference                                  Informed by negotiations between ICL and Fujitsu conducted to  ensure the survival of ICL   suggesting that collaboration would only be possible in  very specific areas agreed upon by individual companies   it was concluded that an emulation of the Japanese approach would be preferable to any attempt at participating in the Japanese programme                                    
In response  a committee was created and was chaired by John Alvey  a technology director at British Telecom  The report generated proposed a different course of action to the Japanese initiative and became the basis for the UK s rejection of the Fifth Generation and the creation of its own Alvey Programme             The programme s fundamental goal was the improvement of the advanced information technology in the UK to address the declining performance of this sector             It operated in      until                 
Alvey was not involved in the programme itself            
The main focus areas of the Alvey Programme were as follows            

Advanced Microelectronics and VLSI
Intelligent Knowledge Based Systems  IKBS  or Artificial Intelligence  AI 
Software Engineering
Man Machine Interaction  including Natural Language Processing 
Alongside these areas  the provision of a communications infrastructure was a component of the programme             Various areas of endeavour were incorporated into the main focus areas  For example  systems architecture  specifically parallel processing  featured in the VLSI endeavour
