Academic field of study or profession
Not to be confused with School discipline 
An academic discipline or academic field is a subdivision of knowledge that is taught and researched at the college or university level  Disciplines are defined  in part  and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published  and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties within colleges and universities to which their practitioners belong  Academic disciplines are conventionally divided into the humanities  including philosophy  language  art and cultural studies   the scientific disciplines  such as physics  chemistry  and biology   and the formal sciences like mathematics and computer science  The social sciences are sometimes considered a fourth category  It is also known as a field of study  field of inquiry  research field and branch of knowledge  The different terms are used in different countries and fields 
Individuals associated with academic disciplines are commonly referred to as experts or specialists  Others  who may have studied liberal arts or systems theory rather than concentrating in a specific academic discipline  are classified as generalists 
While each academic discipline is a more or less focused practice  scholarly approaches such as multidisciplinarity interdisciplinarity  transdisciplinarity  and cross disciplinarity integrate aspects from multiple disciplines  thereby addressing any problems that may arise from narrow concentration within specialized fields of study   For example  professionals may encounter trouble communicating across academic disciplines because of differences in jargon  specified concepts  or methodology 
Some researchers believe that academic disciplines may  in the future  be replaced by what is known as Mode              or  post academic science              which involves the acquisition of cross disciplinary knowledge through the collaboration of specialists from various academic disciplines      citation needed     


History of the concept edit 
The University of Paris in      consisted of four faculties  Theology  Medicine  Canon Law and Arts             Educational institutions originally used the term  discipline  to catalog and archive the new and expanding body of information produced by the scholarly community  Disciplinary designations originated in German universities during the beginning of the nineteenth century      citation needed     
Most academic disciplines have their roots in the mid to late nineteenth century secularization of universities  when the traditional curricula were supplemented with non classical languages and literatures  social sciences such as political science  economics  sociology and public administration  and natural science and technology disciplines such as physics  chemistry  biology  and engineering      citation needed     
In the early twentieth century  new academic disciplines such as education and psychology were added  In the     s and     s  there was an explosion of new academic disciplines focusing on specific themes  such as media studies  women s studies  and Africana studies  Many academic disciplines designed as preparation for careers and professions  such as nursing  hospitality management  and corrections  also emerged in the universities  Finally  interdisciplinary scientific fields of study such as biochemistry and geophysics gained prominence as their contribution to knowledge became widely recognized  Some new disciplines  such as public administration  can be found in more than one disciplinary setting  some public administration programs are associated with business schools  thus emphasizing management   while others are linked to  political science   emphasizing policy analysis       citation needed     
As the twentieth century approached  these designations were gradually adopted by other countries and became the accepted conventional subjects  However  these designations differed between various countries             In the twentieth century  the natural science disciplines included  physics  chemistry  biology  geology  and astronomy  The social science disciplines included  economics  politics  sociology  and psychology      citation needed     
Prior to the twentieth century  categories were broad and general  which was expected due to the lack of interest in science at the time   Most practitioners of science were amateurs and were referred to as  natural historians  and  natural philosophers  labels that date back to Aristotle instead of  scientists              Natural history referred to what we now call life sciences and natural philosophy referred to the current physical sciences 
Prior to the twentieth century  few opportunities existed for science as an occupation outside the educational system  Higher education provided the institutional structure for scientific investigation  as well as economic support for research and teaching  Soon  the volume of scientific information rapidly increased and researchers realized the importance of concentrating on smaller  narrower fields of scientific activity  Because of this narrowing  scientific specializations emerged  As these specializations developed  modern scientific disciplines in universities also improved their sophistication  Eventually  academia s identified disciplines became the foundations for scholars of specific specialized interests and expertise            

Functions and criticism edit 
An influential critique of the concept of academic disciplines came from Michel Foucault in his      book  Discipline and Punish  Foucault asserts that academic disciplines originate from the same social movements and mechanisms of control that established the modern prison and penal system in eighteenth century France  and that this fact reveals essential aspects they continue to have in common   The disciplines characterize  classify  specialize  they distribute along a scale  around a norm  hierarchize individuals in relation to one another and  if necessary  disqualify and invalidate    Foucault             p                      

Communities of academic disciplines edit 
Communities of academic disciplines can be found outside academia within corporations  government agencies  and independent organizations  where they take the form of associations of professionals with common interests and specific knowledge  Such communities include corporate think tanks  NASA  and IUPAC  Communities such as these exist to benefit the organizations affiliated with them by providing specialized new ideas  research  and findings 
Nations at various developmental stages will find the need for different academic disciplines during different times of growth  A newly developing nation will likely prioritize government  political matters and engineering over those of the humanities  arts and social sciences  On the other hand  a well developed nation may be capable of investing more in the arts and social sciences  Communities of academic disciplines would contribute at varying levels of importance during different stages of development 

Interactions edit 
These categories explain how the different academic disciplines interact with one another 

Multidisciplinary edit 
Multidisciplinary  or pluridisciplinary  knowledge is associated with more than one existing academic discipline or profession  A multidisciplinary community or project is made up of people from different academic disciplines and professions  One key question is how well the challenge can be decomposed into subparts  and then addressed via the distributed knowledge in the community  The lack of shared vocabulary between people and communication overhead can sometimes be an issue in these communities and projects  If challenges of a particular type need to be repeatedly addressed so that each one can be properly decomposed  a multidisciplinary community can be exceptionally efficient and effective      citation needed     
There are many examples of a particular idea appearing in different academic disciplines  all of which came about around the same time  One example of this scenario is the shift from the approach of focusing on sensory awareness of the whole   an attention to the  total field    a  sense of the whole pattern  of form and function as a unity   an  integral idea of structure and configuration   This has happened in art  in the form of cubism   physics  poetry  communication and educational theory  According to Marshall McLuhan  this paradigm shift was due to the passage from the era of mechanization  which brought sequentiality  to the era of the instant speed of electricity  which brought simultaneity            
Multidisciplinary approaches also encourage people to help shape the innovation of the future  The political dimensions of forming new multidisciplinary partnerships to solve the so called societal Grand Challenges were presented in the Innovation Union and in the European Framework Programme  the Horizon      operational overlay  Innovation across academic disciplines is considered the pivotal foresight of the creation of new products  systems  and processes for the benefit of all societies  growth and wellbeing  Regional examples such as Biopeople and industry academia initiatives in translational medicine such as SHARE ku dk in Denmark provide evidence of the successful endeavour of multidisciplinary innovation and facilitation of the paradigm shift      citation needed     

Transdisciplinary edit 
Main article  Transdisciplinarity
In practice  transdisciplinary can be thought of as the union of all interdisciplinary efforts  While interdisciplinary teams may be creating new knowledge that lies between several existing disciplines  a transdisciplinary team is more holistic and seeks to relate all disciplines into a coherent whole 

Cross disciplinary edit 
Cross disciplinary knowledge is that which explains aspects of one discipline in terms of another  Common examples of cross disciplinary approaches are studies of the physics of music or the politics of literature 

Bibliometric studies of disciplines edit 
Bibliometrics can be used to map several issues in relation to disciplines  for example  the flow of ideas within and among disciplines  Lindholm Romantschuk                   or the existence of specific national traditions within disciplines              Scholarly impact and influence of one discipline on another may be understood by analyzing the flow of citations             
The Bibliometrics approach is described as straightforward because it is based on simple counting  The method is also objective but the quantitative method may not be compatible with a qualitative assessment and therefore manipulated  The number of citations is dependent on the number of persons working in the same domain instead of inherent quality or published result s originality
