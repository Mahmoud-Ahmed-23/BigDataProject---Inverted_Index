							Criticism of the United Nations often centers on the paralysis of the Security Council  its divisions  vetoes  and geopolitical entanglements creating the impression of an ineffective international body  Yet this view overlooks a crucial truth  the UN is not merely a council chamber of the powerful  but a sprawling global architecture encompassing specialized agencies that play vital roles in culture  health  development  human rights  childhood protection  and other areas that deeply affect the lives of people worldwide 
 nbsp 
By the same logic  dismissing NATO as merely a military alliance is an oversimplification that fails to grasp its evolving dimensions  While NATO is commonly portrayed in media discourse as a traditional military bloc  its actual structure and mission today go far beyond hard power  It is a multidimensional institution that blends military deterrence with diplomatic soft power  extending its tools into cyber security  institutional stability  and the promotion of Western values 
 nbsp 
NATO in its current form is not the same organization that was founded in       It has developed into a comprehensive security apparatus that addresses emerging threats such as cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns  establishing specialized units to protect the infrastructure of its member states  It also plays a critical role in training military and security institutions in non member states to foster regional stability  Moreover  it promotes a political and cultural discourse aligned with Western democratic values  leveraging soft power in identity based and ideological conflicts  NATO also engages with civil society organizations and academic institutions to construct a shared understanding of security  rights  and governance especially in fragile or post conflict states 
 nbsp 
Today  NATO actively adopts tools of  smart power  combining persuasion with deterrence  and partnership building with strategic pressure  This transformation reflects a fundamental shift in its strategic posture one that positions the alliance not merely as a defender of borders  but as a shaper of the global geopolitical and cultural landscape 
 nbsp 
Despite this strategic expansion  NATO now faces an unprecedented internal challenge  a shift in American political attitudes  personified by the rise of Donald Trump  Since his first term  Trump has questioned the relevance of NATO and threatened  explicitly or implicitly  to withdraw or drastically reduce the United States        commitment  He has dealt multiple blows to the alliance  from casting doubt on Article    the cornerstone of NATO       s mutual defense principle  to repeatedly demanding increased financial contributions from member states  portraying NATO as a  bad deal  for the United States  His administration projected a unilateral worldview that runs counter to the spirit of collective security and international cooperation 

 nbsp 
This shift does not merely destabilize the alliance  it undermines its normative foundations and pushes Europe toward an uneasy dilemma  either to build an independent defense capacity amid growing distrust toward Washington  or to submit to an increasingly unpredictable American leadership 
 nbsp 
To ensure its continued relevance in a rapidly changing world  NATO must not only preserve its position but rebuild internal trust by redefining itself not as a purely military pact  but as a versatile security political institution  This requires enhancing European strategic autonomy within the framework of the alliance  reducing overdependence on the United States without dismantling the transatlantic bond  Equally important is the need to update NATO s threat perception to encompass emerging challenges that confront states and societies alike  from cyber warfare to climate change  from artificial intelligence to identity based conflicts 
 nbsp 
NATO must also reintroduce itself to both European and American publics not as an elitist organization preoccupied with geopolitical abstractions  but as a tangible source of protection for everyday life
