Study and causes of differences in the quality of health and healthcare
Health gap in England and Wales       Census
Health equity arises from access to the social determinants of health  specifically from wealth  power and prestige             Individuals who have consistently been deprived of these three determinants are significantly disadvantaged from health inequities  and face worse health outcomes than those who are able to access certain resources                                   It is not equity to simply provide every individual with the same resources  that would be equality  In order to achieve health equity  resources must be allocated based on an individual need based principle            
According to the World Health Organization   Health is a state of complete physical  mental and social well being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity              The quality of health and how health is distributed among economic and social status in a society can provide insight into the level of development within that society             Health is a basic human right and human need  and all human rights are interconnected  Thus  health must be discussed along with all other basic human rights            
Health equity is defined by the CDC as  the state in which everyone has a fair and just opportunity to attain their highest level of health               It is closely associated with the social justice movement  with good health considered a fundamental human right   These inequities may include differences in the  presence of disease  health outcomes  or access to health care                                 between populations with a different race  ethnicity  gender  sexual orientation  disability  or socioeconomic status                       
Health inequity differs from health inequality in that the latter term is used in a number of countries to refer to those instances whereby the health of two demographic groups  not necessarily ethnic or racial groups  differs despite similar access to health care services  It can be further described as differences in health that are avoidable  unfair  and unjust  and cannot be explained by natural causes  such as biology  or differences in choice              Thus  if one population dies younger than another because of genetic differences  which is a non remediable controllable factor  the situation would be classified as a health inequality  Conversely  if a population has a lower life expectancy due to lack of access to medications  the situation would be classified as a health inequity              These inequities may include differences in the  presence of disease  health outcomes  or access to health care   Although  it is important to recognize the difference in health equity and equality  as having equality in health is essential to begin achieving health equity             The importance of equitable access to healthcare has been cited as crucial to achieving many of the Millennium Development Goals             


Socioeconomic status edit 
Socioeconomic status is both a strong predictor of health              and a key factor underlying health inequities across populations  Poor socioeconomic status has the capacity to profoundly limit the capabilities of an individual or population  manifesting itself through deficiencies in both financial and social capital              It is clear how a lack of financial capital can compromise the capacity to maintain good health  Income is an important determinant of access to healthcare resources              Because one s job or career is a primary conduit for both financial and social capital  work is an important  yet underrepresented  factor in health inequities research and prevention efforts                          There are many ways that a job can affect one s health  such as the job s physical demands  exposure to hazards  mechanisms of employment  compensation and benefits  and availability of health and safety programs              In addition  those who are in steady jobs are less likely to face poverty and its implications and more likely to have access to health care   Maintenance of good health through the utilization of proper healthcare resources can be quite costly and therefore unaffordable to certain populations                                     
In China  for instance  the collapse of the Cooperative Medical System left many of the rural poor uninsured and unable to access the resources necessary to maintain good health              Increases in the cost of medical treatment made healthcare increasingly unaffordable for these populations  This issue was further perpetuated by the rising income inequality in the Chinese population  Poor Chinese were often unable to undergo necessary hospitalization and failed to complete treatment regimens  resulting in poorer health outcomes             
Similarly  in Tanzania  it was demonstrated that wealthier families were far more likely to bring their children to a healthcare provider  a significant step towards stronger healthcare              Unequal income distribution itself can be a cause of poorer health for a society as a result of  underinvestment in social goods  such as public education and health care  disruption of social cohesion and the erosion of social capital              
The role of socioeconomic status in health equity extends beyond simple monetary restrictions on an individual s purchasing power  In fact  social capital plays a significant role in the health of individuals and their communities  It has been shown that those who are better connected to the resources provided by the individuals and communities around them  those with more social capital  live longer lives              The segregation of communities on the basis of income occurs in nations worldwide and has a significant impact on quality of health as a result of a decrease in social capital for those trapped in poor neighborhoods                                                              Social interventions  which seek to improve healthcare by enhancing the social resources of a community  are therefore an effective component of campaigns to improve a community s health             

Economic inequality edit 
See also  Social determinants of health in poverty
Poor health outcomes appear to be an effect of economic inequality across a population  Nations and regions with greater economic inequality show poorer outcomes in life expectancy                         Figure            mental health                         Figure            drug abuse                         Figure            obesity                         Figure            educational performance  teenage birthrates  and ill health due to violence  On an international level  there is a positive correlation between developed countries with high economic equality and longevity  This is unrelated to average income per capita in wealthy nations                         Figure            Economic gain only impacts life expectancy to a great degree in countries in which the mean per capita annual income is less than approximately         
The United States shows exceptionally low health outcomes for a developed country  despite having the highest national healthcare expenditure in the world  The US ranks   st in life expectancy  Americans have a lower life expectancy than their European counterparts  even when factors such as race  income  diet  smoking  and education are controlled for             
Relative inequality negatively affects health on an international  national  and institutional levels  The patterns seen internationally hold true between more and less economically equal states in the United States  that is  more equal states show more desirable health outcomes  Importantly  inequality can have a negative health impact on members of lower echelons of institutions  The Whitehall I and II studies looked at the rates of cardiovascular disease and other health risks in British civil servants and found that  even when lifestyle factors were controlled for  members of lower status in the institution showed increased mortality and morbidity on a sliding downward scale from their higher status counterparts 
The negative aspects of inequality are spread across the population  For example  when comparing the United States  a more unequal nation  to England  a less unequal nation   the US shows higher rates of diabetes  hypertension  cancer  lung disease  and heart disease across all income levels                         Figure             This is also true of the difference between mortality across all occupational classes in highly equal Sweden as compared to less equal England                         Figure            
Unconditional cash transfers for reducing poverty used by some programs in the developing world appear to lead to a reduction in the likelihood of being sick              Such evidence can guide resource allocations to effective interventions      citation needed     
The quality of health care varies among different socioeconomic groups              Children in families of low socioeconomic status are the most susceptible to health inequities  Children in poor families under   years of age are likely to face health disparities because the quality of their health depends on others providing for them  young children are not capable of maintaining good health on their own  In addition  these children have higher mortality rates than those in richer families due to malnutrition  Because of their low socioeconomic status  receiving health care can be challenging  Children in poor families are less likely to receive health care in general  and if they do have access to care  it is likely that the quality of that care is not highly sufficient             

Education edit 
Education is an important factor in healthcare utilization  though it is closely intertwined with economic status  An individual may not go to a medical professional or seek care if they do not know the ills of their failure to do so  or the value of proper treatment             
In Tajikistan  since the nation gained its independence  the likelihood of giving birth at home has increased rapidly among women with lower educational status  Education also has a significant impact on the quality of prenatal and maternal healthcare  Mothers with primary education consulted a doctor during pregnancy at significantly lower rates       when compared to those with a secondary education        technical training       or a higher education                     There is also evidence for a correlation between socioeconomic status and health literacy  one study showed that wealthier Tanzanian families were more likely to recognize disease in their children than those that were coming from lower income backgrounds             
Social inequities are a key barrier to accessing health related educational resources  Patients in lower socioeconomic areas will have less access to information about health in general  leading to less awareness of different diseases and health issues  Health education has proven to be a strong preventative measure that can be taken to decrease levels of illness and increase levels of visiting healthcare providers              The lack of health education can contribute to worsened health outcomes in these areas      citation needed     
Education inequities are also closely associated with health inequities  Individuals with lower levels of education are more likely to incur greater health risks such as substance abuse  obesity  and injuries both intentional and unintentional              Education is also associated with greater comprehension of health information and services necessary to make the right health decisions  as well as being associated with a longer lifespan              Individuals with high grades have been observed to display better levels of protective health behavior and lower levels of risky health behaviors than their less academically gifted counterparts  Factors such as poor diets  inadequate physical activity  physical and emotional abuse  and teenage pregnancy all have significant impacts on students  academic performance and these factors tend to manifest themselves more frequently in lower income individuals                         

Spatial disparities in health edit 
See also  Healthcare reform in China
For some populations  access to healthcare and health resources is physically limited  resulting in health inequities  For instance  an individual might be physically incapable of traveling the distances required to reach healthcare services  or long distances can make seeking regular care unappealing despite the potential benefits 

In       the federal government identified nearly    percent of rural America as  medically underserved   lacking in skilled nursing facilities  as well as rehabilitation  psychiatric and intensive care units  In rural areas  there are approximately    primary care doctors per         people  whereas there are    doctors per         in urban centers  According to the National Rural Health Association  almost     of rural counties had no doctors in       Rural communities face lower life expectancies and increased rates of diabetes  chronic disease  and obesity  There is a physical difference in access healthcare as well  for emergency instances or even therapies  where patients are to travel excessive distances to receive necessary care              These health disparities in rural areas are major problems  Over the pandemic  however  efforts were present to make healthcare more universal  In doing so  more awareness was given to rural populations  There are still things that need to be done  though  underlying health disparities in region are still prominent               Global concentrations of healthcare resources  as depicted by the number of physicians per         individuals  by country  Costa Rica  for example  has demonstrable health spatial inequities with        of the population living in areas where healthcare is inaccessible  Inequity has decreased in some areas of the nation as a result of the work of healthcare reform programs  however those regions not served by the programs have experienced a slight increase in inequity             
China experienced a serious decrease in spatial health equity following the Chinese economic revolution in the     s as a result of the degradation of the Cooperative Medical System  CMS   The CMS provided an infrastructure for the delivery of healthcare to rural locations  as well as a framework to provide funding based upon communal contributions and government subsidies  In its absence  there was a significant decrease in the quantity of healthcare professionals          as well as functioning clinics  from     to     of villages over    years  in rural areas  resulting in inequitable healthcare for rural populations  The significant poverty experienced by rural workers  some earning less than US   per day  further limits access to healthcare  and results in malnutrition and poor general hygiene  compounding the loss of healthcare resources  It is important to also note what rural areas are composed of  There are many rural counties that have disproportionate rates of minorities living there  a link between the racial issue at play and that of regional status              The loss of the CMS has had noticeable impacts on life expectancy  with rural regions such as areas of Western China experiencing significantly lower life expectancies 
Similarly  populations in rural Tajikistan experience spatial health inequities  A study by Jane Falkingham of the University of Southampton noted that physical access to healthcare was one of the primary factors influencing quality of maternal healthcare  Further  many women in rural areas of the country did not have adequate access to healthcare resources  resulting in poor maternal and neonatal care  These rural women were  for instance  far more likely to give birth in their homes without medical oversight             

Ethnic and racial disparities edit 
See also  Race and health
Along with the socioeconomic factor of health disparities  race is another key factor  The United States historically had large disparities in health and access to adequate healthcare between races  and current evidence supports the notion that these racially centered disparities continue to exist and are a significant social health issue                          The disparities in access to adequate healthcare include differences in the quality of care based on race and overall insurance coverage based on race  A      study in the Journal of the American Medical Association identifies race as a significant determinant in the level of quality of care  with Black people receiving lower quality care than their white counterparts              This is in part because members of ethnic minorities such as African Americans are either earning low incomes  or living below the poverty line  In a      Census Bureau  African American families made an average of          while their white counterparts made an average of                      Due to a lack of affordable health care  the African American death rate reveals that African Americans have a higher rate of dying from treatable or preventable causes  According to a study conducted in      by the Office of Minority Health a U S  Department of Health African American men were     more likely than white men to die from heart disease              Also African American women were     more likely to die from breast cancer than their white counterparts              Additionally  among African American and Latino infants  mortality rates are   to   times higher than other racial groups              An analysis of more than   million pregnancies found that babies born to Black women worldwide had poorer outcomes  such as baby death and stillbirth  than White women  This was true even after controlling for older age and a lower level of education among mothers  an indicator of poorer economic and social status   In the same analysis  Hispanic women were   times more likely to experience a baby death than White women and South Asian women had an increased risk of premature birth and having a baby with low birthweight compared with White women                          A      scoping review of the literature found that in studies involving multiracial or multiethnic populations  the incorporation of race or ethnicity variables lacked thoughtful conceptualization and informative analysis concerning their role as indicators of exposure to racialized social disadvantage  Racialized social disadvantage encompasses systemic and structural barriers  discrimination  and social exclusion experienced by individuals and communities based on their race or ethnicity  resulting in disparities in access to resources  opportunities  and health outcomes                         
Such disparities also prevalently attack indigenous communities  As members of indigenous communities adjust to western lifestyles  they have become more susceptible to developing certain chronic illnesses             
There are also considerable racial disparities in access to insurance coverage  with ethnic minorities generally having less insurance coverage than non ethnic minorities  For example  Hispanic Americans tend to have less insurance coverage than white Americans and as a result receive less regular medical care              The level of insurance coverage is directly correlated with access to healthcare including preventive and ambulatory care              A      study on racial and ethnic disparities in health done by the Institute of Medicine has shown that the aforementioned disparities cannot solely be accounted for in terms of certain demographic characteristics like  insurance status  household income  education  age  geographic location and quality of living conditions  Even when the researchers corrected for these factors  the disparities persist              Slavery has contributed to disparate health outcomes for generations of African Americans in the United States             
Ethnic health inequities also appear in nations across the African continent  A survey of the child mortality of major ethnic groups across    African nations  Central African Republic  C te d Ivoire  Ghana  Kenya  Mali  Namibia  Niger  Rwanda  Senegal  Uganda  and Zambia  was published in      by the WHO  The study described the presence of significant ethnic parities in the child mortality rates among children younger than   years old  as well as in education and vaccine use              In South Africa  the legacy of apartheid still manifests itself as a differential access to social services  including healthcare based upon race and social class  and the resultant health inequities                          Further  evidence suggests systematic disregard of indigenous populations in a number of countries  The Pygmies of Congo  for instance  are excluded from government health programs  discriminated against during public health campaigns  and receive poorer overall healthcare             
In a survey of five European countries  Sweden  Switzerland  the UK  Italy  and France   a      survey noted that only Sweden provided access to translators for      of those who needed it  while the other countries lacked this service potentially compromising healthcare to non native populations  Given that non natives composed a considerable section of these nations                   and    respectively   this could have significant detrimental effects on the health equity of the nation  In France  an older study noted significant differences in access to healthcare between native French populations  and non French migrant populations based upon health expenditure  however this was not fully independent of poorer economic and working conditions experienced by these populations             
A      study of race based health inequity in Australia revealed that Aborigines experienced higher rates of mortality than non Aborigine populations  Aborigine populations experienced    times greater mortality in the       age range      times greater infant mortality rate  and   times greater age standardized mortality rate  Rates of diarrheal diseases and tuberculosis are also significantly greater in this population     and    times greater respectively   which is indicative of the poor healthcare of this ethnic group  At this point in time  the parities in life expectancy at birth between indigenous and non indigenous peoples were highest in Australia  when compared to the US  Canada and New Zealand                          In South America  indigenous populations faced similarly poor health outcomes with maternal and infant mortality rates that were significantly higher  up to   to   times greater  than the national average              The same pattern of poor indigenous healthcare continues in India  where indigenous groups were shown to experience greater mortality at most stages of life  even when corrected for environmental effects             
Due to systemic health and social inequities people from racial and ethnic minority groups in the United States are disproportionately affected by COVID                
On February          the head of the World Health Organization  WHO   Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus  noted regarding the global inequity in the access to COVID    vaccines  that almost     countries had not yet given a single dose              In early April       the WHO reported that     of existing vaccines had been distributed to the wealthiest countries  while only      had been distributed to the poorest countries  As a result  one quarter of the populations of those wealthy countries had already been vaccinated  while only   in     residents of the poor countries had been vaccinated             

Sex and gender in healthcare equity edit

Gender and sex are both components of health disparity 

Sex and gender in medicine edit 
Main article  Sex differences in medicine
Both gender and sex are significant factors that influence health  Sex is characterized by female and male biological differences in regards to gene expression  hormonal concentration  and anatomical characteristics              Gender is an expression of behavior and lifestyle choices  Both sex and gender inform each other  and differences between genders influence disease manifestation and associated healthcare approaches              Understanding how the interaction of sex and gender contributes to disparity in the context of health allows providers to ensure quality outcomes for patients  This interaction is complicated by the difficulty of distinguishing between sex and gender given their intertwined nature  sex modifies gender  and gender can modify sex  thereby impacting health                    Sex and gender can both be considered sources of health disparity  both contribute to susceptibility to various health conditions  including cardiovascular disease and autoimmune disorders              Historically  research on medicine and treatment have surrounded around the men and the male body  The gaps in research on the female body and treatment approaches have resulted in less effective care for women  Unfortunately  this results in under and misdiagnosed diseases for women             

Gender disparities in life expectancy edit

In most regions of the world  the mortality rate is higher for adult men than for adult women  for example  adult men develop fatal illnesses with more frequency than females              The list of countries by life expectancy shows the sex gap in life expectancy  The leading causes of the higher male death rate are accidents  injuries  violence  and cardiovascular diseases  In most regions of the world  violence and traffic related injuries account for the majority of mortality of adolescent males              Men in the United States tend to live longer than women              Physicians tend to offer invasive procedures to male patients more often than to female patients              
The      World Development Report  WDR  noted that women in developing nations experience greater mortality rates than men in developing nations             

Other gender disparities in health edit 
Male disadvantage edit 
Men are more likely to smoke than women and experience smoking related health complications later in life as a result  this trend is also observed in regard to other substances  such as marijuana  in Jamaica  where the rate of use is     times more for men than women              Men are also more likely to have severe chronic conditions             

Female disadvantage edit 
In developing countries  males tend to have a health advantage over women due to gender discrimination  evidenced by infanticide  early marriage  and domestic abuse for females             
Women in developing countries have a much higher risk of maternal death than those in developed countries  The highest risk of dying during childbirth is   in   in Afghanistan and Sierra Leone  compared to nearly   in        in Sweden a disparity that is much greater than that for neonatal or child mortality             
Women are generally are of lower socioeconomic status  SES  in USA and have more barriers to accessing healthcare  and higher rates of depression and chronic stress and negative impact health              In Europe  women who grew up in poverty are more likely to have lower muscle strength and higher disability in old age                         
Women are also more likely than men to suffer from sexual or intimate partner violence both in the United States and worldwide  Women have better access to healthcare in the United States than they do in many other places in the world              yet having sufficient health insurance to afford the care  such as related to postpartum treatment and care  may help to avoid additional preventable hospital readmission and emergency department visits             
In one population study conducted in Harlem  New York      of women reported having privatized or publicly assisted health insurance  while only     of men reported having any health insurance  This trend is representative of the general population of the United States              On the other hand  a woman s access to healthcare in rural communities has recently become a matter of concern  Access to maternal obstetric care has decreased in rural communities due to the increase in both hospital closers and labor  amp  delivery center closures that have placed an increased burden on families living in these areas              Burdens faced by women in these rural communities include financial burdens on traveling to receive adequate care              Millions of individuals living in rural areas in the United States are more at risk of having decreased access to maternal health care facilities if the community is low income              These women are more at risk of experiencing adverse maternal outcomes like a higher risk of having postpartum depression  having an out of hospital birth  and on the extreme end  maternal morbidity and mortality             
In addition  women s pain tends to be treated less seriously and initially ignored by clinicians when compared to their treatment of men s pain complaints              Historically  women have not been included in the design or practice of clinical trials  which has slowed the understanding of women s reactions to medications and created a research gap  This has led to post approval adverse events among women  resulting in several drugs being pulled from the market  However  the clinical research industry is aware of the problem  and has made progress in correcting it                         

Cultural factors edit 
Health disparities are also due in part to cultural factors that involve practices based not only on sex  but also gender status  For example  in China  health disparities have distinguished medical treatment for men and women due to the cultural phenomenon of preference for male children              Recently  gender based disparities have decreased as females have begun to receive higher quality care                          Additionally  a girl s chances of survival are impacted by the presence of a male sibling  while girls do have the same chance of survival as boys if they are the oldest girl  they have a higher probability of being aborted or dying young if they have an older sister             
In India  gender based health inequities are apparent in early childhood  Many families provide better nutrition for boys in the interest of maximizing future productivity given that boys are generally seen as breadwinners              In addition  boys receive better care than girls and are hospitalized at a greater rate  The magnitude of these disparities increases with the severity of poverty in a given population             
Additionally  the cultural practice of female genital mutilation  FGM  is known to impact women s health  though is difficult to know the worldwide extent of this practice  While generally thought of as a Sub Saharan African practice  it may have roots in the Middle East as well              The estimated   million girls who are subjected to FGM each year potentially suffer both immediate and lifelong negative effects              Immediately following FGM  girls commonly experience excessive bleeding and urine retention              Long term consequences include urinary tract infections  bacterial vaginosis  pain during intercourse  and difficulties in childbirth that include prolonged labor  vaginal tears  and excessive bleeding                            Women who have undergone FGM also have higher rates of post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD  and herpes simplex virus    HSV   than women who have not                           

LGBTQ health disparities edit 
See also  Healthcare and the LGBTQ community
Sexuality and gender identity are the  basis of health discrimination and inequity throughout the world  Homosexual  bisexual  transgender  and gender variant populations around the world experience a range of health problems related to their sexuality and gender identity                                                      some of which are complicated further by limited research 
In spite of recent advances  LGBTQ populations in China  India  and Chile continue to face significant discrimination and barriers to care                                         The World Health Organization  WHO  recognizes that there is inadequate research data about the effects of LGBTQ discrimination on morbidity and mortality rates in the patient population  In addition  retrospective epidemiological studies on LGBTQ populations are difficult to conduct as a result of the practice that sexual orientation is not noted on death certificates               WHO has proposed that more research about the LGBTQ patient population is needed      for improved understanding of its       unique health needs and barriers to accessing care              
One of the main forms of healthcare discrimination       LGBTQ individuals face is discrimination from healthcare workers or institutions themselves                            LGBTQ people often face significant difficulties in accessing care as a result to discrimination and homophobia from healthcare professionals               This discrimination can take the form of verbal abuse  disrespectful conduct  refusal of care  the withholding of health information        inadequate treatment  and outright violence                           
Additionally  members of the LGBTQ community contend with health care disparities due  in part  to lack of provider training and awareness of the population s healthcare needs               Transgender individuals believe that there is a higher importance of providing gender identity  GI  information more than sexual orientation  SO  to providers to help inform them of better care and safe treatment for these patients               Studies regarding patient provider communication in the LGBTQ patient community show that providers themselves report a significant lack of awareness regarding the health issues LGBTQ identifying patients face               As a component of this fact  medical schools do not focus much attention on LGBTQ health issues in their curriculum  the LGBTQ related topics that are discussed tend to be limited to HIV AIDS  sexual orientation  and gender identity              
Among LGBTQ identifying individuals  transgender individuals face especially significant barriers to treatment  Many countries still do not have legal recognition of transgender or non binary gender individuals leading to placement in misgendered hospital wards and medical discrimination                            Seventeen European states mandate sterilization of individuals who seek recognition of a gender identity that diverges from their birth gender               In addition to many of the same barriers as the rest of the LGBTQ community  globally the transgender individuals often also face a higher disease burden               Transgender people also face significant levels of discrimination               Due to this experience  many transgender people avoid seeking necessary medical care out of fear of discrimination              
The stigmatization represented particularly in the transgender population       creates a health disparity for LGBTQ individuals with regard to mental health               The LGBTQ community is at increased risk for psychosocial distress  mental health complications  suicidality  homelessness  and substance abuse  often complicated by access based under utilization or fear of health services                                         Transgender and gender variant individuals have been found to experience higher rates of mental health disparity than LGB individuals              
These mental health facts are informed by a history of anti LGBTQ bias in health care               The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  DSM  listed homosexuality as a disorder until       transgender status was listed as a disorder until                    This was amended in      with the DSM   when  gender identity disorder  was replaced with  gender dysphoria   reflecting that simply identifying as transgender is not itself pathological and that the diagnosis is instead for the distress a transgender person may experience as a result of the discordance between assigned gender and gender identity              
LGBTQ health issues have received disproportionately low levels of medical research  leading to difficulties in assessing appropriate strategies for LGBTQ treatment  For instance  a review of medical literature regarding LGBTQ patients revealed that there are significant gaps in the medical understanding of cervical cancer in lesbian and bisexual individuals              it is unclear whether its prevalence in this community is a result of probability or some other preventable cause  For example  LGBTQ people report poorer cancer care experiences               It is incorrectly assumed that LGBTQ women have a lower incidence of cervical cancer than their heterosexual counterparts  resulting in lower rates of screening                     Such findings illustrate the need for continued research focused on the circumstances and needs of LGBTQ individuals and the inclusion in policy frameworks of sexual orientation and gender identity as social determinants of health              
LGB  people are at higher risk of some cancers and LGBTQI are at higher risk of mental illness  The causes of these health inequities are  i  cultural and social norms that preference and prioritise heterosexuality  ii  minority stress associated with sexual orientation  gender identity and sex characteristics  iii  victimisation  iv  discrimination  individual and institutional   and  v  stigma               

Environmental influences edit 
Minority populations have increased exposure to environmental hazards that include lack of neighborhood resources  structural and community factors as well as residential segregation that result in a cycle of disease and stress               The environment that surrounds us can influence individual behaviors and lead to poor health choices and therefore outcomes               Minority neighborhoods have been continuously noted to have more fast food chains and fewer grocery stores than predominantly white neighborhoods               These food deserts affect a family s ability to have easy access to nutritious food for their children  This lack of nutritious food extends beyond the household into the schools that have a variety of vending machines and deliver over processed foods               A related concept that impacts food choices is the prevalence of food swamps  or areas with overexposure to fast food options These environmental condition have social ramifications and in the first time in US history is it projected that the current generation will live shorter lives than their predecessors will              
In addition  minority neighborhoods have various health hazards that result from living close to highways and toxic waste factories or general dilapidated structures and streets               These environmental conditions create varying degrees of health risk from noise pollution  to carcinogenic toxic exposures from asbestos and radon that result in increase chronic disease  morbidity  and mortality               The quality of residential environment such as damaged housing has been shown to increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes  which is reflective of a communities health  This occurs through exposure to lead in paint and lead contaminated soil as well as indoor air pollutants such as second hand smoke and fine particulate matter                             Housing conditions can create varying degrees of health risk that lead to complications of birth and long term consequences in the aging population                In addition  occupational hazards can add to the detrimental effects of poor housing conditions  It has been reported that a greater number of minorities work in jobs that have higher rates of exposure to toxic chemical  dust and fumes               One example of this is the environmental hazards that poor Latino farmworkers face in the United States  This group is exposed to high levels of particulate matter and pesticides on the job  which have contributed to increased cancer rates  lung conditions  and birth defects in their communities              
Racial segregation is another environmental factor that occurs through the discriminatory action of those organizations and working individuals within the real estate industry  whether in the housing markets or rentals  Even though residential segregation is noted in all minority groups  Black people tend to be segregated regardless of income level when compared to Latinos and Asians               Thus  segregation results in minorities clustering in poor neighborhoods that have limited employment  medical care  and educational resources  which is associated with high rates of criminal behavior                            In addition  segregation affects the health of individual residents because the environment is not conducive to physical exercise due to unsafe neighborhoods that lack recreational facilities and have nonexistent park space               Racial and ethnic discrimination adds an additional element to the environment that individuals have to interact with daily               Individuals that reported discrimination have been shown to have an increase risk of hypertension in addition to other physiological stress related affects               The high magnitude of environmental  structural  socioeconomic stressors leads to further compromise on the psychological and physical being  which leads to poor health and disease              
Individuals living in rural areas  especially poor rural areas  have access to fewer health care resources  Although    percent of the U S  population lives in rural areas  only   percent of physicians practice in rural settings  Individuals in rural areas typically must travel longer distances for care  experience long waiting times at clinics  or are unable to obtain the necessary health care they need in a timely manner  Rural areas characterized by a largely Hispanic population average     physicians per        residents compared with     physicians per        residents in non rural areas  Financial barriers to access  including lack of health insurance  are also common among the urban poor               What is more concerning is that the minorities in rural areas participate in research even less than the minorities in urban areas  which can be understood as a very noticeable and unhealthy difference given that minorities in urban areas are already lacking in health research participation  A recent self study showed that people in Arkansas were mostly willing to participate in studies  but lacked the opportunity  and that minority groups  including Black and Hispanic groups  were more likely to express this interest than that of others  yet they generally lack the opportunity to actually commit to it              

Disparities in access to health care edit 
Reasons for disparities in access to health care are many  but can include the following 

Lack of a regular source of care  Without access to a regular source of care  patients have greater difficulty obtaining care  fewer doctor visits  and more difficulty obtaining prescription drugs  Compared to whites  minority groups in the United States are less likely to have a doctor they go to on a regular basis and are more likely to use emergency rooms and clinics as their regular source of care               In the United Kingdom  which is much more racially harmonious  this issue arises for a different reason  since       NHS GPs have not been responsible for care out of normal GP surgery opening hours  leading to significantly higher attendances in A E
Lack of financial resources  Although the lack of financial resources is a barrier to health care access for many Americans  the impact on access appears to be greater for minority populations              
Legal barriers  Access to medical care by low income immigrant minorities can be hindered by legal barriers to public insurance programs   For example  in the United States federal law bars states from providing Medicaid coverage to immigrants who have been in the country fewer than five years                                  Another example could be when a non English speaking person attends a clinic where the receptionist does not speak the person s language  This is mostly seen in people who have limited English proficiency  or LEP 
Structural barriers  These barriers include poor transportation  an inability to schedule appointments quickly or during convenient hours  and excessive time spent in the waiting room  all of which affect a person s ability and willingness to obtain needed care              
Scarcity of providers  In inner cities  rural areas  and communities with high concentrations of minority populations  access to medical care can be limited due to the scarcity of primary care practitioners  specialists  and diagnostic facilities               This scarcity can also extend to the personnel in the medical laboratory with some geographical regions having significantly diminished access to advanced diagnostic methods and pathology care               In the UK  Monitor  a quango  has a legal obligation to ensure that sufficient provision exists in all parts of the nation 
The health care financing system  The Institute of Medicine in the United States says fragmentation of the U S  health care delivery and financing system is a barrier to accessing care  Racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to be enrolled in health insurance plans which place limits on covered services and offer a limited number of health care providers                                 
Linguistic barriers  Language differences restrict access to medical care for minorities in the United States who have limited English proficiency              
Health literacy  This is where patients have problems obtaining  processing  and understanding basic health information  For example  patients with a poor understanding of good health may not know when it is necessary to seek care for certain symptoms  While problems with health literacy are not limited to minority groups  the problem can be more pronounced in these groups than in whites due to socioeconomic and educational factors               A study conducted in Mdantsane  South Africa depicts the correlation of maternal education and the antenatal visits for pregnancy  As patients have a greater education  they tend to use maternal health care services more than those with a lesser maternal education background              
Lack of diversity in the health care workforce  A major reason for disparities in access to care are the cultural differences between predominantly white health care providers and minority patients  Only    of physicians in the United States are African American  and Hispanics represent just     even though these percentages are much less than their groups  proportion of the United States population                                 
Age  Age can also be a factor in health disparities for a number of reasons  As many older Americans exist on fixed incomes which may make paying for health care expenses difficult  Additionally  they may face other barriers such as impaired mobility or lack of transportation which make accessing health care services challenging for them physically  Also  they may not have the opportunity to access health information via the internet as less than     of Americans over the age of    have access to the internet               This could put older individuals at a disadvantage in terms of accessing valuable information about their health and how to protect it  On the other hand  older individuals in the US     or above  are provided with medical care via Medicare 
Criminalization and lack of research of traditional medicine               and mental health treatments               Mental illness accounts for about one third of adult disability globally               Conventional drug treatments have dominated psychiatry for decades  without a breakthrough in mental healthcare  Access to psychedelic assisted therapy  and the decriminalization of Psilocybin and other entheogens are questions of health justice              
Health insurance edit 
A major part of the United States  healthcare system is health insurance  The main types of health insurance in the United States includes taxpayer funded health insurance and private health insurance               Funded through state and federal taxes  some common examples of taxpayer funded health insurance include Medicaid  Medicare  and CHIP               Private health insurance is offered in a variety of forms  and includes plans such as Health Maintenance Organizations  HMO s  and Preferred Provider Organization  PPO s                While health insurance increases the affordability of healthcare in the United States  issues of access along with additional related issues act as barriers to health equity 
There are many issues due to health insurance that affect health equity  including the following 

Health Insurance Literacy  Within these health insurance plans  common aspects of the insurance include premiums  deductibles  co payments  coinsurance  coverage limits  in network versus out of network providers  and prior authorization               According to a United Health survey  only    of Americans surveyed understood these health insurance terms               To address issues in finding available insurance plans and confusion around the components of health insurance policies  the Affordable Care Act  ACA  set up state mandated health insurance marketplaces or health exchanges  where individuals can research and compare different kinds of health care plans and their respective components               Between      and       over      million people have been able to sign up for health insurance through the Marketplaces               However  most Marketplaces focus more on the presentation of health insurances and their coverages  rather than including detailed explanations of the health insurance terms 
Lack of universal health care or health insurance coverage  According to the Congressional Budget Office  CBO        million people in the United States were uninsured in       and that number would rise to an estimated    million people by                    Without health insurance  patients are more likely to postpone medical care  go without needed medical care  go without prescription medicines  and be denied access to care               Minority groups in the United States lack insurance coverage at higher rates than whites               This problem does not exist in countries with fully funded public health systems  such as the examplar of the NHS 
Underinsured or inefficient health insurance coverage  While there are many causes of underinsurance  a common a reason is due to low premiums  the up front yearly or monthly amount individuals pay for their insurance policy  and high deductibles  the amount paid out of pocket by the policy holder before an insurance provider will pay any expenses               Under the ACA  individuals were subject to a fee called the Shared Responsibility Payment  which occurred as a result of not buying health insurance despite being able to afford it               While this mandate was aimed at increasing health insurance rates for Americans  it also led many individuals to sign up for relatively inexpensive health insurance plans that did not provide adequate health coverage in order to avoid the repercussions of the mandate               Similar to those who lack health insurance  these underinsured individuals also deal with the side effects that occur as a result of lack of care 
Dental healthcare edit 
In many countries  dental healthcare is less accessible than other kinds of healthcare resulting in increased risk for oral and systemic diseases  In Western countries  dental healthcare providers are present  and private or public healthcare systems typically facilitate access  However  access remains limited for marginalized groups such as the homeless  racial minorities  and those who are homebound or disabled  In Central and Eastern Europe  the privatization of dental healthcare has resulted in a shortage of affordable options for lower income people  In Eastern Europe  school age children formerly had access through school programs  but these have been discontinued  Therefore  many children no longer have access to care  Access to services and the breadth of services provided is greatly reduced in developing regions  Such services may be limited to emergency care and pain relief  neglecting preventative or restorative services  Regions like Africa  Asia  and Latin America do not have enough dental health professionals to meet the needs of the populace  In Africa  for example  there is only one dentist for every         people  compared to industrialized countries which average one dentist per       people              

Disparities in quality of health care edit 
Health disparities in the quality of care exist and are based on language and ethnicity race which includes 

Problems with patient provider communication edit 
Communication is critical for the delivery of appropriate and effective treatment and care  regardless of a patient s race  and miscommunication can lead to incorrect diagnosis  improper use of medications  and failure to receive follow up care    The patient provider relationship is dependent on the ability of both individuals to effectively communicate   Language and culture both play a significant role in communication during a medical visit  Among the patient population  minorities face greater difficulty in communicating with their physicians  For example  Asian American patients were reported to have both less trust and satisfaction with their healthcare providers than that of white patients  and so by a substantial amount  Not only cultural and communication errors arise from here  but also those of racial constraints that have patterned American history for years  This is all occurring even when the Asian American population stands as one of the fastest growing               Despite being the only racial ethnic group that has cancer as the leading cause of death  they are also linked to extremely low rates of cancer screenings               It is not that they can t  since Asian Americans typically find themselves in the more economically stable side of American society  It is based largely  though  on the distrusts felt by this group towards healthcare providers  In another study  patients when surveyed responded that     of the time they have problems communicating with their providers which included understanding doctor  feeling doctor listened  and had questions but did not ask               In contrast  the Hispanic population had the largest problem communicating with their provider      of the time               Minority groups are also less likely to have a care provider from the same background  This can create a feeling of disconnect between the patient and the provider  separating trust from the equation  People are more likely to feel close to others alike  In healthcare  where a strong relationship between the patient and provider is necessary  it could help for the provider and patient to be similar in some way  Communication has been linked to health outcomes  as communication improves so does patient satisfaction which leads to improved compliance and then to improved health outcomes               Quality of care is impacted as a result of an inability to communicate with health care providers   Language plays a pivotal role in communication and efforts need to be taken to ensure excellent communication between patient and provider  Among limited English proficient patients in the United States  the linguistic barrier is even greater   Less than half of non English speakers who say they need an interpreter during clinical visits report having one   The absence of interpreters during a clinical visit adds to the communication barrier  Furthermore  inability of providers to communicate with limited English proficient patients leads to more diagnostic procedures  more invasive procedures  and over prescribing of medications               Language barriers have not only hindered appointment scheduling  prescription filling  and clear communications  but have also been associated with health declines  which can be attributed to reduced compliance and delays in seeking care  which could affect particularly  refugee health in the United States                            Many health related settings provide interpreter services for their limited English proficient patients  This has been helpful when providers do not speak the same language as the patient   However  there is mounting evidence that patients need to communicate with a language concordant physician  not simply an interpreter  to receive the best medical care  bond with the physician  and be satisfied with the care experience                            Having patient physician language discordant pairs  i e  Spanish speaking patient with an English speaking physician  may also lead to greater medical expenditures and thus higher costs to the organization                  Additional communication problems result from a decrease or lack of cultural competence by providers    It is important for providers to be cognizant of patients  health beliefs and practices without being judgmental or reacting   Understanding a patients  view of health and disease is important for diagnosis and treatment   So providers need to assess patients  health beliefs and practices to improve quality of care               Patient health decisions can be influenced by religious beliefs  mistrust of Western medicine  and familial and hierarchical roles  all of which a white provider may not be familiar with                                    Other type of communication problems are seen in LGBTQ health care with the spoken heterosexist  conscious or unconscious  attitude on LGBTQ patients  lack of understanding on issues like having no sex with men  lesbians  gynecologic examinations  and other issues               The same types of problems too exist in people with disabilities  who still to this day face the effects from past Western medicine procedures that brought injustice to their community              

Provider discrimination edit 
Provider discrimination occurs when health care providers either unconsciously or consciously treat certain racial and ethnic patients differently from other patients  This may be due to stereotypes that providers may have towards ethnic racial groups  A March       study from Social Science  amp  Medicine suggests that doctors may be more likely to ascribe negative racial stereotypes to their minority patients               This may occur regardless of consideration for education  income  and personality characteristics  Two types of stereotypes may be involved  automatic stereotypes or goal modified stereotypes   Automated stereotyping is when stereotypes are automatically activated and influence judgments behaviors outside of consciousness               Goal modified stereotype is a more conscious process  done when specific needs of clinician arise  time constraints  filling in gaps in information needed  to make a complex decisions               Physicians are unaware of their implicit biases               Some research suggests that ethnic minorities are less likely than whites to receive a kidney transplant once on dialysis or to receive pain medication for bone fractures  Critics question this research and say further studies are needed to determine how doctors and patients make their treatment decisions  Others argue that certain diseases cluster by ethnicity and that clinical decision making does not always reflect these differences              

Lack of preventive care edit 
According to the      National Healthcare Disparities Report  uninsured Americans are less likely to receive preventive services in health care               For example  minorities are not regularly screened for colon cancer and the death rate for colon cancer has increased among African Americans and Hispanic populations  Furthermore  limited English proficient patients are also less likely to receive preventive health services such as mammograms               Studies have shown that use of professional interpreters have significantly reduced disparities in the rates of fecal occult testing  flu immunizations and pap smears               In the UK  Public Health England  a universal service free at the point of use  which forms part of the NHS  offers regular screening to any member of the population considered to be in an at risk group  such as individuals over     for major disease  such as colon cancer  or diabetic retinopathy                            

Plans for achieving health equity edit 
There are a multitude of strategies for achieving health equity and reducing disparities outlined in scholarly texts  some examples include 

Advocacy  Advocacy for health equity has been identified as a key means of promoting favourable policy change               EuroHealthNet carried out a systematic review of the academic and grey literature  It found  amongst other things  that certain kinds of evidence may be more persuasive in advocacy efforts  that practices associated with knowledge transfer and translation can increase the uptake of knowledge  that there are many different potential advocates and targets of advocacy and that advocacy efforts need to be tailored according to context and target               As a result of its work  it produced an online advocacy for health equity toolkit              
Provider based incentives to improve healthcare for ethnic populations  One source of health inequity stems from unequal treatment of non white patients in comparison with white patients  Creating provider based incentives to create greater parity between treatment of white and non white patients is one proposed solution to eliminate provider bias               These incentives typically are monetary because of its effectiveness in influencing physician behavior 
Using Evidence Based Medicine  EBM   Evidence Based Medicine  EBM  shows promise in reducing healthcare provider bias in turn promoting health equity               In theory EBM can reduce disparities however other research suggests that it might exacerbate them instead  Some cited shortcomings include EBM s injection of clinical inflexibility in decision making and its origins as a purely cost driven measure              
Increasing awareness  The most cited measure to improving health equity relates to increasing public awareness  A lack of public awareness is a key reason why there has not been significant gains in reducing health disparities in ethnic and minority populations  Increased public awareness would lead to increased congressional awareness  greater availability of disparity data  and further research into the issue of health disparities 
The Gradient Evaluation Framework  The evidence base defining which policies and interventions are most effective in reducing health inequalities is extremely weak  It is important therefore that policies and interventions which seek to influence health inequity be more adequately evaluated  Gradient Evaluation Framework  GEF  is an action oriented policy tool that can be applied to assess whether policies will contribute to greater health equity amongst children and their families              
The AIM framework  In a pilot study  researchers examined the role of AIM ability  incentives  and management feedback in reducing care disparity in pressure ulcer detection between African American and Caucasian residents  The results showed that while the program was implemented  the provision of     training to enhance ability      monetary incentives to enhance motivation  and     management feedback to enhance accountability led to successful reduction in pressure ulcers  Specifically  the detection gap between the two groups decreased  The researchers suggested additional replications with longer duration to assess the effectiveness of the AIM framework 
Monitoring actions on the social determinants of health  In       citing the need for accountability for the pledges made by countries in the Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health  the World Health Organization and United Nations Children s Fund called for the monitoring of intersectoral interventions on the social determinants of health that improve health equity              
Changing the distribution of health services  Health services play a major role in health equity  Health inequities stem from lack of access to care due to poor economic status and an interaction among other social determinants of health  The majority of high quality health services are distributed among the wealthy people in society  leaving those who are poor with limited options  In order to change this fact and move towards achieving health equity  it is essential that health care increases in areas or neighborhoods consisting of low socioeconomic families and individuals             
Prioritize treatment among the poor  Because of the challenges that arise from accessing health care with low economic status  many illnesses and injuries go untreated or are not given sufficient treatment  Promoting treatment as a priority among the poor will give them the resources they need in order to achieve good health  because health is a basic human right                        
Implementing medical pluralism  Extreme differences that underlie urban and alternative medicine approaches emphasize the need for a system that represents the duality of the populations it intends to serve  Urban medicine generally believes that technological advancement is the best way to help treat illness as it allows for a more  sophisticated  mode of care  alternative medicine is more traditional in relying solely on herbal and natural remedies believing that the elaborate institutions of urban care are not best suited for serving individual needs  Medical pluralism  hence  is an adaptive tactic most effective for communities that include Indigenous people  and mixed rural urban populations               Medical pluralism acknowledges the needs of a variety of people and is a step closer to health equity  Medical pluralism  avoids the extremes   of most current healthcare delivery approaches and provides a middle ground perspective on tackling health issues that are not solved by urban or rural health alone               By practicing integrative medicine  chronic and unresolved health issues are better treated  borrowing from the technological and philosophical approaches of both models of care  Aimed at embracing both medical techniques  medical pluralism is currently being considered in nations with diverse communities  it is manifested in the practice of integrative medicine which is a deliberate execution of that approach  There are currently ongoing efforts to implement this dual model of healthcare delivery regionally in nations composed of very diverse communities  and such is the case in many Latin American countries such as Ecuador that have a large indigenous population  The process of successfully implementing an integrative healthcare system is discussed as having six main steps that pose different challenges  Guito et al  s guidelines for each steps describes the first as being  imperceptible integration  to the sixth being  total integration               
Artificial Intelligence  AI  can be helpful in identifying and improving issues of health disparities  A recent scoping review of the literature found that it is important to engage with various communities while AI health applications are being developed and also reviewed based on various biases that are later identified through this work              
Pandemic Treaty  The WHO s member states made health equity the central principle of the convention or other international instrument under negotiation              
G   s initiative for healthcare edit 
In       the G   under its Affordable Healthcare Model Hospital initiative  with the Government of Andhra Pradesh  India  opened a     bed facility in Srikakulam  drawing support from the Aarogyasri scheme                                                     

Health inequalities edit 
Health inequality is the term used in a number of countries to refer to those instances whereby the health of two demographic groups  not necessarily ethnic or racial groups  differs despite comparative access to health care services  Such examples include higher rates of morbidity and mortality for those in lower occupational classes than those in higher occupational classes  and the increased likelihood of those from ethnic minorities being diagnosed with a mental health disorder  In Canada  the issue was brought to public attention by the LaLonde report 
In UK  the Black Report was produced in      to highlight inequalities  On    February       Sir Michael Marmot  an epidemiologist at University College London  published the Fair Society  Healthy Lives report on the relationship between health and poverty  Marmot described his findings as illustrating a  social gradient in health   the life expectancy for the poorest is seven years shorter than for the most wealthy  and the poor are more likely to have a disability  In its report on this study  The Economist argued that the material causes of this contextual health inequality include unhealthful lifestyles   smoking remains more common  and obesity is increasing fastest  amongst the poor in Britain              
In June       the European Commission launched the Joint Action Health Equity in Europe               Forty nine participants from    European Union Member States will work together to address health inequalities and the underlying social determinants of health across Europe  Under the coordination of the Italian Institute of Public Health  the Joint Action aims to achieve greater equity in health in Europe across all social groups while reducing the inter country heterogeneity in tackling health inequalities 

Bias in research edit 
Research to identify health inequities  how they arise and what can be done to address them is essential to securing health equity  However  the same exclusionary social structures that contribute to health inequities in society also influence and are reproduced by researchers and public health institutions               In other words  medicine and public health organizations have evolved to better meet the needs of some groups more than others  Candidate variance in research can be important to ensure a safe life for every individual equally  Precision medicine lacks in minority groups relative to its effectiveness in whites               While there are many examples of bias in medical and public health research  some general categories of exclusionary research practices include                  Structural invisibility   approaches to collection  analysis or publication of data which hide the potential contribution of social factors to the distribution of health risks or outcomes  For example  limitations in public health surveys in the United States to collect data on race  ethnicity  and nativity      Institutionalized exclusion   codification of exclusionary social structures in research practices  instruments  and scientific models resulting in an inherent bias in favor of the normative group  For example  the definition of a human as an         kg man in toxicology      Unexamined assumptions   cultural norms and unconscious bias that can impact all aspects of research  In other words  assuming that the researchers  perspective and understanding is objective and universally shared  For example  the lack of conceptual equivalence across multi lingual survey instruments                           
Take the Asian American community as a reference  For this subpopulation only is cancer the leading cause of death  This could be a result of Asian Americans being less likely to appear in studies of environmental factors on health due to a false assumption that they are the same as whites               There is also a general distrust from the Asian American population towards Western healthcare as a result of historical racial pressures and cultural differences               In recent years  governmental figures in the United States have pushed for change  especially with the recent pandemic where making healthcare more accessible became more understanding  Whether their ways in which they aim for change were considered as appropriate differed on the audience               Different racial and ethnic groups faced the pandemic on different levels than that of whites  It is in this way that COVID    served as an eye opener to some of the major issues at hand  For example  in minority groups in the United States other than Asian American and Non Hispanic groups  there were greater rates of infection  hospitalization  and death when compared to the rates of Whites               Despite efforts  there were also concerns in differences in efficacy of the vaccines against the pandemic  For example  many of the clinical trials in the development of COVID    vaccines did not consider safe and inclusive plans  Taking approaches that develop protocols specific to different groups equally could be a way to combat this                           

Health disparity and genomics edit 
Genomics applications continue to increase in clinical medical applications  Historically  results from studies do not include underrepresented communities and races               The question of who benefits from publicly funded genomics is an important public health consideration  and attention will be needed to ensure that implementation of genomic medicine does not further entrench social equity concerns               Currently the National Human Genome Research Institute counts with a Genomics and Health Disparities Interest Group to tackle the issues of accessibility and application of genomic medicine to communities not normally represented  The Director of the Health Disparities Group  Vence L  Bonham Jr   leads a team that seeks to qualify and better understand the disparities and reduce the gap in access to genetic counseling  inclusion of minority communities in original research  and access to genetic information to improve health              
There is some movement toward progress  though  Sickle cell disease  which disproportionately impacts Black people where every   of     births              has the condition  is treatable with gene therapy  In December       the United States  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  approved two gene therapy treatments              that use gene editing machinery known as CRISPR Cas  to alleviate the sickling of the red blood cells  This will greatly improve the livelihoods of millions  but especially people of color who are much more at risk for this condition
