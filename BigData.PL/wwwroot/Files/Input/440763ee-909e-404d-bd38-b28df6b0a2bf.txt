							Amidst a landscape of evolving economic refor ms and regional uncertainties  Egypt remains a key player in the Middle East and North Africa  MENA  region  In this exclusive interview  Todd Wilcox  CEO and Deputy Chairperson of HSBC Bank Egypt  provides valuable insights into the bank       s vision for the Egyptian economy  highlighting growth opportunities  navigating potential pitfalls  and outlining HSBC       s pivotal role in fostering foreign direct investment  FDI  and sustainable economic development 
What is the bank s vision of the Egyptian economy at present and its growth opportunities 
We hold a positive and balanced view on Egypt s economy  recognizing both the promising opportunities and the challenges ahead  The country has demonstrated remarkable resilience  driven by its economic reform programme and diversifying efforts  These initiatives have laid the right foundations for future growth  particularly in sectors like manufacturing  energy  infrastructure and technology  Egypt s strategic location  young and skilled workforce as well as its focus on attracting foreign direct investments are key strengths 
In terms of growth potential  significant opportunities exist in renewables  the digital economy and manufacturing  Egypt s push toward green energy  including solar and wind  makes major advancements  This not only reduces dependence on energy imports but also opens up new investment avenues  Additionally  the digital economy is rapidly evolving supported by a thriving startup ecosystem and a growing emphasis on innovation 
That said  the ongoing regional tension has undoubtedly introduced a layer of pressure on the country s economy  This tension could potentially weigh on Egypt s tourism and Suez Canal revenues both of which are critical to its economic health  However  the country s efforts have helped mitigate some of these risks and the country remains a key player in navigating these challenges 
Of course  there are other challenges to keep an eye on Â  Inflation  foreign currency sustainable adequacy and high interest rates are still concerns  as they could affect investor confidence in the near term  Managing public debt will also be critical to ensuring long term stability 
Despite these hurdles  Egypt s commitment and proven track record to reform and its regional and global partnership inspire confidence in its future trajectory  With continued investment and effective policies  Egypt is well positioned to achieve growth ambitions and solidify its role as a major economic player in the region 
What are the economic sectors that the bank believes have strong growth opportunities in the coming period 
When we look at Egypt s economy  there are several sectors we believe have a strong growth potential in the coming period and I d say a few really stand out for us 
First  we are very optimistic about manufacturing and exporting  particularly in sectors like textiles  automotives  electronics  home appliances and many others  Egypt has the potential to play a very critical role as well on this front  thanks to its location and the various trade agreements in place  There s also been a focus on improving infrastructure  which can boost industrial growth and make Egypt more competitive globally 
Also  renewable energy as I mentioned in my answer to the previous question  Egypt is making great strides in solar and wind power  this is an area where we see a lot of opportunity for both local and foreign investors  The government s commitment to green energy aligns with the global trends towards sustainable infrastructure  We are already seeing muchinterest from foreign investors and also many of our clients 
Another sector is the digital economy  There is a strong entrepreneurial spirit here  and Egypt s young  tech savvy population is driving growth in areas like fintech  e commerce and digital services  With the increasing push for digital transformation across various industries  we think this sector could become a real game changer for the country s economy in the near future  Egypt can also act as a regional hub which could drive broader economic development across multiple sectors 
Recognizing this potential  the bank has been very proactive on this front being the first to introduce a dedicated lending initiative for technology entrepreneurs providing them with innovative financing solutions and working capital facilities to support the digital transformation and the industries driving the new economy 
Finally trade  given the strategic importance of the Suez Canal and the Suez Canal Economic Zone  Egypt s efforts to develop the SCzone into a major industrial and logistic hub are set to attract substantial FDIs  The ScZone offers a prime location for international companies looking to access not only the Middle Eastern markets but also Asia  Europe and Africa  With the government actively promoting investment friendly policies in the zone and more broadly  we anticipate that it will become a magnet for industries like manufacturing  logistics and energy 
What role does the bank play in serving the Egyptian economy 
HSBC has had a longstanding presence in Egypt for    years  during which we have played a vital role in bringing the best of HSBC globally to position itself as a key thought partner of the Egyptian Government to attract Foreign Direct Investment  FDI   leading in ESG and Sustainable finance transactions and Digitization 
We have been at the forefront of event business with the government and financial institutions and have supported landmark transactions across Debt Capital Market and Export Finance including outbound and ESG business 
In today       s global economy  the ability to connect across borders is crucial for businesses and individuals alike  By leveraging our global network and strong regional presence in the Middle East  we have been able to connect our Egyptian clients to opportunities worldwide  while also helping global investors tap into the significant potential that Egypt offers 
During       HSBC has engaged in a number of activities to support the Egyptian Government in attracting FDI  as we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the General Authority for Investment and Free Zone  GAFI  to support the Egyptian Government with its strategy to attract more FDIs to Egypt  this agreement follows GAFI s successful mission with HSBC to Singapore and China which underscored how highly investors regard the opportunities that exist for them in Egypt 
We also focused on supporting Chinese multinational investments and fostering strong partnerships between Chinese businesses and the government  We have taken a unique approach in this space  becoming the first and only bank in Egypt to offer a native Mandarin speaking relationship manager who provides dedicated support and strategic planning to our Chinese clients 
Throughout       we have seen remarkable growth in this corridor  with a significant increase in average assets and deposits  much of which is tied to new FDIs  Our focus has been proactively monitoring new investments coming from China and engaging with potential entrants early  offering them in depth insights into the market and improving transparency to help them make informed decisions 
Egypt is one of HSBC s most vibrant and dynamic markets  with a business foundation rooted in decades of dedicated support to our customers and the country s strategic agenda 
Could you provide more details about the recent conference that you organized in the UK to attract FDI into Egypt  
HSBC held the Egypt   UK Investment and Opportunities Forum in London during Sept     which is an initiative by HSBC  UK Export Finance and the Egyptian British Chamber of Commerce to foster and strengthen cross border activity between the UK and Egypt  The conference showcased investment opportunities in Egypt across different sectors   including renewable energy  water  automotive  food processing  IT  and AI   to potential investors from the UK  It also helped connect institutions of both countries  bringing together government representatives  business leaders and senior executives 
The event featured presentations by GAFI s head Hossam Heiba on supporting a sustainable investment climate  SCZone head Walid Gamal El Din on the economic zone s investment proposition  and Advisor to the Vice Finance Minister Nevine Mansour on economic reform  The presentations were followed by two panel discussions with large local and international companies   the first of which discussed Egypt       s growth potential and infrastructure and the second focused on investment opportunities and success stories 
During the same visit  we organized a roundtable for the Minister of Finance with    institutional investors and   bilateral meetings were held for the Deputy CBE governor with investors 
One day after the Forum took place in London  a senior delegation from the bank visited France to update French corporates on the improving economic situation and discuss potential investment opportunities in Egypt 
The interest we have seen from clients and global investors in the different international roadshows we have organized underscores how highly they regard future opportunities in Egypt  This year s delegation is very important as it is an opportunity to consider Egypt s economic reform programme in view of evolving global circumstances and to support the government s ambitions to attract more foreign direct investment 
What are the most prominent sectors that the bank targets in terms of financing in the new year 
For years now our strategy has been quite clear  we aim to be the leading international bank in Egypt 
We are the go to bank for multinationals  continuously providing our clients with innovative  world class solutions 
A big part of this growth in Egypt is digitization  which is crucial to the country s economic development  We have a digital offering that s unmatched and we are looking for ways to enhance this offering  For instance  this year we successfully rolled out Instant Payment services for corporates after the successful launch of personal accounts where     of our clients already registered on the platform Â  Now our corporate clients can process payments instantly           days a year through our global digital platform  This has greatly improved operational efficiency and cash management for our clients 
As a testament to our digital capabilities  our client Imerys has been awarded  Best in Class Treasury Solution in Africa  by the Adam Smith Awards in       for the full treasury transformation solution  where HSBC showcased its digital capabilities and innovative solutions and was mandated the deal to be subject s main Treasury and Banking partner  The Adam Smith Awards are recognized as the industry benchmark for best practice and innovation in corporate treasury 
HSBC has strengthened its position as the leading sustainable finance bank in Egypt  delivering innovative transactions  expanding ESG linked financing solutions  and driving systemic change across key industries across all lines of business 
As Egypt continues its transition to a more sustainable and inclusive economy  HSBC stands at the forefront  supporting businesses  institutions  and policymakers with market leading financing solutions in sustainable finance  Through strategic leadership  HSBC is not only financing Egypt s transition but also shaping the future of sustainable finance in the country 
HSBC continues to achieve new milestones in the market  with the number of sustainable finance transactions in Egypt increasing by approximately     during      
We also have one of the HSBC Global Service Centers right here in Egypt  which is the only one within the Middle East region  The centre serves more than    different countries and   regions with a number of Centers of Excellence for trade and cash management 
The Trade Centre of Excellence executed thousands of transactions in the days immediately after Egypt adopted a flexible exchange rate  Having the dedicated Center of Excellence for Trade here was a real advantage in ramping up processing volumes and speeds to ensure that clients  supply chain requirements were met as market conditions changed 
We have been named Best Bank for Diversity and Inclusion in Egypt at the Euromoney Awards for Excellence       which demonstrates our commitment to creating an inclusive business that supports diverse groups in both our workplace and the wider community 
One element of the bank s award entry was HSBC Egypt s support of an innovative programme with the Global Fund for Widows which has helped       widows build their own businesses  The partnership was a central part of how HSBC marked    years of doing business in Egypt and identified a way to support an important segment of society while helping Egyptian widows take their first steps to becoming entrepreneurs  This award not only honours the work of HSBC Egypt but also serves as a reminder of the collective impact we can achieve when we come together to create a more inclusive and equitable world 
Our consistent results year after year really reflect the strength and resilience of our business here in Egypt
