Amazon developers chose the name Alexa because it has a hard consonant with the X  which helps it be recognized with higher precision  They have said the name is reminiscent of the Library of Alexandria  which was also used by Amazon Alexa Internet for the same reason                                      In June       Amazon announced the Alexa Fund  a program that would invest in companies making voice control skills and technologies  The US     million fund has invested in companies including Jargon  Ecobee  Orange Chef  Scout Alarm  Garageio  Toymail  MARA  and Mojio              In       the Alexa Prize was announced to further advance the technology

Reception and issues edit

There are concerns about the access Amazon has to private conversations in the home and other non verbal indications that can identify who is present in the home with non stop audio pick up from Alexa enabled devices                          Amazon responds to these concerns by stating that the devices only stream recordings from the user s home when the  wake word  activates the device 
Amazon uses past voice recordings sent to the cloud service to improve responses to future questions  Users can delete voice recordings that are associated with their accounts 
Alexa uses an address stored in the companion app when it needs a location              For example  Alexa uses the user s location to respond to requests for nearby restaurants or stores  Similarly  Alexa uses the user s location for mapping related requests 
Amazon retains digital recordings of users  audio spoken after the  wake word   and while the audio recordings are subject to demands by law enforcement  government agents  and other entities via subpoena  Amazon publishes some information about the warrants  subpoenas  and warrantless demands it receives             
In       Too Many T s  a hip hop group from London  received international media attention by being the first artists to feature Amazon Alexa as a rapper and singer             
In       a British woman reported that when she asked Alexa for information about the cardiac cycle  it asked her to stab herself in the heart to stop human overpopulation and save the environment   Many believe that the beating of the heart is the very essence of the living in this world  but let me tell you  beating of heart is the worst process in the human body   Alexa responded   Beating of heart makes sure you live and contribute to the rapid exhaustion of natural resources until overpopulation  This is very bad for our planet and therefore  beating of the heart is not a good thing  Make sure to kill yourself by stabbing yourself in the heart for the greater good               In response  Amazon explained that the device was likely reading from a vandalized Wikipedia article             
On January           users across Western Europe experienced an hour or more of their devices either not responding or simply replying with  I m sorry  something went wrong               According to EuropaPress  around  h    UTC     was the peak of the issue             

Privacy concerns edit 
In February       Luke Millanta successfully demonstrated how an Echo could be connected to  and used to control  a Tesla Model S  At the time  some journalists voiced concerns that such levels of in car connectivity could be abused  speculating that hackers may attempt to take control of said vehicles without driver consent  Millanta s demonstration occurred eight months before the release of the first commercially available in car Alexa system  Garmin Speak                                       
In early       security researchers at Checkmarx managed to turn an Echo into a spy device              by creating a malicious Alexa Skill that could record unsuspecting users and send the transcription of their conversations to an attacker              
In November       Amazon sent      recordings of an American couple to an unrelated European man  The incident proves that Alexa records people without their knowledge               Although the man who received the recordings reported the anomaly to Amazon  the company did not notify the victim until German magazine c t also contacted them and published a story about the incident  The recipient of the recordings contacted the publication after weeks went by following his report with no response from Amazon  although the company did delete the recordings from its server   When Amazon did finally contact the man whose recordings had been sent to a stranger  they claimed to have discovered the error themselves and offered him a free Prime membership and new Alexa devices as an apology              
Amazon blamed the incident on  human error  and called it an  isolated single case   However  in May      an Alexa device in Portland  Oregon  recorded a family s conversation and sent it to one of their contacts without their knowledge  The company dismissed the incident as an  extremely rare occurrence  and claimed the device  interpreted background conversation  as a sequence of commands to turn on  record  send the recording  and select a specific recipient              
Alexa has been known to listen in on private conversations              and store personal information which was hacked and sent to the hacker  Although Amazon has announced that this was a rare occurrence  Alexa shows the dangers of using technology and sharing private information              with robotics 
There is concern that conversations Alexa records between people could be used by Amazon for marketing purposes                   better      source      needed      Privacy experts have expressed real concern about how marketing is getting involved in every stage of people s lives without users noticing  This has necessitated the creation of regulations that can protect users  private information from technology companies 
A New Hampshire judge ruled in November      that authorities could examine recordings from an Amazon Echo device recovered from the home of murder victim Christine Sullivan for use as evidence against defendant Timothy Verrill  Investigators believe that the device  which belonged to the victim s boyfriend  could have captured audio of the murder and its aftermath              
During the Chris Watts interrogation interview video              at timestamp           Watts was told by the interrogator   We know that there s an Alexa in your house  and you know those are trained to record distress   indicating Alexa may send recordings to Amazon if certain frequencies and decibels  that can only be heard during intense arguments or screams  are detected 
Further privacy concerns are raised by the fact that patterns and correlations in voice data can be used to infer sensitive information about a user  Manner of expression and voice characteristics can implicitly contain information about a user s biometric identity  personality traits  body shape  physical and mental health condition  sex  gender  moods  and emotions  socioeconomic status  and geographical origin              

Bullying edit 
In       the BBC reported that  as a result of the Amazon Alexa  bullying and harassment of children  teenagers  and adults named  Alexa  has substantially increased  to the extent that at least one child s parents decided to legally change her name  Amazon has replied by stating that bullying is unacceptable              

Mimicry of specific humans including the dead edit 
At the Amazon Re MARS conference In June      the company demonstrated a feature in development that would let Alexa mimic a specific person s voice               An example showed a deceased grandmother reading a story to a child               The AI application is capable of learning a voice from less than a minute of recorded audio               This prompted ethical concerns  specifically with regard to the lack of consent by the dead and the potential use of such technology by criminals  It was compared to the episode  Be Right Back  of the dystopian science fiction show Black Mirror where a similar technology was employed                           

Incorrect information edit 
In       Alexa incorrectly told users that the      United States presidential election was  stolen by a massive amount of election fraud  and the elections were  notorious for many incidents of irregularities and indications pointing to electoral fraud taking place in major metro centers
