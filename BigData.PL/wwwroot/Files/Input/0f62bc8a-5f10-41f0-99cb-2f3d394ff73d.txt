Evolutionary algorithms  EA  reproduce essential elements of the biological evolution in a computer algorithm in order to solve  difficult  problems  at least approximately  for which no exact or satisfactory solution methods are known  They belong to the class of metaheuristics and are a subset of population based bio inspired algorithms            and evolutionary computation  which itself are part of the field of computational intelligence             The mechanisms of biological evolution that an EA mainly imitates are reproduction  mutation  recombination and selection  Candidate solutions to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population  and the fitness function determines the quality of the solutions  see also loss function   Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators 
Evolutionary algorithms often perform well approximating solutions to all types of problems because they ideally do not make any assumption about the underlying fitness landscape  Techniques from evolutionary algorithms applied to the modeling of biological evolution are generally limited to explorations of microevolutionary processes and planning models based upon cellular processes  In most real applications of EAs  computational complexity is a prohibiting factor             In fact  this computational complexity is due to fitness function evaluation  Fitness approximation is one of the solutions to overcome this difficulty  However  seemingly simple EA can solve often complex problems                                   therefore  there may be no direct link between algorithm complexity and problem complexity 


Generic definition edit 
The following is an example of a generic evolutionary algorithm                                  

Randomly generate the initial population of individuals  the first generation 
Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population 
Check  if the goal is reached and the algorithm can be terminated 
Select individuals as parents  preferably of higher fitness 
Produce offspring with optional crossover  mimicking reproduction  
Apply mutation operations on the offspring 
Select individuals preferably of lower fitness for replacement with new individuals  mimicking natural selection

Types edit 
Similar techniques differ in genetic representation and other implementation details  and the nature of the particular applied problem 

Genetic algorithm   This is the most popular type of EA  One seeks the solution of a problem in the form of strings of numbers  traditionally binary  although the best representations are usually those that reflect something about the problem being solved              by applying operators such as recombination and mutation  sometimes one  sometimes both    This type of EA is often used in optimization problems 
Genetic programming   Here the solutions are in the form of computer programs  and their fitness is determined by their ability to solve a computational problem  There are many variants of Genetic Programming 
Cartesian genetic programming
Gene expression programming
Grammatical evolution
Linear genetic programming
Multi expression programming
Evolutionary programming   Similar to evolution strategy  but with a deterministic selection of all parents 
Evolution strategy  ES    Works with vectors of real numbers as representations of solutions  and typically uses self adaptive mutation rates  The method is mainly used for numerical optimization  although there are also variants for combinatorial tasks                                     
CMA ES
Natural evolution strategy
Differential evolution   Based on vector differences and is therefore primarily suited for numerical optimization problems 
Coevolutionary algorithm   Similar to genetic algorithms and evolution strategies  but the created solutions are compared on the basis of their outcomes from interactions with other solutions  Solutions can either compete or cooperate during the search process  Coevolutionary algorithms are often used in scenarios where the fitness landscape is dynamic  complex  or involves competitive interactions                         
Neuroevolution   Similar to genetic programming but the genomes represent artificial neural networks by describing structure and connection weights  The genome encoding can be direct or indirect 
Learning classifier system   Here the solution is a set of classifiers  rules or conditions   A Michigan LCS evolves at the level of individual classifiers whereas a Pittsburgh LCS uses populations of classifier sets  Initially  classifiers were only binary  but now include real  neural net  or S expression types  Fitness is typically determined with either a strength or accuracy based reinforcement learning or supervised learning approach 
Quality Diversity algorithms   QD algorithms simultaneously aim for high quality and diverse solutions  Unlike traditional optimization algorithms that solely focus on finding the best solution to a problem  QD algorithms explore a wide variety of solutions across a problem space and keep those that are not just high performing  but also diverse and unique                                     
Theoretical background edit 
The following theoretical principles apply to all or almost all EAs 

No free lunch theorem edit 
The no free lunch theorem of optimization states that all optimization strategies are equally effective when the set of all optimization problems is considered  Under the same condition  no evolutionary algorithm is fundamentally better than another  This can only be the case if the set of all problems is restricted  This is exactly what is inevitably done in practice  Therefore  to improve an EA  it must exploit problem knowledge in some form  e g  by choosing a certain mutation strength or a problem adapted coding   Thus  if two EAs are compared  this constraint is implied  In addition  an EA can use problem specific knowledge by  for example  not randomly generating the entire start population  but creating some individuals through heuristics or other procedures                          Another possibility to tailor an EA to a given problem domain is to involve suitable heuristics  local search procedures or other problem related procedures in the process of generating the offspring  This form of extension of an EA is also known as a memetic algorithm  Both extensions play a major role in practical applications  as they can speed up the search process and make it more robust                         

Convergence edit 
For EAs in which  in addition to the offspring  at least the best individual of the parent generation is used to form the subsequent generation  so called elitist EAs   there is a general proof of convergence under the condition that an optimum exists  Without loss of generality  a maximum search is assumed for the proof 
From the property of elitist offspring acceptance and the existence of the optimum it follows that per generation

I e   the fitness values represent a monotonically non decreasing sequence  which is bounded due to the existence of the optimum  From this follows the convergence of the sequence against the optimum 
Since the proof makes no statement about the speed of convergence  it is of little help in practical applications of EAs  But it does justify the recommendation to use elitist EAs  However  when using the usual panmictic population model  elitist EAs tend to converge prematurely more than non elitist ones              In a panmictic population model  mate selection  see step   of the generic definition  is such that every individual in the entire population is eligible as a mate  In non panmictic populations  selection is suitably restricted  so that the dispersal speed of better individuals is reduced compared to panmictic ones  Thus  the general risk of premature convergence of elitist EAs can be significantly reduced by suitable population models that restrict mate selection                         

Virtual alphabets edit 
With the theory of virtual alphabets  David E  Goldberg showed in      that by using a representation with real numbers  an EA that uses classical recombination operators  e g  uniform or n point crossover  cannot reach certain areas of the search space  in contrast to a coding with binary numbers              This results in the recommendation for EAs with real representation to use arithmetic operators for recombination  e g  arithmetic mean or intermediate recombination   With suitable operators  real valued representations are more effective than binary ones  contrary to earlier opinion                         

Comparison to other concepts edit 
Biological processes edit 
A possible limitation     according to whom       of many evolutionary algorithms is their lack of a clear genotype phenotype distinction  In nature  the fertilized egg cell undergoes a complex process known as embryogenesis to become a mature phenotype  This indirect encoding is believed to make the genetic search more robust  i e  reduce the probability of fatal mutations   and also may improve the evolvability of the organism                          Such indirect  also known as generative or developmental  encodings also enable evolution to exploit the regularity in the environment              Recent work in the field of artificial embryogeny  or artificial developmental systems  seeks to address these concerns  And gene expression programming successfully explores a genotype phenotype system  where the genotype consists of linear multigenic chromosomes of fixed length and the phenotype consists of multiple expression trees or computer programs of different sizes and shapes                  improper synthesis      

Monte Carlo methods edit 
Both method classes have in common that their individual search steps are determined by chance  The main difference  however  is that EAs  like many other metaheuristics  learn from past search steps and incorporate this experience into the execution of the next search steps in a method specific form  With EAs  this is done firstly through the fitness based selection operators for partner choice and the formation of the next generation  And secondly  in the type of search steps  In EA  they start from a current solution and change it or they mix the information of two solutions  In contrast  when dicing out new solutions in Monte Carlo methods  there is usually no connection to existing solutions                         
If  on the other hand  the search space of a task is such that there is nothing to learn  Monte Carlo methods are an appropriate tool  as they do not contain any algorithmic overhead that attempts to draw suitable conclusions from the previous search  An example of such tasks is the proverbial search for a needle in a haystack  e g  in the form of a flat  hyper plane with a single narrow peak 

Applications edit 
The areas in which evolutionary algorithms are practically used are almost unlimited            and range from industry                          engineering                                    complex scheduling                                     agriculture              robot movement planning             and finance                         to research                         and art  The application of an evolutionary algorithm requires some rethinking from the inexperienced user  as the approach to a task using an EA is different from conventional exact methods and this is usually not part of the curriculum of engineers or other disciplines  For example  the fitness calculation must not only formulate the goal but also support the evolutionary search process towards it  e g  by rewarding improvements that do not yet lead to a better evaluation of the original quality criteria  For example  if peak utilisation of resources such as personnel deployment or energy consumption is to be avoided in a scheduling task  it is not sufficient to assess the maximum utilisation  Rather  the number and duration of exceedances of a still acceptable level should also be recorded in order to reward reductions below the actual maximum peak value              There are therefore some publications that are aimed at the beginner and want to help avoiding beginner s mistakes as well as leading an application project to success                                      This includes clarifying the fundamental question of when an EA should be used to solve a problem and when it is better not to 

Related techniques and other global search methods edit 
There are some other proven and widely used methods of nature inspired global search techniques such as

Memetic algorithm   A hybrid method  inspired by Richard Dawkins s notion of a meme  It commonly takes the form of a population based algorithm  frequently an EA  coupled with individual learning procedures capable of performing local refinements  Emphasizes the exploitation of problem specific knowledge and tries to orchestrate local and global search in a synergistic way 
A cellular evolutionary or memetic algorithm uses a topological neighbouhood relation between the individuals of a population for restricting the mate selection and by that reducing the propagation speed of above average individuals  The idea is to maintain genotypic diversity in the poulation over a longer period of time to reduce the risk of premature convergence 
Ant colony optimization is based on the ideas of ant foraging by pheromone communication to form paths  Primarily suited for combinatorial optimization and graph problems 
Particle swarm optimization is based on the ideas of animal flocking behaviour  Also primarily suited for numerical optimization problems 
Gaussian adaptation   Based on information theory  Used for maximization of manufacturing yield  mean fitness or average information  See for instance Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory 
In addition  many new nature inspired or methaphor guided algorithms have been proposed since the beginning of this century  For criticism of most publications on these  see the remarks at the end of the introduction to the article on metaheuristics
