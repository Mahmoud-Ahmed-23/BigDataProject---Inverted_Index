							Koudijs Kapo Feed Company is considering establishing a fish processing factory after inaugurating a fish feed factory with investments of EGP    m and a production capacity of         tonnes per year 
Member of the board Alaa Kamar noted that the company operates in the field of feed production of various types  including fish  poultry  and livestock  adding that it is considering expansion through the new factory to process and export fish 
He explained that expansion in aquaculture projects encourages fish feed manufacturing companies to add more production lines  which eventually boosts the size of investments in the sector 
He pointed out that the company does not own fish farms now and is not considering the idea  whereas it deals with small fish farmers as well as large investment companies 
Moreover  Kamar said that opening a fish feed production factory now reflects the confidence of foreign and local investors in the Egyptian market and their plans to reach higher growth rates 
He explained that the new alliance to enter the fish industry began with the establishment of the factory in      on      sqm and a production capacity of         tonnes per year with investments of EGP    m  including EGP   m from the Central Bank of Egypt  CBE   while the remainder part was funded with retained earnings 
He noted that the dollar shortage that took over the market two years ago impacted the company       s ability to import machinery and equipment 
Yet  he added that the company managed to overcome all the obstacles to expedite the inauguration of the factory
