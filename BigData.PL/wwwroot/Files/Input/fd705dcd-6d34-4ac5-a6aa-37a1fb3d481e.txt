                                                                Physics is the branch of science that studies matter  energy  and the fundamental forces of nature through space and time  It is one of the most important subject in Science  Physics is one of the earliest fields of science  Whatever we see and feel nowadays is associated with Physics  It helps scientists make the modern world more comfortable PhysicsWhat is Physics Physics is branch in which we study about matter  energy  and the fundamental forces of nature through space and time  The word physics is derived from the Greek word Physikos which means natural or physical The rules of universe are understood and described using the study of physics  Starting from tiny particles that constitute matter to the massive forces that rule the cosmos  physics comprises of many topics and concepts  There are various definition of physics  as per belief New technologies are frequently made possible by improvements in physics  For example let us consider  our knowledge of physics and its subfields have led us to create goods such as television  computers  home appliances  and nuclear weapons  Similarly  improvements in thermodynamics have drastically affected the growth of industrialization  and improvements in mechanics have influenced the creation of calculus Branches of PhysicsPhysics is such a vast subject  It has numerous concepts and theory which makes study of Physics complex  So it is categorized in various branches to study effectively  Along with branch of Physics  GeeksforGeeks has curated this list of important topics in Physics based on the branch to help you prepare for Physics in board cum competitive exams  This will be a free study material for Physics Below are the branches of Physics MechanicsMechanics study how matter  force  and motion are related to one another with respect to physical objects  The three branches of mechanics are Statics  which studies forces acting on and

the science of optics  Light has many properties in common with X rays  microwaves  and radio waves because it is an electromagnetic wave OpticsImportant topics in OpticsLaws of ReflectionTotal Internal ReflectionDiffractionDispersion of LightRefractionRegular and Diffused ReflectionBraille SystemThermodynamicsThermodynamics is the branch of Physics in which we study about interaction between heat  work  temperature  and energy  Thermodynamics broadly refers to the process of moving energy from one location or form to another  The fundamental principle is that heat is a kind of energy that is equivalent to a specific quantity of mechanical labor ThermodynamicsImportant topics in ThermodynamicsZeroth Law of ThermodynamicsFirst Law of ThermodynamicsLatent HeatSecond Law of ThermodynamicsSpecific Heat CapacityThermodynamic ProcessesBehavior of GasElectromagnetismThe study of charge and the fields and forces it generates is known as electromagnetism  Two components of electromagnetism are electricity and magnetism  One of the four basic forces of nature is the electromagnetic force  In interactions between atoms and molecules  it is the dominating force  Electromagnetism can be referred to as a mixture of electrostatics and magnetism  two separate interrelated phenomena  Magnetism is an interaction that only happens between charged particles in relative motion  whereas electromagnetic forces happen between any two charged particles  generating an attraction between particles with opposing charges and repulsion between particles with the same charge  nbsp Important topics in ElectromagnetismElectric ChargeElectric Circuit   Definition  Components  Circuit with BulbsElectric CurrentElectric FieldElectric Field Lines nbsp Electric Flux nbsp
