A native of Terre Haute  Indiana  Stuart E  Dreyfus is professor emeritus at University of California  Berkeley in the Industrial Engineering and Operations Research Department  While at the Rand Corporation he was a programmer of the JOHNNIAC computer                        While at Rand he coauthored Applied Dynamic Programming with Richard Bellman  Following that work  he was encouraged to pursue a Ph D  which he completed in applied mathematics at Harvard University in       on the calculus of variations  In       Dreyfus simplified the Dynamic Programming based derivation of backpropagation  due to Henry J  Kelley and Arthur E  Bryson  using only the chain rule                                              He also coauthored Mind Over Machine with his brother Hubert Dreyfus in
