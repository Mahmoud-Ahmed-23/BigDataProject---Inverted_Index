PubMed is an openly accessible  free database which includes primarily the MEDLINE database of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics  The United States National Library of Medicine  NLM  at the National Institutes of Health maintains the database as part of the Entrez system of information retrieval            
From      to       online access to the MEDLINE database was provided via computer and phone lines primarily through institutional facilities  such as university libraries             PubMed  first released in January       ushered in the era of private  free  home  and office based MEDLINE searching             The PubMed system was offered free to the public starting in June                 


Content edit 
In addition to MEDLINE  PubMed provides access to 

older references from the print version of Index Medicus  back to      and earlier
references to some journals before they were indexed in Index Medicus and MEDLINE  for instance Science  BMJ  and Annals of Surgery
very recent entries to records for an article before it is indexed with Medical Subject Headings  MeSH  and added to MEDLINE
a collection of books available full text and other subsets of NLM records           
PMC citations
NCBI Bookshelf
Many PubMed records contain links to full text articles  some of which are freely available  often in PubMed Central            and local mirrors  such as Europe PubMed Central            
Information about the journals indexed in MEDLINE  and available through PubMed  is found in the NLM Catalog            
As of         May               update       PubMed has more than    million citations and abstracts dating back to       selectively to the year       and very selectively to       As of the same date     update            million of PubMed s records are listed with their abstracts  and      million records have links to full text versions  of which      million articles are available  full text for free              Over the last    years  ending    December        an average of nearly one million new records were added each year  
In       NLM changed the indexing system so that publishers are able to directly correct typos and errors in PubMed indexed articles            
PubMed has been reported to include some articles published in predatory journals  MEDLINE and PubMed policies for the selection of journals for database inclusion are slightly different  Weaknesses in the criteria and procedures for indexing journals in PubMed Central may allow publications from predatory journals to leak into PubMed             

Characteristics edit 
Website design edit 
A new PubMed interface was launched in October      and encouraged the use of such quick  Google like search formulations  they have also been described as  telegram  searches              By default the results are sorted by Most Recent  but this can be changed to Best Match  Publication Date  First Author  Last Author  Journal  or Title             
The PubMed website design and domain was updated in January      and became default on    May       with the updated and new features              There was a critical reaction from many researchers who frequently use the site             

PubMed for handhelds mobiles edit 
PubMed MEDLINE can be accessed via handheld devices  using for instance the  PICO  option  for focused clinical questions  created by the NLM              A  PubMed Mobile  option  providing access to a mobile friendly  simplified PubMed version  is also available             

Search edit 
Standard search edit 
Simple searches on PubMed can be carried out by entering key aspects of a subject into PubMed s search window 
PubMed translates this initial search formulation and automatically adds field names  relevant MeSH  Medical Subject Headings  terms  synonyms  Boolean operators  and  nests  the resulting terms appropriately  enhancing the search formulation significantly  in particular by routinely combining  using the OR operator  textwords and MeSH terms      citation needed     

Comprehensive search edit 
For optimal searches in PubMed  it is necessary to understand its core component  MEDLINE  and especially of the MeSH  Medical Subject Headings  controlled vocabulary used to index MEDLINE articles  They may also require complex search strategies  use of field names  tags   proper use of limits and other features  reference librarians and search specialists offer search services                         
The search into PubMed s search window is only recommended for the search of unequivocal topics or new interventions that do not yet have a MeSH heading created  as well as for the search for commercial brands of medicines and proper nouns  It is also useful when there is no suitable heading or the descriptor represents a partial aspect  The search using the thesaurus MeSH is more accurate and will give fewer irrelevant results  In addition  it saves the disadvantage of the free text search in which the spelling  singular plural or abbreviated differences have to be taken into consideration  On the other side  articles more recently incorporated into the database to which descriptors have not yet been assigned will not be found  Therefore  to guarantee an exhaustive search  a combination of controlled language headings and free text terms must be used             

Journal article parameters edit 
When a journal article is indexed  numerous article parameters are extracted and stored as structured information  Such parameters are  Article Type  MeSH terms  e g    Clinical Trial    Secondary identifiers   MeSH terms   Language  Country of the Journal or publication history  e publication date  print journal publication date  

Publication Type  Clinical queries systematic reviews edit 
Publication type parameter allows searching by the type of publication  including reports of various kinds of clinical research             

Secondary ID edit 
Since July       the MEDLINE article indexing process extracts identifiers from the article abstract and puts those in a field called Secondary Identifier  SI   The secondary identifier field is to store accession numbers to various databases of molecular sequence data  gene expression or chemical compounds and clinical trial IDs  For clinical trials  PubMed extracts trial IDs for the two largest trial registries  ClinicalTrials gov  NCT identifier  and the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Register  IRCTN identifier              

See also edit 
A reference which is judged particularly relevant can be marked and  related articles  can be identified  If relevant  several studies can be selected and related articles to all of them can be generated  on PubMed or any of the other NCBI Entrez databases  using the  Find related data  option  The related articles are then listed in order of  relatedness   To create these lists of related articles  PubMed compares words from the title and abstract of each citation  as well as the MeSH headings assigned  using a powerful word weighted algorithm              The  related articles  function has been judged to be so precise that the authors of a paper suggested it can be used instead of a full search             

Mapping to MeSH edit 
PubMed automatically links to MeSH terms and subheadings  Examples would be   bad breath  links to  and includes in the search   halitosis    heart attack  to  myocardial infarction    breast cancer  to  breast neoplasms   Where appropriate  these MeSH terms are automatically  expanded   that is  include more specific terms  Terms like  nursing  are automatically linked to  Nursing  MeSH   or  Nursing  Subheading    This feature is called Auto Term Mapping and is enacted  by default  in free text searching but not exact phrase searching  i e  enclosing the search query with double quotes               This feature makes PubMed searches more sensitive and avoids false negative  missed  hits by compensating for the diversity of medical terminology             
PubMed does not apply automatic mapping of the term in the following circumstances  by writing the quoted phrase  e g    kidney allograft    when truncated on the asterisk  e g   kidney allograft    and when looking with field labels  e g   Cancer  ti               

My NCBI edit 
The PubMed optional facility  My NCBI   with free registration  provides tools for

saving searches
filtering search results
setting up automatic updates sent by e mail
saving sets of references retrieved as part of a PubMed search
configuring display formats or highlighting search terms
and a wide range of other options              The  My NCBI  area can be accessed from any computer with web access 
An earlier version of  My NCBI  was called  PubMed Cubby              

LinkOut edit 
LinkOut is an NLM facility to link and make available full text local journal holdings              Some       sites  mainly academic institutions  participate in this NLM facility  as of March               update        from Aalborg University in Denmark to ZymoGenetics in Seattle              Users at these institutions see their institution s logo within the PubMed search result  if the journal is held at that institution  and can access the full text  Link out is being consolidated with Outside Tool as of the major platform update coming in the Summer of                  

PubMed Commons edit 
In       PubMed allows authors of articles to comment on articles indexed by PubMed  This feature was initially tested in a pilot mode  since       and was made permanent in                   In February       PubMed Commons was discontinued due to the fact that  usage has remained minimal                          

askMEDLINE edit 
askMEDLINE  a free text  natural language query tool for MEDLINE PubMed  developed by the NLM  also suitable for handhelds             

PubMed identifier edit 
For help using PubMed identifiers within Wikipedia  see Wikipedia PMID 
A PMID  PubMed identifier or PubMed unique identifier              is a unique integer value  starting at    assigned to each PubMed record  A PMID is not the same as a PMCID  PubMed Central identifier  which is the identifier for all works published in the free to access PubMed Central             
The assignment of a PMID or PMCID to a publication tells the reader nothing about the type or quality of the content  PMIDs are assigned to letters to the editor  editorial opinions  op ed columns  and any other piece that the editor chooses to include in the journal  as well as peer reviewed papers  The existence of the identification number is also not proof that the papers have not been retracted for fraud  incompetence  or misconduct  The announcement about any corrections to original papers may be assigned a PMID 
Each number that is entered in the PubMed search window is treated by default as if it were a PMID  Therefore  any reference in PubMed can be located using the PMID 

Alternative interfaces edit 
MEDLINE is one of the databases which are accessible via PubMed  Several companies provide access to MEDLINE through their platforms 
The National Library of Medicine leases the MEDLINE information to a number of private vendors such as Embase  Ovid  Dialog  EBSCO  Knowledge Finder and many other commercial  non commercial  and academic providers              As of October               update       more than     licenses had been issued  more than     of them to providers outside the United States  As licenses to use MEDLINE data are available for free  the NLM in effect provides a free testing ground for a wide range             of alternative interfaces and  rd party additions to PubMed  one of a very few large  professionally curated databases which offers this option 
Lu identifies a sample of    current and free Web based PubMed versions  requiring no installation or registration  which are grouped into four categories             

Ranking search results  for instance  eTBLAST  MedlineRanker              MiSearch             
Clustering results by topics  authors  journals etc   for instance  Anne O Tate              ClusterMed             
Enhancing semantics and visualization  for instance  EBIMed              MedEvi             
Improved search interface and retrieval experience  for instance  askMEDLINE                         BabelMeSH              and PubCrawler             
As most of these and other alternatives rely essentially on PubMed MEDLINE data leased under license from the NLM PubMed  the term  PubMed derivatives  has been suggested              Without the need to store about         GB of original PubMed Datasets  anybody can write PubMed applications using the eutils application program interface as described in  The E utilities In Depth  Parameters  Syntax and More   by Eric Sayers  PhD              Various citation format generators  taking PMID numbers as input  are examples of web applications making use of the eutils application program interface  Sample web pages include Citation Generator   Mick Schroeder  Pubmed Citation Generator   Ultrasound of the Week  PMID cite  and Cite this for me 

Data mining of PubMed edit 
Alternative methods to mine the data in PubMed use programming environments such as Matlab  Python or R  In these cases  queries of PubMed are written as lines of code and passed to PubMed and the response is then processed directly in the programming environment   Code can be automated to systematically query with different keywords such as disease  year  organs  etc  
For bulk processing  the full PubMed database is available as XML which can be downloaded from an FTP server  The annual baseline is released in December  followed by daily update files              
In addition to its traditional role as a biomedical database  PubMed has become common resource for training biomedical language models             
The data accessible by PubMed can be mirrored locally using an unofficial tool such as MEDOC             
Millions of PubMed records augment various open data datasets about open access  like Unpaywall  Data analysis tools like Unpaywall Journals are used by libraries to assist with big deal cancellations  libraries can avoid subscriptions for materials already served by instant open access via open archives like PubMed Central
