Early life edit 
Philip K  Dick  c        age    
Dick and his twin sister  Jane Charlotte Dick  were born six weeks prematurely on December           in Chicago  Illinois  to Dorothy  n e Kindred             and Joseph Edgar Dick              who worked for the United States Department of Agriculture                          His paternal grandparents were Irish              Jane s death on January           six weeks after their birth  profoundly affected Philip s life  leading to the recurrent motif of the  phantom twin  in his books             
Dick s family later moved to the San Francisco Bay Area  When he was five  his father was transferred to Reno  Nevada  and when Dorothy refused to move  she and Joseph divorced  Both fought for custody of Philip  which was awarded to Dorothy  Determined to raise Philip alone  she took a job in Washington  D C   and moved there with her son  Philip was enrolled at John Eaton Elementary School              completing the second through fourth grades  His lowest grade was a  C  in Written Composition  although a teacher said he  shows interest and ability in story telling   He was educated in Quaker schools              In June       Dorothy and Philip returned to California  and it was around this time that he became interested in science fiction              Dick stated that he read his first science fiction magazine  Stirring Science Stories  in                  
Dick attended Berkeley High School in Berkeley  California  He and fellow science fiction author Ursula K  Le Guin were members of the class of      but did not know each other at the time  He claimed to have hosted a classical music program on KSMO Radio in                   From      to       he worked at Art Music Company  a record store on Telegraph Avenue 
He attended the University of California  Berkeley from September      to November           ultimately receiving an honorable dismissal dated January          He did not declare a major and took classes in history  psychology  philosophy  and zoology  Dick dropped out because of ongoing anxiety problems  according to his third wife Anne s memoir  She also says he disliked the mandatory ROTC training  At Berkeley  he befriended poet Robert Duncan and poet and linguist Jack Spicer  who gave Dick ideas for a Martian language 
Through his studies in philosophy  he believed that existence is based on internal human perception  which does not necessarily correspond to external reality  He described himself as  an acosmic panentheist   which he explained as meaning that  I don t believe that the universe exists  I believe that the only thing that exists is God and he is more than the universe  The universe is an extension of God into space and time  That s the premise I start from in my work  that so called  reality  is a mass delusion that we ve all been required to believe for reasons totally obscure               After reading the works of Plato and pondering the possibilities of metaphysical realms  he came to the conclusion that  in a certain sense  the world is not entirely real and there is no way to confirm whether it is truly there  That question was a theme in many of his novels 


Career edit 
Early writing edit 

Dick s novelette  The Defenders  was the cover story for the January      issue of Galaxy Science Fiction  illustrated by Ed Emshwiller 
Dick s short story  The World She Wanted  took the cover of the May      issue of Science Fiction Quarterly 
Dick s novel The Cosmic Puppets originally appeared in the December      issue of Satellite Science Fiction as  A Glass of Darkness  

Dick sold his first story   Roog  about  a dog who imagined that the garbagemen who came every Friday morning were stealing valuable food which the family had carefully stored away in a safe metal container              in       when he was     From then on he wrote full time  During       his first speculative fiction publications appeared in July and September numbers of Planet Stories  edited by Jack O Sullivan  and in If and The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction that year              His debut novel  Solar Lottery  was published in      as half of Ace Double  D     alongside The Big Jump by Leigh Brackett              The     s were a difficult and impoverished time for Dick  who once lamented   We couldn t even pay the late fees on a library book   He published almost exclusively within the science fiction genre but dreamed of a career in mainstream fiction              During the     s  he produced a series of non genre  relatively conventional novels             
In       Dick wrote that he was willing to  take twenty to thirty years to succeed as a literary writer   The dream of mainstream success formally died in January      when the Scott Meredith Literary Agency returned all of his unsold mainstream novels  Only one of them  Confessions of a Crap Artist  was published during Dick s lifetime              in      by Paul Williams  Entwhistle Books 
In      Dick won the Hugo Award for The Man in the High Castle             Although he was hailed as a genius in the science fiction world  the mainstream literary world was unappreciative  and he could publish books only through low paying science fiction publishers such as Ace  He said in a      interview that were it not for interest by a French publishing company in the mid     s  which decided to publish all of his catalog to date  he would not have been able to continue as a writer              But even in his later years  he continued to have financial troubles  In the introduction to the      short story collection  The Golden Man  he wrote 

 Several years ago  when I was ill  Heinlein offered his help  anything he could do  and we had never met  he would phone me to cheer me up and see how I was doing  He wanted to buy me an electric typewriter  God bless him one of the few true gentlemen in this world  I don t agree with any ideas he puts forth in his writing  but that is neither here nor there  One time when I owed the IRS a lot of money and couldn t raise it  Heinlein loaned the money to me  I think a great deal of him and his wife  I dedicated a book to them in appreciation  Robert Heinlein is a fine looking man  very impressive and very military in stance  you can tell he has a military background  even to the haircut  He knows I m a flipped out freak and still he helped me and my wife when we were in trouble  That is the best in humanity  there  that is who and what I love              
Flight to Canada  mental health and suicide attempt edit 
In       Dick s marriage to Nancy Hackett broke down  and she moved out of their house in Santa Venetia  California  He had abused amphetamine for much of the previous decade  stemming in part from his need to maintain a prolific writing regimen due to the financial exigencies of the science fiction field  He allowed other drug users to move into the house  Following the release of    novels between      and       these developments were exacerbated by unprecedented periods of writer s block  with Dick ultimately failing to publish new fiction until                  
One day  in November       Dick returned to his home to discover it had been burglarized  with his safe blown open and personal papers missing  The police could not determine the culprit  and even suspected Dick of having done it himself              Shortly thereafter  he was invited to be guest of honor at the Vancouver Science Fiction Convention in February       Within a day of arriving at the conference and giving his speech  The Android and the Human  he informed people that he had fallen in love with a woman named Janis whom he had met there and announced that he would be remaining in Vancouver              A conference attendee  Michael Walsh  movie critic for the local newspaper The Province  invited Dick to stay in his home  but asked him to leave two weeks later due to his erratic behavior  Janis then ended their relationship and moved away  On March           Dick attempted suicide by taking an overdose of the sedative potassium bromide              Subsequently  after deciding to seek help  Dick became a participant in X Kalay  a Canadian Synanon type recovery program   and was well enough by April to return to California              In October       Dick wrote a letter to the FBI about science fiction writer Thomas Disch  Dick said he had been approached by a covert Anti American organization which attempted to recruit him  Dick said he recognized their ideology in a book Disch wrote                         
On relocating to Orange County  California at the behest of California State University  Fullerton professor Willis McNelly  who initiated a correspondence with Dick during his X Kalay stint   he donated manuscripts  papers and other materials to the university s Special Collections Library  where they are in the Philip K  Dick Science Fiction Collection in the Pollak Library  During this period  Dick befriended a circle of Fullerton State students that included several aspiring science fiction writers  including K  W  Jeter  James Blaylock and Tim Powers  Jeter would later continue Dick s Bladerunner series with three sequels                                     
Dick returned to the events of these months while writing his novel A Scanner Darkly                     which contains fictionalized depictions of the burglary of his home  his time using amphetamines and living with addicts  and his experiences of X Kalay  portrayed in the novel as  New Path    A factual account of his recovery program participation was portrayed in his posthumously released book The Dark Haired Girl  a collection of letters and journals from the period      citation needed     

Paranormal experiences edit 
On February           while recovering from the effects of sodium pentothal administered for the extraction of an impacted wisdom tooth  Dick received a home delivery of Darvon from a young woman  When he opened the door  he was struck by the dark haired girl s beauty  and was especially drawn to her golden necklace  He asked her about its curious fish shaped design  As she was leaving  she replied   This is a sign used by the early Christians   Dick called the symbol the  vesicle pisces   This name seems to have been based on his conflation of two related symbols  the Christian ichthys symbol  two intersecting arcs delineating a fish in profile   which the woman was wearing  and the vesica piscis             
Dick recounted that as the sun glinted off the gold pendant  the reflection caused the generation of a  pink beam  of light that mesmerized him  He came to believe the beam imparted wisdom and clairvoyance  and also believed it to be intelligent  On one occasion  he was startled by a separate recurrence of the pink beam  which imparted the information that his infant son was ill  The Dicks rushed the child to the hospital  where the illness was confirmed by professional diagnosis                  verification needed     

After the woman s departure  Dick began experiencing strange hallucinations  Although initially attributing them to side effects from medication  he considered this explanation implausible after weeks of continued hallucination  He told Charles Platt   I experienced an invasion of my mind by a transcendentally rational mind  as if I had been insane all my life and suddenly I had become sane              
Throughout February and March       Dick experienced a series of hallucinations which he referred to as                                   shorthand for February March       Aside from the  pink beam   he described the initial hallucinations as geometric patterns  and  occasionally  brief pictures of Jesus and ancient Rome  As the hallucinations increased in duration and frequency  Dick claimed he began to live two parallel lives one as himself   Philip K  Dick   and one as  Thomas               a Christian persecuted by Romans in the first century AD  He referred to the  transcendentally rational mind  as  Zebra    God  and  VALIS   an acronym for Vast Active Living Intelligence System   He wrote about the experiences  first in the semi autobiographical novel Radio Free Albemuth  then in VALIS  The Divine Invasion  The Transmigration of Timothy Archer and the unfinished The Owl in Daylight  the VALIS trilogy       citation needed     
In       Dick wrote a letter to the FBI  accusing various people  including University of California  San Diego professor Fredric Jameson  of being foreign agents of Warsaw Pact powers              He also wrote that Stanis aw Lem was probably a false name used by a composite committee operating on orders of the Communist party to gain control over public opinion             
At one point  Dick felt he had been taken over by the spirit of the prophet Elijah  He believed that an episode in his novel Flow My Tears  the Policeman Said was a detailed retelling of a biblical story from the Book of Acts  which he had never read              He documented and discussed his experiences and faith in a private journal he called his  exegesis   portions of which were later published as The Exegesis of Philip K  Dick  The last novel he wrote was The Transmigration of Timothy Archer  it was published shortly after his death in

Early in life  Dick attended Communist Party USA meetings but later shifted more towards anti communism and libertarianism as time passed  In an interview  Dick once described himself as a  religious anarchist               Dick generally tried to stay out of the political scene because of high societal turmoil from the Vietnam War  Still  he showed some anti Vietnam War and anti governmental sentiments  In       he joined the  Writers and Editors War Tax Protest                           an anti war pledge to pay no U S  federal income tax  which resulted in the confiscation of his car by the IRS             
Dick was a critic of the U S  federal government  regarding it to be just as  bad as the Soviet Union   and cheered on  a great decentralization of the government   Dick s politics occasionally influenced his literature  Dick s      short story  Faith of Our Fathers  is critical of communism  Dick s      novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep  condemns the eugenics movement              In       as a response to the Roe v  Wade decision  Dick published  The Pre persons   a satirical anti abortion and anti Malthusianism short story  Following the story s publication  Dick stated that he received death threats from feminists             

Death edit 
On February                after completing an interview  Dick contacted his therapist  complaining of failing eyesight  and was advised to go to a hospital immediately  but did not  The following day  he was found unconscious on the floor of his Santa Ana  California  home  having suffered a stroke  On February                Dick suffered another stroke in the hospital  which led to brain death  Five days later  on March               he was disconnected from life support 
After his death  Dick s father  Joseph  took his son s ashes to Riverside Cemetery in Fort Morgan  Colorado  section      K  block         lot           where they were buried next to his twin sister Jane  who died in infancy  Her tombstone had been inscribed with both of their names at the time of her death          years earlier                          Philip died four months before the release of Blade Runner  the film based on his novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep             

Style and works edit 
Themes edit 
Dick s stories typically focus on the fragile nature of what is real and the construction of personal identity  His stories often become surreal fantasies  as the main characters slowly discover that their everyday world is actually an illusion assembled by powerful external entities  such as the suspended animation in Ubik              vast political conspiracies or the vicissitudes of an unreliable narrator   All of his work starts with the basic assumption that there cannot be one  single  objective reality   writes science fiction author Charles Platt   Everything is a matter of perception  The ground is liable to shift under your feet  A protagonist may find himself living out another person s dream  or he may enter a drug induced state that actually makes better sense than the real world  or he may cross into a different universe completely              
Alternate universes and simulacra are common plot devices  with fictional worlds inhabited by common  working people  rather than galactic elites   There are no heroes in Dick s books   Ursula K  Le Guin wrote   but there are heroics  One is reminded of Dickens  what counts is the honesty  constancy  kindness and patience of ordinary people               Dick made no secret that much of his thinking and work was heavily influenced by the writings of Carl Jung                          The Jungian constructs and models that most concerned Dick seem to be the archetypes of the collective unconscious  group projection hallucination  synchronicities  and personality theory              Many of Dick s protagonists overtly analyze reality and their perceptions in Jungian terms  see Lies  Inc        citation needed     
Dick identified one major theme of his work as the question   What constitutes the authentic human being               In works such as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep   beings can appear totally human in every respect while lacking soul or compassion  while completely alien beings such as Glimmung in Galactic Pot Healer may be more humane and complex than their human peers  Understood correctly  said Dick  the term  human being  applies  not to origin or to any ontology but to a way of being in the world               This authentic way of being manifests itself in compassion that recognizes the oneness of all life   In Dick s vision  the moral imperative calls on us to care for all sentient beings  human or nonhuman  natural or artificial  regardless of their place in the order of things  And Dick makes clear that this imperative is grounded in empathy  not reason  whatever subsequent role reason may play               The figure of the android depicts those who are deficient in empathy  who are alienated from others and are becoming more mechanical  emotionless  in their behaviour   In general  then  it can be said that for Dick robots represent machines that are becoming more like humans  while androids represent humans that are becoming more like machines              



Dick s third major theme is his fascination with war and his fear and hatred of it  One hardly sees critical mention of it  yet it is as integral to his body of work as oxygen is to water

Mental illness was a constant interest of Dick s  and themes of mental illness permeate his work  The character Jack Bohlen in the      novel Martian Time Slip is an  ex schizophrenic   The novel Clans of the Alphane Moon centers on an entire society made up of descendants of lunatic asylum inmates  In       he wrote the essay titled  Schizophrenia and the Book of Changes              
Drug use  including religious  recreational  and abuse  was also a theme in many of Dick s works  such as A Scanner Darkly and The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch              Dick himself was a drug user for much of his life  According to a      interview in Rolling Stone              Dick wrote all of his books published before      while on amphetamines   A Scanner Darkly        was the first complete novel I had written without speed   said Dick in the interview  He also experimented briefly with psychedelics  but wrote The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch         which Rolling Stone dubs  the classic LSD novel of all time   before he had ever tried them  Despite his heavy amphetamine use  however  Dick later said that doctors told him the amphetamines never actually affected him  that his liver had processed them before they reached his brain             
Summing up all these themes in Understanding Philip K  Dick  Eric Carl Link discussed eight themes or  ideas and motifs                                    Epistemology and the Nature of Reality  Know Thyself  The Android and the Human  Entropy and Pot Healing  The Theodicy Problem  Warfare and Power Politics  The Evolved Human  and  Technology  Media  Drugs and Madness                                       

Pen names edit 
Dick had two professional stories published under the pen names Richard Phillipps and Jack Dowland   Some Kinds of Life  was published in October      in Fantastic Universe under byline Richard Phillipps  apparently because the magazine had a policy against publishing multiple stories by the same author in the same issue   Planet for Transients  was published in the same issue under his own name             
The short story  Orpheus with Clay Feet  was published under the pen name Jack Dowland  The protagonist desires to be the muse for fictional author Jack Dowland  considered the greatest science fiction author of the   th century  In the story  Dowland publishes a short story titled  Orpheus with Clay Feet  under the pen name Philip K  Dick      citation needed     
The surname Dowland refers to Renaissance composer John Dowland  who is featured in several works  The title Flow My Tears  the Policeman Said directly refers to Dowland s best known composition   Flow  my tears   In the novel The Divine Invasion  the character Linda Fox  created specifically with Linda Ronstadt in mind  is an intergalactically famous singer whose entire body of work consists of recordings of John Dowland compositions      citation needed     

Selected works edit 
For a complete bibliography  see Philip K  Dick bibliography 
The Man in the High Castle        is set in an alternative history in which the United States is ruled by the victorious Axis powers  It is the only Dick novel to win a Hugo Award  In      this was adapted into a television series by Amazon Studios

VALIS        is perhaps Dick s most postmodern and autobiographical novel  examining his own unexplained experiences  It may also be his most academically studied work  and was adapted as an opera by Tod Machover              Later works like the VALIS trilogy were heavily autobiographical  many with  two three seventy four           references and influences  The word VALIS is the acronym for Vast Active Living Intelligence System  Later  Dick theorized that VALIS was both a  reality generator  and a means of extraterrestrial communication  A fourth VALIS manuscript  Radio Free Albemuth  although composed in       was posthumously published in       This work is described by the publisher  Arbor House  as  an introduction and key to his magnificent VALIS trilogy              
Regardless of the feeling that he was somehow experiencing a divine communication  Dick was never fully able to rationalize the events  For the rest of his life  he struggled to comprehend what was occurring  questioning his own sanity and perception of reality  He transcribed what thoughts he could into an eight thousand page  one million word journal dubbed the Exegesis  From      until his death in       Dick spent many nights writing in this journal  A recurring theme in Exegesis is Dick s hypothesis that history had been stopped in the first century AD  and that  the Empire never ended   He saw Rome as the pinnacle of materialism and despotism  which  after forcing the Gnostics underground  had kept the population of Earth enslaved to worldly possessions  Dick believed that VALIS had communicated with him  and anonymously others  to induce the impeachment of U S  President Richard Nixon  whom Dick believed to be the current Emperor of Rome incarnate

Contemporary philosophy edit 
Postmodernists such as Jean Baudrillard and Laurence Rickels have commented on Dick s writing s foreshadowing of postmodernity               Jean Baudrillard offers this interpretation 

 It is hyperreal  It is a universe of simulation  which is something altogether different  And this is so not because Dick speaks specifically of simulacra  SF has always done so  but it has always played upon the double  on artificial replication or imaginary duplication  whereas here the double has disappeared  There is no more double  one is always already in the other world  an other world which is not another  without mirrors or projection or utopias as means for reflection  The simulation is impassable  unsurpassable  checkmated  without exteriority  We can no longer move  through the mirror  to the other side  as we could during the golden age of transcendence               

Dick s anti government skepticism was referred to in Mythmakers and Lawbreakers  a collection of interviews about fiction by anarchist authors  Noting his early authorship of The Last of the Masters  an anarchist themed novelette  author Margaret Killjoy expressed that while Dick never fully sided with anarchism  his opposition to government centralization and organized religion has influenced anarchist interpretations of gnosticism
