Inferences are steps in logical reasoning  moving from premises to logical consequences  etymologically  the word infer means to  carry forward   Inference is theoretically traditionally divided into deduction and induction  a distinction that in Europe dates at least to Aristotle     s BCE   Deduction is inference deriving logical conclusions from premises known or assumed to be true  with the laws of valid inference being studied in logic  Induction is inference from particular evidence to a universal conclusion  A third type of inference is sometimes distinguished  notably by Charles Sanders Peirce  contradistinguishing abduction from induction 
Various fields study how inference is done in practice  Human inference  i e  how humans draw conclusions  is traditionally studied within the fields of logic  argumentation studies  and cognitive psychology  artificial intelligence researchers develop automated inference systems to emulate human inference  Statistical inference uses mathematics to draw conclusions in the presence of uncertainty  This generalizes deterministic reasoning  with the absence of uncertainty as a special case  Statistical inference uses quantitative or qualitative  categorical  data which may be subject to random variations 


Definition edit 
The process by which a conclusion is inferred from multiple observations is called inductive reasoning  The conclusion may be correct or incorrect  or correct to within a certain degree of accuracy  or correct in certain situations  Conclusions inferred from multiple observations may be tested by additional observations 
This definition is disputable  due to its lack of clarity  Ref  Oxford English dictionary   induction        Logic the inference of a general law from particular instances        clarification needed       The definition given thus applies only when the  conclusion  is general 
Two possible definitions of  inference  are 

A conclusion reached on the basis of evidence and reasoning 
The process of reaching such a conclusion 
Examples edit 
Example for definition    edit 
Ancient Greek philosophers defined a number of syllogisms  correct three part inferences  that can be used as building blocks for more complex reasoning  We begin with a famous example 

All humans are mortal 
All Greeks are humans 
All Greeks are mortal 
The reader can check that the premises and conclusion are true  but logic is concerned with inference  does the truth of the conclusion follow from that of the premises 
The validity of an inference depends on the form of the inference  That is  the word  valid  does not refer to the truth of the premises or the conclusion  but rather to the form of the inference  An inference can be valid even if the parts are false  and can be invalid even if some parts are true  But a valid form with true premises will always have a true conclusion 
For example  consider the form of the following symbological track 

All meat comes from animals 
All beef is meat 
Therefore  all beef comes from animals 
If the premises are true  then the conclusion is necessarily true  too 
Now we turn to an invalid form 

All A are B 
All C are B 
Therefore  all C are A 
To show that this form is invalid  we demonstrate how it can lead from true premises to a false conclusion 

All apples are fruit   True 
All bananas are fruit   True 
Therefore  all bananas are apples   False 
A valid argument with a false premise may lead to a false conclusion   this and the following examples do not follow the Greek syllogism  

All tall people are French   False 
John Lennon was tall   True 
Therefore  John Lennon was French   False 
When a valid argument is used to derive a false conclusion from a false premise  the inference is valid because it follows the form of a correct inference 
A valid argument can also be used to derive a true conclusion from a false premise 

All tall people are musicians   Valid  False 
John Lennon was tall   Valid  True 
Therefore  John Lennon was a musician   Valid  True 
In this case we have one false premise and one true premise where a true conclusion has been inferred 

Example for definition    edit 
Evidence  It is the early     s and you are an American stationed in the Soviet Union  You read in the Moscow newspaper that a soccer team from a small city in Siberia starts winning game after game  The team even defeats the Moscow team  Inference  The small city in Siberia is not a small city anymore  The Soviets are working on their own nuclear or high value secret weapons program 
Knowns  The Soviet Union is a command economy  people and material are told where to go and what to do  The small city was remote and historically had never distinguished itself  its soccer season was typically short because of the weather 
Explanation  In a command economy  people and material are moved where they are needed  Large cities might field good teams due to the greater availability of high quality players  and teams that can practice longer  possibly due to sunnier weather and better facilities  can reasonably be expected to be better  In addition  you put your best and brightest in places where they can do the most good such as on high value weapons programs  It is an anomaly for a small city to field such a good team  The anomaly indirectly described a condition by which the observer inferred a new meaningful pattern that the small city was no longer small  Why would you put a large city of your best and brightest in the middle of nowhere  To hide them  of course 

Incorrect inference edit 
An incorrect inference is known as a fallacy  Philosophers who study informal logic have compiled large lists of them  and cognitive psychologists have documented many biases in human reasoning that favor incorrect reasoning 

Applications edit 
Inference engines edit 
Main articles  Reasoning system  Inference engine  expert system  and business rule engine
AI systems first provided automated logical inference and these were once extremely popular research topics  leading to industrial applications under the form of expert systems and later business rule engines  More recent work on automated theorem proving has had a stronger
basis in formal logic 
An inference system s job is to extend a knowledge base automatically  The knowledge base  KB  is a set of propositions that represent what the system knows about the world  Several techniques can be used by that system to extend KB by means of valid inferences  An additional requirement is that the conclusions the system arrives at are relevant to its task 
Additionally  the term  inference  has also been applied to the process of generating predictions from trained neural networks  In this context  an  inference engine  refers to the system or hardware performing these operations  This type of inference is widely used in applications ranging from image recognition to natural language processing 

Prolog engine edit 
Prolog  for  Programming in Logic   is a programming language based on a subset of predicate calculus  Its main job is to check whether a certain proposition can be inferred from a KB  knowledge base  using an algorithm called backward chaining 
Let us return to our Socrates syllogism  We enter into our Knowledge Base the following piece of code 

mortal X          	man X  
man socrates   

  Here    can be read as  if   Generally  if P 
  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  to  
  
 Q  if P then Q  then in Prolog we would code Q  P  Q if P   
This states that all men are mortal and that Socrates is a man  Now we can ask the Prolog system about Socrates 

   mortal socrates  

 where    signifies a query  Can mortal socrates   be deduced from the KB using the rules 
gives the answer  Yes  
On the other hand  asking the Prolog system the following 

   mortal plato  

gives the answer  No  
This is because Prolog does not know anything about Plato  and hence defaults to any property about Plato being false  the so called closed world assumption   Finally
   mortal X   Is anything mortal  would result in  Yes   and in some implementations   Yes   X socrates 
Prolog can be used for vastly more complicated inference tasks  See the corresponding article for further examples 

Semantic web edit 
Recently automatic reasoners found in semantic web a new field of application  Being based upon description logic  knowledge expressed using one variant of OWL can be logically processed  i e   inferences can be made upon it 

Bayesian statistics and probability logic edit 
Main article  Bayesian inference
Philosophers and scientists who follow the Bayesian framework for inference use the mathematical rules of probability to find this best explanation  The Bayesian view has a number of desirable features one of them is that it embeds deductive  certain  logic as a subset  this prompts some writers to call Bayesian probability  probability logic   following E  T  Jaynes  
Bayesians identify probabilities with degrees of beliefs  with certainly true propositions having probability    and certainly false propositions having probability    To say that  it s going to rain tomorrow  has a     probability is to say that you consider the possibility of rain tomorrow as extremely likely 
Through the rules of probability  the probability of a conclusion and of alternatives can be calculated  The best explanation is most often identified with the most probable  see Bayesian decision theory   A central rule of Bayesian inference is Bayes  theorem 

Fuzzy logic edit

Non monotonic logic edit 
Main article  Non monotonic logic           
A relation of inference is monotonic if the addition of premises does not undermine previously reached conclusions  otherwise the relation is non monotonic 
Deductive inference is monotonic  if a conclusion is reached on the basis of a certain set of premises  then that conclusion still holds if more premises are added 
By contrast  everyday reasoning is mostly non monotonic because it involves risk  we jump to conclusions from deductively insufficient premises 
We know when it is worth or even necessary  e g  in medical diagnosis  to take the risk  Yet we are also aware that such inference is defeasible that new information may undermine old conclusions  Various kinds of defeasible but remarkably successful inference have traditionally captured the attention of philosophers  theories of induction  Peirce s theory of abduction  inference to the best explanation  etc    More recently logicians have begun to approach the phenomenon from a formal point of view  The result is a large body of theories at the interface of philosophy  logic and artificial intelligence
