							Egyptians abroad began casting their votes in the      parliamentary elections in over     countries Saturday  Elections abroad will continue on Sunday 
Voter turnout was rather low Saturday morning  slightly increasing throughout the day  according to several reports by representatives of Egyptian communities abroad 
Head of the Egyptians Abroad Union in Saudi Arabia  Emam Youssef  told Daily News Egypt that  Islamists  supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and the Salafist party began rallying in front of the polling station in Riyadh   We called the police which arrested them  but another group emerged   Youssef said 
A large Egyptian community resides in Saudi Arabia  but Youssef said that participation was lower than expected due to several reasons  on top of which the lack of polling stations   People here have to travel really long distances up to     and       km to reach the capital Riyadh or the consulate in Jeddah   he explained 
Youssef estimated the number of Egyptians in Saudi Arabia to be close to two million      of which are eligible for voting  In his opinion  previous electoral events such as the constitutional referendum and presidential elections saw more participation 
 We don t know most of the candidates  especially those running for seats aimed at representing Egyptians abroad inside the parliament   Youssef stated  He added that people have been following Egyptian satellite channels 
 Fi Hob Misr list headed by Sameh Seif El Yazal promoted themselves as  undefeatable and winners because they are supported by the state  despite the president saying he would stand at a distance from all candidates  and this has affected voters  opinion of the elections   Youssef said 
Howeida Ahmed  an Egyptian Arabic teacher living in Saudi Arabia  stressed on her permanent contact with her homeland which helped her to choose the right candidate in parliamentary elections 
 Despite living in Jeddah  I have never lost contact with my family and friends back home  so I asked them about the candidates and I researched their backgrounds before voting         said Ahmed  She added that she really hopes the chosen candidates will work hard to solve problems facing Egyptian expatriates 
Meanwhile  participation was much higher in Kuwait  according to Youssef 
In Europe  Saturday is a working day  According to Hany Shenouda  a senior representative of the Egyptian community in France  it is expected that more participants will take part in the elections on Sunday 
 Today is a cold day in Paris  and the weekend starts tomorrow  For those reasons  participation was rather low   Shenouda told Daily News Egypt on Saturday  He added that the embassy had properly organised itself for the elections with the presence of a diplomatic mission from Egypt 
 The French police was also present   he said  Asked about voters  awareness  Shenouda gave a rather pleasant image by stating that  Egyptians know whom to vote for and how to cast their votes  They have done their research by following the media  researched the Internet and discussed with friends and families  
Nonetheless  he pointed out that voters knew more about the lists than individual candidates  Shenouda said the Egyptian community in France was about         and that there was another polling station in Marseille 
Meanwhile  Ghada Agamy  a candidate in the  Fi Hob Misr  lists in the UAE  said that participation in the elections had been low but that it was expected to increase in the afternoon  after the provision of buses to take voters to the polling station 
Both Shenouda and Agamy confirmed that electoral advertisement abroad was forbidden   I took permission to hold a public conference recently  but other than that posters and similar things we see in Egypt are forbidden   Agamy told Daily News Egypt 
Shenouda denied any anti Egyptian government protests at the time he spoke with Daily News  while Agamy insisted that this was partly the reason why electoral campaigning was prohibited   We cannot have rallies and chant in a way that would disrupt public order in another country   Agamy stated 
She said she depended more on the Internet and personal meetings to communicate with voters   I have lived abroad for over    years and I targeted community leaders of different categories of people such as teachers  businessmen  and so on  and they would spread the word to the rest   she said 
However  she admitted that she was able to have a limited number of T shirts printed with the name and logo of her list   because both could be used in a broader meaning to promote Egypt in general  as if they were encouraging tourism for instance  
However  she said that  up to this moment  she was still facing the issue of voters not being fully aware of the procedures   These elections are different than the referendum on the constitution and presidential elections because they require that the voter makes extra effort in finding out who the candidates are  especially those that have been away for a long period of time and do not know most of them  
Fawzya Khaleel  one of Al Nour Party candidates for the eight seats representing Egyptians abroad spoke about how she promotes her candidacy   Any propaganda abroad is banned by the law   Khaleel said   We only depend on the word of mouth to market our list outside Egypt  
Meanwhile  unconfirmed information emerged about the actual location of candidates running under the category of Egyptians abroad  suggesting some were actually staying in Egypt  Khaleel said   It was not a requirement from the candidate to be working abroad  however there must be proof of residence abroad  
Candidates abroad don t have to completely move to Egypt to attend all parliament sessions   We only have to attend sessions that discuss any laws related to Egyptians abroad   said Khaleel 
But Agamy said that the law stipulated that a candidate running for seats designated for Egyptians living abroad should have lived in that country for at least ten years and continue to be a resident in it   But in the end  the responsibility falls on voters  They can research the candidate s name and decide if he is suitable for the representation or not   Agamy concluded 
Despite their different countries and locations within countries  Egyptians abroad agreed they have never seen any kind of advocacy or promotion for candidates and their programmes  They also said they did not receive information from the embassy or alerts  However  they had different reasons behind their participation or boycott 
A TV producer based in the UAE  Khabab  told Daily News Egypt he did not even know the exact dates of the elections   I also do not know the candidates or their programmes  Whoever wants to follow the elections news  watches the Egyptian TV channels   he said 
An Egyptian journalist in the UAE  Marina Makary  said she was scheduled to vote in the second electoral phase in November   But most likely  I will not vote anyway  I do not even know who is running and I do not think they will make any difference than the previous parliament  so why should I vote  I would rather vote when I feel like my vote could make a difference   she said 
Abdelhalim Abdullah  another resident of the UAE  said he made his choice according to his political views meaning that instead of looking at which candidates could represent him  he voted for some he believes are not aligned with the current regime and  might create an opposition bloc in the upcoming parliament  
 I also endorse having a political system as a step forward  However  there was no promotion for any of the candidates abroad  I just followed from the news that today is the voting  but never received anything from the embassy telling me to go vote or anything   Abdullah added 
Nouran  an Egyptian graduate student living in Denmark said she might vote just to see how it goes   I think it will represent Egyptians abroad if they go vote  However  the potential impact of the upcoming parliament depends mainly on the electoral process  voters  percentage  whether if it was fair and transparent and violations free   she said 
Finally  for Peter  who is an Egyptian worker living in the US  choosing from the lists was easier         Choosing from the lists is pretty easy  as it is not difficult to identify the list s background  but we face a huge problem when we try to choose for the individual seats   said Peter  He also added that he relies a lot on his friends in Egypt to inquire on the right candidates to vote for
