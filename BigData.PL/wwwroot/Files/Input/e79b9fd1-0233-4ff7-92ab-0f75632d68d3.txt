A programming language is a set of instructions and syntax used to create software programs  Some of the key features of programming languages include 

Syntax  The specific rules and structure used to write code in a programming language 
Data Types  The type of values that can be stored in a program  such as numbers  strings  and booleans 
Variables  Named memory locations that can store values 
Operators  Symbols used to perform operations on values  such as addition  subtraction  and comparison 
Control Structures  Statements used to control the flow of a program  such as if else statements  loops  and function calls 
Libraries and Frameworks  Collections of pre written code that can be used to perform common tasks and speed up development 
Paradigms  The programming style or philosophy used in the language  such as procedural  object oriented  or functional 

Examples of popular programming languages include Python  Java  C    JavaScript  and Ruby  Each language has its own strengths and weaknesses and is suited for different types of projects 
A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions for a computer to perform specific tasks  It       s used to write software programs and applications  and to control and manipulate computer systems  There are many different programming languages  each with its own syntax  structure  and set of commands  Some of the most commonly used programming languages include Java  Python  C    JavaScript  and C   The choice of programming language depends on the specific requirements of a project  including the platform being used  the intended audience  and the desired outcome  Programming languages continue to evolve and change over time  with new languages being developed and older ones being updated to meet changing needs 
Are you aiming to become a software engineer one day  Do you also want to develop a mobile application that people all over the world would love to use  Are you passionate enough to take the big step to enter the world of programming  Then you are in the right place because through this article you will get a brief introduction to programming  Now before we understand what programming is  you must know what is a computer  A computer is a device that can accept human instruction  processes it  and responds to it or a computer is a computational device that is used to process the data under the control of a computer program  Program is a sequence of instruction along with data  nbsp 
The basic components of a computer are  nbsp 

Input unit
Central Processing Unit CPU 
Output unit

The CPU is further divided into three parts  nbsp  nbsp 

Memory unit
Control unit
Arithmetic Logic unit

Most of us have heard that CPU is called the brain of our computer because it accepts data  provides temporary memory space to it until it is stored saved  on the hard disk  performs logical operations on it and hence processes here also means converts  data into information  We all know that a computer consists of hardware and software  Software is a set of programs that performs multiple tasks together  An operating system is also software  system software  that helps humans to interact with the computer system  nbsp A program is a set of instructions given to a computer to perform a specific operation  or computer is a computational device that is used to process the data under the control of a computer program  While executing the program  raw data is processed into the desired output format  These computer programs are written in a programming language which are high level languages  High level languages are nearly human languages that are more complex than the computer understandable language which are called machine language  or low level language  So after knowing the basics  we are ready to create a very simple and basic program  Like we have different languages to communicate with each other  likewise  we have different languages like C  C    C   Java  python  etc to communicate with the computers  The computer only understands binary language  the language of   s and   s  also called machine understandable language or low level language but the programs we are going to write are in a high level language which is almost similar to human language  nbsp The piece of code given below performs a basic task of printing  hello world  I am learning programming  on the console screen  We must know that keyboard  scanner  mouse  microphone  etc are various examples of input devices  and monitor console screen   printer  speaker  etc are examples of output devices  nbsp 
main  
  
 clrscr   
 printf  hello world  I am learning to program   
 getch   
   
At this stage  you might not be able to understand in depth how this code prints something on the screen  The main   is a standard function that you will always include in any program that you are going to create from now onwards  Note that the execution of the program starts from the main   function  The clrscr   function is used to see only the current output on the screen while the printf   function helps us to print the desired output on the screen  Also  getch   is a function that accepts any character input from the keyboard  In simple words  we need to press any key to continue some people may say that getch   helps in holding the screen to see the output   nbsp Between high level language and machine language  there are assembly languages also called symbolic machine code  Assembly languages are particularly computer architecture specific  Utility program  Assembler  is used to convert assembly code into executable machine code  High Level Programming Language is portable but requires Interpretation or compiling to convert it into a machine language that is computer understood  nbsp Hierarchy of Computer language         nbsp

Characteristics of a programming Language         nbsp 

A programming language must be simple  easy to learn and use  have good readability  and be human recognizable 
Abstraction is a must have Characteristics for a programming language in which the ability to define the complex structure and then its degree of usability comes 
A portable programming language is always preferred 
Programming language       s efficiency must be high so that it can be easily converted into a machine code and its execution consumes little space in memory 
A programming language should be well structured and documented so that it is suitable for application development 
Necessary tools for the development  debugging  testing  maintenance of a program must be provided by a programming language 
A programming language should provide a single environment known as Integrated Development Environment IDE  
A programming language must be consistent in terms of syntax and semantics 

Basic Terminologies  nbsp in Programming Languages

Increased Productivity  Programming languages provide a set of abstractions that allow developers to write code more quickly and efficiently 
Portability  Programs written in a high level programming language can run on many different operating systems and platforms 
Readability  Well designed programming languages can make code more readable and easier to understand for both the original author and other developers 
Large Community  Many programming languages have large communities of users and developers  which can provide support  libraries  and tools 

Disadvantages of programming languages 

Complexity  Some programming languages can be complex and difficult to learn  especially for beginners 
Performance  Programs written in high level programming languages can run slower than programs written in lower level languages 
Limited Functionality  Some programming languages may not have built in support for certain types of tasks or may require additional libraries to perform certain functions 
Fragmentation  There are many different programming languages  which can lead to fragmentation and make it difficult to share code and collaborate with other developers 

Tips for learning new programming language
