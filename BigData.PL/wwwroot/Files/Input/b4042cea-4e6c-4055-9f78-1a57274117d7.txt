Human rights are universally recognized moral principles or norms that establish standards of human behavior and are often protected by both national and international laws  These rights are considered inherent and inalienable  meaning they belong to every individual simply by virtue of being human  regardless of characteristics like nationality  ethnicity  religion  or socio economic status  They encompass a broad range of civil  political  economic  social  and cultural rights  such as the right to life  freedom of expression  protection against enslavement  and right to education 
The modern concept of human rights gained significant prominence after World War II  particularly in response to the atrocities of the Holocaust  leading to the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  UDHR  by the United Nations General Assembly in       This document outlined a comprehensive framework of rights that countries are encouraged to protect  setting a global standard for human dignity  freedom  and justice  The UDHR has since inspired numerous international treaties and national laws designed to promote and safeguard these rights globally 
While the principle of universal human rights is widely accepted  debates persist regarding which rights should take precedence  how they should be implemented  and their applicability in different cultural contexts  Criticisms often arise from perspectives like cultural relativism  which argue that individual human rights are inappropriate for societies that prioritise a communal or collectivist identity  and may conflict with certain cultural or traditional practices 
Nonetheless  human rights remain a central focus in international relations and legal frameworks  supported by institutions such as the United Nations  various non governmental organizations  and national bodies dedicated to monitoring and enforcing human rights standards worldwide 


History
Main article  History of human rightsThe United States Declaration of Independence  unanimously ratified by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia on   July     
Many of the basic ideas that animated the human rights movement developed in the aftermath of the Second World War and the events of the Holocaust             culminating in the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Paris by the United Nations General Assembly in                 
Ancient peoples did not have the same modern day conception of universal human rights             However  the concept has in some sense existed for centuries  although not in the same way as today                                             
The true forerunner of human rights discourse was the concept of natural rights  which first appeared as part of the medieval natural law tradition  It developed in new directions during the European Enlightenment with such philosophers as John Locke  Francis Hutcheson  and Jean Jacques Burlamaqui  and featured prominently in the political discourse of the American Revolution and the French Revolution             From this foundation  the modern human rights arguments emerged over the latter half of the   th century             possibly as a reaction to slavery  torture  genocide  and war crimes            
The medieval natural law tradition was heavily influenced by the writings of St Paul s early Christian thinkers such as St Hilary of Poitiers  St Ambrose  and St Augustine             Augustine was among the earliest to examine the legitimacy of the laws of man  and attempt to define the boundaries of what laws and rights occur naturally based on wisdom and conscience  instead of being arbitrarily imposed by mortals  and if people are obligated to obey laws that are unjust            
The Kouroukan Fouga was the constitution of the Mali Empire in West Africa  It was composed in the   th century  and was one of the very first charters on human rights  It included the  right to life and to the preservation of physical integrity  and significant protections for women                                               
Spanish scholasticism insisted on a subjective vision of law during the   th and   th centuries  Luis de Molina  Domingo de Soto and Francisco Vitoria  members of the School of Salamanca  defined law as a moral power over one s own  Although they maintained at the same time  the idea of law as an objective order  they stated that there are certain natural rights  mentioning both rights related to the body  right to life  to property  and to the spirit  right to freedom of thought  dignity   The jurist V zquez de Menchaca  starting from an individualist philosophy  was decisive in the dissemination of the term iura naturalia  This natural law thinking was supported by contact with American civilizations and the debate that took place in Castile about the just titles of the conquest and  in particular  the nature of the indigenous people  In the Castilian colonization of America  it is often stated  measures were applied in which the germs of the idea of Human Rights are present  debated in the well known Valladolid Debate that took place in      and       The thought of the School of Salamanca  especially through Francisco Vitoria  also contributed to the promotion of European natural law 
From this foundation  the modern human rights arguments emerged over the latter half of the   th century             Magna Carta is an English charter originally issued in      which influenced the development of the common law and many later constitutional documents related to human rights  such as the      English Bill of Rights  the      United States Constitution  and the      United States Bill of Rights             
  th century English philosopher John Locke discussed natural rights in his work  identifying them as being  life  liberty  and estate  property    and argued that such fundamental rights could not be surrendered in the social contract  In Britain in       the English Bill of Rights and the Scottish Claim of Right each made a range of oppressive governmental actions  illegal              Two major revolutions occurred during the   th century  in the United States        and in France         leading to the United States Declaration of Independence and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen respectively  both of which articulated certain human rights  Additionally  the Virginia Declaration of Rights of      encoded into law a number of fundamental civil rights and civil freedoms 

We hold these truths to be self evident  that all men are created equal  that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights  that among these are Life  Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness         United States Declaration of Independence      
     to World War I
Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen approved by the National Assembly of France     August     
Philosophers such as Thomas Paine  John Stuart Mill  and Hegel expanded on the theme of universality during the   th and   th centuries  In       William Lloyd Garrison wrote in a newspaper called The Liberator that he was trying to enlist his readers in  the great cause of human rights               so the term human rights probably came into use sometime between Paine s The Rights of Man and Garrison s publication  In      a contemporary  Henry David Thoreau  wrote about human rights in his treatise On the Duty of Civil Disobedience which was later influential on human rights and civil rights thinkers  United States Supreme Court Justice David Davis  in his      opinion for Ex Parte Milligan  wrote  By the protection of the law  human rights are secured  withdraw that protection and they are at the mercy of wicked rulers or the clamor of an excited people              
Many groups and movements have managed to achieve profound social changes over the course of the   th century in the name of human rights  In Western Europe and North America  labour unions brought about laws granting workers the right to strike  establishing minimum work conditions and forbidding or regulating child labour  The women s rights movement succeeded in gaining for many women the right to vote  National liberation movements in many countries succeeded in driving out colonial powers  One of the most influential was Mahatma Gandhi s leadership of the Indian independence movement  Movements by long oppressed racial and religious minorities succeeded in many parts of the world  among them the civil rights movement  and more recent diverse identity politics movements  on behalf of women and minorities in the United States             
The foundation of the International Committee of the Red Cross  the      Lieber Code and the first of the Geneva Conventions in      laid the foundations of International humanitarian law  to be further developed following the two World Wars 

Between World War I and World War II
The League of Nations was established in      at the negotiations over the Treaty of Versailles following the end of World War I  The League s goals included disarmament  preventing war through collective security  settling disputes between countries through negotiation  diplomacy and improving global welfare  Enshrined in its Charter was a mandate to promote many of the rights which were later included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  The League of Nations had mandates to support many of the former colonies of the Western European colonial powers during their transition from colony to independent state  Established as an agency of the League of Nations  and now part of United Nations  the International Labour Organization also had a mandate to promote and safeguard certain of the rights later included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  UDHR  

the primary goal of the ILO today is to promote opportunities for women and men to obtain decent and productive work  in conditions of freedom  equity  security and human dignity         Report by the Director General for the International Labour Conference   th Session
After World War II
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
Main article  Universal Declaration of Human Rights
 It is not a treaty     In the future  it  may well become the international Magna Carta               Eleanor Roosevelt with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in      
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights  UDHR  is a non binding declaration adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in                   partly in response to the events of World War II  The UDHR urges member states to promote a number of human  civil  economic and social rights  asserting these rights are part of the  foundation of freedom  justice and peace in the world   The declaration was the first international legal effort to limit the behavior of states and make sure they did their duties to their citizens following the model of the rights duty duality 

  recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom  justice and peace in the world        Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights      
The UDHR was framed by members of the Human Rights Commission  with Eleanor Roosevelt as chair  who began to discuss an International Bill of Rights in       The members of the Commission did not immediately agree on the form of such a bill of rights  and whether  or how  it should be enforced  The Commission proceeded to frame the UDHR and accompanying treaties  but the UDHR quickly became the priority              Canadian law professor John Humphrey and French lawyer Ren  Cassin were responsible for much of the cross national research and the structure of the document respectively  where the articles of the declaration were interpretative of the general principle of the preamble  The document was structured by Cassin to include the basic principles of dignity  liberty  equality and brotherhood in the first two articles  followed successively by rights pertaining to individuals  rights of individuals in relation to each other and to groups  spiritual  public and political rights  and economic  social and cultural rights  The final three articles place  according to Cassin  rights in the context of limits  duties and the social and political order in which they are to be realized              Humphrey and Cassin intended the rights in the UDHR to be legally enforceable through some means  as is reflected in the third clause of the preamble             

Whereas it is essential  if man is not to be compelled to have recourse  as a last resort  to rebellion against tyranny and oppression  that human rights should be protected by the rule of law         Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights      
Some of the UDHR was researched and written by a committee of international experts on human rights  including representatives from all continents and all major religions  and drawing on consultation with leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi              The inclusion of both civil and political rights and economic  social  and cultural rights was predicated on the assumption that basic human rights are indivisible and that the different types of rights listed are inextricably linked                          Although this principle was not opposed by any member states at the time of adoption  the declaration was adopted unanimously  with the abstention of the Soviet bloc  apartheid South Africa  and Saudi Arabia   this principle was later subject to significant challenges              On the issue of the term universal  the declarations did not apply to domestic discrimination or racism              Henry J  Richardson III argued             

All major governments at the time of drafting the U N  charter and the Universal declaration did their best to ensure  by all means known to domestic and international law  that these principles had only international application and carried no legal obligation on those governments to be implemented domestically  All tacitly realized that for their own discriminated against minorities to acquire leverage on the basis of legally being able to claim enforcement of these wide reaching rights would create pressures that would be political dynamite 
The onset of the Cold War soon after the UDHR was conceived brought to the fore divisions over the inclusion of both economic and social rights and civil and political rights in the declaration  Capitalist states tended to place strong emphasis on civil and political rights  such as freedom of association and expression   and were reluctant to include economic and social rights  such as the right to work and the right to join a union   Socialist states placed much greater importance on economic and social rights and argued strongly for their inclusion              Because of the divisions over which rights to include and because some states declined to ratify any treaties including certain specific interpretations of human rights  and despite the Soviet bloc and a number of developing countries arguing strongly for the inclusion of all rights in a Unity Resolution  the rights enshrined in the UDHR were split into two separate covenants  allowing states to adopt some rights and derogate others  Although this allowed the covenants to be created  it denied the proposed principle that all rights are linked  which was central to some interpretations of the UDHR                          Although the UDHR is a non binding resolution  it is now considered to be a central component of international customary law which may be invoked under appropriate circumstances by state judiciaries and other judiciaries             

Human Rights Treaties
In       the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  ICCPR  and the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights  ICESCR  were adopted by the United Nations  between them making the rights contained in the UDHR binding on all states      a      They came into force only in       when they were ratified by a sufficient number of countries  despite achieving the ICCPR  a covenant including no economic or social rights  the US only ratified the ICCPR in                    The ICESCR commits     state parties to work toward the granting of economic  social  and cultural rights  ESCR  to individuals 


Numerous other treaties  pieces of legislation  have been offered at the international level  They are generally known as human rights instruments  Some of the most significant are 

Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide  adopted       entry into force        unhchr ch

Including environmental rights
In      the United Nations Human Rights Council officially recognized  having a clean  healthy and sustainable environment  as a human right              In April       the European Court of Human Rights ruled  for the first time in history  that the Swiss government had violated human rights by not acting strongly enough to stop climate change             

Promotion strategies
Paradigms of implementation
Charles Beitz proposes a typology of six paradigms of action that agents  such as human rights agencies  international organizations  individual states  and NGOs  could use to enforce human rights      accountability      inducement      assistance      domestic contestation and engagement      compulsion  and     external adaptation             
Accountability refers to the process of examining and evaluating reports to ensure that states adhering to treaties are meeting their obligations  Inducement consists of the use of incentive systems  including the threat of sanctions  to deter violations and promote adherence to human rights standards  Assistance means providing support to societies that lack the resources or capabilities to meet human rights commitments  Domestic contestation and engagement refers to the notion that external actors can impact a state s behavior by participating in its internal political and social processes  Compulsion is the most extreme method of enforcing human rights through external action involves the use of coercive measures  External adaptation as a paradigm of implementation recognizes that human rights compliance may require not only domestic efforts but also reforming external factors like trade policies or international laws that hinder a government s ability to uphold rights             

Military force
See also  R p and Peacekeeping
Responsibility to protect refers to a doctrine for United Nations member states to intervene to protect populations from atrocities  It has been cited as justification in the use of recent military interventions  An example of an intervention that is often criticized is the      military intervention in the First Libyan Civil War by NATO and Qatar where the goal of preventing atrocities is alleged to have taken upon itself the broader mandate of removing the target government                         

Economic actions
See also  Economic sanctions
Economic sanctions are often levied upon individuals or states who commit human rights violations  Sanctions are often criticized for its feature of collective punishment in hurting a country s population economically in order dampen that population s view of its government                          It is also argued that  counterproductively  sanctions on offending authoritarian governments strengthen that government s position domestically as governments would still have more mechanisms to find funding than their critics and opposition  who become further weakened                         
The risk of human rights violations increases with the increase in financially vulnerable populations  Girls from poor families in non industrialized economies are often viewed as a financial burden on the family and marriage of young girls is often driven in the hope that daughters will be fed and protected by wealthier families              Female genital mutilation and force feeding of daughters is argued to be similarly driven in large part to increase their marriage prospects and thus their financial security by achieving certain idealized standards of beauty              In certain areas  girls requiring the experience of sexual initiation rites with men and passing sex training tests on girls are designed to make them more appealing as marriage prospects              Measures to help the economic status of vulnerable groups in order to reduce human rights violations include girls  education and guaranteed minimum incomes and conditional cash transfers  such as Bolsa familia which subsidize parents who keep children in school rather than contributing to family income  has successfully reduced child labor             

Informational strategies
See also  Human rights education and Activism
Human rights abuses are monitored by United Nations committees  national institutions and governments and by many independent non governmental organizations  such as Amnesty International  Human Rights Watch  World Organisation Against Torture  Freedom House  International Freedom of Expression Exchange and Anti Slavery International  These organisations collect evidence and documentation of human rights abuses and apply pressure to promote human rights  Educating people on the concept of human rights has been argued as a strategy to prevent human rights abuses             

Legal instruments
Many examples of legal instruments at the international  regional and national level described below are designed to enforce laws securing human rights 

Protection at the international level
Main article  International human rights instruments
United Nations
Main article  United Nations
The UN General Assembly
The United Nations  UN  is the only multilateral governmental agency with universally accepted international jurisdiction for universal human rights legislation              All UN organs have advisory roles to the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations Human Rights Council  and there are numerous committees within the UN with responsibilities for safeguarding different human rights treaties  The most senior body of the UN with regard to human rights is the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights  The United Nations has an international mandate to 

  achieve international co operation in solving international problems of an economic  social  cultural  or humanitarian character  and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race  sex  language  or religion         Article     of the Charter of the United Nations
Human Rights Council
Main article  United Nations Human Rights Council
The UN Human Rights Council  created in       has a mandate to investigate alleged human rights violations                 of the     UN member states sit on the council  elected by simple majority in a secret ballot of the United Nations General Assembly  Members serve a maximum of six years and may have their membership suspended for gross human rights abuses  The council is based in Geneva  and meets three times a year  with additional meetings to respond to urgent situations              Independent experts  rapporteurs  are retained by the council to investigate alleged human rights abuses and to report to the council  The Human Rights Council may request that the Security Council refer cases to the International Criminal Court  ICC  even if the issue being referred is outside the normal jurisdiction of the ICC      b     

United Nations treaty bodies
Main article  Treaty body

In addition to the political bodies whose mandate flows from the UN charter  the UN has set up a number of treaty based bodies  comprising committees of independent experts who monitor compliance with human rights standards and norms flowing from the core international human rights treaties  They are supported by and are created by the treaty that they monitor  With the exception of the CESCR  which was established under a resolution of the Economic and Social Council to carry out the monitoring functions originally assigned to that body under the Covenant  they are technically autonomous bodies  established by the treaties that they monitor and accountable to the state parties of those treaties   rather than subsidiary to the United Nations  though in practice they are closely intertwined with the United Nations system and are supported by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights  UNHCHR  and the UN Centre for Human Rights             

The Human Rights Committee promotes participation with the standards of the ICCPR  The members of the committee express opinions on member countries and make judgments on individual complaints against countries which have ratified an Optional Protocol to the treaty  The judgments  termed  views   are not legally binding  The member of the committee meets around three times a year to hold sessions             
The Committee on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights monitors the ICESCR and makes general comments on ratifying countries performance  It will have the power to receive complaints against the countries that opted into the Optional Protocol once it has come into force  Unlike the other treaty bodies  the economic committee is not an autonomous body responsible to the treaty parties  but directly responsible to the Economic and Social Council and ultimately to the General Assembly  This means that the Economic Committee faces particular difficulties at its disposal only relatively  weak  means of implementation in comparison to other treaty bodies              Particular difficulties noted by commentators include  perceived vagueness of the principles of the treaty  relative lack of legal texts and decisions  ambivalence of many states in addressing economic  social and cultural rights  comparatively few non governmental organisations focused on the area and problems with obtaining relevant and precise information                         
The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination monitors the CERD and conducts regular reviews of countries  performance  It can make judgments on complaints against member states allowing it  but these are not legally binding  It issues warnings to attempt to prevent serious contraventions of the convention 
The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women monitors the CEDAW  It receives states  reports on their performance and comments on them  and can make judgments on complaints against countries which have opted into the      Optional Protocol 
The Committee Against Torture monitors the CAT and receives states  reports on their performance every four years and comments on them  Its subcommittee may visit and inspect countries which have opted into the Optional Protocol 
The Committee on the Rights of the Child monitors the CRC and makes comments on reports submitted by states every five years  It does not have the power to receive complaints 
The Committee on Migrant Workers was established in      and monitors the ICRMW and makes comments on reports submitted by states every five years  It will have the power to receive complaints of specific violations only once ten member states allow it 
The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was established in      to monitor the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities  It has the power to receive complaints against the countries which have opted into the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
The Committee on Enforced Disappearances monitors the ICPPED  All States parties are obliged to submit reports to the committee on how the rights are being implemented  The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the State party in the form of  concluding observations  
Each treaty body receives secretariat support from the Human Rights Council and Treaties Division of Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights  OHCHR  in Geneva except CEDAW  which is supported by the Division for the Advancement of Women  DAW   CEDAW formerly held all its sessions at United Nations headquarters in New York but now frequently meets at the United Nations Office in Geneva  the other treaty bodies meet in Geneva  The Human Rights Committee usually holds its March session in New York City  The human rights enshrined in the UDHR  the Geneva Conventions and the various enforced treaties of the United Nations are enforceable in law  In practice  many rights are very difficult to legally enforce due to the absence of consensus on the application of certain rights  the lack of relevant national legislation or of bodies empowered to take legal action to enforce them 

International courts
The official logo of the ICC
There exist a number of internationally recognized organisations with worldwide mandate or jurisdiction over certain aspects of human rights 

The International Court of Justice  ICJ  is the United Nations  primary judiciary body              It has worldwide jurisdiction  It is directed by the Security Council  The ICJ settles disputes between nations  The ICJ does not have jurisdiction over individuals 
The International Criminal Court  ICC  is the body responsible for investigating and punishing war crimes  and crimes against humanity when such occur within its jurisdiction  with a mandate to bring to justice perpetrators of such crimes that occurred after its creation in       A number of UN members have not joined the court and the ICC does not have jurisdiction over their citizens  and others have signed but not yet ratified the Rome Statute  which established the court             
The ICC and other international courts  see Regional human rights below  exist to take action where the national legal system of a state is unable to try the case itself  If national law is able to safeguard human rights and punish those who breach human rights legislation  it has primary jurisdiction by complementarity  Only when all local remedies have been exhausted does international law take effect

Several theoretical approaches have been advanced to explain how and why human rights become part of social expectations  One of the oldest Western philosophies on human rights is that they are a product of a natural law  stemming from different philosophical or religious grounds  Other theories hold that human rights codify moral behavior which is a human social product developed by a process of biological and social evolution  associated with David Hume   Human rights are also described as a sociological pattern of rule setting  as in the sociological theory of law and the work of Max Weber   These approaches include the notion that individuals in a society accept rules from legitimate authority in exchange for security and economic advantage  as in John Rawls    a social contract 

Natural rights
Main articles  Natural law and Natural rights
Natural law theories base human rights on a  natural  moral  religious or even biological order which is independent of transitory human laws or traditions  Socrates and his philosophic heirs  Plato and Aristotle  posited the existence of natural justice or natural right  dikaion physikon                   Latin ius naturale   Of these  Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law              although evidence for this is due largely to the interpretations of his work by Thomas Aquinas              The development of this tradition of natural justice into one of natural law is usually attributed to the Stoics             
Some of the early Church Fathers sought to incorporate the until then pagan concept of natural law into Christianity  Natural law theories have featured greatly in the philosophies of Thomas Aquinas  Francisco Su rez  Richard Hooker  Thomas Hobbes  Hugo Grotius  Samuel von Pufendorf  and John Locke  In the   th century  Thomas Hobbes founded a contractualist theory of legal positivism on what all men could agree upon  what they sought  happiness  was subject to contention  but a broad consensus could form around what they feared  violent death at the hands of another   The natural law was how a rational human being  seeking to survive and prosper  would act  It was discovered by considering humankind s natural rights  whereas previously it could be said that natural rights were discovered by considering the natural law  In Hobbes  opinion  the only way natural law could prevail was for men to submit to the commands of the sovereign  In this lay the foundations of the theory of a social contract between the governed and the governor 
Hugo Grotius based his philosophy of international law on natural law  He wrote that  even the will of an omnipotent being cannot change or abrogate  natural law  which  would maintain its objective validity even if we should assume the impossible  that there is no God or that he does not care for human affairs    De iure belli ac pacis  Prolegomeni XI   This is the famous argument etiamsi daremus  non esse Deum   that made natural law no longer dependent on theology  John Locke incorporated natural law into many of his theories and philosophy  especially in Two Treatises of Government  Locke turned Hobbes  prescription around  saying that if the ruler went against natural law and failed to protect  life  liberty  and property   people could justifiably overthrow the existing state and create a new one 
The Belgian philosopher of law Frank van Dun is one among those who are elaborating a secular conception of natural law in the liberal tradition              There are also emerging and secular forms of natural law theory that define human rights as derivative of the notion of universal human dignity              The term  human rights  has replaced the term  natural rights  in popularity  because the rights are less and less frequently seen as requiring natural law for their existence             

Other theories of human rights
The philosopher John Finnis argues that human rights are justifiable on the grounds of their instrumental value in creating the necessary conditions for human well being                          Interest theories highlight the duty to respect the rights of other individuals on grounds of self interest 

Human rights law  applied to a State s own citizens serves the interest of states  by  for example  minimizing the risk of violent resistance and protest and by keeping the level of dissatisfaction with the government manageable        Niraj Nathwani  Rethinking Refugee Law            
The biological theory considers the comparative reproductive advantage of human social behavior based on empathy and altruism in the context of natural selection                                      The philosopher Zhao Tingyang argues that the traditional human rights framework fails to be universal  because it arose from contingent aspects of Western culture  and that the concept of inalienable and unconditional human rights is in tension with the principle of justice  He proposes an alternative framework called  credit human rights   in which rights are tied to responsibilities                         

Concepts in human rights
See also  Human Rights Law
Indivisibility and categorization of rights
The most common categorization of human rights is to split them into civil and political rights  and economic  social and cultural rights  Civil and political rights are enshrined in articles   to    of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the ICCPR  Economic  social and cultural rights are enshrined in articles    to    of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the ICESCR  The UDHR included both economic  social and cultural rights and civil and political rights because it was based on the principle that the different rights could only successfully exist in combination 

The ideal of free human beings enjoying civil and political freedom and freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his civil and political rights  as well as his social  economic and cultural rights        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights      
This is held to be true because without civil and political rights the public cannot assert their economic  social and cultural rights  The freedom from fear and the freedom of want is essential to this by allowing a communities population to pursue endeavors without international or state interference  Similarly  without livelihoods and a working society  the public cannot assert or make use of civil or political rights  known as the full belly thesis  
Although accepted by the signatories to the UDHR  most of them do not in practice give equal weight to the different types of rights  Western cultures have often given priority to civil and political rights  sometimes at the expense of economic and social rights such as the right to work  to education  health and housing  For example  in the United States there is no universal access to healthcare free at the point of use              That is not to say that Western cultures have overlooked these rights entirely  the welfare states that exist in Western Europe are evidence of this   Similarly  the ex Soviet bloc countries and Asian countries have tended to give priority to economic  social and cultural rights  but have often failed to provide civil and political rights 
Another categorization  offered by Karel Vasak  is that there are three generations of human rights  first generation civil and political rights  right to life and political participation   second generation economic  social and cultural rights  right to subsistence  and third generation solidarity rights  right to peace  right to clean environment   Out of these generations  the third generation is the most debated and lacks both legal and political recognition  This categorization is at odds with the indivisibility of rights  as it implicitly states that some rights can exist without others  Prioritization of rights for pragmatic reasons is however a widely accepted necessity  Human rights expert Philip Alston argues 

If every possible human rights element is deemed to be essential or necessary  then nothing will be treated as though it is truly important                     Philip Alston
He  and others  urge caution with prioritisation of rights 

  the call for prioritizing is not to suggest that any obvious violations of rights can be ignored                     Philip Alston
Priorities  where necessary  should adhere to core concepts  such as reasonable attempts at progressive realization  and principles  such as non discrimination  equality and participation                      Olivia Ball  Paul Gready
Some human rights are said to be  inalienable rights   The term inalienable rights  or unalienable rights  refers to  a set of human rights that are fundamental  are not awarded by human power  and cannot be surrendered  
The adherence to the principle of indivisibility by the international community was reaffirmed in      

All human rights are universal  indivisible and interdependent and related  The international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner  on the same footing  and with the same emphasis         Vienna Declaration and Program of Action  World Conference on Human Rights      
This statement was again endorsed at the      World Summit in New York  paragraph      

Universalism vs cultural relativism
Main articles  Cultural relativism  Moral relativism  Moral universalism  and Universal ethic
Map  Estimated prevalence of Female Genital Cutting  FGC  in Africa  Data based on uncertain estimates 
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights enshrines  by definition  rights that apply to all humans equally  whichever geographical location  state  race or culture they belong to  Proponents of cultural relativism suggest that human rights are not all universal  and indeed conflict with some cultures and threaten their survival  Rights which are most often contested with relativistic arguments are the rights of women  For example  female genital mutilation occurs in different cultures in Africa  Asia and South America  It is not mandated by any religion  but has become a tradition in many cultures  It is considered a violation of women s and girl s rights by much of the international community  and is outlawed in some countries 
Universalism has been described by some as cultural  economic or political imperialism  In particular  the concept of human rights is often claimed to be fundamentally rooted in a politically liberal outlook which  although generally accepted in Europe  Japan or North America  is not necessarily taken as standard elsewhere  For example  in       the Iranian representative to the United Nations  Said Rajaie Khorassani  articulated the position of his country regarding the UDHR by saying that the UDHR was  a secular understanding of the Judeo Christian tradition   which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing the Islamic law               The former Prime Ministers of Singapore  Lee Kuan Yew  and of Malaysia  Mahathir Mohamad both claimed in the     s that Asian values were significantly different from western values and included a sense of loyalty and foregoing personal freedoms for the sake of social stability and prosperity  and therefore authoritarian government is more appropriate in Asia than democracy  This view is countered by Mahathir s former deputy 

To say that freedom is Western or unAsian is to offend our traditions as well as our forefathers  who gave their lives in the struggle against tyranny and injustices         Anwar Ibrahim  in his keynote speech to the Asian Press Forum title Media and Society in Asia    December     
Singapore s opposition leader Chee Soon Juan also states that it is racist to assert that Asians do not want human rights                            An appeal is often made to the fact that influential human rights thinkers  such as John Locke and John Stuart Mill  have all been Western and indeed that some were involved in the running of Empires themselves                            Relativistic arguments tend to neglect the fact that modern human rights are new to all cultures  dating back no further than the UDHR in       They also do not account for the fact that the UDHR was drafted by people from many different cultures and traditions  including a US Roman Catholic  a Chinese Confucian philosopher  a French Zionist and a representative from the Arab League  amongst others  and drew upon advice from thinkers such as Mahatma Gandhi             
Michael Ignatieff has argued that cultural relativism is almost exclusively an argument used by those who wield power in cultures which commit human rights abuses  and that those whose human rights are compromised are the powerless               This reflects the fact that the difficulty in judging universalism versus relativism lies in who is claiming to represent a particular culture  Although the argument between universalism and relativism is far from complete  it is an academic discussion in that all international human rights instruments adhere to the principle that human rights are universally applicable  The      World Summit reaffirmed the international community s adherence to this principle 

The universal nature of human rights and freedoms is beyond question              World Summit  paragraph    Human rights that depend on an individualist orientation have been criticised as unsuited to communally orientated societies  which critics say makes individual human rights non universal                           
Universal jurisdiction vs state sovereignty
See also  Universal jurisdiction and State sovereignty
Universal jurisdiction is a controversial principle in international law whereby states claim criminal jurisdiction over persons whose alleged crimes were committed outside the boundaries of the prosecuting state  regardless of nationality  country of residence  or any other relation with the prosecuting country  The state backs its claim on the grounds that the crime committed is considered a crime against all  which any state is authorized to punish  The concept of universal jurisdiction is therefore closely linked to the idea that certain international norms are erga omnes  or owed to the entire world community  as well as the concept of jus cogens  In       Belgium passed a law of universal jurisdiction to give its court s jurisdiction over crimes against humanity in other countries  and in      Augusto Pinochet was arrested in London following an indictment by Spanish judge Baltasar Garz n under the universal jurisdiction principle               The principle is supported by Amnesty International and other human rights organisations as they believe certain crimes pose a threat to the international community as a whole and the community has a moral duty to act  but others  including Henry Kissinger  argue that state sovereignty is paramount  because breaches of rights committed in other countries are outside states  sovereign interest and because states could use the principle for political reasons              

State and non state actors
Companies  NGOs  political parties  informal groups  and individuals are known as non State actors  Non State actors can also commit human rights abuses  but are not subject to human rights law other than International Humanitarian Law  which applies to individuals  Multinational companies play an increasingly large role in the world  and are responsible for a large number of human rights abuses               Although the legal and moral environment surrounding the actions of governments is reasonably well developed  that surrounding multinational companies is both controversial and ill defined  Multinational companies often view their primary responsibility as being to their shareholders  not to those affected by their actions  Such companies are often larger than the economies of the states in which they operate  and can wield significant economic and political power  No international treaties exist to specifically cover the behavior of companies with regard to human rights  and national legislation is very variable  Jean Ziegler  Special Rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human Rights on the right to food stated in a report in      

the growing power of transnational corporations and their extension of power through privatization  deregulation and the rolling back of the State also mean that it is now time to develop binding legal norms that hold corporations to human rights standards and circumscribe potential abuses of their position of power                      Jean Ziegler
In August       the Human Rights Commission s Sub Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights produced draft Norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises with regard to human rights               These were considered by the Human Rights Commission in       but have no binding status on corporations and are not monitored               Additionally  the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal    aims to substantially reduce inequality by      through the promotion of appropriate legislation              

Human rights in emergency situations
Extrajudicial detention of captives in Guantanamo Bay
See also  Derogation  National security  and Anti terrorism legislation
With the exception of non derogable human rights  international conventions class the right to life  the right to be free from slavery  the right to be free from torture and the right to be free from retroactive application of penal laws as non derogable                the UN recognises that human rights can be limited or even pushed aside during times of national emergency  although it clarifies 

the emergency must be actual  affect the whole population and the threat must be to the very existence of the nation  The declaration of emergency must also be a last resort and a temporary measure         United Nations  The Resource             
Rights that cannot be derogated for reasons of national security in any circumstances are known as peremptory norms or jus cogens  Such International law obligations are binding on all states and cannot be modified by treaty 

Criticism
See also  Human rights inflation
Critics of the view that human rights are universal argue that human rights are a Western concept that  emanate from a European  Judeo Christian  and or Enlightenment heritage  typically labeled Western  and cannot be enjoyed by other cultures that don t emulate the conditions and values of  Western  societies                Right wing critics of human rights argue that they are  unrealistic and unenforceable norms and inappropriate intrusions on state sovereignty   while left wing critics of human rights argue that they fail  to achieve   or prevents better approaches to achieving   progressive goals
