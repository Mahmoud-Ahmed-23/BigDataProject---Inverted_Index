Economics     k  n m ks   i k                           is a social science that studies the production  distribution  and consumption of goods and services                       
Economics focuses on the behaviour and interactions of economic agents and how economies work  Microeconomics analyses what is viewed as basic elements within economies  including individual agents and markets  their interactions  and the outcomes of interactions  Individual agents may include  for example  households  firms  buyers  and sellers  Macroeconomics analyses economies as systems where production  distribution  consumption  savings  and investment expenditure interact  and the factors of production affecting them  such as  labour  capital  land  and enterprise  inflation  economic growth  and public policies that impact these elements  It also seeks to analyse and describe the global economy 
Other broad distinctions within economics include those between positive economics  describing  what is   and normative economics  advocating  what ought to be              between economic theory and applied economics  between rational and behavioural economics  and between mainstream economics and heterodox economics            
Economic analysis can be applied throughout society  including business             finance  cybersecurity             health care             engineering             and government              It is also applied to such diverse subjects as crime              education              the family              feminism              law              philosophy              politics  religion              social institutions  war              science              and the environment             


Definitions of economics


Main article  Definitions of economics
The earlier term for the discipline was  political economy   but since the late   th century  it has commonly been called  economics               The term is ultimately derived from Ancient Greek            oikonomia  which is a term for the  way  nomos  to run a household  oikos    or in other words the know how of an              oikonomikos   or  household or homestead manager   Derived terms such as  economy  can therefore often mean  frugal  or  thrifty                                                   By extension then   political economy  was the way to manage a polis or state 
There are a variety of modern definitions of economics  some reflect evolving views of the subject or different views among economists                          Scottish philosopher Adam Smith        defined what was then called political economy as  an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations   in particular as 

a branch of the science of a statesman or legislator  with the twofold objectives of providing  a plentiful revenue or subsistence for the people           and  to supply the state or commonwealth with a revenue for the publick services             
Jean Baptiste Say         distinguishing the subject matter from its public policy uses  defined it as the science of production  distribution  and consumption of wealth              On the satirical side  Thomas Carlyle        coined  the dismal science  as an epithet for classical economics  in this context  commonly linked to the pessimistic analysis of Malthus                     John Stuart Mill        delimited the subject matter further 

The science which traces the laws of such of the phenomena of society as arise from the combined operations of mankind for the production of wealth  in so far as those phenomena are not modified by the pursuit of any other object             
Alfred Marshall provided a still widely cited definition in his textbook Principles of Economics        that extended analysis beyond wealth and from the societal to the microeconomic level 

Economics is a study of man in the ordinary business of life  It enquires how he gets his income and how he uses it  Thus  it is on the one side  the study of wealth and on the other and more important side  a part of the study of man             
Lionel Robbins        developed implications of what has been termed   p erhaps the most commonly accepted current definition of the subject              

Economics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses             
Robbins described the definition as not classificatory in  pick ing  out certain kinds of behaviour  but rather analytical in  focus ing  attention on a particular aspect of behaviour  the form imposed by the influence of scarcity               He affirmed that previous economists have usually centred their studies on the analysis of wealth  how wealth is created  production   distributed  and consumed  and how wealth can grow              But he said that economics can be used to study other things  such as war  that are outside its usual focus  This is because war has as the goal winning it  as a sought after end   generates both cost and benefits  and  resources  human life and other costs  are used to attain the goal  If the war is not winnable or if the expected costs outweigh the benefits  the deciding actors  assuming they are rational  may never go to war  a decision  but rather explore other alternatives  Economics cannot be defined as the science that studies wealth  war  crime  education  and any other field economic analysis can be applied to  but  as the science that studies a particular common aspect of each of those subjects  they all use scarce resources to attain a sought after end  
Some subsequent comments criticised the definition as overly broad in failing to limit its subject matter to analysis of markets  From the     s  however  such comments abated as the economic theory of maximizing behaviour and rational choice modelling expanded the domain of the subject to areas previously treated in other fields              There are other criticisms as well  such as in scarcity not accounting for the macroeconomics of high unemployment             
Gary Becker  a contributor to the expansion of economics into new areas  described the approach he favoured as  combin ing the  assumptions of maximizing behaviour  stable preferences  and market equilibrium  used relentlessly and unflinchingly               One commentary characterises the remark as making economics an approach rather than a subject matter but with great specificity as to the  choice process and the type of social interaction that  such  analysis involves   The same source reviews a range of definitions included in principles of economics textbooks and concludes that the lack of agreement need not affect the subject matter that the texts treat  Among economists more generally  it argues that a particular definition presented may reflect the direction toward which the author believes economics is evolving  or should evolve             
Many economists including nobel prize winners James M  Buchanan and Ronald Coase reject the method based definition of Robbins and continue to prefer definitions like those of Say  in terms of its subject matter              Ha Joon Chang has for example argued that the definition of Robbins would make economics very peculiar because all other sciences define themselves in terms of the area of inquiry or object of inquiry rather than the methodology  In the biology department  it is not said that all biology should be studied with DNA analysis  People study living organisms in many different ways  so some people will perform DNA analysis  others might analyse anatomy  and still others might build game theoretic models of animal behaviour  But they are all called biology because they all study living organisms  According to Ha Joon Chang  this view that the economy can and should be studied in only one way  for example by studying only rational choices   and going even one step further and basically redefining economics as a theory of everything  is peculiar

From antiquity through the physiocrats
A      painting of a French seaport during the heyday of mercantilism
Questions regarding distribution of resources are found throughout the writings of the Boeotian poet Hesiod and several economic historians have described Hesiod as the  first economist               However  the word Oikos  the Greek word from which the word economy derives  was used for issues regarding how to manage a household  which was understood to be the landowner  his family  and his slaves              rather than to refer to some normative societal system of distribution of resources  which is a more recent phenomenon                                      Xenophon  the author of the Oeconomicus  is credited by philologues for being the source of the word economy              Joseph Schumpeter described   th and   th century scholastic writers  including Tom s de Mercado  Luis de Molina  and Juan de Lugo  as  coming nearer than any other group to being the  founders  of scientific economics  as to monetary  interest  and value theory within a natural law perspective             
Two groups  who later were called  mercantilists  and  physiocrats   more directly influenced the subsequent development of the subject  Both groups were associated with the rise of economic nationalism and modern capitalism in Europe  Mercantilism was an economic doctrine that flourished from the   th to   th century in a prolific pamphlet literature  whether of merchants or statesmen  It held that a nation s wealth depended on its accumulation of gold and silver  Nations without access to mines could obtain gold and silver from trade only by selling goods abroad and restricting imports other than of gold and silver  The doctrine called for importing inexpensive raw materials to be used in manufacturing goods  which could be exported  and for state regulation to impose protective tariffs on foreign manufactured goods and prohibit manufacturing in the colonies             
Physiocrats  a group of   th century French thinkers and writers  developed the idea of the economy as a circular flow of income and output  Physiocrats believed that only agricultural production generated a clear surplus over cost  so that agriculture was the basis of all wealth              Thus  they opposed the mercantilist policy of promoting manufacturing and trade at the expense of agriculture  including import tariffs  Physiocrats advocated replacing administratively costly tax collections with a single tax on income of land owners  In reaction against copious mercantilist trade regulations  the physiocrats advocated a policy of laissez faire              which called for minimal government intervention in the economy             
Adam Smith             was an early economic theorist              Smith was harshly critical of the mercantilists but described the physiocratic system  with all its imperfections  as  perhaps the purest approximation to the truth that has yet been published  on the subject             

Classical political economy
Main article  Classical economics
The publication of Adam Smith s The Wealth of Nations in      is considered to be the first formalisation of economic thought 
The publication of Adam Smith s The Wealth of Nations in       has been described as  the effective birth of economics as a separate discipline               The book identified land  labour  and capital as the three factors of production and the major contributors to a nation s wealth  as distinct from the physiocratic idea that only agriculture was productive 
Smith discusses potential benefits of specialisation by division of labour  including increased labour productivity and gains from trade  whether between town and country or across countries              His  theorem  that  the division of labor is limited by the extent of the market  has been described as the  core of a theory of the functions of firm and industry  and a  fundamental principle of economic organization               To Smith has also been ascribed  the most important substantive proposition in all of economics  and foundation of resource allocation theory that  under competition  resource owners  of labour  land  and capital  seek their most profitable uses  resulting in an equal rate of return for all uses in equilibrium  adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training and unemployment              
In an argument that includes  one of the most famous passages in all economics               Smith represents every individual as trying to employ any capital they might command for their own advantage  not that of the society      a      and for the sake of profit  which is necessary at some level for employing capital in domestic industry  and positively related to the value of produce              In this 

He generally  indeed  neither intends to promote the public interest  nor knows how much he is promoting it  By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry  he intends only his own security  and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value  he intends only his own gain  and he is in this  as in many other cases  led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention  Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it  By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it              
The Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus        used the concept of diminishing returns to explain low living standards  Human population  he argued  tended to increase geometrically  outstripping the production of food  which increased arithmetically  The force of a rapidly growing population against a limited amount of land meant diminishing returns to labour  The result  he claimed  was chronically low wages  which prevented the standard of living for most of the population from rising above the subsistence level                  non primary source needed      Economist Julian Simon has criticised Malthus s conclusions             
While Adam Smith emphasised production and income  David Ricardo        focused on the distribution of income among landowners  workers  and capitalists  Ricardo saw an inherent conflict between landowners on the one hand and labour and capital on the other  He posited that the growth of population and capital  pressing against a fixed supply of land  pushes up rents and holds down wages and profits  Ricardo was also the first to state and prove the principle of comparative advantage  according to which each country should specialise in producing and exporting goods in that it has a lower relative cost of production  rather relying only on its own production              It has been termed a  fundamental analytical explanation  for gains from trade             
Coming at the end of the classical tradition  John Stuart Mill        parted company with the earlier classical economists on the inevitability of the distribution of income produced by the market system  Mill pointed to a distinct difference between the market s two roles  allocation of resources and distribution of income  The market might be efficient in allocating resources but not in distributing income  he wrote  making it necessary for society to intervene             
Value theory was important in classical theory  Smith wrote that the  real price of every thing          is the toil and trouble of acquiring it   Smith maintained that  with rent and profit  other costs besides wages also enter the price of a commodity              Other classical economists presented variations on Smith  termed the  labour theory of value   Classical economics focused on the tendency of any market economy to settle in a final stationary state made up of a constant stock of physical wealth  capital  and a constant population size 

Marxian economics
Main article  Marxian economics
The Marxist critique of political economy comes from the work of German philosopher Karl Marx 
Marxist  later  Marxian  economics descends from classical economics and it derives from the work of Karl Marx  The first volume of Marx s major work  Das Kapital  was published in       Marx focused on the labour theory of value and theory of surplus value  Marx wrote that they were mechanisms used by capital to exploit labour              The labour theory of value held that the value of an exchanged commodity was determined by the labour that went into its production  and the theory of surplus value demonstrated how workers were only paid a proportion of the value their work had created             
Marxian economics was further developed by Karl Kautsky             s The Economic Doctrines of Karl Marx and The Class Struggle  Erfurt Program   Rudolf Hilferding s             Finance Capital  Vladimir Lenin             s The Development of Capitalism in Russia and Imperialism  the Highest Stage of Capitalism  and Rosa Luxemburg             s The Accumulation of Capital 

Neoclassical economics
Main article  Neoclassical economics
At its inception as a social science  economics was defined and discussed at length as the study of production  distribution  and consumption of wealth by Jean Baptiste Say in his Treatise on Political Economy or  The Production  Distribution  and Consumption of Wealth         These three items were considered only in relation to the increase or diminution of wealth  and not in reference to their processes of execution      b      Say s definition has survived in part up to the present  modified by substituting the word  wealth  for  goods and services  meaning that wealth may include non material objects as well  One hundred and thirty years later  Lionel Robbins noticed that this definition no longer sufficed      c      because many economists were making theoretical and philosophical inroads in other areas of human activity  In his Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science  he proposed a definition of economics as a study of human behaviour  subject to and constrained by scarcity      d      which forces people to choose  allocate scarce resources to competing ends  and economise  seeking the greatest welfare while avoiding the wasting of scarce resources   According to Robbins   Economics is the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses               Robbins  definition eventually became widely accepted by mainstream economists  and found its way into current textbooks              Although far from unanimous  most mainstream economists would accept some version of Robbins  definition  even though many have raised serious objections to the scope and method of economics  emanating from that definition             
A body of theory later termed  neoclassical economics  formed from about      to       The term  economics  was popularised by such neoclassical economists as Alfred Marshall and Mary Paley Marshall as a concise synonym for  economic science  and a substitute for the earlier  political economy                           This corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the natural sciences             
Neoclassical economics systematically integrated supply and demand as joint determinants of both price and quantity in market equilibrium  influencing the allocation of output and income distribution  It rejected the classical economics  labour theory of value in favour of a marginal utility theory of value on the demand side and a more comprehensive theory of costs on the supply side              In the   th century  neoclassical theorists departed from an earlier idea that suggested measuring total utility for a society  opting instead for ordinal utility  which posits behaviour based relations across individuals                         
In microeconomics  neoclassical economics represents incentives and costs as playing a pervasive role in shaping decision making  An immediate example of this is the consumer theory of individual demand  which isolates how prices  as costs  and income affect quantity demanded              In macroeconomics it is reflected in an early and lasting neoclassical synthesis with Keynesian macroeconomics                         
Neoclassical economics is occasionally referred as orthodox economics whether by its critics or sympathisers  Modern mainstream economics builds on neoclassical economics but with many refinements that either supplement or generalise earlier analysis  such as econometrics  game theory  analysis of market failure and imperfect competition  and the neoclassical model of economic growth for analysing long run variables affecting national income 
Neoclassical economics studies the behaviour of individuals  households  and organisations  called economic actors  players  or agents   when they manage or use scarce resources  which have alternative uses  to achieve desired ends  Agents are assumed to act rationally  have multiple desirable ends in sight  limited resources to obtain these ends  a set of stable preferences  a definite overall guiding objective  and the capability of making a choice  There exists an economic problem  subject to study by economic science  when a decision  choice  is made by one or more players to attain the best possible outcome             

Keynesian economics
Main article  Keynesian economics
John Maynard Keynes  a key economics theorist
Keynesian economics derives from John Maynard Keynes  in particular his book The General Theory of Employment  Interest and Money         which ushered in contemporary macroeconomics as a distinct field              The book focused on determinants of national income in the short run when prices are relatively inflexible  Keynes attempted to explain in broad theoretical detail why high labour market unemployment might not be self correcting due to low  effective demand  and why even price flexibility and monetary policy might be unavailing  The term  revolutionary  has been applied to the book in its impact on economic analysis             
During the following decades  many economists followed Keynes  ideas and expanded on his works  John Hicks and Alvin Hansen developed the IS LM model which was a simple formalisation of some of Keynes  insights on the economy s short run equilibrium  Franco Modigliani and James Tobin developed important theories of private consumption and investment  respectively  two major components of aggregate demand  Lawrence Klein built the first large scale macroeconometric model  applying the Keynesian thinking systematically to the US economy             

Post WWII economics
Immediately after World War II  Keynesian was the dominant economic view of the United States establishment and its allies  Marxian economics was the dominant economic view of the Soviet Union nomenklatura and its allies 

Monetarism
Main article  Monetarism
Monetarism appeared in the     s and     s  its intellectual leader being Milton Friedman  Monetarists contended that monetary policy and other monetary shocks  as represented by the growth in the money stock  was an important cause of economic fluctuations  and consequently that monetary policy was more important than fiscal policy for purposes of stabilisation                          Friedman was also skeptical about the ability of central banks to conduct a sensible active monetary policy in practice  advocating instead using simple rules such as a steady rate of money growth             
Monetarism rose to prominence in the     s and     s  when several major central banks followed a monetarist inspired policy  but was later abandoned because the results were unsatisfactory                         

New classical economics
Main article  New classical macroeconomics
A more fundamental challenge to the prevailing Keynesian paradigm came in the     s from new classical economists like Robert Lucas  Thomas Sargent and Edward Prescott  They introduced the notion of rational expectations in economics  which had profound implications for many economic discussions  among which were the so called Lucas critique and the presentation of real business cycle models             

New Keynesians
Main article  New Keynesian economics
During the     s  a group of researchers appeared being called New Keynesian economists  including among others George Akerlof  Janet Yellen  Gregory Mankiw and Olivier Blanchard  They adopted the principle of rational expectations and other monetarist or new classical ideas such as building upon models employing micro foundations and optimizing behaviour  but simultaneously emphasised the importance of various market failures for the functioning of the economy  as had Keynes              Not least  they proposed various reasons that potentially explained the empirically observed features of price and wage rigidity  usually made to be endogenous features of the models  rather than simply assumed as in older Keynesian style ones 

New neoclassical synthesis
Main article  New neoclassical synthesis
After decades of often heated discussions between Keynesians  monetarists  new classical and new Keynesian economists  a synthesis emerged by the     s  often given the name the new neoclassical synthesis  It integrated the rational expectations and optimizing framework of the new classical theory with a new Keynesian role for nominal rigidities and other market imperfections like imperfect information in goods  labour and credit markets  The monetarist importance of monetary policy in stabilizing             the economy and in particular controlling inflation was recognised as well as the traditional Keynesian insistence that fiscal policy could also play an influential role in affecting aggregate demand  Methodologically  the synthesis led to a new class of applied models  known as dynamic stochastic general equilibrium or DSGE models  descending from real business cycles models  but extended with several new Keynesian and other features  These models proved useful and influential in the design of modern monetary policy and are now standard workhorses in most central banks             

After the      financial crisis
After the      financial crisis  macroeconomic research has put greater emphasis on understanding and integrating the financial system into models of the general economy and shedding light on the ways in which problems in the financial sector can turn into major macroeconomic recessions  In this and other research branches  inspiration from behavioural economics has started playing a more important role in mainstream economic theory              Also  heterogeneity among the economic agents  e g  differences in income  plays an increasing role in recent economic research             

Other schools and approaches
Main article  Schools of economic thought
Other schools or trends of thought referring to a particular style of economics practised at and disseminated from well defined groups of academicians that have become known worldwide  include the Freiburg School  the School of Lausanne  the Stockholm school and the Chicago school of economics  During the     s and     s mainstream economics was sometimes separated into the Saltwater approach of those universities along the Eastern and Western coasts of the US  and the Freshwater  or Chicago school approach             
Within macroeconomics there is  in general order of their historical appearance in the literature  classical economics  neoclassical economics  Keynesian economics  the neoclassical synthesis  monetarism  new classical economics  New Keynesian economics             and the new neoclassical synthesis             
Beside the mainstream development of economic thought  various alternative or heterodox economic theories have evolved over time  positioning themselves in contrast to mainstream theory              These include             

Austrian School  emphasizing human action  property rights and the freedom to contract and transact to have a thriving and successful economy              It also emphasises that the state should play as small role as possible  if any role  in the regulation of economic activity between two transacting parties              Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises are the two most prominent representatives of the Austrian school 
Post Keynesian economics concentrates on macroeconomic rigidities and adjustment processes  It is generally associated with the University of Cambridge and the work of Joan Robinson             
Ecological economics like environmental economics studies the interactions between human economies and the ecosystems in which they are embedded              but in contrast to environmental economics takes an oppositional position towards general mainstream economic principles  A major difference between the two subdisciplines is their assumptions about the substitution possibilities between human made and natural capital              
Additionally  alternative developments include Marxian economics  constitutional economics  institutional economics  evolutionary economics  dependency theory  structuralist economics  world systems theory  econophysics  econodynamics  feminist economics and biophysical economics              
Feminist economics emphasises the role that gender plays in economies  challenging analyses that render gender invisible or support gender oppressive economic systems               The goal is to create economic research and policy analysis that is inclusive and gender aware to encourage gender equality and improve the well being of marginalised groups 

Methodology
Theoretical research
Main articles  Microeconomics  Macroeconomics  and Mathematical economics
 Economic theory  redirects here  For the publication  see Economic Theory  journal  
Mainstream economic theory relies upon analytical economic models  When creating theories  the objective is to find assumptions which are at least as simple in information requirements  more precise in predictions  and more fruitful in generating additional research than prior theories               While neoclassical economic theory constitutes both the dominant or orthodox theoretical as well as methodological framework  economic theory can also take the form of other schools of thought such as in heterodox economic theories 
In microeconomics  principal concepts include supply and demand  marginalism  rational choice theory  opportunity cost  budget constraints  utility  and the theory of the firm               Early macroeconomic models focused on modelling the relationships between aggregate variables  but as the relationships appeared to change over time macroeconomists  including new Keynesians  reformulated their models with microfoundations               in which microeconomic concepts play a major part 
Sometimes an economic hypothesis is only qualitative  not quantitative              
Expositions of economic reasoning often use two dimensional graphs to illustrate theoretical relationships  At a higher level of generality  mathematical economics is the application of mathematical methods to represent theories and analyse problems in economics  Paul Samuelson s treatise Foundations of Economic Analysis        exemplifies the method  particularly as to maximizing behavioural relations of agents reaching equilibrium  The book focused on examining the class of statements called operationally meaningful theorems in economics  which are theorems that can conceivably be refuted by empirical data              

Empirical research
Main articles  Econometrics and Experimental economics
Economic theories are frequently tested empirically  largely through the use of econometrics using economic data               The controlled experiments common to the physical sciences are difficult and uncommon in economics               and instead broad data is observationally studied  this type of testing is typically regarded as less rigorous than controlled experimentation  and the conclusions typically more tentative  However  the field of experimental economics is growing  and increasing use is being made of natural experiments 
Statistical methods such as regression analysis are common  Practitioners use such methods to estimate the size  economic significance  and statistical significance   signal strength   of the hypothesised relation s  and to adjust for noise from other variables  By such means  a hypothesis may gain acceptance  although in a probabilistic  rather than certain  sense  Acceptance is dependent upon the falsifiable hypothesis surviving tests  Use of commonly accepted methods need not produce a final conclusion or even a consensus on a particular question  given different tests  data sets  and prior beliefs 
Experimental economics has promoted the use of scientifically controlled experiments  This has reduced the long noted distinction of economics from natural sciences because it allows direct tests of what were previously taken as axioms               In some cases these have found that the axioms are not entirely correct 
In behavioural economics  psychologist Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel Prize in economics in      for his and Amos Tversky s empirical discovery of several cognitive biases and heuristics  Similar empirical testing occurs in neuroeconomics  Another example is the assumption of narrowly selfish preferences versus a model that tests for selfish  altruistic  and cooperative preferences               These techniques have led some to argue that economics is a  genuine science

Microeconomics examines how entities  forming a market structure  interact within a market to create a market system  These entities include private and public players with various classifications  typically operating under scarcity of tradable units and regulation  The item traded may be a tangible product such as apples or a service such as repair services  legal counsel  or entertainment 
Various market structures exist  In perfectly competitive markets  no participants are large enough to have the market power to set the price of a homogeneous product  In other words  every participant is a  price taker  as no participant influences the price of a product  In the real world  markets often experience imperfect competition 
Forms of imperfect competition include monopoly  in which there is only one seller of a good   duopoly  in which there are only two sellers of a good   oligopoly  in which there are few sellers of a good   monopolistic competition  in which there are many sellers producing highly differentiated goods   monopsony  in which there is only one buyer of a good   and oligopsony  in which there are few buyers of a good   Firms under imperfect competition have the potential to be  price makers   which means that they can influence the prices of their products 
In partial equilibrium method of analysis  it is assumed that activity in the market being analysed does not affect other markets  This method aggregates  the sum of all activity  in only one market  General equilibrium theory studies various markets and their behaviour  It aggregates  the sum of all activity  across all markets  This method studies both changes in markets and their interactions leading towards equilibrium              

Production  cost  and efficiency
Main articles  Production  economics   Opportunity cost  Economic efficiency  and Production possibility frontier
An example production possibility frontier with illustrative points marked
In microeconomics  production is the conversion of inputs into outputs  It is an economic process that uses inputs to create a commodity or a service for exchange or direct use  Production is a flow and thus a rate of output per period of time  Distinctions include such production alternatives as for consumption  food  haircuts  etc   vs  investment goods  new tractors  buildings  roads  etc    public goods  national defence  smallpox vaccinations  etc   or private goods  and  guns  vs  butter  
Inputs used in the production process include such primary factors of production as labour services  capital  durable produced goods used in production  such as an existing factory   and land  including natural resources   Other inputs may include intermediate goods used in production of final goods  such as the steel in a new car 
Economic efficiency measures how well a system generates desired output with a given set of inputs and available technology  Efficiency is improved if more output is generated without changing inputs  A widely accepted general standard is Pareto efficiency  which is reached when no further change can make someone better off without making someone else worse off 
The production possibility frontier  PPF  is an expository figure for representing scarcity  cost  and efficiency  In the simplest case  an economy can produce just two goods  say  guns  and  butter    The PPF is a table or graph  as at the right  that shows the different quantity combinations of the two goods producible with a given technology and total factor inputs  which limit feasible total output  Each point on the curve shows potential total output for the economy  which is the maximum feasible output of one good  given a feasible output quantity of the other good 
Scarcity is represented in the figure by people being willing but unable in the aggregate to consume beyond the PPF  such as at X  and by the negative slope of the curve               If production of one good increases along the curve  production of the other good decreases  an inverse relationship  This is because increasing output of one good requires transferring inputs to it from production of the other good  decreasing the latter 
The slope of the curve at a point on it gives the trade off between the two goods  It measures what an additional unit of one good costs in units forgone of the other good  an example of a real opportunity cost  Thus  if one more Gun costs     units of butter  the opportunity cost of one Gun is     Butter  Along the PPF  scarcity implies that choosing more of one good in the aggregate entails doing with less of the other good  Still  in a market economy  movement along the curve may indicate that the choice of the increased output is anticipated to be worth the cost to the agents 
By construction  each point on the curve shows productive efficiency in maximizing output for given total inputs  A point inside the curve  as at A   is feasible but represents production inefficiency  wasteful use of inputs   in that output of one or both goods could increase by moving in a northeast direction to a point on the curve  Examples cited of such inefficiency include high unemployment during a business cycle recession or economic organisation of a country that discourages full use of resources  Being on the curve might still not fully satisfy allocative efficiency  also called Pareto efficiency  if it does not produce a mix of goods that consumers prefer over other points 
Much applied economics in public policy is concerned with determining how the efficiency of an economy can be improved  Recognizing the reality of scarcity and then figuring out how to organise society for the most efficient use of resources has been described as the  essence of economics   where the subject  makes its unique contribution               

Specialisation
Main articles  Division of labour  Comparative advantage  and Gains from trade
A map showing the main trade routes for goods within late medieval Europe
Specialisation is considered key to economic efficiency based on theoretical and empirical considerations  Different individuals or nations may have different real opportunity costs of production  say from differences in stocks of human capital per worker or capital labour ratios  According to theory  this may give a comparative advantage in production of goods that make more intensive use of the relatively more abundant  thus relatively cheaper  input 
Even if one region has an absolute advantage as to the ratio of its outputs to inputs in every type of output  it may still specialise in the output in which it has a comparative advantage and thereby gain from trading with a region that lacks any absolute advantage but has a comparative advantage in producing something else 
It has been observed that a high volume of trade occurs among regions even with access to a similar technology and mix of factor inputs  including high income countries  This has led to investigation of economies of scale and agglomeration to explain specialisation in similar but differentiated product lines  to the overall benefit of respective trading parties or regions                           
The general theory of specialisation applies to trade among individuals  farms  manufacturers  service providers  and economies  Among each of these production systems  there may be a corresponding division of labour with different work groups specializing  or correspondingly different types of capital equipment and differentiated land uses              
An example that combines features above is a country that specialises in the production of high tech knowledge products  as developed countries do  and trades with developing nations for goods produced in factories where labour is relatively cheap and plentiful  resulting in different in opportunity costs of production  More total output and utility thereby results from specializing in production and trading than if each country produced its own high tech and low tech products 
Theory and observation set out the conditions such that market prices of outputs and productive inputs select an allocation of factor inputs by comparative advantage  so that  relatively  low cost inputs go to producing low cost outputs  In the process  aggregate output may increase as a by product or by design               Such specialisation of production creates opportunities for gains from trade whereby resource owners benefit from trade in the sale of one type of output for other  more highly valued goods  A measure of gains from trade is the increased income levels that trade may facilitate              

Supply and demand
Main article  Supply and demand
The supply and demand model describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between product availability and demand  The graph depicts an increase in demand from D  to D  and the resulting increase in price and quantity required to reach a new equilibrium point on the supply curve  S  
Prices and quantities have been described as the most directly observable attributes of goods produced and exchanged in a market economy               The theory of supply and demand is an organizing principle for explaining how prices coordinate the amounts produced and consumed  In microeconomics  it applies to price and output determination for a market with perfect competition  which includes the condition of no buyers or sellers large enough to have price setting power 
For a given market of a commodity  demand is the relation of the quantity that all buyers would be prepared to purchase at each unit price of the good  Demand is often represented by a table or a graph showing price and quantity demanded  as in the figure   Demand theory describes individual consumers as rationally choosing the most preferred quantity of each good  given income  prices  tastes  etc  A term for this is  constrained utility maximisation   with income and wealth as the constraints on demand   Here  utility refers to the hypothesised relation of each individual consumer for ranking different commodity bundles as more or less preferred 
The law of demand states that  in general  price and quantity demanded in a given market are inversely related  That is  the higher the price of a product  the less of it people would be prepared to buy  other things unchanged   As the price of a commodity falls  consumers move toward it from relatively more expensive goods  the substitution effect   In addition  purchasing power from the price decline increases ability to buy  the income effect   Other factors can change demand  for example an increase in income will shift the demand curve for a normal good outward relative to the origin  as in the figure  All determinants are predominantly taken as constant factors of demand and supply 
Supply is the relation between the price of a good and the quantity available for sale at that price  It may be represented as a table or graph relating price and quantity supplied  Producers  for example business firms  are hypothesised to be profit maximisers  meaning that they attempt to produce and supply the amount of goods that will bring them the highest profit  Supply is typically represented as a function relating price and quantity  if other factors are unchanged 
That is  the higher the price at which the good can be sold  the more of it producers will supply  as in the figure  The higher price makes it profitable to increase production  Just as on the demand side  the position of the supply can shift  say from a change in the price of a productive input or a technical improvement  The  Law of Supply  states that  in general  a rise in price leads to an expansion in supply and a fall in price leads to a contraction in supply  Here as well  the determinants of supply  such as price of substitutes  cost of production  technology applied and various factors inputs of production are all taken to be constant for a specific time period of evaluation of supply 
Market equilibrium occurs where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded  the intersection of the supply and demand curves in the figure above  At a price below equilibrium  there is a shortage of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded  This is posited to bid the price up  At a price above equilibrium  there is a surplus of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded  This pushes the price down  The model of supply and demand predicts that for given supply and demand curves  price and quantity will stabilise at the price that makes quantity supplied equal to quantity demanded  Similarly  demand and supply theory predicts a new price quantity combination from a shift in demand  as to the figure   or in supply 

Firms
Main articles  Theory of the firm  Industrial organisation  Business economics  and Managerial economics
People frequently do not trade directly on markets  Instead  on the supply side  they may work in and produce through firms  The most obvious kinds of firms are corporations  partnerships and trusts  According to Ronald Coase  people begin to organise their production in firms when the costs of doing business becomes lower than doing it on the market               Firms combine labour and capital  and can achieve far greater economies of scale  when the average cost per unit declines as more units are produced  than individual market trading 
In perfectly competitive markets studied in the theory of supply and demand  there are many producers  none of which significantly influence price  Industrial organisation generalises from that special case to study the strategic behaviour of firms that do have significant control of price  It considers the structure of such markets and their interactions  Common market structures studied besides perfect competition include monopolistic competition  various forms of oligopoly  and monopoly              
Managerial economics applies microeconomic analysis to specific decisions in business firms or other management units  It draws heavily from quantitative methods such as operations research and programming and from statistical methods such as regression analysis in the absence of certainty and perfect knowledge  A unifying theme is the attempt to optimise business decisions  including unit cost minimisation and profit maximisation  given the firm s objectives and constraints imposed by technology and market conditions              

Uncertainty and game theory
Main articles  Information economics  Game theory  and Financial economics
Uncertainty in economics is an unknown prospect of gain or loss  whether quantifiable as risk or not  Without it  household behaviour would be unaffected by uncertain employment and income prospects  financial and capital markets would reduce to exchange of a single instrument in each market period  and there would be no communications industry               Given its different forms  there are various ways of representing uncertainty and modelling economic agents  responses to it              
Game theory is a branch of applied mathematics that considers strategic interactions between agents  one kind of uncertainty  It provides a mathematical foundation of industrial organisation  discussed above  to model different types of firm behaviour  for example in a solipsistic industry  few sellers   but equally applicable to wage negotiations  bargaining  contract design  and any situation where individual agents are few enough to have perceptible effects on each other  In behavioural economics  it has been used to model the strategies agents choose when interacting with others whose interests are at least partially adverse to their own              
In this  it generalises maximisation approaches developed to analyse market actors such as in the supply and demand model and allows for incomplete information of actors  The field dates from the      classic Theory of Games and Economic Behavior by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern  It has significant applications seemingly outside of economics in such diverse subjects as the formulation of nuclear strategies  ethics  political science  and evolutionary biology              
Risk aversion may stimulate activity that in well functioning markets smooths out risk and communicates information about risk  as in markets for insurance  commodity futures contracts  and financial instruments  Financial economics or simply finance describes the allocation of financial resources  It also analyses the pricing of financial instruments  the financial structure of companies  the efficiency and fragility of financial markets               financial crises  and related government policy or regulation                                                                  
Some market organisations may give rise to inefficiencies associated with uncertainty  Based on George Akerlof s  Market for Lemons  article  the paradigm example is of a dodgy second hand car market  Customers without knowledge of whether a car is a  lemon  depress its price below what a quality second hand car would be               Information asymmetry arises here  if the seller has more relevant information than the buyer but no incentive to disclose it  Related problems in insurance are adverse selection  such that those at most risk are most likely to insure  say reckless drivers   and moral hazard  such that insurance results in riskier behaviour  say more reckless driving               
Both problems may raise insurance costs and reduce efficiency by driving otherwise willing transactors from the market   incomplete markets    Moreover  attempting to reduce one problem  say adverse selection by mandating insurance  may add to another  say moral hazard  Information economics  which studies such problems  has relevance in subjects such as insurance  contract law  mechanism design  monetary economics  and health care               Applied subjects include market and legal remedies to spread or reduce risk  such as warranties  government mandated partial insurance  restructuring or bankruptcy law  inspection  and regulation for quality and information disclosure                                                                  

Market failure
Main article  Market failure
See also  Government failure  Information economics  Environmental economics  Ecological economics  and Agricultural economics
Pollution can be a simple example of market failure  if costs of production are not borne by producers but are by the environment  accident victims or others  then prices are distorted 
An environmental scientist sampling water
The term  market failure  encompasses several problems which may undermine standard economic assumptions  Although economists categorise market failures differently  the following categories emerge in the main texts      e     
Information asymmetries and incomplete markets may result in economic inefficiency but also a possibility of improving efficiency through market  legal  and regulatory remedies  as discussed above 
Natural monopoly  or the overlapping concepts of  practical  and  technical  monopoly  is an extreme case of failure of competition as a restraint on producers  Extreme economies of scale are one possible cause 
Public goods are goods which are under supplied in a typical market  The defining features are that people can consume public goods without having to pay for them and that more than one person can consume the good at the same time 
Externalities occur where there are significant social costs or benefits from production or consumption that are not reflected in market prices  For example  air pollution may generate a negative externality  and education may generate a positive externality  less crime  etc    Governments often tax and otherwise restrict the sale of goods that have negative externalities and subsidise or otherwise promote the purchase of goods that have positive externalities in an effort to correct the price distortions caused by these externalities               Elementary demand and supply theory predicts equilibrium but not the speed of adjustment for changes of equilibrium due to a shift in demand or supply              
In many areas  some form of price stickiness is postulated to account for quantities  rather than prices  adjusting in the short run to changes on the demand side or the supply side  This includes standard analysis of the business cycle in macroeconomics  Analysis often revolves around causes of such price stickiness and their implications for reaching a hypothesised long run equilibrium  Examples of such price stickiness in particular markets include wage rates in labour markets and posted prices in markets deviating from perfect competition 
Some specialised fields of economics deal in market failure more than others  The economics of the public sector is one example  Much environmental economics concerns externalities or  public bads  
Policy options include regulations that reflect cost benefit analysis or market solutions that change incentives  such as emission fees or redefinition of property rights              

Welfare
Main article  Welfare economics
Welfare economics uses microeconomics techniques to evaluate well being from allocation of productive factors as to desirability and economic efficiency within an economy  often relative to competitive general equilibrium               It analyses social welfare  however measured  in terms of economic activities of the individuals that compose the theoretical society considered  Accordingly  individuals  with associated economic activities  are the basic units for aggregating to social welfare  whether of a group  a community  or a society  and there is no  social welfare  apart from the  welfare  associated with its individual units 

Macroeconomics
Main article  Macroeconomics
The circulation of money in an economy in a macroeconomic model  In this model  the use of natural resources and the generation of waste  such as greenhouse gases  is not included 
Macroeconomics  another branch of economics  examines the economy as a whole to explain broad aggregates and their interactions  top down   that is  using a simplified form of general equilibrium theory               Such aggregates include national income and output  the unemployment rate  and price inflation and subaggregates like total consumption and investment spending and their components  It also studies effects of monetary policy and fiscal policy 
Since at least the     s  macroeconomics has been characterised by further integration as to micro based modelling of sectors  including rationality of players  efficient use of market information  and imperfect competition               This has addressed a long standing concern about inconsistent developments of the same subject              
Macroeconomic analysis also considers factors affecting the long term level and growth of national income  Such factors include capital accumulation  technological change and labour force growth              

Growth
Main article  Economic growth
Growth economics studies factors that explain economic growth        the increase in output per capita of a country over a long period of time  The same factors are used to explain differences in the level of output per capita between countries  in particular why some countries grow faster than others  and whether countries converge at the same rates of growth 
Much studied factors include the rate of investment  population growth  and technological change  These are represented in theoretical and empirical forms  as in the neoclassical and endogenous growth models  and in growth accounting              

Business cycle
Main article  Business cycle
See also  Circular flow of income  Aggregate supply  Aggregate demand  and Unemployment
A basic illustration of a business cycle
The economics of a depression were the spur for the creation of  macroeconomics  as a separate discipline  During the Great Depression of the     s  John Maynard Keynes authored a book entitled The General Theory of Employment  Interest and Money outlining the key theories of Keynesian economics  Keynes contended that aggregate demand for goods might be insufficient during economic downturns  leading to unnecessarily high unemployment and losses of potential output 
He therefore advocated active policy responses by the public sector  including monetary policy actions by the central bank and fiscal policy actions by the government to stabilise output over the business cycle               Thus  a central conclusion of Keynesian economics is that  in some situations  no strong automatic mechanism moves output and employment towards full employment levels  John Hicks  IS LM model has been the most influential interpretation of The General Theory 
Over the years  understanding of the business cycle has branched into various research programmes  mostly related to or distinct from Keynesianism  The neoclassical synthesis refers to the reconciliation of Keynesian economics with classical economics  stating that Keynesianism is correct in the short run but qualified by classical like considerations in the intermediate and long run             
New classical macroeconomics  as distinct from the Keynesian view of the business cycle  posits market clearing with imperfect information  It includes Friedman s permanent income hypothesis on consumption and  rational expectations  theory               led by Robert Lucas  and real business cycle theory              
In contrast  the new Keynesian approach retains the rational expectations assumption  however it assumes a variety of market failures  In particular  New Keynesians assume prices and wages are  sticky   which means they do not adjust instantaneously to changes in economic conditions              
Thus  the new classicals assume that prices and wages adjust automatically to attain full employment  whereas the new Keynesians see full employment as being automatically achieved only in the long run  and hence government and central bank policies are needed because the  long run  may be very long 

Unemployment
Main article  Unemployment
The U S  unemployment rate from      to     
The amount of unemployment in an economy is measured by the unemployment rate  the percentage of workers without jobs in the labour force  The labour force only includes workers actively looking for jobs  People who are retired  pursuing education  or discouraged from seeking work by a lack of job prospects are excluded from the labour force  Unemployment can be generally broken down into several types that are related to different causes              
Classical models of unemployment occurs when wages are too high for employers to be willing to hire more workers  Consistent with classical unemployment  frictional unemployment occurs when appropriate job vacancies exist for a worker  but the length of time needed to search for and find the job leads to a period of unemployment              
Structural unemployment covers a variety of possible causes of unemployment including a mismatch between workers  skills and the skills required for open jobs               Large amounts of structural unemployment can occur when an economy is transitioning industries and workers find their previous set of skills are no longer in demand  Structural unemployment is similar to frictional unemployment since both reflect the problem of matching workers with job vacancies  but structural unemployment covers the time needed to acquire new skills not just the short term search process              
While some types of unemployment may occur regardless of the condition of the economy  cyclical unemployment occurs when growth stagnates  Okun s law represents the empirical relationship between unemployment and economic growth               The original version of Okun s law states that a    increase in output would lead to a    decrease in unemployment              

Money and monetary policy
Main article  Monetary policy
See also  Monetary economics and History of money
Money is a means of final payment for goods in most price system economies  and is the unit of account in which prices are typically stated  Money has general acceptability  relative consistency in value  divisibility  durability  portability  elasticity in supply  and longevity with mass public confidence  It includes currency held by the nonbank public and checkable deposits  It has been described as a social convention  like language  useful to one largely because it is useful to others  In the words of Francis Amasa Walker  a well known   th century economist   Money is what money does    Money is that money does  in the original               
As a medium of exchange  money facilitates trade  It is essentially a measure of value and more importantly  a store of value being a basis for credit creation  Its economic function can be contrasted with barter  non monetary exchange   Given a diverse array of produced goods and specialised producers  barter may entail a hard to locate double coincidence of wants as to what is exchanged  say apples and a book  Money can reduce the transaction cost of exchange because of its ready acceptability  Then it is less costly for the seller to accept money in exchange  rather than what the buyer produces              
Monetary policy is the policy that central banks conduct to accomplish their broader objectives  Most central banks in developed countries follow inflation targeting               whereas the main objective for many central banks in development countries is to uphold a fixed exchange rate system               The primary monetary tool is normally the adjustment of interest rates               either directly via administratively changing the central bank s own interest rates or indirectly via open market operations               Via the monetary transmission mechanism  interest rate changes affect investment  consumption and net export  and hence aggregate demand  output and employment  and ultimately the development of wages and inflation 

Fiscal policy
Main articles  Fiscal policy  Government spending  and Tax
Governments implement fiscal policy to influence macroeconomic conditions by adjusting spending and taxation policies to alter aggregate demand  When aggregate demand falls below the potential output of the economy  there is an output gap where some productive capacity is left unemployed  Governments increase spending and cut taxes to boost aggregate demand  Resources that have been idled can be used by the government 
For example  unemployed home builders can be hired to expand highways  Tax cuts allow consumers to increase their spending  which boosts aggregate demand  Both tax cuts and spending have multiplier effects where the initial increase in demand from the policy percolates through the economy and generates additional economic activity 
The effects of fiscal policy can be limited by crowding out  When there is no output gap  the economy is producing at full capacity and there are no excess productive resources  If the government increases spending in this situation  the government uses resources that otherwise would have been used by the private sector  so there is no increase in overall output  Some economists think that crowding out is always an issue while others do not think it is a major issue when output is depressed 
Sceptics of fiscal policy also make the argument of Ricardian equivalence  They argue that an increase in debt will have to be paid for with future tax increases  which will cause people to reduce their consumption and save money to pay for the future tax increase  Under Ricardian equivalence  any boost in demand from tax cuts will be offset by the increased saving intended to pay for future higher taxes 

Inequality
Main article  Economic inequality
Economic inequality includes income inequality  measured using the distribution of income  the amount of money people receive   and wealth inequality measured using the distribution of wealth  the amount of wealth people own   and other measures such as consumption  land ownership  and human capital  Inequality exists at different extents between countries or states  groups of people  and individuals               There are many methods for measuring inequality               the Gini coefficient being widely used for income differences among individuals  An example measure of inequality between countries is the Inequality adjusted Human Development Index  a composite index that takes inequality into account               Important concepts of equality include equity  equality of outcome  and equality of opportunity 
Research has linked economic inequality to political and social instability  including revolution  democratic breakdown and civil conflict                                                      Research suggests that greater inequality hinders economic growth and macroeconomic stability  and that land and human capital inequality reduce growth more than inequality of income                            Inequality is at the centre stage of economic policy debate across the globe  as government tax and spending policies have significant effects on income distribution               In advanced economies  taxes and transfers decrease income inequality by one third  with most of this being achieved via public social spending  such as pensions and family benefits               

Other branches of economics
Public economics
Main article  Public economics
Public economics is the field of economics that deals with economic activities of a public sector  usually government  The subject addresses such matters as tax incidence  who really pays a particular tax   cost benefit analysis of government programmes  effects on economic efficiency and income distribution of different kinds of spending and taxes  and fiscal politics  The latter  an aspect of public choice theory  models public sector behaviour analogously to microeconomics  involving interactions of self interested voters  politicians  and bureaucrats              
Much of economics is positive  seeking to describe and predict economic phenomena  Normative economics seeks to identify what economies ought to be like 
Welfare economics is a normative branch of economics that uses microeconomic techniques to simultaneously determine the allocative efficiency within an economy and the income distribution associated with it  It attempts to measure social welfare by examining the economic activities of the individuals that comprise society              

International economics
Main article  International economics
List of countries by gross domestic product  PPP  per capita in April     
International trade studies determinants of goods and services flows across international boundaries  It also concerns the size and distribution of gains from trade  Policy applications include estimating the effects of changing tariff rates and trade quotas  International finance is a macroeconomic field which examines the flow of capital across international borders  and the effects of these movements on exchange rates  Increased trade in goods  services and capital between countries is a major effect of contemporary globalisation              

Labour economics
Main article  Labour economics
Labour economics seeks to understand the functioning and dynamics of the markets for wage labour  Labour markets function through the interaction of workers and employers  Labour economics looks at the suppliers of labour services  workers   the demands of labour services  employers   and attempts to understand the resulting pattern of wages  employment  and income  In economics  labour is a measure of the work done by human beings  It is conventionally contrasted with such other factors of production as land and capital  There are theories which have developed a concept called human capital  referring to the skills that workers possess  not necessarily their actual work   although there are also counter posing macro economic system theories that think human capital is a contradiction in terms      citation needed     

Development economics
Main article  Development economics
Development economics examines economic aspects of the economic development process in relatively low income countries focusing on structural change  poverty  and economic growth  Approaches in development economics frequently incorporate social and political factors

Gary Becker in      presented an economic theory of social interactions  whose applications included the family  charity  merit goods and multiperson interactions  and envy and hatred               He and Kevin Murphy authored a book in      that analysed market behaviour in a social environment              

Profession
Main article  Economist
The professionalisation of economics  reflected in the growth of graduate programmes on the subject  has been described as  the main change in economics since around                     Most major universities and many colleges have a major  school  or department in which academic degrees are awarded in the subject  whether in the liberal arts  business  or for professional study  See Bachelor of Economics and Master of Economics 
In the private sector  professional economists are employed as consultants and in industry  including banking and finance  Economists also work for various government departments and agencies  for example  the national treasury  central bank or National Bureau of Statistics  See Economic analyst 
There are dozens of prizes awarded to economists each year for outstanding intellectual contributions to the field  the most prominent of which is the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences  though it is not a Nobel Prize 
Contemporary economics uses mathematics  Economists draw on the tools of calculus  linear algebra  statistics  game theory  and computer science               Professional economists are expected to be familiar with these tools  while a minority specialise in econometrics and mathematical methods

Notes


   Capital  in Smith s usage includes fixed capital and circulating capital  The latter includes wages and labour maintenance  money  and inputs from land  mines  and fisheries associated with production             

   This science indicates the cases in which commerce is truly productive  where whatever is gained by one is lost by another  and where it is profitable to all  it also teaches us to appreciate its several processes  but simply in their results  at which it stops  Besides this knowledge  the merchant must also understand the processes of his art  He must be acquainted with the commodities in which he deals  their qualities and defects  the countries from which they are derived  their markets  the means of their transportation  the values to be given for them in exchange  and the method of keeping accounts  The same remark is applicable to the agriculturist  to the manufacturer  and to the practical man of business  to acquire a thorough knowledge of the causes and consequences of each phenomenon  the study of political economy is essentially necessary to them all  and to become expert in his particular pursuit  each one must add thereto a knowledge of its processes    Say       p       XVI  

   And when we submit the definition in question to this test  it is seen to possess deficiencies which  so far from being marginal and subsidiary  amount to nothing less than a complete failure to exhibit either the scope or the significance of the most central generalisations of all    Robbins       p          

   The conception we have adopted may be described as analytical  It does not attempt to pick out certain kinds of behaviour  but focuses attention on a particular aspect of behaviour  the form imposed by the influence of scarcity   Robbins       p           

  Compare with Nicholas Barr         whose list of market failures is melded with failures of economic assumptions  which are     producers as price takers  i e  presence of oligopoly or monopoly  but why is this not a product of the following       equal power of consumers  what labour lawyers call an imbalance of bargaining power      complete markets     public goods     external effects  i e  externalities       increasing returns to scale  i e  practical monopoly      perfect information  in The Economics of the Welfare State   th      ed    Oxford University Press        pp              ISBN                                         Joseph E  Stiglitz        classifies market failures as from failure of competition  including natural monopoly   information asymmetries  incomplete markets  externalities  public good situations  and macroeconomic disturbances  in  Chapter    Market Failure   Economics of the Public Sector   th International Student      ed    W W  Norton  amp  Company        pp               ISBN
