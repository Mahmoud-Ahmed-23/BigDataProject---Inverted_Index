The International Energy Agency  IEA  is a Paris based autonomous intergovernmental organization  established in       that provides policy recommendations  analysis and data on the global energy sector             The    member countries and               association countries of the IEA represent     of global energy demand            
The IEA was set up under the framework of the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development  OECD  in the aftermath of the      oil crisis to respond to physical disruptions in global oil supplies  provide data and statistics about the global oil market and energy sector  promote energy savings and conservation  and establish international technical collaboration             Since its founding  the IEA has also coordinated use of the oil reserves that its members are required to hold 
By regularly underestimating the role of renewable energies and overestimating the growth of nuclear energy  the IEA promotes the nuclear industry            
In subsequent decades  the IEA s role expanded to cover the entire global energy system  encompassing traditional fuels such as gas  and coal as well as cleaner and fast growing energy sources and technologies including renewable energy sources  solar photovoltaics  wind power  biofuels as well as nuclear power  and hydrogen  and the critical minerals needed for these technologies 
The core activity of the IEA is providing policy advice to its member states and Associated countries to support their energy security and advance their transition to clean energy             Recently  it has focused in particular on supporting global efforts to accelerate clean energy transition  mitigate climate change  reach net zero emissions  and prevent global temperatures from rising above           C                        All IEA member countries have signed the Paris Agreement which aims to limit warming to           C  and two thirds of IEA member governments have made commitments to emission neutrality by      

The Embassy of Australia  Paris  where the IEA headquarters are located
The IEA s current executive director is Fatih Birol  who took office in late                              IEA publishes a range of reports and other information including its flagship publication  the annual World Energy Outlook  as well as the Net Zero by      report                                     


History edit 
The IEA was founded on November           after the      oil crisis  to avoid future shocks by helping to ensure reliable energy supplies  promote energy efficiency  ensure energy security and encourage technological research and innovation                        
The Agreement on an International Energy Program  IEP Agreement  established the mandates and structure of the IEA  chartering it as an autonomous organisation under the umbrella of the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development  OECD              In       the IEA relocated its headquarters from the Ch teau de la Muette  which it shared with the OECD  to commercially leased space located within the Embassy of Australia  Paris             
The IEA operates autonomously  with its own budget and governance structure  The organization began with    founding member countries             and has since expanded to     with the latest addition being Lithuania in       Full members of the IEA must also be members of the OECD and are required to hold    days worth of oil imports as emergency stocks  These emergency stocks can be released to stabilize oil markets worldwide and have been activated five times  January      due to the Gulf War       after devastation in the Gulf of Mexico from hurricanes Katrina and Rita       during the Libyan crisis  and twice in      in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine                        
In addition to the emergency release mechanism  the IEA s initial mandates include reducing dependence on oil  developing alternative energy sources  energy research and development  and collaboration with oil producing companies and countries to create a stable energy market  Members are expected to draw up plans on demand reduction and efficiency measures that can be implemented during energy emergencies 
In       the IEA s chief economist Fatih Birol was appointed executive director  the first time an official from within the organization was picked to lead it              They have a mandate to modernize the agency on three major pillars  broadening the IEA s mandate on energy security beyond oil to include natural gas and electricity  increasing engagement in emerging economies through new Association partnerships  and expanding the IEA s core focus on clean energy technology and energy efficiency                        

IEA chief Fatih Birol called on policymakers to do more to speed up the energy transition and reduce emissions 
The new category of  Association countries  was created in                   allowing countries that do not fit the criteria for IEA membership to become affiliated with the organization and participate in its work              China  Indonesia  and Thailand were the first to join and the IEA now has thirteen            Association countries  including Ukraine since July                               IEA member and Association countries represent over     of global energy consumption            
In       IEA chief Fatih Birol called on policymakers to do more to accelerate the clean energy transition and reduce emissions  saying that  Clean energy technologies are slowly but surely going to replace the existing energy industry                          
After the IEA s      Ministerial meeting  a bi annual high level meeting of IEA countries  member countries once again expanded the organisation s mandate to include accelerating the global clean energy transition by  supporting countries in the global effort to attain net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector by mid century                          The  IEA      mandate also doubles down on strengthening energy security and recognizes the importance of tracking critical minerals and materials to the clean energy transition

Areas of work edit 
The IEA produces analyses on all energy sources and technologies  on global and regional markets  as well as specific country level reports and studies on key technologies  minerals  and materials for the clean energy transition  It also produces comprehensive data and statistics for over     countries 
The IEA s analytical work is split into various categories including policy recommendations  tracking  market forecasts  technical roadmapping  and scenario analysis 

Data edit 
The IEA publishes comprehensive data  statistics  and analysis that inform national energy policies and support long term planning for energy sector investments  The IEA analyses and releases data and information on trends in energy supply  demand  prices  public research and development  and energy efficiency metrics  The data also serves to track short  and long term trends in countries energy transitions             
The Policies and Measures Database  PAMS  makes available to the public data on government policies and programs to reduce carbon emissions  support energy efficiency  and improve the development and use of renewable and clean energy sources  The database compiles data from several IEA and International Renewable Energy Agency  IRENA  data sources dating back to      and includes information on past  current  and planned policy measures             

Scenarios edit 
IEA publications give projections based on sets of assumptions called scenarios  Currently used scenarios include 

Stated Policies Scenario  STEPS   Assumes implementation of governments  existing policies and firm commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions             
Announced Pledges Scenario  APS   Assumes implementation of policies as in the STEPS  and also assumes fulfillment of looser pledges that are not yet backed by policy and legislation             
Net Zero Scenario  NZE   Assumes implementation of the IEA s pathway to net zero emissions by      while minimising cost and meeting key UN Sustainable Development Goals                         
Older scenarios include 

    Scenario  Environmental groups have become critical                         of the IEA s     Scenario  created to align with the      Copenhagen Accord   contending it does not align with up to date climate science  nor is it consistent with the Paris climate agreement that aspires to limit global warming to     degrees Celsius  In March       the IEA  along with IRENA  published a report             that considers a safer climate scenario than their current    S  This scenario offers improved chances of limiting global warming to less than two degrees  but   according to research organization Oil Change International   still falls short of adequately addressing climate science and the decarbonization required to reach agreed upon global climate limits              The IEA has stopped updating this safer climate scenario
Sustainable Development Scenario  Concerns regarding the IEA s Sustainable Development Scenario  the successor to the     scenario  has also been raised by climate scientists and key financial institutions  who have called for     C scenario placed centrally in the World Energy Outlook             The IEA s Sustainable Development Scenario only gets to net zero by       two decades too late 
Key publications edit 
World Energy Outlook  WEO 

This section is an excerpt from World Energy Outlook  edit 
The annual World Energy Outlook  WEO  is the International Energy Agency s  IEA  flagship publication on global energy projections and analysis              It contains medium to long term energy market projections  extensive statistics  analysis and advice for both governments and the energy business regarding energy security  environmental protection and economic development  The first WEO was published in      and it has been an annual publication since                  

The World Energy Outlook uses three scenarios to examine future energy trends  The Net Zero Emissions by      Scenario is normative  in that it is designed to achieve specific outcomes   an emissions trajectory consistent with keeping the temperature rise in      below           C  with a     probability   universal access to modern energy services and major improvements in air quality   and shows a pathway to reach it              The Announced Pledges Scenario  and the Stated Policies Scenario are exploratory  in that they define a set of starting conditions  such as policies and targets  and then see where they lead based on model representations of energy systems  including market dynamics and technological progress  The scenarios are not predictions but enable policy makers and other readers to compare different possible versions of the future and the levers and actions that produce them  with the aim of stimulating insights about the future of global energy             
A      report on renewable energy
Net Zero by       a roadmap for the global energy sector
Net Zero by      was published in May      and presented the first comprehensive pathway for the global energy sector to reach net zero emissions by       The report introduced the Net Zero Emissions scenario  showing how to transition to net zero by      while maintaining secure and affordable energy supplies  extending energy access  and encouraging robust economic growth  The report was the basis for a game created by the IEA and the Financial Times in which players compete to see if they can reduce emissions to net zero                          
Energy Technology Perspectives  ETP

Country Reviews
Since       the IEA has published in depth energy policy reviews  These country policy reviews are typically conducted every five years for member countries  and cover the full range of the country s energy systems and policies  with recent reports placing particular focus on progress towards reaching climate goals  The most recent reports were on Norway  Poland  Belgium  and Canada  The IEA also produces in depth energy reviews of its accession and association countries  as well as partner countries             

Energy Efficiency edit 
In its focus on energy efficiency  the IEA convenes policy leaders and other stakeholders with an eye toward scaling up progress on energy efficiency as a way to mitigate climate change  contribute to energy security  and deliver economic  and support economies and communities              The IEA has created Energy Efficiency Indicators based on over ten years of data to highlight the drivers of individual nations  energy use in order to track energy efficiency and improve national policies  The data covers major sectors such as residential services  industry  and transport             

Clean Energy Transitions Programme edit 
CETP s focus is to  accelerate global clean energy transitions  particularly in major emerging economies   The program supports governments whose energy policies will be key to the global energy transition and involves collaborative analytics  technology cooperation  stakeholder convenings  and training and capacity building  CETP has identified Brazil  China  India  Indonesia  Mexico  and South Africa as priority countries as well as the regions of Southeast Asia  Latin America and Africa                         

People Centered Clean Energy Transition edit 
As part of its work on the energy transition  the IEA convenes the Global Commission for People Centred Clean Energy Transitions to  ensure the benefits and costs involved in the transformation of our energy system are distributed fairly and in a way that protects the most vulnerable in society   The approach focuses on skill development  jobs  worker protections  economic development  equity and fairness  social inclusion  and engaging individuals as stakeholders in the process              The commission is composed of national leaders  government ministers  and representatives from civil society  In October       the Commission published a report for twelve recommendations for a people centered approach to the clean energy transition                         

Resilience of the Energy Sector to Climate Change Impacts edit 
Given the implications of climate change impacts for energy security  the IEA also works to understand climate impacts on energy systems and provide guidance on measures to improve their resilience to these impacts  This includes an assessment of hydropower under different climate scenarios                                     and a report focused on climate hazards for power systems and measures to enhance their climate resilience              The IEA also provides an overview of the level of climate hazards in its member countries  along with key planning and policy documents to address energy sector climate resilience             

Technology Collaboration Programs  TCPs  edit 
TCPs provide support to independent  international groups of government and industry experts to research  develop  and commercialise energy technologies and related issues  Over       experts are involved in TCPs across approximately     organisations in    countries  Examples of TCPs include the Energy in Buildings and Communities  EBC   Photovoltaic Power Systems  PVPS   and Hybrid and Electric Vehicles  HEV  

Criticism edit 
Bias against renewable energy edit 
Real development of global photovoltaics additions vs  predictions by the IEA           
The IEA has been criticised for systematically underestimating the role of renewable energy sources in future energy systems such as photovoltaics and their cost reductions                                     
In the past  the IEA has been criticized by environmental groups for underplaying the role of renewable energy technologies in favor of nuclear             and fossil fuels              In       Guy Pearse stated that the IEA has consistently underestimated the potential for renewable energy alternatives             
The Energy Watch Group  EWG   a coalition of scientists and politicians which analyses official energy industry predictions  claims that the IEA has had an institutional bias towards traditional energy sources and has been using  misleading data  to undermine the case for renewable energy  such as wind and solar  A      EWG report compares IEA projections about the growth of wind power capacity and finds that it has consistently underestimated the amount of energy the wind power industry can deliver             
For example  in       the IEA predicted global wind electricity generation would total      GW by       but EWG s report states that this level was reached by the end of                   The report also said that the IEA has not learned the lesson of previous underestimates  and last year net additions of wind power globally were four times greater than the average IEA estimate from its           predictions              This pattern seems to have continued through                  
In a press release  the IEA stated that      of the increase in global electricity generation in      was provided by renewable sources and nuclear   placing nuclear power production alongside renewable energy sources as if both were being expanded on a grand scale  While it announced that renewables were expanded by     GW              it concealed the fact that nuclear power capacity was not even expanded by a hundredth of this  namely      GW              In the document announced with the press release  it states the increase in nuclear power capacity at   GW              but conceals the fact that  according to its own figures       GW were lost in the same year due to the shutdown of nuclear power plants             
Amid discontent from across the renewables sector at the IEA s performance as a global energy watchdog  the International Renewable Energy Agency was formed on January           The aim is to have the agency fully operational by      with an initial annual budget of    M             
The IEA s current forecasts for solar power do not accord with the exponential growth in the sector  The misleading projections have perpetuated the impression that the growth of solar power requires huge subsidies  and has the potential to discourage investment in solar energy market and consequently  hold back even faster growth                         

Accuracy of forecasting edit 
Ahead of the launch of the      World Energy Outlook  the British daily newspaper The Guardian  referring to an unidentified senior IEA official  alleged that the agency was deliberately downplaying the risk of peak oil under pressures from the US  According to a second unidentified former senior IEA official it was  imperative not to anger the Americans  and that the world has already entered the  peak oil zone              
The Guardian also referred to a team of scientists from Uppsala University in Sweden who studied the      World Energy Outlook and concluded the forecasts of the IEA were unattainable  According to their peer reviewed report  oil production in      would not exceed    million barrels per day                 m  d  while the IEA forecasts a production of     million barrels per day                 m  d   The lead author of the report  Kjell Aleklett  has claimed that IEA s reports are  political documents               Other research from the same group has thoroughly reviewed oil projections done by the IEA World Energy Outlook             
The anticorruption NGO Global Witness wrote in its report Heads in the Sand that  Global Witness  analysis demonstrates that the Agency continues to retain an overly optimistic  and therefore misleading  view about potential future oil production   According to Global Witness   the Agency s over confidence  despite credible data  external analysis and underlying fundamentals all strongly suggesting a more precautionary approach  has had a disastrous global impact              
In       the IEA predicted that demand for fossil fuels such as oil  natural gas and coal would reach an all time high by                   OPEC rejected the IEA s forecast  saying  what makes such predictions so dangerous  is that they are often accompanied by calls to stop investing in new oil and gas projects                           The IEA forecasts that ammonia will meet approximately     of shipping fuel demands by                  

Restricting access to data edit 
In       the IEA was publicly criticized by more than    international academics and researchers at Our World in Data for publishing its detailed  global energy data behind paywalls    making  it unusable in the public discourse and  preventing  many researchers from accessing it                                                       The authors of the Our World in Data open letter suggested that  countries that fund the IEA drop the requirement to place data behind paywalls and increase their funding               
In January       the IEA announced plans to make all its data and analyses freely available and open access  a move endorsed by its executive director and governing board  This initiative was awaiting final endorsement from IEA member countries to become effective              
In October       the IEA made the World Energy Outlook      dataset available for non commercial use under a Creative Commons license  This dataset encompasses global aggregated data for various scenarios  alongside detailed regional and country specific data up to                   

US shale edit 
In       the IEA was criticized at the World Economic Forum by Saudi Arabia s Oil Minister Al Falih  for hyping the US shale oil industry amid forecasts of oversupply for the oil market in their January Oil Market Report  Al Falih was exasperated with those claims  arguing that natural depletion  and strong demand growth meant that there was plenty of room for new supplies  while the shale drillers would not crash the market  He further said that the IEA is overstating the role of shale in a global market  and how the core job of the IEA  is not to take things out of context
