AI assisted marketing
This article is about the use of article intelligence  AI  in marketing  For the marketing of AI products  see Artificial intelligence marketing 

The fields of marketing and artificial intelligence converge in systems which assist in areas such as market forecasting  and automation of processes and decision making  along with increased efficiency of tasks which would usually be performed by humans  The science behind these systems can be explained through neural networks and expert systems  computer programs that process input and provide valuable output for marketers 
Artificial intelligence systems stemming from social computing technology can be applied to understand social networks on the Web  Data mining techniques can be used to analyze different types of social networks  This analysis helps a marketer to identify influential actors or nodes within networks  information which can then be applied to take a societal marketing approach 


Artificial neural networks edit 
An artificial neural network is a form of computer program modeled on the brain and nervous system of humans             Neural networks are composed of a series of interconnected processing neurons that function in unison to achieve certain outcomes  
Using  human like trial and error learning methods neural networks detect patterns existing within a data set ignoring data that is not significant while emphasizing the data which is most influential             
From a marketing perspective  neural networks are a form of software tool used to assist in decision making  Neural networks are effective in gathering and extracting information from large data sources and have the ability to identify cause and effect within tha data                        These neural nets through the process of learning  identify relationships and connections between databases  Once knowledge has been accumulated  neural networks can be relied on to provide generalizations and can apply past knowledge and learning to a variety of situations            
Neural networks help fulfill the role of marketing companies through effectively aiding in market segmentation and measurement of performance while reducing costs and improving accuracy  Due to their learning ability  flexibility  adaption  and knowledge discovery  neural networks offer many advantages over traditional models             Neural networks can be used to assist in pattern classification  forecasting and marketing analysis 

Pattern classification edit 
Classification of customers can be facilitated through the neural network approach allowing companies to make informed marketing decisions  An example of this was employed by Spiegel Inc   a firm dealing in direct mail operations that used neural networks to improve efficiencies  Using software developed by NeuralWare Inc   Spiegel identified the demographics of customers who had made a single purchase and those customers who had made repeat purchases  Neural networks where then able to identify the key patterns and consequently identify the customers that were most likely to repeat purchase  Understanding this information allowed Spiegel to streamline marketing efforts  and reduced costs            

Forecasting edit 
Sales forecasting  is the process of estimating future events with the goal of providing benchmarks for monitoring actual performance and reducing uncertainty              Artificial intelligence techniques have emerged to facilitate the process of forecasting through increasing accuracy in the areas of demand for products  distribution  employee turnover  performance measurement  and inventory control             An example of forecasting using neural networks is the Airline Marketing Assistant Tactician  an application developed by BehabHeuristics which allows for the forecasting of passenger demand and consequent seat allocation through neural networks  This system has been used by National air Canada and USAir            

Marketing analysis edit 
Neural networks provide a useful alternative to traditional statistical models due to their reliability  time saving characteristics and ability to recognize patterns from incomplete or noisy data                        Examples of marketing analysis systems includes the Target Marketing System developed by Churchull Systems for Veratex Corporation  This support system scans a market database to identify dormant customers allowing management to make decisions regarding which key customers to target            
When performing marketing analysis  neural networks can assist in the gathering and processing of information ranging from consumer demographics and credit history to the purchase patterns of consumers            
AI is allowing organizations to  deliver an ad experience that is more personalized for each user  shapes the customer journey  influences purchasing decisions  and builds brand loyalty    How    AI technology allows marketers to separate their consumers into distinct personas and understand what motivates their consumers  Here they can then focus on the specific needs of their audience and create a long lasting relationship with the brand  Kushmaro   Ultimately brands want to create that loyalty with a consumer  and AI will allow them to better achieve this   Pini Yakuel  founder and CEO of Optimove   By analyzing customers based on their movement among segments over time  we can achieve dynamic micro segmentation and predict future behavior in a very accurate fashion    Kushmaro   Being able to predict future behaviors of consumers is very important  This way marketers can specifically market to consumers based on their current behaviors and the predictions of their future behaviors  This will allow for a loyal relationship between the consumer and the brand and will ultimately help businesses 

Application of artificial intelligence to marketing decision making edit 
Marketing is a complex field of decision making which involves a large degree of both judgment and intuition on behalf of the marketer              The enormous increase in complexity that the individual decision maker faces renders the decision making process almost an impossible task  The marketing decision engine can help distill the noise  The generation of more efficient management procedures have been recognized as a necessity              The application of Artificial intelligence to decision making through a decision support system has the ability to aid the decision maker in dealing with uncertainty in decision problems   Artificial intelligence techniques are increasingly extending decision support through analyzing trends  providing forecasts  reducing information overload  enabling communication required for collaborative decisions  and allowing for up to date information             

The structure of marketing decisions edit 
Organizations strive to satisfy the needs of the customers  paying specific attention to their desires  A consumer orientated approach requires the production of goods and services that align with these needs  Understanding consumer behavior aids the marketer in making appropriate decisions  Thus  decision making is dependent on the marketing problem  the decision maker  and the decision environment             

Expert system edit 
An expert system is a software program that combines the knowledge of experts in an attempt to solve problems through emulating the knowledge and reasoning procedures of the experts  Each expert system has the ability to process data  and then through reasoning  transform it into evaluations  judgments  and opinions  thus providing advises to specialized problems             
The use of an expert system that applies to the field of marketing is MARKEX  Market Expert   These Intelligent decision support systems act as consultants for marketers  supporting the decision maker in different stages  specifically in the new product development process  The software provides a systematic analysis that uses various methods of forecasting  data analysis and multi criteria decision making to select the most appropriate penetration strategy              BRANDFRAME is another example of a system developed to assist marketers in the decision making process  The system supports a brand manager in terms of identifying the brand s attributes  retail channels  competing brands  targets  and budgets   New marketing input is fed into the system where BRANDFRAME analyses the data  Recommendations are made by the system in regard to marketing mix instruments  such as lowering the price or starting a sales promotional campaign 

Artificial intelligence and automation efficiency edit 
Application to marketing automation edit 
In marketing  automation use of software to automate marketing processes that would have otherwise been performed manually  It assists in effectively allowing processes such as customer segmentation  campaign management  and product promotion  to be undertaken at a more efficient rate              Marketing automation is a key component of customer relationship management  CRM   Companies are using systems that employ data mining algorithms that analyze the customer database  giving further insight into the customer  This information may refer to socio economic characteristics  earlier interactions with the customer  and information about the purchase history of the customer              Various systems have been designed to give organizations control over their data  Automation tools allow the system to monitor the performance of campaigns  making regular adjustments to the campaigns to improve response rates and to provide campaign performance tracking             

Automation of distribution edit 
Distribution of products requires companies to access accurate data so they are able to respond to fluctuating trends in product demand  Automation processes are able to provide a comprehensive system that improves real time monitoring and intelligent control  
Amazon acquired Kiva Systems  the makers of the warehouse robot for      million in       Prior to the purchase of the automated system  human employees would have to walk the enormous warehouse  tracking and retrieving books  The Kiva robots are able to undertake order fulfillment  product replenishment  as well as heavy lifting  thus increasing efficiency for the company             

Use of artificial intelligence to analyze social networks on the web edit 
A social network is a social arrangement of actors who make up a group  within a network  there can be an array of ties and nodes that exemplifies common occurrences within a network and common relationships  Lui                     describes a social network as   the study of social entities  people in an organization  called actors   and their interactions and relationships  The interactions and relationships can be represented with a network or graph  where each vertex  or node  represents an actor and each link represents a relationship   At the present time there is a growth in virtual social networking with the common emergence of social networks being replicated online  for example  social networking sites such as Twitter  Facebook and LinkedIn  From a marketing perspective  analysis and simulation of these networks can help to understand consumer behavior and opinion  The use of Agent based social simulation techniques and data opinion mining to collect social knowledge of networks can help a marketer to understand their market and segments within it 

Social computing edit 
Social computing is the branch of technology that can be used by marketers to analyze social behaviors within networks and also allows for the creation of artificial social agents              Social computing provides the platform to create social based software  some earlier examples of social computing are such systems that allow a user to extract social information such as contact information from email accounts e g  addresses and companies titles from one s email using Conditional Random Field  CRFs  technology             

Data mining edit 
Data mining involves searching the Web for existing information namely opinions and feelings that are posted online among social networks    This area of study is called opinion mining or sentiment analysis  It analyzes peoples opinions  appraisals  attitudes  and emotions toward entities  individuals  issues  events  topics  and their attributes               However searching for this information and analysis of it can be a sizeable task  manually analyzing this information also presents the potential for researcher bias  Therefore  objective opinion analysis systems are suggested as a solution to this in the form of automated opinion mining and summarization systems  Marketers using this type of intelligence to make inferences about consumer opinion should be wary of what is called opinion spam  where fake opinions or reviews are posted in the web in order to influence potential consumers for or against a product or service             
Search engines are a common type of intelligence that seeks to learn what the user is interested in to present appropriate information  PageRank and HITS are examples of algorithms that search for information via hyperlinks  Google uses PageRank to control its search engine  Hyperlink based intelligence can be used to seek out web communities   which is described as   a cluster of densely linked pages representing a group of people with a common interest              
Centrality and prestige are types of measurement terms used to describe the level of common occurrences among a group of actors  the terms help to describe the level of influence and actor holds within a social network  Someone who has many ties within a network would be described as a  central  or  prestige  actor  Identifying these nodes within a social network is helpful for marketers to find out who are the trendsetters within social networks             

Social Media AI based tools edit
