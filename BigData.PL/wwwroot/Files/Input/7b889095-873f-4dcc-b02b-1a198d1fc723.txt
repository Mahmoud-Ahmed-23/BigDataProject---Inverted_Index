Philosophical study of morality
For other uses  see Ethics  disambiguation  


Ethics is the philosophical study of moral phenomena  Also called moral philosophy  it investigates normative questions about what people ought to do or which behavior is morally right  Its main branches include normative ethics  applied ethics  and metaethics 
Normative ethics aims to find general principles that govern how people should act  Applied ethics examines concrete ethical problems in real life situations  such as abortion  treatment of animals  and business practices  Metaethics explores the underlying assumptions and concepts of ethics  It asks whether there are objective moral facts  how moral knowledge is possible  and how moral judgments motivate people  Influential normative theories are consequentialism  deontology  and virtue ethics  According to consequentialists  an act is right if it leads to the best consequences  Deontologists focus on acts themselves  saying that they must adhere to duties  like telling the truth and keeping promises  Virtue ethics sees the manifestation of virtues  like courage and compassion  as the fundamental principle of morality 
Ethics is closely connected to value theory  which studies the nature and types of value  like the contrast between intrinsic and instrumental value  Moral psychology is a related empirical field and investigates psychological processes involved in morality  such as reasoning and the formation of character  Descriptive ethics describes the dominant moral codes and beliefs in different societies and considers their historical dimension 
The history of ethics started in the ancient period with the development of ethical principles and theories in ancient Egypt  India  China  and Greece  This period saw the emergence of ethical teachings associated with Hinduism  Buddhism  Confucianism  Daoism  and contributions of philosophers like Socrates and Aristotle  During the medieval period  ethical thought was strongly influenced by religious teachings  In the modern period  this focus shifted to a more secular approach concerned with moral experience  reasons for acting  and the consequences of actions  An influential development in the   th century was the emergence of metaethics 


Definition  edit 
According to Aristotle  how to lead a good life is one of the central questions of ethics            
Ethics  also called moral philosophy  is the study of moral phenomena  It is one of the main branches of philosophy and investigates the nature of morality and the principles that govern the moral evaluation of conduct  character traits  and institutions  It examines what obligations people have  what behavior is right and wrong  and how to lead a good life  Some of its key questions are  How should one live   and  What gives meaning to life               In contemporary philosophy  ethics is usually divided into normative ethics  applied ethics  and metaethics            
Morality is about what people ought to do rather than what they actually do  what they want to do  or what social conventions require  As a rational and systematic field of inquiry  ethics studies practical reasons why people should act one way rather than another  Most ethical theories seek universal principles that express a general standpoint of what is objectively right and wrong             In a slightly different sense  the term ethics can also refer to individual ethical theories in the form of a rational system of moral principles  such as Aristotelian ethics  and to a moral code that certain societies  social groups  or professions follow  as in Protestant work ethic and medical ethics            
The English word ethics has its roots in the Ancient Greek word  thos         meaning  character  and  personal disposition   This word gave rise to the Ancient Greek word  thik s           which was translated into Latin as ethica and entered the English language in the   th century through the Old French term  thique             The term morality originates in the Latin word moralis  meaning  manners  and  character   It was introduced into the English language during the Middle English period through the Old French term moralit             
The terms ethics and morality are usually used interchangeably but some philosophers distinguish between the two  According to one view  morality focuses on what moral obligations people have while ethics is broader and includes ideas about what is good and how to lead a meaningful life  Another difference is that codes of conduct in specific areas  such as business and environment  are usually termed ethics rather than morality  as in business ethics and environmental ethics            

Normative ethics edit 
Main article  Normative ethics
Normative ethics is the philosophical study of ethical conduct and investigates the fundamental principles of morality  It aims to discover and justify general answers to questions like  How should one live   and  How should people act    usually in the form of universal or domain independent principles that determine whether an act is right or wrong             For example  given the particular impression that it is wrong to set a child on fire for fun  normative ethics aims to find more general principles that explain why this is the case  like the principle that one should not cause extreme suffering to the innocent  which may itself be explained in terms of a more general principle              Many theories of normative ethics also aim to guide behavior by helping people make moral decisions             
Theories in normative ethics state how people should act or what kind of behavior is correct  They do not aim to describe how people normally act  what moral beliefs ordinary people have  how these beliefs change over time  or what ethical codes are upheld in certain social groups  These topics belong to descriptive ethics and are studied in fields like anthropology  sociology  and history rather than normative ethics             
Some systems of normative ethics arrive at a single principle covering all possible cases  Others encompass a small set of basic rules that address all or at least the most important moral considerations              One difficulty for systems with several basic principles is that these principles may conflict with each other in some cases and lead to ethical dilemmas             
Distinct theories in normative ethics suggest different principles as the foundation of morality  The three most influential schools of thought are consequentialism  deontology  and virtue ethics              These schools are usually presented as exclusive alternatives  but depending on how they are defined  they can overlap and do not necessarily exclude one another              In some cases  they differ in which acts they see as right or wrong  In other cases  they recommend the same course of action but provide different justifications for why it is right             

Consequentialism edit 
Main article  Consequentialism
Consequentialism  also called teleological ethics                  a      says that morality depends on consequences  According to the most common view  an act is right if it brings the best future  This means that there is no alternative course of action that has better consequences              A key aspect of consequentialist theories is that they provide a characterization of what is good and then define what is right in terms of what is good              For example  classical utilitarianism says that pleasure is good and that the action leading to the most overall pleasure is right              Consequentialism has been discussed indirectly since the formulation of classical utilitarianism in the late   th century  A more explicit analysis of this view happened in the   th century  when the term was coined by G  E  M  Anscombe             
Consequentialists usually understand the consequences of an action in a very wide sense that includes the totality of its effects  This is based on the idea that actions make a difference in the world by bringing about a causal chain of events that would not have existed otherwise              A core intuition behind consequentialism is that the future should be shaped to achieve the best possible outcome             
The act itself is usually not seen as part of the consequences  This means that if an act has intrinsic value or disvalue  it is not included as a factor  Some consequentialists see this as a flaw  saying that all value relevant factors need to be considered  They try to avoid this complication by including the act itself as part of the consequences  A related approach is to characterize consequentialism not in terms of consequences but in terms of outcome  with the outcome being defined as the act together with its consequences             
Most forms of consequentialism are agent neutral  This means that the value of consequences is assessed from a neutral perspective  that is  acts should have consequences that are good in general and not just good for the agent  It is controversial whether agent relative moral theories  like ethical egoism  should be considered as types of consequentialism             

Types edit 
There are many different types of consequentialism  They differ based on what type of entity they evaluate  what consequences they take into consideration  and how they determine the value of consequences              Most theories assess the moral value of acts  However  consequentialism can also be used to evaluate motives  character traits  rules  and policies             
Many types assess the value of consequences based on whether they promote happiness or suffering  But there are also alternative evaluative principles  such as desire satisfaction  autonomy  freedom  knowledge  friendship  beauty  and self perfection              Some forms of consequentialism hold that there is only a single source of value              The most prominent among them is classical utilitarianism  which states that the moral value of acts only depends on the pleasure and suffering they cause              An alternative approach says that there are many different sources of value  which all contribute to one overall value              Before the   th century  consequentialists were only concerned with the total of value or the aggregate good  In the   th century  alternative views were developed that additionally consider the distribution of value  One of them states that an equal distribution of goods is better than an unequal distribution even if the aggregate good is the same             
There are disagreements about which consequences should be assessed  An important distinction is between act consequentialism and rule consequentialism  According to act consequentialism  the consequences of an act determine its moral value  This means that there is a direct relation between the consequences of an act and its moral value  Rule consequentialism  by contrast  holds that an act is right if it follows a certain set of rules  Rule consequentialism determines the best rules by considering their outcomes at a community level  People should follow the rules that lead to the best consequences when everyone in the community follows them  This implies that the relation between an act and its consequences is indirect  For example  if telling the truth is one of the best rules  then according to rule consequentialism  a person should tell the truth even in specific cases where lying would lead to better consequences             
Another disagreement is between actual and expected consequentialism  According to the traditional view  only the actual consequences of an act affect its moral value  One difficulty of this view is that many consequences cannot be known in advance  This means that in some cases  even well planned and intentioned acts are morally wrong if they inadvertently lead to negative outcomes  An alternative perspective states that what matters are not the actual consequences but the expected consequences  This view takes into account that when deciding what to do  people have to rely on their limited knowledge of the total consequences of their actions  According to this view  a course of action has positive moral value despite leading to an overall negative outcome if it had the highest expected value  for example  because the negative outcome could not be anticipated or was unlikely             
A further difference is between maximizing and satisficing consequentialism  According to maximizing consequentialism  only the best possible act is morally permitted  This means that acts with positive consequences are wrong if there are alternatives with even better consequences  One criticism of maximizing consequentialism is that it demands too much by requiring that people do significantly more than they are socially expected to  For example  if the best action for someone with a good salary would be to donate     of their income to charity  it would be morally wrong for them to only donate      Satisficing consequentialism  by contrast  only requires that an act is  good enough  even if it is not the best possible alternative  According to this view  it is possible to do more than one is morally required to do                  b     
Mohism in ancient Chinese philosophy is one of the earliest forms of consequentialism  It arose in the  th century BCE and argued that political action should promote justice as a means to increase the welfare of the people             

Utilitarianism edit 
Main article  Utilitarianism
The most well known form of consequentialism is utilitarianism  In its classical form  it is an act consequentialism that sees happiness as the only source of intrinsic value  This means that an act is morally right if it produces  the greatest good for the greatest number  by increasing happiness and reducing suffering  Utilitarians do not deny that other things also have value  like health  friendship  and knowledge  However  they deny that these things have intrinsic value  Instead  they say that they have extrinsic value because they affect happiness and suffering  In this regard  they are desirable as a means but  unlike happiness  not as an end              The view that pleasure is the only thing with intrinsic value is called ethical or evaluative hedonism             

Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill are the founding fathers of classical utilitarianism             
Classical utilitarianism was initially formulated by Jeremy Bentham at the end of the   th century and further developed by John Stuart Mill  Bentham introduced the hedonic calculus to assess the value of consequences  Two key aspects of the hedonic calculus are the intensity and the duration of pleasure  According to this view  a pleasurable experience has a high value if it has a high intensity and lasts for a long time  A common criticism of Bentham s utilitarianism argued that its focus on the intensity of pleasure promotes an immoral lifestyle centered around indulgence in sensory gratification  Mill responded to this criticism by distinguishing between higher and lower pleasures  He stated that higher pleasures  like the intellectual satisfaction of reading a book  are more valuable than lower pleasures  like the sensory enjoyment of food and drink  even if their intensity and duration are the same              Since its original formulation  many variations of utilitarianism have developed  including the difference between act and rule utilitarianism and between maximizing and satisficing utilitarianism             

Deontology edit 
Main article  Deontology
Deontology assesses the moral rightness of actions based on a set of norms or principles  These norms describe the requirements that all actions need to follow              They may include principles like telling the truth  keeping promises  and not intentionally harming others              Unlike consequentialists  deontologists hold that the validity of general moral principles does not directly depend on their consequences  They state that these principles should be followed in every case since they express how actions are inherently right or wrong  According to moral philosopher David Ross  it is wrong to break a promise even if no harm comes from it              Deontologists are interested in which actions are right and often allow that there is a gap between what is right and what is good              Many focus on prohibitions and describe which acts are forbidden under any circumstances             

Agent centered and patient centered edit 
Agent centered deontological theories focus on the person who acts and the duties they have  Agent centered theories often focus on the motives and intentions behind people s actions  highlighting the importance of acting for the right reasons  They tend to be agent relative  meaning that the reasons for which people should act depend on personal circumstances  For example  a parent has a special obligation to their child  while a stranger does not have this kind of obligation toward a child they do not know  Patient centered theories  by contrast  focus on the people affected by actions and the rights they have  An example is the requirement to treat other people as ends and not merely as a means to an end              This requirement can be used to argue  for example  that it is wrong to kill a person against their will even if this act would save the lives of several others  Patient centered deontological theories are usually agent neutral  meaning that they apply equally to everyone in a situation  regardless of their specific role or position             

Kantianism edit 
Main article  Kantian ethics
Immanuel Kant formulated a deontological system based on universal laws that apply to all rational creatures 
Immanuel Kant             is one of the most well known deontologists              He states that reaching outcomes that people desire  such as being happy  is not the main purpose of moral actions  Instead  he argues that there are universal principles that apply to everyone independent of their desires  He uses the term categorical imperative for these principles  saying that they have their source in the structure of practical reason and are true for all rational agents  According to Kant  to act morally is to act in agreement with reason as expressed by these principles             while violating them is both immoral and irrational             
Kant provided several formulations of the categorical imperative  One formulation says that a person should only follow maxims     c      that can be universalized  This means that the person would want everyone to follow the same maxim as a universal law applicable to everyone  Another formulation states that one should treat other people always as ends in themselves and never as mere means to an end  This formulation focuses on respecting and valuing other people for their own sake rather than using them in the pursuit of personal goals             
In either case  Kant says that what matters is to have a good will  A person has a good will if they respect the moral law and form their intentions and motives in agreement with it  Kant states that actions motivated in such a way are unconditionally good  meaning that they are good even in cases where they result in undesirable consequences             

Others edit 
Main articles  Divine command theory  Contractualism  and Discourse ethics
Divine command theory says that God is the source of morality  It states that moral laws are divine commands and that to act morally is to obey and follow God s will  While all divine command theorists agree that morality depends on God  there are disagreements about the precise content of the divine commands  and theorists belonging to different religions tend to propose different moral laws              For example  Christian and Jewish divine command theorists may argue that the Ten Commandments express God s will             while Muslims may reserve this role for the teachings of the Quran              
Contractualists reject the reference to God as the source of morality and argue instead that morality is based on an explicit or implicit social contract between humans  They state that actual or hypothetical consent to this contract is the source of moral norms and duties  To determine which duties people have  contractualists often rely on a thought experiment about what rational people under ideal circumstances would agree on  For example  if they would agree that people should not lie then there is a moral obligation to refrain from lying  Because it relies on consent  contractualism is often understood as a patient centered form of deontology                  d      Famous social contract theorists include Thomas Hobbes  John Locke  Jean Jacques Rousseau  and John Rawls             

According to discourse ethics  as formulated by J rgen Habermas  moral norms are justified by rational discourse within society  
Discourse ethics also focuses on social agreement on moral norms but says that this agreement is based on communicative rationality  It aims to arrive at moral norms for pluralistic modern societies that encompass a diversity of viewpoints  A universal moral norm is seen as valid if all rational discourse participants do or would approve  This way  morality is not imposed by a single moral authority but arises from the moral discourse within society  This discourse should aim to establish an ideal speech situation to ensure fairness and inclusivity  In particular  this means that discourse participants are free to voice their different opinions without coercion but are at the same time required to justify them using rational argumentation             

Virtue ethics edit 
Main article  Virtue ethics
The main concern of virtue ethics is how virtues are expressed in actions  As such  it is neither directly interested in the consequences of actions nor in universal moral duties              Virtues are positive character traits like honesty  courage  kindness  and compassion  They are usually understood as dispositions to feel  decide  and act in a certain manner by being wholeheartedly committed to this manner  Virtues contrast with vices  which are their harmful counterparts             
Virtue theorists usually say that the mere possession of virtues by itself is not sufficient  Instead  people should manifest virtues in their actions  An important factor is the practical wisdom  also called phronesis  of knowing when  how  and which virtue to express  For example  a lack of practical wisdom may lead courageous people to perform morally wrong actions by taking unnecessary risks that should better be avoided             
Different types of virtue ethics differ on how they understand virtues and their role in practical life  Eudaimonism is the original form of virtue theory developed in Ancient Greek philosophy and draws a close relation between virtuous behavior and happiness  It states that people flourish by living a virtuous life  Eudaimonist theories often hold that virtues are positive potentials residing in human nature and that actualizing these potentials results in leading a good and happy life              Agent based theories  by contrast  see happiness only as a side effect and focus instead on the admirable traits and motivational characteristics expressed while acting  This is often combined with the idea that one can learn from exceptional individuals what those characteristics are              Feminist ethics of care are another form of virtue ethics  They emphasize the importance of interpersonal relationships and say that benevolence by caring for the well being of others is one of the key virtues             
Influential schools of virtue ethics in ancient philosophy were Aristotelianism and Stoicism  According to Aristotle          BCE   each virtue     e      is a golden mean between two types of vices  excess and deficiency  For example  courage is a virtue that lies between the deficient state of cowardice and the excessive state of recklessness  Aristotle held that virtuous action leads to happiness and makes people flourish in life              Stoicism emerged about     BCE             and taught that  through virtue alone  people can achieve happiness characterized by a peaceful state of mind free from emotional disturbances  The Stoics advocated rationality and self mastery to achieve this state              In the   th century  virtue ethics experienced a resurgence thanks to philosophers such as Elizabeth Anscombe  Philippa Foot  Alasdair MacIntyre  and Martha Nussbaum             

Other traditions edit 
There are many other schools of normative ethics in addition to the three main traditions  Pragmatist ethics focuses on the role of practice and holds that one of the key tasks of ethics is to solve practical problems in concrete situations  It has certain similarities to utilitarianism and its focus on consequences but concentrates more on how morality is embedded in and relative to social and cultural contexts  Pragmatists tend to give more importance to habits than to conscious deliberation and understand morality as a habit that should be shaped in the right way             
Postmodern ethics agrees with pragmatist ethics about the cultural relativity of morality  It rejects the idea that there are objective moral principles that apply universally to all cultures and traditions  It asserts that there is no one coherent ethical code since morality itself is irrational and humans are morally ambivalent beings              Postmodern ethics instead focuses on how moral demands arise in specific situations as one encounters other people             

The practices of compassion and loving kindness are key elements of Buddhist ethics 
Ethical egoism is the view that people should act in their self interest or that an action is morally right if the person acts for their own benefit  It differs from psychological egoism  which states that people actually follow their self interest without claiming that they should do so  Ethical egoists may act in agreement with commonly accepted moral expectations and benefit other people  for example  by keeping promises  helping friends  and cooperating with others  However  they do so only as a means to promote their self interest  Ethical egoism is often criticized as an immoral and contradictory position             
Normative ethics has a central place in most religions  Key aspects of Jewish ethics are to follow the     commandments of God according to the Mitzvah duty found in the Torah and to take responsibility for societal welfare              Christian ethics puts less emphasis on following precise laws and teaches instead the practice of selfless love  such as the Great Commandment to  Love your neighbor as yourself               The Five Pillars of Islam constitute a basic framework of Muslim ethics and focus on the practice of faith  prayer  charity  fasting during Ramadan  and pilgrimage to Mecca             
Buddhists emphasize the importance of compassion and loving kindness towards all sentient entities              A similar outlook is found in Jainism  which has non violence as its principal virtue              Duty is a central aspect of Hindu ethics and is about fulfilling social obligations  which may vary depending on a person s social class and stage of life              Confucianism places great emphasis on harmony in society and sees benevolence as a key virtue              Taoism extends the importance of living in harmony to the whole world and teaches that people should practice effortless action by following the natural flow of the universe              Indigenous belief systems  like Native American philosophy and the African Ubuntu philosophy  often emphasize the interconnectedness of all living beings and the environment while stressing the importance of living in harmony with nature             

Metaethics edit 
Main article  Metaethics
Metaethics is the branch of ethics that examines the nature  foundations  and scope of moral judgments  concepts  and values  It is not interested in which actions are right but in what it means for an action to be right and whether moral judgments are objective and can be true at all  It further examines the meaning of morality and other moral terms              Metaethics is a metatheory that operates on a higher level of abstraction than normative ethics by investigating its underlying assumptions  Metaethical theories typically do not directly judge which normative ethical theories are correct  However  metaethical theories can still influence normative theories by examining their foundational principles             
Metaethics overlaps with various branches of philosophy  On the level of ontology      f      it examines whether there are objective moral facts              Concerning semantics  it asks what the meaning of moral terms are and whether moral statements have a truth value              The epistemological side of metaethics discusses whether and how people can acquire moral knowledge              Metaethics overlaps with psychology because of its interest in how moral judgments motivate people to act  It also overlaps with anthropology since it aims to explain how cross cultural differences affect moral assessments             

Basic concepts edit 
The deontic square visualizes the relations between possible moral statuses of an act             
Metaethics examines basic ethical concepts and their relations  Ethics is primarily concerned with normative statements about what ought to be the case  in contrast to descriptive statements  which are about what is the case                  g      Duties and obligations express requirements of what people ought to do              Duties are sometimes defined as counterparts of the rights that always accompany them  According to this view  someone has a duty to benefit another person if this other person has the right to receive that benefit             
Obligation and permission are contrasting terms that can be defined through each other  to be obligated to do something means that one is not permitted not to do it and to be permitted to do something means that one is not obligated not to do it                   h      Some theorists define obligations in terms of values or what is good  When used in a general sense  good contrasts with bad  When describing people and their intentions  the term evil rather than bad is often employed              
Obligations are used to assess the moral status of actions  motives  and character traits               An action is morally right if it is in tune with a person s obligations and morally wrong if it violates them               Supererogation is a special moral status that applies to cases in which the agent does more than is morally required of them               To be morally responsible for an action usually means that the person possesses and exercises certain capacities or some form of control      i      If a person is morally responsible then it is appropriate to respond to them in certain ways  for example  by praising or blaming them              

Realism  relativism  and nihilism edit 
A major debate in metaethics is about the ontological status of morality  questioning whether ethical values and principles are real  It examines whether moral properties exist as objective features independent of the human mind and culture rather than as subjective constructs or expressions of personal preferences and cultural norms              
Moral realists accept the claim that there are objective moral facts  This view implies that moral values are mind independent aspects of reality and that there is an absolute fact about whether a given action is right or wrong  A consequence of this view is that moral requirements have the same ontological status as non moral facts  it is an objective fact whether there is an obligation to keep a promise just as it is an objective fact whether a thing is rectangular               Moral realism is often associated with the claim that there are universal ethical principles that apply equally to everyone               It implies that if two people disagree about a moral evaluation then at least one of them is wrong  This observation is sometimes taken as an argument against moral realism since moral disagreement is widespread in most fields              
Moral relativists reject the idea that morality is an objective feature of reality  They argue instead that moral principles are human inventions  This means that a behavior is not objectively right or wrong but only subjectively right or wrong relative to a certain standpoint  Moral standpoints may differ between persons  cultures  and historical periods               For example  moral statements like  Slavery is wrong  or  Suicide is permissible  may be true in one culture and false in another                   j      Some moral relativists say that moral systems are constructed to serve certain goals such as social coordination  According to this view  different societies and different social groups within a society construct different moral systems based on their diverging purposes               Emotivism provides a different explanation  stating that morality arises from moral emotions  which are not the same for everyone              
Moral nihilists deny the existence of moral facts  They reject the existence of both objective moral facts defended by moral realism and subjective moral facts defended by moral relativism  They believe that the basic assumptions underlying moral claims are misguided  Some moral nihilists conclude from this that anything is allowed  A slightly different view emphasizes that moral nihilism is not itself a moral position about what is allowed and prohibited but the rejection of any moral position               Moral nihilism  like moral relativism  recognizes that people judge actions as right or wrong from different perspectives  However  it disagrees that this practice involves morality and sees it as just one type of human behavior              

Naturalism and non naturalism edit 
Main articles  Naturalism and Non naturalism
A central disagreement among moral realists is between naturalism and non naturalism  Naturalism states that moral properties are natural properties accessible to empirical observation  They are similar to the natural properties investigated by the natural sciences  like color and shape               Some moral naturalists hold that moral properties are a unique and basic type of natural property      k      Another view states that moral properties are real but not a fundamental part of reality and can be reduced to other natural properties  such as properties describing the causes of pleasure and pain              
Non naturalism argues that moral properties form part of reality and that moral features are not identical or reducible to natural properties  This view is usually motivated by the idea that moral properties are unique because they express what should be the case               Proponents of this position often emphasize this uniqueness by claiming that it is a fallacy to define ethics in terms of natural entities or to infer prescriptive from descriptive statements              

Cognitivism and non cognitivism edit 
Main articles  Cognitivism and Non cognitivism
The metaethical debate between cognitivism and non cognitivism is about the meaning of moral statements and is a part of the study of semantics  According to cognitivism  moral statements like  Abortion is morally wrong  and  Going to war is never morally justified  are truth apt  meaning that they all have a truth value  they are either true or false  Cognitivism claims that moral statements have a truth value but is not interested in which truth value they have  It is often seen as the default position since moral statements resemble other statements  like  Abortion is a medical procedure  or  Going to war is a political decision   which have a truth value              
There is a close relation between the semantic theory of cognitivism and the ontological theory of moral realism  Moral realists assert that moral facts exist  This can be used to explain why moral statements are true or false  a statement is true if it is consistent with the facts and false otherwise  As a result  philosophers who accept one theory often accept the other as well  An exception is error theory  which combines cognitivism with moral nihilism by claiming that all moral statements are false because there are no moral facts              
Non cognitivism is the view that moral statements lack a truth value  According to this view  the statement  Murder is wrong  is neither true nor false  Some non cognitivists claim that moral statements have no meaning at all  A different interpretation is that they have another type of meaning  Emotivism says that they articulate emotional attitudes  According to this view  the statement  Murder is wrong  expresses that the speaker has a negative moral attitude towards murder or disapproves of it  Prescriptivism  by contrast  understands moral statements as commands  According to this view  stating that  Murder is wrong  expresses a command like  Do not commit murder               

Moral knowledge edit 
The epistemology of ethics studies whether or how one can know moral truths  Foundationalist views state that some moral beliefs are basic and do not require further justification  Ethical intuitionism is one such view that says that humans have a special cognitive faculty through which they can know right from wrong  Intuitionists often argue that general moral truths  like  Lying is wrong   are self evident and that it is possible to know them without relying on empirical experience  A different foundationalist position focuses on particular observations rather than general intuitions  It says that if people are confronted with a concrete moral situation  they can perceive whether right or wrong conduct was involved              
In contrast to foundationalists  coherentists say that there are no basic moral beliefs  They argue that beliefs form a complex network and mutually support and justify one another  According to this view  a moral belief can only amount to knowledge if it coheres with the rest of the beliefs in the network               Moral skeptics say that people are unable to distinguish between right and wrong behavior  thereby rejecting the idea that moral knowledge is possible  A common objection by critics of moral skepticism asserts that it leads to immoral behavior              

The trolley problem is a thought experiment about the moral difference between doing and allowing harm 
Thought experiments are used as a method in ethics to decide between competing theories  They usually present an imagined situation involving an ethical dilemma and explore how people s intuitions of right and wrong change based on specific details in that situation               For example  in Philippa Foot s trolley problem  a person can flip a switch to redirect a trolley from one track to another  thereby sacrificing the life of one person to save five  This scenario explores how the difference between doing and allowing harm affects moral obligations               Another thought experiment  proposed by Judith Jarvis Thomson  examines the moral implications of abortion by imagining a situation in which a person gets connected without their consent to an ill violinist  In this scenario  the violinist dies if the connection is severed  similar to how a fetus dies in the case of abortion  The thought experiment explores whether it would be morally permissible to sever the connection within the next nine months              

Moral motivation edit 
On the level of psychology  metaethics is interested in how moral beliefs and experiences affect behavior  According to motivational internalists  there is a direct link between moral judgments and action  This means that every judgment about what is right motivates the person to act accordingly  For example  Socrates defends a strong form of motivational internalism by holding that a person can only perform an evil deed if they are unaware that it is evil  Weaker forms of motivational internalism say that people can act against their own moral judgments  for example  because of the weakness of the will  Motivational externalists accept that people can judge an act to be morally required without feeling a reason to engage in it  This means that moral judgments do not always provide motivational force               A closely related question is whether moral judgments can provide motivation on their own or need to be accompanied by other mental states  such as a desire to act morally              

Applied ethics edit 
Main article  Applied ethics
Applied ethics  also known as practical ethics               is the branch of ethics and applied philosophy that examines concrete moral problems encountered in real life situations  Unlike normative ethics  it is not concerned with discovering or justifying universal ethical principles  Instead  it studies how those principles can be applied to specific domains of practical life  what consequences they have in these fields  and whether additional domain specific factors need to be considered              

One of the difficulties of applied ethics is to determine how to apply general ethical principles to concrete situations  like medical procedures 
One of the main challenges of applied ethics is to breach the gap between abstract universal theories and their application to concrete situations               For example  an in depth understanding of Kantianism or utilitarianism is usually not sufficient to decide how to analyze the moral implications of a medical procedure like abortion  One reason is that it may not be clear how the Kantian requirement of respecting everyone s personhood applies to a fetus or  from a utilitarian perspective  what the long term consequences are in terms of the greatest good for the greatest number               This difficulty is particularly relevant to applied ethicists who employ a top down methodology by starting from universal ethical principles and applying them to particular cases within a specific domain               A different approach is to use a bottom up methodology  known as casuistry  This method does not start from universal principles but from moral intuitions about particular cases  It seeks to arrive at moral principles relevant to a specific domain  which may not be applicable to other domains               In either case  inquiry into applied ethics is often triggered by ethical dilemmas in which a person is subject to conflicting moral requirements              
Applied ethics covers issues belonging to both the private sphere  like right conduct in the family and close relationships  and the public sphere  like moral problems posed by new technologies and duties toward future generations               Major branches include bioethics  business ethics  and professional ethics  There are many other branches  and their domains of inquiry often overlap              

Bioethics edit 
Main article  Bioethics
Bioethics covers moral problems associated with living organisms and biological disciplines               A key problem in bioethics is how features such as consciousness  being able to feel pleasure and pain  rationality  and personhood affect the moral status of entities  These differences concern  for example  how to treat non living entities like rocks and non sentient entities like plants in contrast to animals  and whether humans have a different moral status than other animals               According to anthropocentrism  only humans have a basic moral status  This suggests that all other entities possess a derivative moral status only insofar as they impact human life  Sentientism  by contrast  extends an inherent moral status to all sentient beings  Further positions include biocentrism  which also covers non sentient lifeforms  and ecocentrism  which states that all of nature has a basic moral status              
Bioethics is relevant to various aspects of life and many professions  It covers a wide range of moral problems associated with topics like abortion  cloning  stem cell research  euthanasia  suicide  animal testing  intensive animal farming  nuclear waste  and air pollution              
Bioethics can be divided into medical ethics  animal ethics  and environmental ethics based on whether the ethical problems relate to humans  other animals  or nature in general               Medical ethics is the oldest branch of bioethics  The Hippocratic Oath is one of the earliest texts to engage in medical ethics by establishing ethical guidelines for medical practitioners like a prohibition to harm the patient               Medical ethics often addresses issues related to the start and end of life  It examines the moral status of fetuses  for example  whether they are full fledged persons and whether abortion is a form of murder               Ethical issues also arise about whether a person has the right to end their life in cases of terminal illness or chronic suffering and if doctors may help them do so               Other topics in medical ethics include medical confidentiality  informed consent  research on human beings  organ transplantation  and access to healthcare              

Harm done to animals is a particular concern in animal ethics  for example  as a result of intensive animal farming 
Animal ethics examines how humans should treat other animals  This field often emphasizes the importance of animal welfare while arguing that humans should avoid or minimize the harm done to animals  There is wide agreement that it is wrong to torture animals for fun  The situation is more complicated in cases where harm is inflicted on animals as a side effect of the pursuit of human interests  This happens  for example  during factory farming  when using animals as food  and for research experiments on animals               A key topic in animal ethics is the formulation of animal rights  Animal rights theorists assert that animals have a certain moral status and that humans should respect this status when interacting with them               Examples of suggested animal rights include the right to life  the right to be free from unnecessary suffering  and the right to natural behavior in a suitable environment              
Environmental ethics deals with moral problems relating to the natural environment including animals  plants  natural resources  and ecosystems  In its widest sense  it covers the whole cosmos               In the domain of agriculture  this concerns the circumstances under which the vegetation of an area may be cleared to use it for farming and the implications of planting genetically modified crops               On a wider scale  environmental ethics addresses the problem of global warming and people s responsibility on the individual and collective levels  including topics like climate justice and duties towards future generations  Environmental ethicists often promote sustainable practices and policies directed at protecting and conserving ecosystems and biodiversity              

Business and professional ethics edit 
Main articles  Business ethics and Professional ethics
Business ethics examines the moral implications of business conduct and how ethical principles apply to corporations and organizations               A key topic is corporate social responsibility  which is the responsibility of corporations to act in a manner that benefits society at large  Corporate social responsibility is a complex issue since many stakeholders are directly and indirectly involved in corporate decisions  such as the CEO  the board of directors  and the shareholders  A closely related topic is the question of whether corporations themselves  and not just their stakeholders  have moral agency               Business ethics further examines the role of honesty and fairness in business practices as well as the moral implications of bribery  conflict of interest  protection of investors and consumers  worker s rights  ethical leadership  and corporate philanthropy              
Professional ethics is a closely related field that studies ethical principles applying to members of a specific profession  like engineers  medical doctors  lawyers  and teachers  It is a diverse field since different professions often have different responsibilities               Principles applying to many professions include that the professional has the required expertise for the intended work and that they have personal integrity and are trustworthy  Further principles are to serve the interest of their target group  follow client confidentiality  and respect and uphold the client s rights  such as informed consent               More precise requirements often vary between professions  A cornerstone of engineering ethics is to protect public safety  health  and well being               Legal ethics emphasizes the importance of respect for justice  personal integrity  and confidentiality               Key factors in journalism ethics include accuracy  truthfulness  independence  and impartiality as well as proper attribution to avoid plagiarism              

Other subfields edit 
Many other fields of applied ethics are discussed in the academic literature  Communication ethics covers moral principles of communicative conduct  Two key issues in it are freedom of speech and speech responsibility  Freedom of speech concerns the ability to articulate one s opinions and ideas without the threats of punishment and censorship  Speech responsibility is about being accountable for the consequences of communicative action and inaction               A closely related field is information ethics  which focuses on the moral implications of creating  controlling  disseminating  and using information              

Nuclear ethics addresses the moral implications of nuclear technology  such as atom bombs 
The ethics of technology examines the moral issues associated with the creation and use of any artifact  from simple spears to high tech computers and nanotechnology               Central topics in the ethics of technology include the risks associated with creating new technologies  their responsible use  and questions about human enhancement through technological means  such as performance enhancing drugs and genetic enhancement               Important subfields include computer ethics  ethics of artificial intelligence  machine ethics  ethics of nanotechnology  and nuclear ethics              

The ethics of war investigates moral problems of war and violent conflicts  According to just war theory  waging war is morally justified if it fulfills certain conditions  These conditions are commonly divided into requirements concerning the cause to initiate violent activities  such as self defense  and the way those violent activities are conducted  such as avoiding excessive harm to civilians in the pursuit of legitimate military targets               Military ethics is a closely related field that is interested in the conduct of military personnel  It governs questions of the circumstances under which they are permitted to kill enemies  destroy infrastructure  and put the lives of their own troops at risk               Additional topics are the recruitment  training  and discharge of military personnel              
Other fields of applied ethics include political ethics  which examines the moral dimensions of political decisions               educational ethics  which covers ethical issues related to proper teaching practices               and sexual ethics  which addresses the moral implications of sexual behavior              

Related fields edit 
Value theory edit 
Main article  Value theory
Value theory  also called axiology      l      is the philosophical study of value  It examines the nature and types of value               A central distinction is between intrinsic and instrumental value  An entity has intrinsic value if it is good in itself or good for its own sake  An entity has instrumental value if it is valuable as a means to something else  for example  by causing something that has intrinsic value               Other topics include what kinds of things have value and how valuable they are  For instance  axiological hedonists say that pleasure is the only source of intrinsic value and that the magnitude of value corresponds to the degree of pleasure  Axiological pluralists  by contrast  hold that there are different sources of intrinsic value  such as happiness  knowledge  and beauty              
There are disagreements about the exact relation between value theory and ethics  Some philosophers characterize value theory as a subdiscipline of ethics while others see value theory as the broader term that encompasses other fields besides ethics  such as aesthetics and political philosophy               A different characterization sees the two disciplines as overlapping but distinct fields               The term axiological ethics is sometimes used for the discipline studying this overlap  that is  the part of ethics that studies values               The two disciplines are sometimes distinguished based on their focus  ethics is about moral behavior or what is right while value theory is about value or what is good               Some ethical theories  like consequentialism  stand very close to value theory by defining what is right in terms of what is good  But this is not true for ethics in general and deontological theories tend to reject the idea that what is good can be used to define what is right                   m     

Moral psychology edit 
Main article  Moral psychology
Moral psychology explores the psychological foundations and processes involved in moral behavior  It is an empirical science that studies how humans think and act in moral contexts  It is interested in how moral reasoning and judgments take place  how moral character forms  what sensitivity people have to moral evaluations  and how people attribute and react to moral responsibility              
One of its key topics is moral development or the question of how morality develops on a psychological level from infancy to adulthood               According to Lawrence Kohlberg  children go through different stages of moral development as they understand moral principles first as fixed rules governing reward and punishment  then as conventional social norms  and later as abstract principles of what is objectively right across societies               A closely related question is whether and how people can be taught to act morally              
Evolutionary ethics  a closely related field  explores how evolutionary processes have shaped ethics  One of its key ideas is that natural selection is responsible for moral behavior and moral sensitivity  It interprets morality as an adaptation to evolutionary pressure that augments fitness by offering a selective advantage               Altruism  for example  can provide benefits to group survival by improving cooperation               Some theorists  like Mark Rowlands  argue that morality is not limited to humans  meaning that some non human animals act based on moral emotions  Others explore evolutionary precursors to morality in non human animals              

Descriptive ethics edit 
Main article  Descriptive ethics
Descriptive ethics  also called comparative ethics               studies existing moral codes  practices  and beliefs  It investigates and compares moral phenomena in different societies and different groups within a society  It aims to provide a value neutral and empirical description without judging or justifying which practices are objectively right  For instance  the question of how nurses think about the ethical implications of abortion belongs to descriptive ethics  Another example is descriptive business ethics  which describes ethical standards in the context of business  including common practices  official policies  and employee opinions  Descriptive ethics also has a historical dimension by exploring how moral practices and beliefs have changed over time              
Descriptive ethics is a multidisciplinary field that is covered by disciplines such as anthropology  sociology  psychology  and history  Its empirical outlook contrasts with the philosophical inquiry into normative questions  such as which ethical principles are correct and how to justify them              

History edit 
Main article  History of ethics
According to Laozi s teachings  which are central to conceptions of ethics in Daoism  humans should aim to live in harmony with the natural order of the universe 
The history of ethics studies how moral philosophy has developed and evolved in the course of history               It has its origin in ancient civilizations  In ancient Egypt  the concept of Maat was used as an ethical principle to guide behavior and maintain order by emphasizing the importance of truth  balance  and harmony                   n      In ancient India starting in the  nd millennium      BCE               the Vedas and later Upanishads were composed as the foundational texts of Hindu philosophy and discussed the role of duty and the consequences of one s actions               Buddhist ethics originated in ancient India between the  th and  th centuries      BCE and advocated compassion  non violence  and the pursuit of enlightenment               Ancient China in the  th century      BCE     o      saw the emergence of Confucianism  which focuses on moral conduct and self cultivation by acting in agreement with virtues  and Daoism  which teaches that human behavior should be in harmony with the natural order of the universe              
In ancient Greece  Socrates  c                     BCE               emphasized the importance of inquiry into what a good life is by critically questioning established ideas and exploring concepts like virtue  justice  courage  and wisdom               According to Plato  c                     BCE                to lead a good life means that the different parts of the soul are in harmony with each other               For Aristotle               BCE                a good life is associated with being happy by cultivating virtues and flourishing               Starting in the  th century      BCE  the close relation between right action and happiness was also explored by the Hellenistic schools of Epicureanism  which recommended a simple lifestyle without indulging in sensory pleasures  and Stoicism  which advocated living in tune with reason and virtue while practicing self mastery and becoming immune to disturbing emotions              
Ethical thought in the medieval period was strongly influenced by religious teachings  Christian philosophers interpreted moral principles as divine commands originating from God               Thomas Aquinas                 CE               developed natural law ethics by claiming that ethical behavior consists in following the laws and order of nature  which he believed were created by God               In the Islamic world  philosophers like Al Farabi  c                     CE               and Avicenna                CE               synthesized ancient Greek philosophy with the ethical teachings of Islam while emphasizing the harmony between reason and faith               In medieval India  Hindu philosophers like Adi Shankara  c                     CE               and Ramanuja                 CE                   p      saw the practice of spirituality to attain liberation as the highest goal of human behavior              

G  E  Moore s book Principia Ethica was partly responsible for the emergence of metaethics in the   th century 
Moral philosophy in the modern period was characterized by a shift toward a secular approach to ethics  Thomas Hobbes                          identified self interest as the primary drive of humans  He concluded that it would lead to  a war of every man against every man  unless a social contract is established to avoid this outcome               David Hume                          thought that only moral sentiments  like empathy  can motivate ethical actions while he saw reason not as a motivating factor but only as what anticipates the consequences of possible actions               Immanuel Kant                           by contrast  saw reason as the source of morality  He formulated a deontological theory  according to which the ethical value of actions depends on their conformity with moral laws independent of their outcome  These laws take the form of categorical imperatives  which are universal requirements that apply to every situation              
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel                          saw Kant s categorical imperative on its own as an empty formalism and emphasized the role of social institutions in providing concrete content to moral duties               According to the Christian philosophy of S ren Kierkegaard                           the demands of ethical duties are sometimes suspended when doing God s will               Friedrich Nietzsche                          formulated criticisms of both Christian and Kantian morality               Another influential development in this period was the formulation of utilitarianism by Jeremy Bentham                          and John Stuart Mill                           According to the utilitarian doctrine  actions should promote happiness while reducing suffering and the right action is the one that produces the greatest good for the greatest number of people              

Simone de Beauvoir explored moral philosophy from the perspective of existentialism              
An important development in   th century ethics in analytic philosophy was the emergence of metaethics               Significant early contributions to this field were made by G  E  Moore                           who argued that moral values are essentially different from other properties found in the natural world               R  M  Hare                          followed this idea in formulating his prescriptivism  which states that moral statements are commands that  unlike regular judgments  are neither true nor false               J  L  Mackie                          suggested that every moral statement is false since there are no moral facts               An influential argument for moral realism was made by Derek Parfit                           who argued that morality concerns objective features of reality that give people reasons to act in one way or another               Bernard Williams                          agreed with the close relation between reasons and ethics but defended a subjective view instead that sees reasons as internal mental states that may or may not reflect external reality              
Another development in this period was the revival of ancient virtue ethics by philosophers like Philippa Foot                           In the field of political philosophy  John Rawls                          relied on Kantian ethics to analyze social justice as a form of fairness               In continental philosophy  phenomenologists such as Max Scheler                          and Nicolai Hartmann                          built ethical systems based on the claim that values have objective reality that can be investigated using the phenomenological method               Existentialists like Jean Paul Sartre                          and Simone de Beauvoir                           by contrast  held that values are created by humans and explored the consequences of this view in relation to individual freedom  responsibility  and authenticity               This period also saw the emergence of feminist ethics  which questions traditional ethical assumptions associated with a male perspective and puts alternative concepts  like care  at the center

Notes edit 


  According to some theorists  teleological ethics is a wider term than consequentialism because it also covers certain forms of virtue ethics             

  This state is known as supererogation             

  A maxim is a rule that people can adopt to guide their action  like  If you want to make big money  you should go into sales  or  Thou shalt not commit murder              

  Some ethicists state that contractualism is not a normative ethical theory but a metaethical theory because of its emphasis on how moral norms are justified             

  The ancient Greeks used the word ar te  which has the meaning of both  virtue  and  excellence              

  Ontology is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature and categories of being             

  This contrast is closely related to the is ought problem problem  first articulated by David Hume  which states that one cannot deduce a normative statement from a descriptive statement              The exact relation between these types of statements is disputed             

  Deontic logic provides a formal system describing the logical relations between these and similar concepts              

  Some philosophers suggest that there is moral luck  which occurs when factors outside a person s control influence the moral status of that person              

  This position can be understood by analogy to Einstein s theory of relativity  which states that the magnitude of physical properties like mass  length  and duration depends on the frame of reference of the observer              

  For example  natural law ethics  an influential position in Christian ethics  says that morality is based on a natural law created by God              

  There are disagreements in the academic literature about whether they are synonyms or whether one or the other is the wider term              

  For example  the deontologist David Ross holds that the principles of right actions are distinct from the principles of value  He says that the terms good and right mean different things and should not be confused with one another              

  The first explicit discussions of Maat as a concept date to about           BCE              

  Dates for the emergence of Daoism are disputed and some theorists suggest a later date between the  th and  rd centuries      BCE              

  Modern scholars have questioned these traditionally cited dates  suggesting that Ramanuja s life ran from      to
