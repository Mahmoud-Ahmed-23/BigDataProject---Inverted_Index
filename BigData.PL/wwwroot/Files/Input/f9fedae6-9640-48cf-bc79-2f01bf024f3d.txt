A neuron  American English   neurone  British English              or nerve cell  is an excitable cell that fires electric signals called action potentials across a neural network in the nervous system  They are located in the nervous system and help to receive and conduct impulses  Neurons communicate with other cells via synapses  which are specialized connections that commonly use minute amounts of chemical neurotransmitters to pass the electric signal from the presynaptic neuron to the target cell through the synaptic gap 
Neurons are the main components of nervous tissue in all animals except sponges and placozoans  Plants and fungi do not have nerve cells  Molecular evidence suggests that the ability to generate electric signals first appeared in evolution some     to     million years ago  during the Tonian period  Predecessors of neurons were the peptidergic secretory cells  They eventually gained new gene modules which enabled cells to create post synaptic scaffolds and ion channels that generate fast electrical signals  The ability to generate electric signals was a key innovation in the evolution of the nervous system            
Neurons are typically classified into three types based on their function  Sensory neurons respond to stimuli such as touch  sound  or light that affect the cells of the sensory organs  and they send signals to the spinal cord or brain  Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord to control everything from muscle contractions            to glandular output  Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord  When multiple neurons are functionally connected together  they form what is called a neural circuit 
A neuron contains all the structures of other cells such as a nucleus  mitochondria  and Golgi bodies but has additional unique structures such as an axon  and dendrites             The soma is a compact structure  and the axon and dendrites are filaments extruding from the soma  Dendrites typically branch profusely and extend a few hundred micrometers from the soma  The axon leaves the soma at a swelling called the axon hillock and travels for as far as   meter in humans or more in other species  It branches but usually maintains a constant diameter  At the farthest tip of the axon s branches are axon terminals  where the neuron can transmit a signal across the synapse to another cell  Neurons may lack dendrites or have no axons  The term neurite is used to describe either a dendrite or an axon  particularly when the cell is undifferentiated 
Most neurons receive signals via the dendrites and soma and send out signals down the axon  At the majority of synapses  signals cross from the axon of one neuron to the dendrite of another  However  synapses can connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite  The signaling process is partly electrical and partly chemical  Neurons are electrically excitable  due to the maintenance of voltage gradients across their membranes  If the voltage changes by a large enough amount over a short interval  the neuron generates an all or nothing electrochemical pulse called an action potential  This potential travels rapidly along the axon and activates synaptic connections as it reaches them  Synaptic signals may be excitatory or inhibitory  increasing or reducing the net voltage that reaches the soma 
In most cases  neurons are generated by neural stem cells during brain development and childhood  Neurogenesis largely ceases during adulthood in most areas of the brain 


Nervous system edit 
Neurons are the primary components of the nervous system  along with the glial cells that give them structural and metabolic support             The nervous system is made up of the central nervous system  which includes the brain and spinal cord  and the peripheral nervous system  which includes the autonomic  enteric and somatic nervous systems             In vertebrates  the majority of neurons belong to the central nervous system  but some reside in peripheral ganglia  and many sensory neurons are situated in sensory organs such as the retina and cochlea 
Axons may bundle into nerve fascicles that make up the nerves in the peripheral nervous system  like strands of wire that make up a cable   In the central nervous system bundles of axons are called nerve tracts 

Anatomy and histology edit

Neurons are highly specialized for the processing and transmission of cellular signals  Given the diversity of functions performed in different parts of the nervous system  there is a wide variety in their shape  size  and electrochemical properties  For instance  the soma of a neuron can vary from   to     micrometers in diameter            

The soma is the body of the neuron  As it contains the nucleus  most protein synthesis occurs here  The nucleus can range from   to    micrometers in diameter            
The dendrites of a neuron are cellular extensions with many branches  This overall shape and structure are referred to metaphorically as a dendritic tree  This is where the majority of input to the neuron occurs via the dendritic spine 
The axon is a finer  cable like projection that can extend tens  hundreds  or even tens of thousands of times the diameter of the soma in length  The axon primarily carries nerve signals away from the soma and carries some types of information back to it  Many neurons have only one axon  but this axon may and usually will undergo extensive branching  enabling communication with many target cells  The part of the axon where it emerges from the soma is called the axon hillock  Besides being an anatomical structure  the axon hillock also has the greatest density of voltage dependent sodium channels  This makes it the most easily excited part of the neuron and the spike initiation zone for the axon  In electrophysiological terms  it has the most negative threshold potential 
While the axon and axon hillock are generally involved in information outflow  this region can also receive input from other neurons 
The axon terminal is found at the end of the axon farthest from the soma and contains synapses  Synaptic boutons are specialized structures where neurotransmitter chemicals are released to communicate with target neurons  In addition to synaptic boutons at the axon terminal  a neuron may have en passant boutons  which are located along the length of the axon 
The accepted view of the neuron attributes dedicated functions to its various anatomical components  however  dendrites and axons often act in ways contrary to their so called main function            
Axons and dendrites in the central nervous system are typically only about one micrometer thick  while some in the peripheral nervous system are much thicker  The soma is usually about       micrometers in diameter and often is not much larger than the cell nucleus it contains  The longest axon of a human motor neuron can be over a meter long  reaching from the base of the spine to the toes 
Sensory neurons can have axons that run from the toes to the posterior column of the spinal cord  over     meters in adults  Giraffes have single axons several meters in length running along the entire length of their necks  Much of what is known about axonal function comes from studying the squid giant axon  an ideal experimental preparation because of its relatively immense size        millimeter thick  several centimeters long  
Fully differentiated neurons are permanently postmitotic             however  stem cells present in the adult brain may regenerate functional neurons throughout the life of an organism  see neurogenesis   Astrocytes are star shaped glial cells that have been observed to turn into neurons by virtue of their stem cell like characteristic of pluripotency             

Membrane edit 
Like all animal cells  the cell body of every neuron is enclosed by a plasma membrane  a bilayer of lipid molecules with many types of protein structures embedded in it              A lipid bilayer is a powerful electrical insulator  but in neurons  many of the protein structures embedded in the membrane are electrically active  These include ion channels that permit electrically charged ions to flow across the membrane and ion pumps that chemically transport ions from one side of the membrane to the other  Most ion channels are permeable only to specific types of ions  Some ion channels are voltage gated  meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by altering the voltage difference across the membrane  Others are chemically gated  meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by interactions with chemicals that diffuse through the extracellular fluid  The ion materials include sodium  potassium  chloride  and calcium  The interactions between ion channels and ion pumps produce a voltage difference across the membrane  typically a bit less than      of a volt at baseline  This voltage has two functions  first  it provides a power source for an assortment of voltage dependent protein machinery that is embedded in the membrane  second  it provides a basis for electrical signal transmission between different parts of the membrane 

Histology and internal structure edit 
Golgi stained neurons in human hippocampal tissue
Actin filaments in a mouse cortical neuron in culture
Numerous microscopic clumps called Nissl bodies  or Nissl substance  are seen when nerve cell bodies are stained with a basophilic   base loving   dye  These structures consist of rough endoplasmic reticulum and associated ribosomal RNA  Named after German psychiatrist and neuropathologist Franz Nissl              they are involved in protein synthesis and their prominence can be explained by the fact that nerve cells are very metabolically active  Basophilic dyes such as aniline or  weakly  hematoxylin             highlight negatively charged components  and so bind to the phosphate backbone of the ribosomal RNA 
The cell body of a neuron is supported by a complex mesh of structural proteins called neurofilaments  which together with neurotubules  neuronal microtubules  are assembled into larger neurofibrils              Some neurons also contain pigment granules  such as neuromelanin  a brownish black pigment that is byproduct of synthesis of catecholamines   and lipofuscin  a yellowish brown pigment   both of which accumulate with age                                      Other structural proteins that are important for neuronal function are actin and the tubulin of microtubules  Class III   tubulin is found almost exclusively in neurons  Actin is predominately found at the tips of axons and dendrites during neuronal development  There the actin dynamics can be modulated via an interplay with microtubule             
There are different internal structural characteristics between axons and dendrites  Typical axons seldom contain ribosomes  except some in the initial segment  Dendrites contain granular endoplasmic reticulum or ribosomes  in diminishing amounts as the distance from the cell body increases

Neurons vary in shape and size and can be classified by their morphology and function              The anatomist Camillo Golgi grouped neurons into two types  type I with long axons used to move signals over long distances and type II with short axons  which can often be confused with dendrites  Type I cells can be further classified by the location of the soma  The basic morphology of type I neurons  represented by spinal motor neurons  consists of a cell body called the soma and a long thin axon covered by a myelin sheath  The dendritic tree wraps around the cell body and receives signals from other neurons  The end of the axon has branching axon terminals that release neurotransmitters into a gap called the synaptic cleft between the terminals and the dendrites of the next neuron      citation needed     

Structural classification edit 
Polarity edit 
Different kinds of neurons   Unipolar neuron  Bipolar neuron  Multipolar neuron  Pseudounipolar neuron 
Most neurons can be anatomically characterized as            

Unipolar  single process  Unipolar cells are exclusively sensory neurons  Their dendrites receive sensory information  sometimes directly from the stimulus itself  The cell bodies of unipolar neurons are always found in ganglia  Sensory reception is a peripheral function  so the cell body is in the periphery  though closer to the CNS in a ganglion  The axon projects from the dendrite endings  past the cell body in a ganglion  and into the central nervous system 
Bipolar    axon and   dendrite  They are found mainly in the olfactory epithelium  and as part of the retina 
Multipolar    axon and   or more dendrites
Golgi I  neurons with long projecting axonal processes  examples are pyramidal cells  Purkinje cells  and anterior horn cells
Golgi II  neurons whose axonal process projects locally  the best example is the granule cell
Anaxonic  where the axon cannot be distinguished from the dendrite s 
Pseudounipolar    process which then serves as both an axon and a dendrite
Other edit 
Some unique neuronal types can be identified according to their location in the nervous system and distinct shape  Some examples are      citation needed

Functional classification edit 
Direction edit 
Afferent neurons convey information from tissues and organs into the central nervous system and are also called sensory neurons 
Efferent neurons  motor neurons  transmit signals from the central nervous system to the effector cells 
Interneurons connect neurons within specific regions of the central nervous system 
Afferent and efferent also refer generally to neurons that  respectively  bring information to or send information from the brain 

Action on other neurons edit 
A neuron affects other neurons by releasing a neurotransmitter that binds to chemical receptors  The effect on the postsynaptic neuron is determined by the type of receptor that is activated  not by the presynaptic neuron or by the neurotransmitter  A neurotransmitter can be thought of as a key  and a receptor as a lock  the same neurotransmitter can activate multiple types of receptors  Receptors can be classified broadly as excitatory  causing an increase in firing rate   inhibitory  causing a decrease in firing rate   or modulatory  causing long lasting effects not directly related to firing rate       citation needed     
The two most common        neurotransmitters in the brain  glutamate and GABA  have largely consistent actions  Glutamate acts on several types of receptors and has effects that are excitatory at ionotropic receptors and a modulatory effect at metabotropic receptors  Similarly  GABA acts on several types of receptors  but all of them have inhibitory effects  in adult animals  at least   Because of this consistency  it is common for neuroscientists to refer to cells that release glutamate as  excitatory neurons   and cells that release GABA as  inhibitory neurons   Some other types of neurons have consistent effects  for example   excitatory  motor neurons in the spinal cord that release acetylcholine  and  inhibitory  spinal neurons that release glycine      citation needed     
The distinction between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters is not absolute  Rather  it depends on the class of chemical receptors present on the postsynaptic neuron  In principle  a single neuron  releasing a single neurotransmitter  can have excitatory effects on some targets  inhibitory effects on others  and modulatory effects on others still  For example  photoreceptor cells in the retina constantly release the neurotransmitter glutamate in the absence of light  So called OFF bipolar cells are  like most neurons  excited by the released glutamate  However  neighboring target neurons called ON bipolar cells are instead inhibited by glutamate  because they lack typical ionotropic glutamate receptors and instead express a class of inhibitory metabotropic glutamate receptors              When light is present  the photoreceptors cease releasing glutamate  which relieves the ON bipolar cells from inhibition  activating them  this simultaneously removes the excitation from the OFF bipolar cells  silencing them      citation needed     
It is possible to identify the type of inhibitory effect a presynaptic neuron will have on a postsynaptic neuron  based on the proteins the presynaptic neuron expresses  Parvalbumin expressing neurons typically dampen the output signal of the postsynaptic neuron in the visual cortex  whereas somatostatin expressing neurons typically block dendritic inputs to the postsynaptic neuron             

Discharge patterns edit 
Neurons have intrinsic electroresponsive properties like intrinsic transmembrane voltage oscillatory patterns              So neurons can be classified according to their electrophysiological characteristics 

Tonic or regular spiking  Some neurons are typically constantly  tonically  active  typically firing at a constant frequency  Example  interneurons in neurostriatum 
Phasic or bursting  Neurons that fire in bursts are called phasic 
Fast spiking  Some neurons are notable for their high firing rates  for example  some types of cortical inhibitory interneurons  cells in globus pallidus  retinal ganglion cells                         
Neurotransmitter edit 
Synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitters
Main article  Neurotransmitter
Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers passed from one neuron to another neuron or to a muscle cell or gland cell 

Cholinergic neurons   acetylcholine  Acetylcholine is released from presynaptic neurons into the synaptic cleft  It acts as a ligand for both ligand gated ion channels and metabotropic  GPCRs  muscarinic receptors  Nicotinic receptors are pentameric ligand gated ion channels composed of alpha and beta subunits that bind nicotine  Ligand binding opens the channel causing the influx of Na  depolarization and increases the probability of presynaptic neurotransmitter release  Acetylcholine is synthesized from choline and acetyl coenzyme A 
Adrenergic neurons   noradrenaline  Noradrenaline  norepinephrine  is released from most postganglionic neurons in the sympathetic nervous system onto two sets of GPCRs  alpha adrenoceptors and beta adrenoceptors  Noradrenaline is one of the three common catecholamine neurotransmitters  and the most prevalent of them in the peripheral nervous system  as with other catecholamines  it is synthesized from tyrosine 
GABAergic neurons   gamma aminobutyric acid  GABA is one of two neuroinhibitors in the central nervous system  CNS   along with glycine  GABA has a homologous function to ACh  gating anion channels that allow Cl  ions to enter the post synaptic neuron  Cl  causes hyperpolarization within the neuron  decreasing the probability of an action potential firing as the voltage becomes more negative  for an action potential to fire  a positive voltage threshold must be reached   GABA is synthesized from glutamate neurotransmitters by the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase 
Glutamatergic neurons   glutamate  Glutamate is one of two primary excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters  along with aspartate  Glutamate receptors are one of four categories  three of which are ligand gated ion channels and one of which is a G protein coupled receptor  often referred to as GPCR  
AMPA and Kainate receptors function as cation channels permeable to Na  cation channels mediating fast excitatory synaptic transmission 
NMDA receptors are another cation channel that is more permeable to Ca    The function of NMDA receptors depends on glycine receptor binding as a co agonist within the channel pore  NMDA receptors do not function without both ligands present 
Metabotropic receptors  GPCRs modulate synaptic transmission and postsynaptic excitability 
Glutamate can cause excitotoxicity when blood flow to the brain is interrupted  resulting in brain damage  When blood flow is suppressed  glutamate is released from presynaptic neurons  causing greater NMDA and AMPA receptor activation than normal outside of stress conditions  leading to elevated Ca   and Na  entering the post synaptic neuron and cell damage  Glutamate is synthesized from the amino acid glutamine by the enzyme glutamate synthase 
Dopaminergic neurons dopamine  Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that acts on D  type  D  and D   Gs coupled receptors  which increase cAMP and PKA  and D  type  D   D   and D   receptors  which activate Gi coupled receptors that decrease cAMP and PKA  Dopamine is connected to mood and behavior and modulates both pre  and post synaptic neurotransmission  Loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra has been linked to Parkinson s disease  Dopamine is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine  Tyrosine is catalyzed into levodopa  or L DOPA  by tyrosine hydroxylase  and levodopa is then converted into dopamine by the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase 
Serotonergic neurons serotonin  Serotonin    Hydroxytryptamine    HT  can act as excitatory or inhibitory  Of its four   HT receptor classes    are GPCR and   is a ligand gated cation channel  Serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase  and then further by decarboxylase  A lack of   HT at postsynaptic neurons has been linked to depression  Drugs that block the presynaptic serotonin transporter are used for treatment  such as Prozac and Zoloft 
Purinergic neurons ATP  ATP is a neurotransmitter acting at both ligand gated ion channels  P X receptors  and GPCRs  P Y  receptors  ATP is  however  best known as a cotransmitter  Such purinergic signaling can also be mediated by other purines like adenosine  which particularly acts at P Y receptors 
Histaminergic neurons histamine  Histamine is a monoamine neurotransmitter and neuromodulator  Histamine producing neurons are found in the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus              Histamine is involved in arousal and regulating sleep wake behaviors 
Multimodel classification edit 
Since      there has been a push from the cellular and computational neuroscience community to come up with a universal classification of neurons that will apply to all neurons in the brain as well as across species  This is done by considering the three essential qualities of all neurons  electrophysiology  morphology  and the individual transcriptome of the cells  Besides being universal this classification has the advantage of being able to classify astrocytes as well  A method called patch sequencing in which all three qualities can be measured at once is used extensively by the Allen Institute for Brain Science              In       a comprehensive cell atlas of the adult  and developing human brain at the transcriptional  epigenetic  and functional levels was created through an international collaboration of researchers using the most cutting edge molecular biology approaches             

Connectivity edit 
Main articles  Synapse and Chemical synapse
A signal propagating down an axon to the cell body and dendrites of the next cell
Chemical synapse
Neurons communicate with each other via synapses  where either the axon terminal of one cell contacts another neuron s dendrite  soma  or  less commonly  axon  Neurons such as Purkinje cells in the cerebellum can have over      dendritic branches  making connections with tens of thousands of other cells  other neurons  such as the magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic nucleus  have only one or two dendrites  each of which receives thousands of synapses 
Synapses can be excitatory or inhibitory  either increasing or decreasing activity in the target neuron  respectively  Some neurons also communicate via electrical synapses  which are direct  electrically conductive junctions between cells             
When an action potential reaches the axon terminal  it opens voltage gated calcium channels  allowing calcium ions to enter the terminal  Calcium causes synaptic vesicles filled with neurotransmitter molecules to fuse with the membrane  releasing their contents into the synaptic cleft  The neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic cleft and activate receptors on the postsynaptic neuron  High cytosolic calcium in the axon terminal triggers mitochondrial calcium uptake  which  in turn  activates mitochondrial energy metabolism to produce ATP to support continuous neurotransmission             
An autapse is a synapse in which a neuron s axon connects to its dendrites 
The human brain has some     x       eighty six billion  neurons                          Each neuron has on average       synaptic connections to other neurons  It has been estimated that the brain of a three year old child has about      synapses    quadrillion   This number declines with age  stabilizing by adulthood  Estimates vary for an adult  ranging from      to   x      synapses      to     trillion              

Nonelectrochemical signaling edit 
Beyond electrical and chemical signaling  studies suggest neurons in healthy human brains can also communicate through 

force generated by the enlargement of dendritic spines            
the transfer of proteins   transneuronally transported proteins  TNTPs                         
They can also get modulated by input from the environment and hormones released from other parts of the organism              which could be influenced more or less directly by neurons  This also applies to neurotrophins such as BDNF  The gut microbiome is also connected with the brain             
Neurons also communicate with microglia  the brain s main immune cells via specialized contact sites  called  somatic junctions   These connections enable microglia to constantly monitor and regulate neuronal functions  and exert neuroprotection when needed             

Mechanisms for propagating action potentials edit 
Main article  Action potential
In      John Zachary Young suggested that the squid giant axon could be used to study neuronal electrical properties              It is larger than but similar to human neurons  making it easier to study  By inserting electrodes into the squid giant axons  accurate measurements were made of the membrane potential 
The cell membrane of the axon and soma contain voltage gated ion channels that allow the neuron to generate and propagate an electrical signal  an action potential   Some neurons also generate subthreshold membrane potential oscillations  These signals are generated and propagated by charge carrying ions including sodium  Na    potassium  K    chloride  Cl    and calcium  Ca    
Several stimuli can activate a neuron leading to electrical activity  including pressure  stretch  chemical transmitters  and changes in the electric potential across the cell membrane              Stimuli cause specific ion channels within the cell membrane to open  leading to a flow of ions through the cell membrane  changing the membrane potential  Neurons must maintain the specific electrical properties that define their neuron type             
Thin neurons and axons require less metabolic expense to produce and carry action potentials  but thicker axons convey impulses more rapidly  To minimize metabolic expense while maintaining rapid conduction  many neurons have insulating sheaths of myelin around their axons  The sheaths are formed by glial cells  oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system  The sheath enables action potentials to travel faster than in unmyelinated axons of the same diameter  whilst using less energy  The myelin sheath in peripheral nerves normally runs along the axon in sections about        mm long  punctuated by unsheathed nodes of Ranvier  which contain a high density of voltage gated ion channels  Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disorder that results from the demyelination of axons in the central nervous system 
Some neurons do not generate action potentials but instead generate a graded electrical signal  which in turn causes graded neurotransmitter release  Such non spiking neurons tend to be sensory neurons or interneurons  because they cannot carry signals long distances 

Neural coding edit 
Neural coding is concerned with how sensory and other information is represented in the brain by neurons  The main goal of studying neural coding is to characterize the relationship between the stimulus and the individual or ensemble neuronal responses and the relationships among the electrical activities of the neurons within the ensemble              It is thought that neurons can encode both digital and analog information             

All or none principle edit 
As long as the stimulus reaches the threshold  the full response will be given  A larger stimulus does not result in a larger response  and vice versa                                  
Main article  All or none law
The conduction of nerve impulses is an example of an all or none response  In other words  if a neuron responds at all  then it must respond completely  Greater intensity of stimulation  like brighter image louder sound  does not produce a stronger signal but can increase firing frequency                                   Receptors respond in different ways to stimuli  Slowly adapting or tonic receptors respond to a steady stimulus and produce a steady rate of firing  Tonic receptors most often respond to increased stimulus intensity by increasing their firing frequency  usually as a power function of stimulus plotted against impulses per second  This can be likened to an intrinsic property of light where greater intensity of a specific frequency  color  requires more photons  as the photons can not become  stronger  for a specific frequency 
Other receptor types include quickly adapting or phasic receptors  where firing decreases or stops with a steady stimulus  examples include skin which  when touched causes neurons to fire  but if the object maintains even pressure  the neurons stop firing  The neurons of the skin and muscles that are responsive to pressure and vibration have filtering accessory structures that aid their function 
The pacinian corpuscle is one such structure  It has concentric layers like an onion  which form around the axon terminal  When pressure is applied and the corpuscle is deformed  mechanical stimulus is transferred to the axon  which fires  If the pressure is steady  the stimulus ends  thus  these neurons typically respond with a transient depolarization during the initial deformation and again when the pressure is removed  which causes the corpuscle to change shape again  Other types of adaptation are important in extending the function of several other neurons             

Etymology and spelling edit 
The German anatomist Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer introduced the term neuron in                   based on the ancient Greek        neuron  sinew  cord  nerve               
The word was adopted in French with the spelling neurone  That spelling was also used by many writers in English              but has now become rare in American usage and uncommon in British usage                         
Some previous works used nerve cell  cellule nervose   as adopted in Camillo Golgi s      paper on the discovery of the silver staining technique used to visualize nervous tissue under light microscopy

The neuron s place as the primary functional unit of the nervous system was first recognized in the late   th century through the work of the Spanish anatomist Santiago Ram n y Cajal             
To make the structure of individual neurons visible  Ram n y Cajal improved a silver staining process that had been developed by Camillo Golgi              The improved process involves a technique called  double impregnation  and is still in use 
In      Ram n y Cajal published a paper about the bird cerebellum  In this paper  he stated that he could not find evidence for anastomosis between axons and dendrites and called each nervous element  an autonomous canton                           This became known as the neuron doctrine  one of the central tenets of modern neuroscience             
In       the German anatomist Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer wrote a highly influential review of the neuron doctrine in which he introduced the term neuron to describe the anatomical and physiological unit of the nervous system                         
The silver impregnation stains are a useful method for neuroanatomical investigations because  for reasons unknown  it stains only a small percentage of cells in a tissue  exposing the complete micro structure of individual neurons without much overlap from other cells             

Neuron doctrine edit 
Drawing of neurons in the pigeon cerebellum  by Spanish neuroscientist Santiago Ram n y Cajal in        A  denotes Purkinje cells and  B  denotes granule cells  both of which are multipolar 
The neuron doctrine is the now fundamental idea that neurons are the basic structural and functional units of the nervous system  The theory was put forward by Santiago Ram n y Cajal in the late   th century  It held that neurons are discrete cells  not connected in a meshwork   acting as metabolically distinct units 
Later discoveries yielded refinements to the doctrine  For example  glial cells  which are non neuronal  play an essential role in information processing              Also  electrical synapses are more common than previously thought              comprising direct  cytoplasmic connections between neurons  In fact  neurons can form even tighter couplings  the squid giant axon arises from the fusion of multiple axons             
Ram n y Cajal also postulated the Law of Dynamic Polarization  which states that a neuron receives signals at its dendrites and cell body and transmits them  as action potentials  along the axon in one direction  away from the cell body              The Law of Dynamic Polarization has important exceptions  dendrites can serve as synaptic output sites of neurons             and axons can receive synaptic inputs             

Compartmental modelling of neurons edit 
Although neurons are often described as  fundamental units  of the brain  they perform internal computations  Neurons integrate input within dendrites  and this complexity is lost in models that assume neurons to be a fundamental unit  Dendritic branches can be modeled as spatial compartments  whose activity is related to passive membrane properties  but may also be different depending on input from synapses  Compartmental modelling of dendrites is especially helpful for understanding the behavior of neurons that are too small to record with electrodes  as is the case for Drosophila melanogaster             

Neurons in the brain edit 
The number of neurons in the brain varies dramatically from species to species              In a human  there are an estimated       billion neurons in the cerebral cortex and       billion neurons in the cerebellum              By contrast  the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has just     neurons  making it an ideal model organism as scientists have been able to map all of its neurons  The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster  a common subject in biological experiments  has around         neurons and exhibits many complex behaviors  Many properties of neurons  from the type of neurotransmitters used to ion channel composition  are maintained across species  allowing scientists to study processes occurring in more complex organisms in much simpler experimental systems

Charcot Marie Tooth disease  CMT  is a heterogeneous inherited disorder of nerves  neuropathy  that is characterized by loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation  predominantly in the feet and legs extending to the hands and arms in advanced stages  Presently incurable  this disease is one of the most common inherited neurological disorders  affecting    in         people             
Alzheimer s disease  AD   also known simply as Alzheimer s  is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration  together with declining activities of daily living and neuropsychiatric symptoms or behavioral changes              The most striking early symptom is loss of short term memory  amnesia   which usually manifests as minor forgetfulness that becomes steadily more pronounced with illness progression  with relative preservation of older memories  As the disorder progresses  cognitive  intellectual  impairment extends to the domains of language  aphasia   skilled movements  apraxia   and recognition  agnosia   and functions such as decision making and planning become impaired                         
Parkinson s disease  PD   also known as Parkinson s  is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that often impairs motor skills and speech              Parkinson s disease belongs to a group of conditions called movement disorders              It is characterized by muscle rigidity  tremor  a slowing of physical movement  bradykinesia   and in extreme cases  a loss of physical movement  akinesia   The primary symptoms are the results of decreased stimulation of the motor cortex by the basal ganglia  normally caused by the insufficient formation and action of dopamine  which is produced in the dopaminergic neurons of the brain  Secondary symptoms may include high level cognitive dysfunction and subtle language problems  PD is both chronic and progressive 
Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disease leading to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigability during simple activities  Weakness is typically caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction  inhibiting the stimulative effect of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine  Myasthenia is treated with immunosuppressants  cholinesterase inhibitors and  in selected cases  thymectomy 

Demyelination edit 
Further information  Demyelinating disease
Guillain Barr  syndrome   demyelination
Demyelination is a process characterized by the gradual loss of the myelin sheath enveloping nerve fibers  When myelin deteriorates  signal conduction along nerves can be significantly impaired or lost  and the nerve eventually withers  Demyelination may affect both central and peripheral nervous systems  contributing to various neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis  Guillain Barr  syndrome  and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy  Although demyelination is often caused by an autoimmune reaction  it may also be caused by viral infections  metabolic disorders  trauma  and some medications 

Axonal degeneration edit 
Although most injury responses include a calcium influx signaling to promote resealing of severed parts  axonal injuries initially lead to acute axonal degeneration  which is the rapid separation of the proximal and distal ends  occurring within    minutes of injury              Degeneration follows with swelling of the axolemma  and eventually leads to bead like formation  Granular disintegration of the axonal cytoskeleton and inner organelles occurs after axolemma degradation  Early changes include accumulation of mitochondria in the paranodal regions at the site of injury  The endoplasmic reticulum degrades and mitochondria swell up and eventually disintegrate  The disintegration is dependent on ubiquitin and calpain proteases  caused by the influx of calcium ions   suggesting that axonal degeneration is an active process that produces complete fragmentation  The process takes about roughly    hours in the PNS and longer in the CNS  The signaling pathways leading to axolemma degeneration are unknown 

Development edit 
Main article  Neurogenesis
Neurons develop through the process of neurogenesis  in which neural stem cells divide to produce differentiated neurons  Once fully differentiated they are no longer capable of undergoing mitosis  Neurogenesis primarily occurs during embryonic development 
Neurons initially develop from the neural tube in the embryo  The neural tube has three layers   a ventricular zone  an intermediate zone  and a marginal zone  The ventricular zone surrounds the tube s central canal and becomes the ependyma  Dividing cells of the ventricular zone form the intermediate zone which stretches to the outermost layer of the neural tube called the pial layer  The gray matter of the brain is derived from the intermediate zone  The extensions of the neurons in the intermediate zone make up the marginal zone when myelinated becomes the brain s white matter             
Differentiation of the neurons is ordered by their size  Large motor neurons are first  Smaller sensory neurons together with glial cell differentiate at birth             
Adult neurogenesis can occur and studies of the age of human neurons suggest that this process occurs only for a minority of cells and that the vast majority of neurons in the neocortex form before birth and persist without replacement  The extent to which adult neurogenesis exists in humans  and its contribution to cognition are controversial  with conflicting reports published in                  
The body contains a variety of stem cell types that can differentiate into neurons  Researchers found a way to transform human skin cells into nerve cells using transdifferentiation  in which  cells are forced to adopt new identities              
During neurogenesis in the mammalian brain  progenitor and stem cells progress from proliferative divisions to differentiative divisions  This progression leads to the neurons and glia that populate cortical layers  Epigenetic modifications play a key role in regulating gene expression in differentiating neural stem cells  and are critical for cell fate determination in the developing and adult mammalian brain  Epigenetic modifications include DNA cytosine methylation to form   methylcytosine and   methylcytosine demethylation               DNA cytosine methylation is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases  DNMTs   Methylcytosine demethylation is catalyzed in several stages by TET enzymes that carry out oxidative reactions  e g    methylcytosine to   hydroxymethylcytosine  and enzymes of the DNA base excision repair  BER  pathway             
At different stages of mammalian nervous system development  two DNA repair processes are employed in the repair of DNA double strand breaks  These pathways are homologous recombinational repair used in proliferating neural precursor cells  and non homologous end joining used mainly at later developmental stages            
Intercellular communication between developing neurons and microglia is also indispensable for proper neurogenesis and brain development             

Nerve regeneration edit 
Main article  Neuroregeneration
Peripheral axons can regrow if they are severed              but one neuron cannot be functionally replaced by one of another type  Llin s  law
