The Fifth Generation Computer Systems  FGCS  Japanese              romanized       daigosedai konpy ta  was a    year initiative launched in      by Japan s Ministry of International Trade and Industry  MITI  to develop computers based on massively parallel computing and logic programming  The project aimed to create an  epoch making computer  with supercomputer like performance and to establish a platform for future advancements in artificial intelligence  Although FGCS was ahead of its time  its ambitious goals ultimately led to commercial failure  However  on a theoretical level  the project significantly contributed to the development of concurrent logic programming 
The term  fifth generation  was chosen to emphasize the system s advanced nature  In the history of computing hardware  there had been four prior  generations  of computers  the first generation utilized vacuum tubes  the second  transistors and diodes  the third  integrated circuits  and the fourth  microprocessors  While earlier generations focused on increasing the number of logic elements within a single CPU  it was widely believed at the time that the fifth generation would achieve enhanced performance through the use of massive numbers of CPUs      citation needed     


Background edit 
In the late     s until the early     s  there was much talk about  generations  of computer hardware  then usually organized into three generations

First generation  Thermionic vacuum tubes  Mid     s  IBM pioneered the arrangement of vacuum tubes in pluggable modules  The IBM     was a first generation computer 
Second generation  Transistors        The era of miniaturization begins  Transistors are much smaller than vacuum tubes  draw less power  and generate less heat  Discrete transistors are soldered to circuit boards  with interconnections accomplished by stencil screened conductive patterns on the reverse side  The IBM      was a second generation computer 
Third generation  Integrated circuits  silicon chips containing multiple transistors         A pioneering example is the ACPX module used in the IBM         which  by stacking layers of silicon over a ceramic substrate  accommodated over    transistors per chip  the chips could be packed together onto a circuit board to achieve unprecedented logic densities  The IBM        was a hybrid second and third generation computer 
Omitted from this taxonomy is the  zeroth generation  computer based on metal gears  such as the IBM      or mechanical relays  such as the Mark I   and the post third generation computers based on Very Large Scale Integrated  VLSI  circuits 
There was also a parallel set of generations for software 

First generation  Machine language 
Second generation  Low level programming languages such as Assembly language 
Third generation  Structured high level programming languages such as C  COBOL and FORTRAN 
Fourth generation   Non procedural  high level programming languages  such as object oriented languages             
Throughout these multiple generations up to the     s  Japan built computers following U S  and British leads  In the mid     s  the Ministry of International Trade and Industry stopped following western leads and started looking into the future of computing on a small scale  They asked the Japan Information Processing Development Center  JIPDEC  to indicate a number of future directions  and in      offered a three year contract to carry out more in depth studies along with industry and academia  It was during this period that the term  fifth generation computer  started to be used  
Prior to the     s  MITI guidance had successes such as an improved steel industry  the creation of the oil supertanker  the automotive industry  consumer electronics  and computer memory  MITI decided that the future was going to be information technology  However  the Japanese language  particularly in its written form  presented and still presents obstacles for computers             As a result of these hurdles  MITI held a conference to seek assistance from experts 
The primary fields for investigation from this initial project were 

Inference computer technologies for knowledge processing
Computer technologies to process large scale data bases and knowledge bases
High performance workstations
Distributed functional computer technologies
Super computers for scientific calculation
Project launch edit 
The aim was to build parallel computers for artificial intelligence applications using concurrent logic programming  The project imagined an  epoch making  computer with supercomputer like performance running on top of large databases  as opposed to a traditional filesystem  using a logic programming language to define and access the data using massively parallel computing processing   They envisioned building a prototype machine with performance between    M and  G LIPS  where a LIPS is a Logical Inference Per Second  At the time typical workstation machines were capable of about    k LIPS  They proposed to build this machine over a ten year period    years for initial R amp D    years for building various subsystems  and a final   years to complete a working prototype system  In      the government decided to go ahead with the project  and established the Institute for New Generation Computer Technology  ICOT  through joint investment with various Japanese computer companies  After the project ended  MITI would consider an investment in a new  sixth generation  project  
Ehud Shapiro captured the rationale and motivations driving this project            

 As part of Japan s effort to become a leader in the computer industry  the Institute for New Generation Computer Technology has launched a revolutionary ten year plan for the development of large computer systems which will be applicable to knowledge information processing systems  These Fifth Generation computers will be built around the concepts of logic programming  In order to refute the accusation that Japan exploits knowledge from abroad without contributing any of its own  this project will stimulate original research and will make its results available to the international research community  
Logic programming edit 
The target defined by the FGCS project was to develop  Knowledge Information Processing systems   roughly meaning  applied Artificial Intelligence   The chosen tool to implement this goal was logic programming  Logic programming approach as was characterized by Maarten Van Emden   one of its founders   as            

The use of logic to express information in a computer 
The use of logic to present problems to a computer 
The use of logical inference to solve these problems 
More technically  it can be summed up in two equations 

Program   Set of axioms 
Computation   Proof of a statement from axioms 
The Axioms typically used are universal axioms of a restricted form  called Horn clauses or definite clauses  The statement proved in a computation is an existential statement      citation needed      The proof is constructive  and provides values for the existentially quantified variables  these values constitute the output of the computation 
Logic programming was thought of as something that unified various gradients of computer science  software engineering  databases  computer architecture and artificial intelligence   It seemed that logic programming was a key missing connection between knowledge engineering and parallel computer architectures 

Results edit 
After having influenced the consumer electronics field during the     s and the automotive world during the     s  the Japanese had developed a strong reputation  The launch of the FGCS project spread the belief that parallel computing was the future of all performance gains  producing a wave of apprehension in the computer field  Soon parallel projects were set up in the US as the Strategic Computing Initiative and the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation  MCC   in the UK as Alvey  and in Europe as the European Strategic Program on Research in Information Technology  ESPRIT   as well as the European Computer Industry Research Centre  ECRC  in Munich  a collaboration between ICL in Britain  Bull in France  and Siemens in Germany 
The project ran from      to       spending a little less than     billion  about US     million  total             After the FGCS Project  MITI stopped funding large scale computer research projects  and the research momentum developed by the FGCS Project dissipated  However MITI ICOT embarked on a neural net project     which       which some called the Sixth Generation Project in the     s  with a similar level of funding             Per year spending was less than    of the entire R amp D expenditure of the electronics and communications equipment industry  For example  the project s highest expenditure year was     million yen in       but IBM alone spent     billion dollars      billion yen  in       while the industry spent      billion yen in                 

Concurrent logic programming edit 
In       during a visit to the ICOT  Ehud Shapiro invented Concurrent Prolog  a novel programming language that integrated logic programming and concurrent programming  Concurrent Prolog is a process oriented language  which embodies dataflow synchronization and guarded command indeterminacy as its basic control mechanisms  Shapiro described the language in a Report marked as ICOT Technical Report                 which presented a Concurrent Prolog interpreter written in Prolog  Shapiro s work on Concurrent Prolog inspired a change in the direction of the FGCS from focusing on parallel implementation of Prolog to the focus on concurrent logic programming as the software foundation for the project             It also inspired the concurrent logic programming language Guarded Horn Clauses  GHC  by Ueda  which was the basis of KL   the programming language that was finally designed and implemented by the FGCS project as its core programming language 
The FGCS project and its findings contributed greatly to the development of the concurrent logic programming field  The project produced a new generation of promising Japanese researchers 

Commercial failure edit 
Five running Parallel Inference Machines  PIM  were eventually produced  PIM m  PIM p  PIM i  PIM k  PIM c  The project also produced applications to run on these systems  such as the parallel database management system Kappa  the legal reasoning system HELIC II  and the automated theorem prover MGTP  as well as bioinformatics applications 
The FGCS Project did not meet with commercial success for reasons similar to the Lisp machine companies and Thinking Machines  The highly parallel computer architecture was eventually surpassed in speed by less specialized hardware  for example  Sun workstations and Intel x   machines  
A primary problem was the choice of concurrent logic programming as the bridge between the parallel computer architecture and the use of logic as a knowledge representation and problem solving language for AI applications  This never happened cleanly  a number of languages were developed  all with their own limitations  In particular  the committed choice feature of concurrent constraint logic programming interfered with the logical semantics of the languages             The project found that the benefits of logic programming were largely negated using committed choice      citation needed     
Another problem was that existing CPU performance quickly overcame the barriers that experts anticipated in the     s  and the value of parallel computing dropped to the point where it was for some time used only in niche situations  Although a number of workstations of increasing capacity were designed and built over the project s lifespan  they generally found themselves soon outperformed by  off the shelf  units available commercially 
The project also failed to incorporate outside innovations  During its lifespan  GUIs became mainstream in computers  the internet enabled locally stored databases to become distributed  and even simple research projects provided better real world results in data mining      citation needed      
The FGCS workstations had no appeal in a market where general purpose systems could replace and outperform them  This is parallel to the Lisp machine market  where rule based systems such as CLIPS could run on general purpose computers  making expensive Lisp machines unnecessary            

Ahead of its time edit 
In summary  the Fifth Generation project was revolutionary  and accomplished some basic research that anticipated future research directions  Many papers and patents were published  MITI established a committee which assessed the performance of the FGCS Project as having made major contributions in computing  in particular eliminating bottlenecks in parallel processing software and the realization of intelligent
interactive processing based on large knowledge bases  However  the committee was strongly biased to justify the project  so this overstates the actual results            
Many of the themes seen in the Fifth Generation project are now being re interpreted in current technologies  as the hardware limitations foreseen in the     s were finally reached in the     s  When clock speeds of CPUs began to move into the          GHz range  CPU power dissipation and other problems became more important  The ability of industry to produce ever faster single CPU systems  linked to Moore s Law about the periodic doubling of transistor counts  began to be threatened  
In the early   st century  many flavors of parallel computing began to proliferate  including multi core architectures at the low end and massively parallel processing at the high end  Ordinary consumer machines and game consoles began to have parallel processors like the Intel Core  AMD K    and Cell  Graphics card companies like Nvidia and AMD began introducing large parallel systems like CUDA and OpenCL  
It appears  however  that these new technologies do not cite FGCS research  It is not clear if FGCS was leveraged to facilitate these developments in any significant way  No significant impact of FGCS on the computing industry has been demonstrated      citation needed
