Stephen William Hawking         January                               March       was an English theoretical physicist  cosmologist  and author who was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge                                     Between      and       he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge  widely viewed as one of the most prestigious academic posts in the world             
Hawking was born in Oxford into a family of physicians  In October       at the age of     he began his university education at University College  Oxford  where he received a first class BA degree in physics  In October       he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall  Cambridge  where  in March       he obtained his PhD in applied mathematics and theoretical physics  specialising in general relativity and cosmology  In       at age     Hawking was diagnosed with an early onset slow progressing form of motor neurone disease that gradually  over decades  paralysed him                          After the loss of his speech  he communicated through a speech generating device  initially through use of a handheld switch  and eventually by using a single cheek muscle             
Hawking s scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity  and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation  often called Hawking radiation  Initially  Hawking radiation was controversial  By the late     s  and following the publication of further research  the discovery was widely accepted as a major breakthrough in theoretical physics  Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics  Hawking was a vigorous supporter of the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics                          He also introduced the notion of a micro black hole             
Hawking achieved commercial success with several works of popular science in which he discussed his theories and cosmology in general  His book A Brief History of Time appeared on the Sunday Times bestseller list for a record breaking     weeks  Hawking was a Fellow of the Royal Society  a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences  and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom  the highest civilian award in the United States  In       Hawking was ranked number    in the BBC s poll of the     Greatest Britons  He died in      at the age of     having lived more than    years following his diagnosis of motor neurone disease             


Early life
Family
Hawking was born on   January                              in Oxford to Frank and Isobel Eileen Hawking  n e Walker                           Hawking s mother was born into a family of doctors in Glasgow  Scotland                          His wealthy paternal great grandfather  from Yorkshire  over extended himself buying farm land and then went bankrupt in the great agricultural depression during the early   th century              His paternal great grandmother saved the family from financial ruin by opening a school in their home              Despite their families  financial constraints  both parents attended the University of Oxford  where Frank read medicine and Isobel read Philosophy  Politics and Economics              Isobel worked as a secretary for a medical research institute  and Frank was a medical researcher specializing in tropical diseases              Hawking said of his father   I modeled myself on him  Because he was a scientific researcher  I felt that scientific research was the natural thing to do when one grew up  The only difference was that I was not attracted to medicine or biology because they seemed too inexact and descriptive  I wanted something more fundamental  and I found it in physics              
In       when Hawking s father became head of the division of parasitology at the National Institute for Medical Research  the family moved to St Albans  Hertfordshire                          In St Albans  the family was considered highly intelligent and somewhat eccentric                          meals were often spent with each person silently reading a book              They lived a frugal existence in a large  cluttered  and poorly maintained house and travelled in a converted London taxicab                          During one of Hawking s father s frequent absences working in Africa              the rest of the family spent four months in Mallorca visiting his mother s friend Beryl and her husband  the poet Robert Graves             

Primary and secondary school years
Hawking began his schooling at the Byron House School in Highgate  London  He later blamed its  progressive methods  for his failure to learn to read while at the school                          In St Albans  the eight year old Hawking attended St Albans High School for Girls for a few months  At that time  younger boys could attend one of the houses                         
Hawking attended two private  i e  fee paying  schools  first Radlett School             and from September       St Albans School  Hertfordshire                          after passing the eleven plus a year early              The family placed a high value on education              Hawking s father wanted his son to attend Westminster School  but the    year old Hawking was ill on the day of the scholarship examination  His family could not afford the school fees without the financial aid of a scholarship  so Hawking remained at St Albans                          A positive consequence was that Hawking remained close to a group of friends with whom he enjoyed board games  the manufacture of fireworks  model aeroplanes and boats              and long discussions about Christianity and extrasensory perception              From      on  with the help of the mathematics teacher Dikran Tahta  they built a computer from clock parts  an old telephone switchboard and other recycled components                          In       he built a record player from spare parts   My father would have regarded it as recklessly self indulgent  to buy a record player  but I persuaded him that I could assemble one from parts that I could buy cheap  That appealed to him as a Yorkshireman               
Although known at school as  Einstein   Hawking was not initially successful academically              With time  he began to show considerable aptitude for scientific subjects and  inspired by Tahta  decided to study mathematics at university                                      Hawking s father advised him to study medicine  concerned that there were few jobs for mathematics graduates              He also wanted his son to attend University College  Oxford  his own alma mater  As it was not possible to read mathematics there at the time  Hawking decided to study physics and chemistry  Despite his headmaster s advice to wait until the next year  Hawking was awarded a scholarship after taking the examinations in March                              

Undergraduate years
Hawking began his university education at University College  Oxford              in October      at the age of                 For the first eighteen months  he was bored and lonely                  he found the academic work  ridiculously easy                           His physics tutor  Robert Berman  later said   It was only necessary for him to know that something could be done  and he could do it without looking to see how other people did it              A change occurred during his second and third years when  according to Berman  Hawking made more of an effort  to be one of the boys   He developed into a popular  lively and witty college member  interested in classical music and science fiction              Part of the transformation resulted from his decision to join the college boat club  the University College Boat Club  where he coxed a rowing crew                          The rowing coach at the time noted that Hawking cultivated a daredevil image  steering his crew on risky courses that led to damaged boats                          Hawking estimated that he studied about       hours during his three years at Oxford  These unimpressive study habits made sitting his finals a challenge  and he decided to answer only theoretical physics questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge  A first class degree was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study in cosmology at the University of Cambridge                          Anxious  he slept poorly the night before the examinations  and the result was on the borderline between first  and second class honours  making a viva  oral examination  with the Oxford examiners necessary                         
Hawking was concerned that he was viewed as a lazy and difficult student  So  when asked at the viva to describe his plans  he said   If you award me a First  I will go to Cambridge  If I receive a Second  I shall stay in Oxford  so I expect you will give me a First                           He was held in higher regard than he believed  as Berman commented  the examiners  were intelligent enough to realise they were talking to someone far cleverer than most of themselves               After receiving a first class BA degree in physics and completing a trip to Iran with a friend  he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall  Cambridge  in October                                          

Post graduate years
Hawking s first year as a doctoral student was difficult  He was initially disappointed to find that he had been assigned Dennis William Sciama  one of the founders of modern cosmology  as a supervisor rather than the noted astronomer Fred Hoyle                          and he found his training in mathematics inadequate for work in general relativity and cosmology              After being diagnosed with motor neurone disease  Hawking fell into a depression                  though his doctors advised that he continue with his studies  he felt there was little point              His disease progressed more slowly than doctors had predicted  Although Hawking had difficulty walking unsupported  and his speech was almost unintelligible  an initial diagnosis that he had only two years to live proved unfounded  With Sciama s encouragement  he returned to his work                          Hawking started developing a reputation for brilliance and brashness when he publicly challenged the work of Hoyle and his student Jayant Narlikar at a lecture in June                               Hawking reflected   Before I got motor neuron disease  I was bored with life  But the prospect of an early death made me realize life was really worth living              
When Hawking began his doctoral studies  there was much debate in the physics community about the prevailing theories of the creation of the universe  the Big Bang and Steady State theories              Inspired by Roger Penrose s theorem of a spacetime singularity in the centre of black holes  Hawking applied the same thinking to the entire universe  and  during       he wrote his thesis on this topic                          Hawking s thesis             was approved in                   There were other positive developments  Hawking received a research fellowship at Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge              he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics  specialising in general relativity and cosmology  in March                   and his essay  Singularities and the Geometry of Space Time  shared top honours with one by Penrose to win that year s prestigious Adams Prize                         

Career
         
In his work  and in collaboration with Penrose  Hawking extended the singularity theorem concepts first explored in his doctoral thesis  This included not only the existence of singularities but also the theory that the universe might have started as a singularity  Their joint essay was the runner up in the      Gravity Research Foundation competition                          In       they published a proof that if the universe obeys the general theory of relativity and fits any of the models of physical cosmology developed by Alexander Friedmann  then it must have begun as a singularity                                      In       Hawking accepted a specially created Fellowship for Distinction in Science to remain at Caius             
In       Hawking postulated what became known as the second law of black hole dynamics  that the event horizon of a black hole can never get smaller              With James M  Bardeen and Brandon Carter  he proposed the four laws of black hole mechanics  drawing an analogy with thermodynamics              To Hawking s irritation  Jacob Bekenstein  a graduate student of John Wheeler  went further and ultimately correctly to apply thermodynamic concepts literally                         
In the early     s  Hawking s work with Carter  Werner Israel  and David C  Robinson strongly supported Wheeler s no hair theorem  one that states that no matter what the original material from which a black hole is created  it can be completely described by the properties of mass  electrical charge and rotation                          His essay titled  Black Holes  won the Gravity Research Foundation Award in January                   Hawking s first book  The Large Scale Structure of Space Time  written with George Ellis  was published in                  
Beginning in       Hawking moved into the study of quantum gravity and quantum mechanics                          His work in this area was spurred by a visit to Moscow and discussions with Yakov Borisovich Zel dovich and Alexei Starobinsky  whose work showed that according to the uncertainty principle  rotating black holes emit particles               To Hawking s annoyance  his much checked calculations produced findings that contradicted his second law  which claimed black holes could never get smaller               and supported Bekenstein s reasoning about their entropy                           
His results  which Hawking presented from       showed that black holes emit radiation  known today as Hawking radiation  which may continue until they exhaust their energy and evaporate                                         Initially  Hawking radiation was controversial  By the late     s and following the publication of further research  the discovery was widely accepted as a significant breakthrough in theoretical physics                                         Hawking was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society  FRS  in       a few weeks after the announcement of Hawking radiation  At the time  he was one of the youngest scientists to become a Fellow                           
Hawking was appointed to the Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Visiting Professorship at the California Institute of Technology  Caltech  in       He worked with a friend on the faculty  Kip Thorne                          and engaged him in a scientific wager about whether the X ray source Cygnus X   was a black hole  The wager was an  insurance policy  against the proposition that black holes did not exist               Hawking acknowledged that he had lost the bet in       a bet that was the first of several he was to make with Thorne and others               Hawking had maintained ties to Caltech  spending a month there almost every year since this first visit              

         
Hawking returned to Cambridge in      to a more academically senior post  as reader in gravitational physics  The mid to late     s were a period of growing public interest in black holes and the physicists who were studying them  Hawking was regularly interviewed for print and television                            He also received increasing academic recognition of his work               In       he was awarded both the Eddington Medal and the Pius XI Gold Medal  and in      the Dannie Heineman Prize  the Maxwell Medal and Prize and the Hughes Medal                            He was appointed a professor with a chair in gravitational physics in                    The following year he received the Albert Einstein Medal and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford                           
In       Hawking was elected Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge                            His inaugural lecture in this role was titled   Is the End in Sight for Theoretical Physics   and proposed N     supergravity as the leading theory to solve many of the outstanding problems physicists were studying               His promotion coincided with a health crisis which led to his accepting  albeit reluctantly  some nursing services at home               At the same time  he was also making a transition in his approach to physics  becoming more intuitive and speculative rather than insisting on mathematical proofs   I would rather be right than rigorous   he told Kip Thorne               In       he proposed that information in a black hole is irretrievably lost when a black hole evaporates  This information paradox violates the fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics  and led to years of debate  including  the Black Hole War  with Leonard Susskind and Gerard  t Hooft                           

Hawking at an ALS convention in San Francisco in the     s
Cosmological inflation                  a theory proposing that following the Big Bang  the universe initially expanded incredibly rapidly before settling down to a slower expansion                  was proposed by Alan Guth and also developed by Andrei Linde               Following a conference in Moscow in October       Hawking and Gary Gibbons            organised a three week Nuffield Workshop in the summer of      on  The Very Early Universe  at Cambridge University  a workshop that focused mainly on inflation theory                                         Hawking also began a new line of quantum theory research into the origin of the universe  In      at a Vatican conference  he presented work suggesting that there might be no boundary                  or beginning or ending                  to the universe                           
Hawking subsequently developed the research in collaboration with Jim Hartle             and in      they published a model  known as the Hartle Hawking state  It proposed that prior to the Planck epoch  the universe had no boundary in space time  before the Big Bang  time did not exist and the concept of the beginning of the universe is meaningless               The initial singularity of the classical Big Bang models was replaced with a region akin to the North Pole  One cannot travel north of the North Pole  but there is no boundary there                  it is simply the point where all north running lines meet and end                            Initially  the no boundary proposal predicted a closed universe  which had implications about the existence of God  As Hawking explained   If the universe has no boundaries but is self contained    then God would not have had any freedom to choose how the universe began               
Further work by Hawking in the area of arrows of time led to the      publication of a paper theorising that if the no boundary proposition were correct  then when the universe stopped expanding and eventually collapsed  time would run backwards               A paper by Don Page and independent calculations by Raymond Laflamme led Hawking to withdraw this concept               Honours continued to be awarded  in      he was awarded the American Franklin Medal               and in the      New Year Honours appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire  CBE                                          These awards did not significantly change Hawking s financial status  and motivated by the need to finance his children s education and home expenses  he decided in      to write a popular book about the universe that would be accessible to the general public                            Instead of publishing with an academic press  he signed a contract with Bantam Books  a mass market publisher  and received a large advance for his book                            A first draft of the book  called A Brief History of Time  was completed in                   
One of the first messages Hawking produced with his speech generating device was a request for his assistant to help him finish writing A Brief History of Time               Peter Guzzardi  his editor at Bantam  pushed him to explain his ideas clearly in non technical language  a process that required many revisions from an increasingly irritated Hawking               The book was published in April      in the US and in June in the UK  and it proved to be an extraordinary success  rising quickly to the top of best seller lists in both countries and remaining there for months                                         The book was translated into many languages               and as of       has sold an estimated        million copies              
Media attention was intense               and a Newsweek magazine cover and a television special both described him as  Master of the Universe                Success led to significant financial rewards  but also the challenges of celebrity status               Hawking travelled extensively to promote his work  and enjoyed partying into the late hours               A difficulty refusing the invitations and visitors left him limited time for work and his students               Some colleagues were resentful of the attention Hawking received  feeling it was due to his disability                           
He received further academic recognition  including five more honorary degrees               the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society                      the Paul Dirac Medal                     and  jointly with Penrose  the prestigious Wolf Prize                      In the      Birthday Honours  he was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour  CH                             He reportedly declined a knighthood in the late     s in objection to the UK s science funding policy

Hawking pursued his work in physics  in      he co edited a book on Euclidean quantum gravity with Gary Gibbons and published a collected edition of his own articles on black holes and the Big Bang               In       at Cambridge s Newton Institute  Hawking and Penrose delivered a series of six lectures that were published in      as  The Nature of Space and Time                In       he conceded a      public scientific wager made with Kip Thorne and John Preskill of Caltech  Hawking had bet that Penrose s proposal of a  cosmic censorship conjecture                   that there could be no  naked singularities  unclothed within a horizon                  was correct              
After discovering his concession might have been premature  a new and more refined wager was made  This one specified that such singularities would occur without extra conditions               The same year  Thorne  Hawking and Preskill made another bet  this time concerning the black hole information paradox                            Thorne and Hawking argued that since general relativity made it impossible for black holes to radiate and lose information  the mass energy and information carried by Hawking radiation must be  new   and not from inside the black hole event horizon  Since this contradicted the quantum mechanics of microcausality  quantum mechanics theory would need to be rewritten  Preskill argued the opposite  that since quantum mechanics suggests that the information emitted by a black hole relates to information that fell in at an earlier time  the concept of black holes given by general relativity must be modified in some way              
Hawking also maintained his public profile  including bringing science to a wider audience  The documentary A Brief History of Time  directed by Errol Morris and produced by Steven Spielberg  premiered in       the film contains material from the book as well as interviews with Hawking  his friends  family and colleagues  Hawking had wanted the film to be scientific rather than biographical  but he was persuaded otherwise  The film  while a critical success  was not widely released               A popular level collection of essays  interviews  and talks titled Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays was published in                    and a six part television series Stephen Hawking s Universe and a companion book appeared in       As Hawking insisted  this time the focus was entirely on science

Hawking continued his writings for a popular audience  publishing The Universe in a Nutshell in                    and A Briefer History of Time  which he wrote in      with Leonard Mlodinow to update his earlier works with the aim of making them accessible to a wider audience  and God Created the Integers  which appeared in                    Along with Thomas Hertog at CERN and Jim Hartle  from      on Hawking developed a theory of top down cosmology  which says that the universe had not one unique initial state but many different ones  and therefore that it is inappropriate to formulate a theory that predicts the universe s current configuration from one particular initial state               Top down cosmology posits that the present  selects  the past from a superposition of many possible histories  In doing so  the theory suggests a possible resolution of the fine tuning question                           
Hawking continued to travel widely  including trips to Chile  Easter Island  South Africa  Spain  to receive the Fonseca Prize in                                  Canada               and numerous trips to the United States               For practical reasons related to his disability  Hawking increasingly travelled by private jet  and by      that had become his only mode of international travel              
By       consensus among physicists was growing that Hawking was wrong about the loss of information in a black hole               In a      lecture in Dublin  he conceded his      bet with Preskill  but described his own  somewhat controversial solution to the information paradox problem  involving the possibility that black holes have more than one topology                            In the      paper he published on the subject  he argued that the information paradox was explained by examining all the alternative histories of universes  with the information loss in those with black holes being cancelled out by those without such loss                            In January       he called the alleged loss of information in black holes his  biggest blunder               
As part of another longstanding scientific dispute  Hawking had emphatically argued  and bet  that the Higgs boson would never be found               The particle was proposed to exist as part of the Higgs field theory by Peter Higgs in       Hawking and Higgs engaged in a heated and public debate over the matter in      and again in       with Higgs criticising Hawking s work and complaining that Hawking s  celebrity status gives him instant credibility that others do not have                The particle was discovered in July      at CERN following construction of the Large Hadron Collider  Hawking quickly conceded that he had lost his bet                           and said that Higgs should win the Nobel Prize for Physics               which he did in                   
In       Hawking and his daughter Lucy published George s Secret Key to the Universe  a children s book designed to explain theoretical physics in an accessible fashion and featuring characters similar to those in the Hawking family               The book was followed by sequels in                  and                   
In       following a UK wide vote  the BBC included Hawking in their list of the     Greatest Britons               He was awarded the Copley Medal from the Royal Society                      the Presidential Medal of Freedom  which is America s highest civilian honour                      and the Russian Special Fundamental Physics Prize                     

Hawking at the unveiling of the Corpus Clock in September     
Several buildings have been named after him  including the Stephen W  Hawking Science Museum in San Salvador  El      Salvador               the Stephen Hawking Building in Cambridge               and the Stephen Hawking Centre at the Perimeter Institute in Canada               Appropriately  given Hawking s association with time  he unveiled the mechanical  Chronophage   or time eating  Corpus Clock at Corpus Christi College  Cambridge in September                                
During his career  Hawking supervised    successful PhD students             One doctoral student did not successfully complete the PhD                 better      source      needed      As required by Cambridge University policy  Hawking retired as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in                                 Despite suggestions that he might leave the United Kingdom as a protest against public funding cuts to basic scientific research               Hawking worked as director of research at the Cambridge University Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics              
On    June       as a tongue in cheek test of his      conjecture that travel into the past is effectively impossible  Hawking held a party open to all  complete with hors d oeuvres and iced champagne  but publicised the party only after it was over so that only time travellers would know to attend  as expected  nobody showed up to the party

On    July       Hawking helped launch Breakthrough Initiatives  an effort to search for extraterrestrial life               Hawking created Stephen Hawking  Expedition New Earth  a documentary on space colonisation  as a      episode of Tomorrow s World                           
In August       Hawking said that not all information is lost when something enters a black hole and there might be a possibility to retrieve information from a black hole according to his theory               In July       Hawking was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Imperial College London              
Hawking s final paper   A smooth exit from eternal inflation    was posthumously published in the Journal of High Energy Physics on    April                                


Personal life
Marriages
Hawking met his future wife  Jane Wilde  at a party in       The following year  Hawking was diagnosed with motor neurone disease  In October       the couple became engaged to marry  aware of the potential challenges that lay ahead due to Hawking s shortened life expectancy and physical limitations                            Hawking later said that the engagement gave him  something to live for                The two were married on    July      in their shared hometown of St Albans             
The couple resided in Cambridge  within Hawking s walking distance to the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics  DAMTP   During their first years of marriage  Jane lived in London during the week as she completed her degree at Westfield College  They travelled to the United States several times for conferences and physics related visits  Jane began a PhD programme through Westfield College in medieval Spanish poetry  completed in        The couple had three children  Robert  born May                                 Lucy  born November                    and Timothy  born April                   
Hawking rarely discussed his illness and physical challenges even  in a precedent set during their courtship  with Jane               His disabilities meant that the responsibilities of home and family rested firmly on his wife s shoulders  leaving him more time to think about physics               Upon his appointment in      to a year long position at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena  California  Jane proposed that a graduate or post doctoral student live with them and help with his care  Hawking accepted  and Bernard Carr travelled with them as the first of many students who fulfilled this role                            The family spent a generally happy and stimulating year in Pasadena              
Hawking returned to Cambridge in      to a new home and a new job  as reader  Don Page  with whom Hawking had begun a close friendship at Caltech  arrived to work as the live in graduate student assistant  With Page s help and that of a secretary  Jane s responsibilities were reduced so she could return to her doctoral thesis and her new interest in singing              
Around December       Jane met organist Jonathan Hellyer Jones when singing in a church choir  Hellyer Jones became close to the Hawking family and  by the mid     s  he and Jane had developed romantic feelings for each other                                         According to Jane  her husband was accepting of the situation  stating  he would not object so long as I continued to love him                                          Jane and Hellyer Jones were determined not to break up the family  and their relationship remained platonic for a long period              
By the     s  Hawking s marriage had been strained for many years  Jane felt overwhelmed by the intrusion into their family life of the required nurses and assistants               The impact of his celebrity status was challenging for colleagues and family members  while the prospect of living up to a worldwide fairytale image was daunting for the couple                            Hawking s views of religion also contrasted with her strong Christian faith and resulted in tension                                         After a tracheotomy in       Hawking required a full time nurse and nursing care was split across three shifts daily  In the late     s  Hawking grew close to one of his nurses  Elaine Mason  to the dismay of some colleagues  caregivers  and family members  who were disturbed by her strength of personality and protectiveness               In February       Hawking told Jane that he was leaving her for Mason              and departed the family home               After his divorce from Jane in       Hawking married Mason in September                            declaring   It s wonderful                  I have married the woman I love               
In       Jane Hawking published a memoir  Music to Move the Stars  describing her marriage to Hawking and its breakdown  Its revelations caused a sensation in the media but  as was his usual practice regarding his personal life  Hawking made no public comment except to say that he did not read biographies about himself               After his second marriage  Hawking s family felt excluded and marginalised from his life               For a period of about five years in the early     s  his family and staff became increasingly worried that he was being physically abused               Police investigations took place  but were closed as Hawking refused to make a complaint              
In       Hawking and Mason quietly divorced                            and Hawking resumed closer relationships with Jane  his children  and his grandchildren                            Reflecting on this happier period  a revised version of Jane s book  re titled Travelling to Infinity  My Life with Stephen  appeared in                    and was made into a film  The Theory of Everything  in                   

Disability
Hawking had a rare early onset  slow progressing form of motor neurone disease  MND  also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  ALS  or Lou Gehrig s disease   which gradually paralysed him over decades             
Hawking had experienced increasing clumsiness during his final year at Oxford  including a fall on some stairs and difficulties when rowing                            The problems worsened  and his speech became slightly slurred  His family noticed the changes when he returned home for Christmas  and medical investigations were begun                            The MND diagnosis came when Hawking was     in       At the time  doctors gave him a life expectancy of two years                           
In the late     s  Hawking s physical abilities declined  he began to use crutches and could no longer give lectures regularly               As he slowly lost the ability to write  he developed compensatory visual methods  including seeing equations in terms of geometry                            The physicist Werner Israel later compared the achievements to Mozart composing an entire symphony in his head                            Hawking was fiercely independent and unwilling to accept help or make concessions for his disabilities  He preferred to be regarded as  a scientist first  popular science writer second  and  in all the ways that matter  a normal human being with the same desires  drives  dreams  and ambitions as the next person                His wife Jane later noted   Some people would call it determination  some obstinacy  I ve called it both at one time or another                He required much persuasion to accept the use of a wheelchair at the end of the     s               but ultimately became notorious for the wildness of his wheelchair driving               Hawking was a popular and witty colleague  but his illness  as well as his reputation for brashness  distanced him from some              
When Hawking first began using a wheelchair he was using standard motorised models  The earliest surviving example of these chairs was made by BEC Mobility and sold by Christie s in November      for                        Hawking continued to use this type of chair until the early     s  at which time his ability to use his hands to drive a wheelchair deteriorated  Hawking used a variety of different chairs from that time  including a DragonMobility Dragon elevating powerchair from       as shown in the April      photo of Hawking attending NASA s   th anniversary               a Permobil C    from       and then a Permobil F  from                   
Hawking s speech deteriorated  and by the late     s he could be understood by only his family and closest friends  To communicate with others  someone who knew him well would interpret his speech into intelligible speech               Spurred by a dispute with the university over who would pay for the ramp needed for him to enter his workplace  Hawking and his wife campaigned for improved access and support for those with disabilities in Cambridge                            including adapted student housing at the university               In general  Hawking had ambivalent feelings about his role as a disability rights champion  while wanting to help others  he also sought to detach himself from his illness and its challenges               His lack of engagement in this area led to some criticism              
During a visit to CERN on the border of France and Switzerland in mid       Hawking contracted pneumonia  which in his condition was life threatening  he was so ill that Jane was asked if life support should be terminated  She refused  but the consequence was a tracheotomy  which required round the clock nursing care and caused the loss of what remained of his speech                            The National Health Service was ready to pay for a nursing home  but Jane was determined that he would live at home  The cost of the care was funded by an American foundation                            Nurses were hired for the three shifts required to provide the round the clock support he required  One of those employed was Elaine Mason  who was to become Hawking s second wife              
For his communication  Hawking initially raised his eyebrows to choose letters on a spelling card               but in      he received a computer program called the  Equalizer  from Walter Woltosz  CEO of Words Plus  who had developed an earlier version of the software to help his mother in law  who also had ALS and had lost her ability to speak and write               In a method he used for the rest of his life  Hawking could now simply press a switch to select phrases  words or letters from a bank of about             that were scanned                            The program was originally run on a desktop computer  Elaine Mason s husband  David  a computer engineer  adapted a small computer and attached it to his wheelchair              
Released from the need to use somebody to interpret his speech  Hawking commented that  I can communicate better now than before I lost my voice                The voice he used had an American accent and is no longer produced                            Despite the later availability of other voices  Hawking retained this original voice  saying that he preferred it and identified with it               Originally  Hawking activated a switch using his hand and could produce up to    words per minute               Lectures were prepared in advance and were sent to the speech synthesiser in short sections to be delivered              
Hawking gradually lost the use of his hand  and in      he began to control his communication device with movements of his cheek muscles                                         with a rate of about one word per minute               With this decline there was a risk of him developing locked in syndrome  so Hawking collaborated with Intel Corporation researchers on systems that could translate his brain patterns or facial expressions into switch activations  After several prototypes that did not perform as planned  they settled on an adaptive word predictor made by the London based startup SwiftKey  which used a system similar to his original technology  Hawking had an easier time adapting to the new system  which was further developed after inputting large amounts of Hawking s papers and other written materials and uses predictive software similar to other smartphone keyboards                                                     
By       he could no longer drive his wheelchair independently  but the same people who created his new typing mechanics were working on a method to drive his chair using movements made by his chin  This proved difficult  since Hawking could not move his neck  and trials showed that while he could indeed drive the chair  the movement was sporadic and jumpy                            Near the end of his life  Hawking experienced increased breathing difficulties  often resulting in his requiring the usage of a ventilator  and being regularly hospitalised              

Disability outreach
Starting in the     s  Hawking accepted the mantle of role model for disabled people  lecturing and participating in fundraising activities               At the turn of the century  he and eleven other humanitarians signed the Charter for the Third Millennium on Disability  which called on governments to prevent disability and protect the rights of disabled people                            In       Hawking was awarded the Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize of the American Physical Society              
In August       Hawking narrated the  Enlightenment  segment of the      Summer Paralympics opening ceremony in London               In       the biographical documentary film Hawking  in which Hawking himself is featured  was released               In September       he expressed support for the legalisation of assisted suicide for the terminally ill               In August       Hawking accepted the Ice Bucket Challenge to promote ALS MND awareness and raise contributions for research  As he had pneumonia in       he was advised not to have ice poured over him  but his children volunteered to accept the challenge on his behalf              

Plans for a trip to space

In late       Hawking revealed in a BBC interview that one of his greatest unfulfilled desires was to travel to space               On hearing this  Richard Branson offered a free flight into space with Virgin Galactic  which Hawking immediately accepted  Besides personal ambition  he was motivated by the desire to increase public interest in spaceflight and to show the potential of people with disabilities               On    April       Hawking flew aboard a specially modified Boeing         jet operated by Zero G Corp off the coast of Florida to experience weightlessness               Fears that the manoeuvres would cause him undue discomfort proved incorrect  and the flight was extended to eight parabolic arcs               It was described as a successful test to see if he could withstand the g forces involved in space flight               At the time  the date of Hawking s trip to space was projected to be as early as       but commercial flights to space did not commence before his death              

Death
Hawking died at his home in Cambridge on    March       at the age of                                            His family stated that he  died peacefully                             He was eulogised by figures in science  entertainment  politics  and other areas      a      The Gonville and Caius College flag flew at half mast and a book of condolences was signed by students and visitors                                         A tribute was made to Hawking in the closing speech by IPC President Andrew Parsons at the closing ceremony of the      Paralympic Winter Games in Pyeongchang  South Korea              
His private funeral took place on    March                    at Great St Mary s Church  Cambridge                            Guests at the funeral included The Theory of Everything actors Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones  Queen guitarist and astrophysicist Brian May  and model Lily Cole                            In addition  actor Benedict Cumberbatch  who played Stephen Hawking in Hawking  astronaut Tim Peake  Astronomer Royal Martin Rees and physicist Kip Thorne provided readings at the service               Although Hawking was an atheist  the funeral took place with a traditional Anglican service                            Following the cremation  a service of thanksgiving was held at Westminster Abbey on    June       after which his ashes were interred in the Abbey s nave  between the graves of Sir Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin      b     

Stephen Hawking s memorial stone in Westminster Abbey
Inscribed on his memorial stone are the words  Here lies what was mortal of Stephen Hawking            and his most famed equation               He directed  at least fifteen years before his death  that the Bekenstein Hawking entropy equation be his epitaph                                c      In June       it was announced that Hawking s words  set to music by Greek composer Vangelis  would be beamed into space from a European space agency satellite dish in Spain with the aim of reaching the nearest black hole   A                      
Hawking s final broadcast interview  about the detection of gravitational waves resulting from the collision of two neutron stars  occurred in October                    His final words to the world appeared posthumously  in April       in the form of a Smithsonian TV Channel documentary entitled  Leaving Earth  Or How to Colonize a Planet                            One of his final research studies  entitled A smooth exit from eternal inflation   about the origin of the universe  was published in the Journal of High Energy Physics in May                                              Later  in October       another of his final research studies  entitled Black Hole Entropy and Soft Hair               was published  and dealt with the  mystery of what happens to the information held by objects once they disappear into a black hole                             Also in October       Hawking s last book  Brief Answers to the Big Questions  a popular science book presenting his final comments on the most important questions facing humankind  was published                                        
On   November       an auction of    personal possessions of Hawking  including his doctoral thesis  Properties of Expanding Universes  PhD thesis  Cambridge University        and wheelchair  took place  and fetched about      million                            Proceeds from the auction sale of the wheelchair went to two charities  the Motor Neurone Disease Association and the Stephen Hawking Foundation               proceeds from the other items went to his estate              
In March       it was announced that the Royal Mint would issue a commemorative   p coin  only available as a commemorative edition               in honour of Hawking               The same month  Hawking s nurse  Patricia Dowdy  was struck off the nursing register for  failures over his care and financial misconduct               
In May      it was announced that an Acceptance in Lieu agreement between HMRC  the Department for Culture  Media and Sport  Cambridge University Library  Science Museum Group  and the Hawking Estate  would see around        pages of Hawking s scientific and other papers remain in Cambridge  while objects including his wheelchairs  speech synthesisers  and personal memorabilia from his former Cambridge office would be housed at the Science Museum               In February      the  Stephen Hawking at Work  display opened at the Science Museum  London as the start of a two year nationwide tour              

Personal views
Relevance of philosophy
At Google s Zeitgeist Conference in       Stephen Hawking said that  philosophy is dead   He believed that philosophers  have not kept up with modern developments in science    have not taken science sufficiently seriously and so Philosophy is no longer relevant to knowledge claims    their art is dead  and that scientists  have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge   He said that philosophical problems can be answered by science  particularly new scientific theories which  lead us to a new and very different picture of the universe and our place in it                His view was both praised and criticised               He said   Love  faith and morality belong to a different category to physics  You cannot deduce how one should behave from the laws of physics  But one could hope that the logical thought that physics and mathematics involves would guide one also in one s moral behavior              

Future of humanity
President Barack Obama talks with Hawking in the White House before a ceremony presenting him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom on    August      
In       Hawking posed an open question on the Internet   In a world that is in chaos politically  socially and environmentally  how can the human race sustain another     years    later clarifying   I don t know the answer  That is why I asked the question  to get people to think about it  and to be aware of the dangers we now face               
Hawking expressed concern that life on Earth is at risk from a sudden nuclear war  a genetically engineered virus  global warming  an asteroid collision  or other dangers humans have not yet thought of                                         Hawking stated   I regard it as almost inevitable that either a nuclear confrontation or environmental catastrophe will cripple the Earth at some point in the next       years                Such a planet wide disaster need not result in human extinction if the human race were to be able to colonise additional planets before the disaster               Hawking viewed spaceflight and the colonisation of space as necessary for the future of humanity                           
Hawking stated that  given the vastness of the universe  aliens likely exist  but that contact with them should be avoided                            He warned that aliens might pillage Earth for resources  In      he said   If aliens visit us  the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America  which didn t turn out well for the Native Americans               
Hawking warned that superintelligent artificial intelligence could be pivotal in steering humanity s fate  stating that  the potential benefits are huge    Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history  It might also be the last  unless we learn how to avoid the risks                             He feared that  an extremely intelligent future AI will probably develop a drive to survive and acquire more resources as a step toward accomplishing whatever goal it has   and that  The real risk with AI isn t malice but competence  A super intelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals  and if those goals aren t aligned with ours  we re in trouble                He also considered that the enormous wealth generated by machines needs to be redistributed to prevent exacerbated economic inequality              
Hawking was concerned about the future emergence of a race of  superhumans  that would be able to design their own evolution              and  as well  argued that computer viruses in today s world should be considered a new form of life  stating that  maybe it says something about human nature  that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive  Talk about creating life in our own image               

Religion and atheism
Hawking did not rule out the existence of a Creator  asking in A Brief History of Time  Is the unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence                 also stating  If we discover a complete theory  it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason                  for then we should know the mind of God                in his early work  Hawking spoke of God in a metaphorical sense  In the same book he suggested that the existence of God was not necessary to explain the origin of the universe  Later discussions with Neil Turok led to the realisation that the existence of God was also compatible with an open universe               He said  All my work has shown is that you don t have to say that the way the Universe began was the personal whim of God  But you still have the question   Why does the Universe bother to exist   If you like  you can define God as the answer to that question              
Hawking was an atheist                            In an interview published in The Guardian  Hawking regarded  the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail   and the concept of an afterlife as a  fairy story for people afraid of the dark                             In       narrating the first episode of the American television series Curiosity on the Discovery Channel  Hawking declared 

We are each free to believe what we want and it is my view that the simplest explanation is there is no God  No one created the universe and no one directs our fate  This leads me to a profound realisation  There is probably no heaven  and no afterlife either  We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe  and for that  I am extremely grateful                           
Hawking s association with atheism and freethinking was in evidence from his university years onwards  when he had been a member of Oxford University s humanist group  He was later scheduled to appear as the keynote speaker at a      Humanists UK conference               In an interview with El Mundo  he said 

Before we understand science  it is natural to believe that God created the universe  But now science offers a more convincing explanation  What I meant by  we would know the mind of God  is  we would know everything that God would know  if there were a God  which there isn t  I m an atheist              
In addition  Hawking stated 

If you like  you can call the laws of science  God   but it wouldn t be a personal God that you would meet and put questions to              
Politics
Hawking was a longstanding Labour Party supporter                            He recorded a tribute for the      Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore               called the      invasion of Iraq a  war crime                              campaigned for nuclear disarmament                            and supported stem cell research                            universal health care               and action to prevent climate change               In August       Hawking was one of     public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September s referendum on that issue               Hawking believed a United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union  Brexit  would damage the UK s contribution to science as modern research needs international collaboration  and that free movement of people in Europe encourages the spread of ideas               Hawking said to Theresa May   I deal with tough mathematical questions every day  but please don t ask me to help with Brexit                 Hawking was disappointed by Brexit and warned against envy and isolationism              
Hawking was greatly concerned over health care  and maintained that without the UK National Health Service  he could not have survived into his   s               Hawking especially feared privatisation  He stated   The more profit is extracted from the system  the more private monopolies grow and the more expensive healthcare becomes  The NHS must be preserved from commercial interests and protected from those who want to privatise it                Hawking blamed the Conservatives for cutting funding to the NHS  weakening it by privatisation  lowering staff morale through holding pay back and reducing social care               Hawking accused Jeremy Hunt of cherry picking evidence which Hawking maintained debased science               Hawking also stated   There is overwhelming evidence that NHS funding and the numbers of doctors and nurses are inadequate  and it is getting worse               
In June       Hawking endorsed the Labour Party in the      UK general election  citing the Conservatives  proposed cuts to the NHS  But he was also critical of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn  expressing scepticism over whether the party could win a general election under him              
Hawking feared Donald Trump s policies on global warming could endanger the planet and make global warming irreversible  He said   Climate change is one of the great dangers we face  and it s one we can prevent if we act now  By denying the evidence for climate change  and pulling out of the Paris Agreement  Donald Trump will cause avoidable environmental damage to our beautiful planet  endangering the natural world  for us and our children                Hawking further stated that this could lead Earth  to become like Venus  with a temperature of two hundred and fifty degrees  and raining sulphuric acid               
Hawking was also a supporter of a universal basic income               He was critical of the Israeli government s position on the Israeli Palestinian conflict  stating that their policy  is likely to lead to disaster

At the release party for the home video version of the A Brief History of Time  Leonard Nimoy  who had played Spock on Star Trek  learned that Hawking was interested in appearing on the show  Nimoy made the necessary contact  and Hawking played a holographic simulation of himself in an episode of Star Trek  The Next Generation in                                 The same year  his synthesiser voice was recorded for the Pink Floyd song  Keep Talking                             and in      for an appearance on The Simpsons               Hawking appeared in documentaries titled The Real Stephen Hawking                      Stephen Hawking  Profile                     and Hawking         and the documentary series Stephen Hawking  Master of the Universe                      Hawking also guest starred in Futurama              and had a recurring role in The Big Bang Theory              
Hawking allowed the use of his copyrighted voice                           in the biographical      film The Theory of Everything  in which he was portrayed by Eddie Redmayne in an Academy Award winning role               Hawking was featured at the Monty Python Live  Mostly  show in       He was shown to sing an extended version of the  Galaxy Song   after running down Brian Cox with his wheelchair  in a pre recorded video                           
Hawking used his fame to advertise products  including a wheelchair               National Savings               British Telecom  Specsavers  Egg Banking               and Go Compare               In       he applied to trademark his name              
Broadcast in March      just a week or two before his death  Hawking was the voice of The Book Mark II on The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy radio series  and he was the guest of Neil deGrasse Tyson on StarTalk              
The      animated sitcom The Freak Brothers features a recurring character  Mayor Pimco  who is apparently modelled after Stephen Hawking               
On   January       Google featured Hawking in a Google Doodle on the occasion of his   th birthday               
On Desert Island Discs  Hawking chose Francis Poulenc s  Gloria  Brahms s  Violin Concerto  Beethoven s  String Quartet No      Wagner s Die Walk re  Act    The Beatles s  Please Please Me   Mozart s  Requiem  Puccini s  O Principe  che a lunghe carovane  and Edith Piaf s  Non  je ne regrette rien    That just about sums up my life    For his book  he chose George Eliot s Middlemarch   I think someone  maybe it was Virginia Woolf  said it was a book for adults  I m not sure I m grownup yet  but I will give it a try              

Awards and honours

Hawking received numerous awards and honours  Already early in the list  in      he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society  FRS              At that time  his nomination read 

Hawking has made major contributions to the field of general relativity  These derive from a deep understanding of what is relevant to physics and astronomy  and especially from a mastery of wholly new mathematical techniques  Following the pioneering work of Penrose he established  partly alone and partly in collaboration with Penrose  a series of successively stronger theorems establishing the fundamental result that all realistic cosmological models must possess singularities  Using similar techniques  Hawking has proved the basic theorems on the laws governing black holes  that stationary solutions of Einstein s equations with smooth event horizons must necessarily be axisymmetric  and that in the evolution and interaction of black holes  the total surface area of the event horizons must increase  In collaboration with G  Ellis  Hawking is the author of an impressive and original treatise on  Space time in the Large  
The citation continues   Other important work by Hawking relates to the interpretation of cosmological observations and to the design of gravitational wave detectors               
Hawking was also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences                      the American Philosophical Society                      and the United States National Academy of Sciences                     
Hawking received the      BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Basic Sciences shared with Viatcheslav Mukhanov for discovering that the galaxies were formed from quantum fluctuations in the early Universe  At the      Pride of Britain Awards  Hawking received the lifetime achievement award  for his contribution to science and British culture                After receiving the award from Prime Minister Theresa May  Hawking humorously requested that she not seek his help with Brexit              

The Hawking Fellowship
Main article  Hawking Fellowship
In       the Cambridge Union Society  in conjunction with Hawking  established the Professor Stephen Hawking Fellowship  The fellowship is awarded annually to an individual who has made an exceptional contribution to the STEM fields and social discourse               with a particular focus on impacts affecting the younger generations  Each fellow delivers a lecture on a topic of their choosing  known as the  Hawking Lecture               
Hawking himself accepted the inaugural fellowship  and he delivered the first Hawking Lecture in his last public appearance before his death                            

Medal for Science Communication
Main article  Stephen Hawking Medal for Science Communication
Hawking was a member of the advisory board of the Starmus Festival  and had a major role in acknowledging and promoting science communication  The Stephen Hawking Medal for Science Communication is an annual award initiated in      to honour members of the arts community for contributions that help build awareness of science               Recipients receive a medal bearing a portrait of Hawking by Alexei Leonov  and the other side represents an image of Leonov himself performing the first spacewalk along with an image of the  Red Special   the guitar of Queen musician and astrophysicist Brian May  with music being another major component of the Starmus Festival               
The Starmus III Festival in      was a tribute to Stephen Hawking and the book of all Starmus III lectures   Beyond the Horizon   was also dedicated to him  The first recipients of the medals  which were awarded at the festival  were chosen by Hawking himself  They were composer Hans Zimmer  physicist Jim Al Khalili  and the science documentary Particle Fever

where

 is black hole temperature

 is the mass of the black hole  and 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
      displaystyle k 
  
 is the Boltzmann constant  This relationship between concepts from the disparate fields of general relativity  quantum mechanics and thermodynamics implies the existence of deep connections between them and may presage their unification  It is inscribed on Hawking s memorial stone              

The equation s most fundamental implication can be obtained as follows  According to thermodynamics  this temperature is associated with an entropy

      displaystyle Mc     
  
 is the energy of a  nonspinning  black hole as expressed with Einstein s formula               Combining equations then gives 


  
    
      
        S

Now  the radius of a nonspinning black hole is given by 
  
    
      
        r

      displaystyle r   frac   GM  c        
  
 and since its surface area is just

          x c

      displaystyle S 
  
 can be expressed in terms of surface area as

      displaystyle S   text BH     frac  kc        hbar G  A  
  

where the subscript BH stands for either  black hole  or  Bekenstein Hawking   This can be expressed more simply as a proportionality between two dimensionless ratios

      displaystyle   frac  S   text BH    k     frac          frac  A  l   text P

      displaystyle l   text P     sqrt   hbar G c

Jacob Bekenstein had conjectured the proportionality  Hawking confirmed it and established the constant of proportionality at 
  
    
      
         
        
           
        
         
      
    
      displaystyle     
  
                            Calculations based on string theory  first carried out in       have been found to yield the same result              

This relationship is conjectured to be valid not just for black holes  but also  since entropy is proportional to information  as an upper bound on the amount of information that can be contained in any volume of space  which has in turn spawned deeper reflections on the possible nature of reality
