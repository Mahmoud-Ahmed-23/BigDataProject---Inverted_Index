Computer system emulating the decision making ability of a human expert
A Symbolics      Lisp machine  an early        platform for expert systems
In artificial intelligence  AI   an expert system is a computer system emulating the decision making ability of a human expert            
Expert systems are designed to solve complex problems by reasoning through bodies of knowledge  represented mainly as if then rules rather than through conventional procedural programming code              Expert systems were among the first truly successful forms of AI software                                                         They were created in the     s and then proliferated in the     s             being then widely regarded as the future of AI   before the advent of successful artificial neural networks            
An expert system is divided into two subsystems     a knowledge base  which represents facts and rules  and    an inference engine  which applies the rules to the known facts to deduce new facts  and can include explaining and debugging abilities 


History edit 
Early development edit 
Soon after the dawn of modern computers in the late     s and early     s  researchers started realizing the immense potential these machines had for modern society  One of the first challenges was to make such machines able to  think  like humans   in particular  making these machines able to make important decisions the way humans do  The medical healthcare field presented the tantalizing challenge of enabling these machines to make medical diagnostic decisions             
Thus  in the late     s  right after the information age had fully arrived  researchers started experimenting with the prospect of using computer technology to emulate human decision making  For example  biomedical researchers started creating computer aided systems for diagnostic applications in medicine and biology  These early diagnostic systems used patients  symptoms and laboratory test results as inputs to generate a diagnostic outcome                         
These systems were often described as the early forms of expert systems  However  researchers realized that there were significant limits when using traditional methods such as flow charts             
             statistical pattern matching              or probability theory                         

Formal introduction and later developments edit 
This section may be too long to read and navigate comfortably  Consider splitting content into sub articles  condensing it  or adding subheadings  Please discuss this issue on the article s talk page    February      
This previous situation gradually led to the development of expert systems  which used knowledge based approaches  These expert systems in medicine were the MYCIN expert system              the Internist I expert system             and later  in the middle of the     s  the CADUCEUS             
Expert systems were formally introduced around      by the Stanford Heuristic Programming Project led by Edward Feigenbaum  who is sometimes termed the  father of expert systems               other key early contributors were Bruce Buchanan and Randall Davis  The Stanford researchers tried to identify domains where expertise was highly valued and complex  such as diagnosing infectious diseases  Mycin  and identifying unknown organic molecules  Dendral               The idea that  intelligent systems derive their power from the knowledge they possess rather than from the specific formalisms and inference schemes they use                as Feigenbaum said   was at the time a significant step forward  since the past research had been focused on heuristic computational methods  culminating in attempts to develop very general purpose problem solvers  foremostly the conjunct work of Allen Newell and Herbert Simon               Expert systems became some of the first truly successful forms of artificial intelligence  AI  software                                                        
Research on expert systems was also active in Europe  In the US  the focus tended to be on the use of production rule systems  first on systems hard coded on top of Lisp programming environments and then on expert system shells developed by vendors such as Intellicorp  In Europe  research focused more on systems and expert systems shells developed in Prolog  The advantage of Prolog systems was that they employed a form of rule based programming that was based on formal logic                         
One such early expert system shell based on Prolog was APES             
One of the first use cases of Prolog and APES was in the legal area namely  the encoding of a large portion of the British Nationality Act  Lance Elliot wrote   The British Nationality Act was passed in      and shortly thereafter was used as a means of showcasing the efficacy of using Artificial Intelligence  AI  techniques and technologies  doing so to explore how the at the time newly enacted statutory law might be encoded into a computerized logic based formalization  A now oft cited research paper entitled  The British Nationality Act as a Logic Program  was published in      and subsequently became a hallmark for subsequent work in AI and the law                          
In the     s  expert systems proliferated  Universities offered expert system courses and two thirds of the Fortune     companies applied the technology in daily business activities                         Interest was international with the Fifth Generation Computer Systems project in Japan and increased research funding in Europe 
In       the first IBM PC  with the PC DOS operating system  was introduced              The imbalance between the high affordability of the relatively powerful chips in the PC  compared to the much more expensive cost of processing power in the mainframes that dominated the corporate IT world at the time  created a new type of architecture for corporate computing  termed the client server model              Calculations and reasoning could be performed at a fraction of the price of a mainframe using a PC  This model also enabled business units to bypass corporate IT departments and directly build their own applications  As a result  client server had a tremendous impact on the expert systems market  Expert systems were already outliers in much of the business world  requiring new skills that many IT departments did not have and were not eager to develop  They were a natural fit for new PC based shells that promised to put application development into the hands of end users and experts  Until then  the main development environment for expert systems had been high end Lisp machines from Xerox  Symbolics  and Texas Instruments  With the rise of the PC and client server computing  vendors such as Intellicorp and Inference Corporation shifted their priorities to developing PC based tools  Also  new vendors  often financed by venture capital  such as Aion Corporation  Neuron Data  Exsys  VP Expert  and many others                           started appearing regularly 
The first expert system to be used in a design capacity for a large scale product was the Synthesis of Integral Design  SID  software program  developed in       Written in Lisp  SID generated     of the VAX      CPU logic gates              Input to the software was a set of rules created by several expert logic designers  SID expanded the rules and generated software logic synthesis routines many times the size of the rules themselves  Surprisingly  the combination of these rules resulted in an overall design that exceeded the capabilities of the experts themselves  and in many cases out performed the human counterparts  While some rules contradicted others  top level control parameters for speed and area provided the tie breaker  The program was highly controversial but used nevertheless due to project budget constraints  It was terminated by logic designers after the VAX      project completion 
During the years before the middle of the     s  the expectations of what expert systems can accomplish in many fields tended to be extremely optimistic  At the start of these early studies  researchers were hoping to develop entirely automatic  i e   completely computerized  expert systems  The expectations of people of what computers can do were frequently too idealistic  This situation radically changed after Richard M  Karp published his breakthrough paper   Reducibility among Combinatorial Problems  in the early     s              Thanks to Karp s work  together with other scholars  like Hubert L  Dreyfus              it became clear that there are certain limits and possibilities when one designs computer algorithms  His findings describe what computers can do and what they cannot do  Many of the computational problems related to this type of expert systems have certain pragmatic limits  These findings laid down the groundwork that led to the next developments in the field             
In the     s and beyond  the term expert system and the idea of a standalone AI system mostly dropped from the IT lexicon  There are two interpretations of this  One is that  expert systems failed   the IT world moved on because expert systems did not deliver on their over hyped promise                          The other is the mirror opposite  that expert systems were simply victims of their success  as IT professionals grasped concepts such as rule engines  such tools migrated from being standalone tools for developing special purpose expert systems  to being one of many standard tools              Other researchers suggest that Expert Systems caused inter company power struggles when the IT organization lost its exclusivity in software modifications to users or Knowledge Engineers             
In the first decade of the     s  there was a  resurrection  for the technology  while using the term rule based systems  with significant success stories and adoption              Many of the leading major business application suite vendors  such as SAP  Siebel  and Oracle  integrated expert system abilities into their suite of products as a way to specify business logic  Rule engines are no longer simply for defining the rules an expert would use but for any type of complex  volatile  and critical business logic  they often go hand in hand with business process automation and integration environments                                     

Current approaches to expert systems edit 
The limits of prior type of expert systems prompted researchers to develop new types of approaches  They have developed more efficient  flexible  and powerful methods to simulate the human decision making process  Some of the approaches that researchers have developed are based on new methods of artificial intelligence  AI   and in particular in machine learning and data mining approaches with a feedback mechanism                  failed verification      Recurrent neural networks often take advantage of such mechanisms  Related is the discussion on the disadvantages section 
Modern systems can incorporate new knowledge more easily and thus update themselves easily  Such systems can generalize from existing knowledge better and deal with vast amounts of complex data  Related is the subject of big data here  Sometimes these type of expert systems are called  intelligent systems              
More recently  it can be argued that expert systems have moved into the area of business rules and business rules management systems 

Software architecture edit 
Illustrating example of backward chaining from a      Master s Thesis            
An expert system is an example of a knowledge based system  Expert systems were the first commercial systems to use a knowledge based architecture  In general view  an expert system includes the following components  a knowledge base  an inference engine  an explanation facility  a knowledge acquisition facility  and a user interface                         
The knowledge base represents facts about the world  In early expert systems such as Mycin and Dendral  these facts were represented mainly as flat assertions about variables  In later expert systems developed with commercial shells  the knowledge base took on more structure and used concepts from object oriented programming  The world was represented as classes  subclasses  and instances and assertions were replaced by values of object instances  The rules worked by querying and asserting values of the objects 
The inference engine is an automated reasoning system that evaluates the current state of the knowledge base  applies relevant rules  and then asserts new knowledge into the knowledge base  The inference engine may also include abilities for explanation  so that it can explain to a user the chain of reasoning used to arrive at a particular conclusion by tracing back over the firing of rules that resulted in the assertion             
There are mainly two modes for an inference engine  forward chaining and backward chaining  The different approaches are dictated by whether the inference engine is being driven by the antecedent  left hand side  or the consequent  right hand side  of the rule  In forward chaining an antecedent fires and asserts the consequent  For example  consider the following rule 

  
    
      
        R
         
         
        
          
            M
            a
            n
          
        
         
        x
         
        
          x  f  
        
        
          
            M
            o
            r
            t
            a
            l
          
        
         
        x
         
      
    
      displaystyle R    mathit  Man   x  implies   mathit  Mortal   x  
  

A simple example of forward chaining would be to assert Man Socrates  to the system and then trigger the inference engine  It would match R  and assert Mortal Socrates  into the knowledge base 
Backward chaining is a bit less straight forward  In backward chaining the system looks at possible conclusions and works backward to see if they might be true  So if the system was trying to determine if Mortal Socrates  is true it would find R  and query the knowledge base to see if Man Socrates  is true  One of the early innovations of expert systems shells was to integrate inference engines with a user interface  This could be especially powerful with backward chaining  If the system needs to know a particular fact but does not  then it can simply generate an input screen and ask the user if the information is known  So in this example  it could use R  to ask the user if Socrates was a Man and then use that new information accordingly 
The use of rules to explicitly represent knowledge also enabled explanation abilities  In the simple example above if the system had used R  to assert that Socrates was Mortal and a user wished to understand why Socrates was mortal they could query the system and the system would look back at the rules which fired to cause the assertion and present those rules to the user as an explanation  In English  if the user asked  Why is Socrates Mortal   the system would reply  Because all men are mortal and Socrates is a man   A significant area for research was the generation of explanations from the knowledge base in natural English rather than simply by showing the more formal but less intuitive rules             
As expert systems evolved  many new techniques were incorporated into various types of inference engines              Some of the most important of these were 

Truth maintenance  These systems record the dependencies in a knowledge base so that when facts are altered  dependent knowledge can be altered accordingly  For example  if the system learns that Socrates is no longer known to be a man it will revoke the assertion that Socrates is mortal 
Hypothetical reasoning  In this  the knowledge base can be divided up into many possible views  a k a  worlds  This allows the inference engine to explore multiple possibilities in parallel  For example  the system may want to explore the consequences of both assertions  what will be true if Socrates is a Man and what will be true if he is not 
Uncertainty systems  One of the first extensions of simply using rules to represent knowledge was also to associate a probability with each rule  So  not to assert that Socrates is mortal  but to assert Socrates may be mortal with some probability value  Simple probabilities were extended in some systems with sophisticated mechanisms for uncertain reasoning  such as fuzzy logic  and combination of probabilities 
Ontology classification  With the addition of object classes to the knowledge base  a new type of reasoning was possible  Along with reasoning simply about object values  the system could also reason about object structures  In this simple example  Man can represent an object class and R  can be redefined as a rule that defines the class of all men  These types of special purpose inference engines are termed classifiers  Although they were not highly used in expert systems  classifiers are very powerful for unstructured volatile domains  and are a key technology for the Internet and the emerging Semantic Web                         
Advantages edit 
The goal of knowledge based systems is to make the critical information required for the system to work explicit rather than implicit              In a traditional computer program  the logic is embedded in code that can typically only be reviewed by an IT specialist  With an expert system  the goal was to specify the rules in a format that was intuitive and easily understood  reviewed  and even edited by domain experts rather than IT experts  The benefits of this explicit knowledge representation were rapid development and ease of maintenance 
Ease of maintenance is the most obvious benefit  This was achieved in two ways  First  by removing the need to write conventional code  many of the normal problems that can be caused by even small changes to a system could be avoided with expert systems  Essentially  the logical flow of the program  at least at the highest level  was simply a given for the system  simply invoke the inference engine  This also was a reason for the second benefit  rapid prototyping  With an expert system shell it was possible to enter a few rules and have a prototype developed in days rather than the months or year typically associated with complex IT projects 
A claim for expert system shells that was often made was that they removed the need for trained programmers and that experts could develop systems themselves  In reality  this was seldom if ever true  While the rules for an expert system were more comprehensible than typical computer code  they still had a formal syntax where a misplaced comma or other character could cause havoc as with any other computer language  Also  as expert systems moved from prototypes in the lab to deployment in the business world  issues of integration and maintenance became far more critical  Inevitably demands to integrate with  and take advantage of  large legacy databases and systems arose  To accomplish this  integration required the same skills as any other type of system             
Summing up the benefits of using expert systems  the following can be highlighted             

Increased availability and reliability  Expertise can be accessed on any computer hardware and the system always completes responses on time 
Multiple expertise  Several expert systems can be run simultaneously to solve a problem  and gain a higher level of expertise than a human expert 
Explanation  Expert systems always describe of how the problem was solved 
Fast response  The expert systems are fast and able to solve a problem in real time 
Reduced cost  The cost of expertise for each user is significantly reduced 
Disadvantages edit 
The most common disadvantage cited for expert systems in the academic literature is the knowledge acquisition problem  Obtaining the time of domain experts for any software application is always difficult  but for expert systems it was especially difficult because the experts were by definition highly valued and in constant demand by the organization  As a result of this problem  a great deal of research in the later years of expert systems was focused on tools for knowledge acquisition  to help automate the process of designing  debugging  and maintaining rules defined by experts  However  when looking at the life cycle of expert systems in actual use  other problems   essentially the same problems as those of any other large system   seem at least as critical as knowledge acquisition  integration  access to large databases  and performance                         
Performance could be especially problematic because early expert systems were built using tools  such as earlier Lisp versions  that interpreted code expressions without first compiling them  This provided a powerful development environment  but with the drawback that it was virtually impossible to match the efficiency of the fastest compiled languages  such as C   System and database integration were difficult for early expert systems because the tools were mostly in languages and platforms that were neither familiar to nor welcome in most corporate IT environments   programming languages such as Lisp and Prolog  and hardware platforms such as Lisp machines and personal computers  As a result  much effort in the later stages of expert system tool development was focused on integrating with legacy environments such as COBOL and large database systems  and on porting to more standard platforms  These issues were resolved mainly by the client server paradigm shift  as PCs were gradually accepted in the IT environment as a legitimate platform for serious business system development and as affordable minicomputer servers provided the processing power needed for AI applications             
Another major challenge of expert systems emerges when the size of the knowledge base increases  This causes the processing complexity to increase  For instance  when an expert system with     million rules was envisioned as the ultimate expert system  it became obvious that such system would be too complex and it would face too many computational problems              An inference engine would have to be able to process huge numbers of rules to reach a decision 
How to verify that decision rules are consistent with each other is also a challenge when there are too many rules  Usually such problem leads to a satisfiability  SAT  formulation              This is a well known NP complete problem Boolean satisfiability problem  If we assume only binary variables  say n of them  and then the corresponding search space is of size  
  
    
      
        
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle   n  
  
  Thus  the search space can grow exponentially 
There are also questions on how to prioritize the use of the rules to operate more efficiently  or how to resolve ambiguities  for instance  if there are too many else if sub structures within one rule  and so on             
Other problems are related to the overfitting and overgeneralization effects when using known facts and trying to generalize to other cases not described explicitly in the knowledge base  Such problems exist with methods that employ machine learning approaches too                         
Another problem related to the knowledge base is how to make updates of its knowledge quickly and effectively                                      Also how to add a new piece of knowledge  i e   where to add it among many rules  is challenging  Modern approaches that rely on machine learning methods are easier in this regard      citation needed     
Because of the above challenges  it became clear that new approaches to AI were required instead of rule based technologies  These new approaches are based on the use of machine learning techniques  along with the use of feedback mechanisms             
The key challenges that expert systems in medicine  if one considers computer aided diagnostic systems as modern expert systems   and perhaps in other application domains  include issues related to aspects such as  big data  existing regulations  healthcare practice  various algorithmic issues  and system assessment             
Finally  the following disadvantages of using expert systems can be summarized             

Expert systems have superficial knowledge  and a simple task can potentially become computationally expensive 
Expert systems require knowledge engineers to input the data  data acquisition is very hard 
The expert system may choose the most inappropriate method for solving a particular problem 
Problems of ethics in the use of any form of AI are very relevant at present 
It is a closed world with specific knowledge  in which there is no deep perception of concepts and their interrelationships until an expert provides them 
Applications edit 
Hayes Roth divides expert systems applications into    categories illustrated in the following table  The example applications were not in the original Hayes Roth table  and some of them arose well afterward  Any application that is not footnoted is described in the Hayes Roth book              Also  while these categories provide an intuitive framework to describe the space of expert systems applications  they are not rigid categories  and in some cases an application may show traits of more than one category

Hearsay was an early attempt at solving voice recognition through an expert systems approach  For the most part this category of expert systems was not all that successful  Hearsay and all interpretation systems are essentially pattern recognition systems looking for patterns in noisy data  In the case of Hearsay recognizing phonemes in an audio stream  Other early examples were analyzing sonar data to detect Russian submarines  These kinds of systems proved much more amenable to a neural network AI solution than a rule based approach 
CADUCEUS and MYCIN were medical diagnosis systems  The user describes their symptoms to the computer as they would to a doctor and the computer returns a medical diagnosis 
Dendral was a tool to study hypothesis formation in the identification of organic molecules  The general problem it solved designing a solution given a set of constraints was one of the most successful areas for early expert systems applied to business domains such as salespeople configuring Digital Equipment Corporation  DEC  VAX computers and mortgage loan application development 
SMH PAL is an expert system for the assessment of students with multiple disabilities             
GARVAN ES  was a medical expert system  developed at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research  that provided automated clinical diagnostic comments on endocrine reports from a pathology laboratory  It was one of the first medical expert systems to go into routine clinical use internationally             and the first expert system to be used for diagnosis daily in Australia              The system was written in  C  and ran on a PDP    in   K of memory  It had     rules that were compiled  not interpreted
