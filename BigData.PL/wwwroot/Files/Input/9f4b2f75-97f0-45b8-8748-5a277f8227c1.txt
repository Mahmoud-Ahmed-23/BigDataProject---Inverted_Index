							Kofi Ansah  In the     s and     s  young Africans were assisted financially by their governments to study in western countries in the hope they would return to contribute to nation building  Individuals who qualified abroad and returned home formed the educated elites of immediate post independent Africa ContentsTransforming Ghana s fashion industryAnsah s impact



Over the years  the demography of such migrants has changed to include professionals who after graduation at home move abroad in search of employment and remain there permanently  This loss of human talent and skills   the  brain drain    is arguably one of Africa s key developmental challenges 



The migration of highly skilled professionals such as doctors  nurses  engineers and academics from Africa has serious economic  political and social implications for development 



But there is another side to the migration of skilled people  That is  brain gain    the return migration of professionals   and  brain circulation    temporary migration of professionals between countries  This is not well documented  especially in the case of African countries 



This is the gap we sought to fill  using a case study of the late Ghanaian fashion designer  Kofi Ansah 



Ansah s impact on Ghanaian fashion was immense because of the timing and context of his return in       He had built a successful career for    years in the UK and the future looked promising  On the other hand  the country he returned to was undergoing profound political and economic transformation  Ghana was transitioning from military rule to a civilian government  Political tension was high  linked to an economic downturn following structural adjustment programmes adopted in the     s  But Ansah chose to relocate his budding career to Ghana 



His case demonstrates how the knowledge and expertise migrants gather through international career mobility can be converted into assets at an individual  national and international level  Returning migrants can transform traditional industries into modern  globalised ones 



Transforming Ghana s fashion industry



We are researchers in sociology  African studies and geography who have been studying how internal and external migration and spatial context influence cultural and creative practice in Ghana  For the Kofi Ansah case study we interviewed    Ghanaian fashion designers whose career journeys had been directly and indirectly influenced by him  These interviews are supplemented by information from social media dedicated to Ansah and his works 



Kofi Ansah  who died in       was from a creative family  His elder sister  Felicia Abban  was the official photographer of Kwame Nkrumah  Ghana s first president  His elder brother  Kwaw Ansah  is an acclaimed film writer  director and producer 



After completing his secondary education  Kofi enrolled in the Chelsea School of Art in the United Kingdom to study fashion design  He made his first fashion headline after he designed a beaded dress for Princess Anne  Subsequently  he worked for several successful British fashion brands  including Gerald Austin and Guy Laroche  before establishing his own studio in central London in      



Despite his early success on the UK fashion scene  Ansah returned to Ghana in      to get fresh inspiration and  try to show people that we can use our fabrics for other things   We just have to work on it and make it commercial   he explained during an interview 



The way cloth was produced locally  using strip loom technology  limited the volume of production  And the conventional styling of clothes limited their patronage  These were some of the features Ansah sought to change 



Ansah transformed Ghana s fashion industry in four areas 




Fabrics and design  His modern designs used African traditional cloth  such as kente and bogolanfini  Linked to these style changes was his collaboration with Woodin and the Ghana Textiles Production  two textile producing companies  to introduce the sale of fabric in single yards instead of the standard six yards  This made the cloth more accessible and functional  It led to the production of casual clothes  such as skirts  blouses  shirts  shorts and trousers  for men and women  He then introduced ready to wear clothing at Woodin 



Accessories  Ansah was also passionate about promoting fashion accessories made with local materials  These included wood  raffia and his personal favourite  calabash  His runway designs always included stunning accessories  The use of prominent accessories has now become an integral element of African fashion shows 



Production  Ansah was instrumental in the introduction of the Friday African wear policy in Ghana  This was aimed at promoting the wearing of local bespoke garments in workplaces on Fridays  Ansah used his friendship with then minister for trade and industry  Alan Kyeremanten  to push his idea to democratise and regularise the use of wax print  Ansah also influenced fashion production by employing international marketing strategies like fashion shows and exhibitions  He thus opened Ghanaian fashion to international audiences by using globally accepted techniques 



Human capital  More importantly  Ansah s vision to grow a lasting and successful industry propelled him to mentor many of Ghana s finest contemporary designers  He partnered with international agencies to launch mentorship programmes for young designers 




One such programme was the Web Young Designers Hub  financed by the French Embassy and coordinated by Ansah and Franca Sozzani  former editor of Vogue Italia  Another project spearheaded by Ansah was the Ethical Fashion Initiative  a partnership between the United Nations and the Presidential Special Initiative programme  These programmes and the exposure that came with them positioned contemporary designers to engage in  brain circulation  



By participating in projects  young designers had the opportunity to travel to other countries and learn about aspects of fashion such as fabric production and event organisation  Such travel was geared towards acquiring knowledge that would have an impact on Ghana s fashion industry 



These engagements helped young fashion designers build networks with designers across the globe 



Ansah s impact



The Ghanaian fashion industry is making its mark globally  Steve French and other young designers are recognised for their creative works and talents  Garments made by Ghanaian designers like Duaba Serwaa and Christie Brown are worn by stars such as Lupita Nyongo and Beyonce respectively  Young Ghanaians  too  proudly wear African clothes for all occasions  The current status of Ghana s fashion industry is largely due to the efforts of Kofi Ansah
