The Eye of Providence  as seen on the US   bill  has been perceived by some to be evidence of a conspiracy linking the Founding Fathers of the United States to the New World Order conspiracy theory                                                                    
A conspiracy theory is an explanation for an event or situation that asserts the existence of a conspiracy  generally by powerful sinister groups  often political in motivation                                    when other explanations are more probable                                   The term generally has a negative connotation  implying that the appeal of a conspiracy theory is based in prejudice  emotional conviction  or insufficient evidence             A conspiracy theory is distinct from a conspiracy  it refers to a hypothesized conspiracy with specific characteristics  including but not limited to opposition to the mainstream consensus among those who are qualified to evaluate its accuracy  such as scientists or historians                                    
Conspiracy theories tend to be internally consistent and correlate with each other              they are generally designed to resist falsification either by evidence against them or a lack of evidence for them              They are reinforced by circular reasoning  both evidence against the conspiracy and absence of evidence for it are misinterpreted as evidence of its truth                         Stephan Lewandowsky observes  This interpretation relies on the notion that  the stronger the evidence against a conspiracy  the more the conspirators must want people to believe their version of events               As a consequence  the conspiracy becomes a matter of faith rather than something that can be proven or disproven                         Studies have linked belief in conspiracy theories to distrust of authority and political cynicism                                      Some researchers suggest that conspiracist ideation belief in conspiracy theories may be psychologically harmful or pathological                          Such belief is correlated with psychological projection  paranoia  and Machiavellianism                         
Psychologists usually attribute belief in conspiracy theories to a number of psychopathological conditions such as paranoia  schizotypy  narcissism  and insecure attachment             or to a form of cognitive bias called  illusory pattern perception                           It has also been linked with the so called Dark triad personality types  whose common feature is lack of empathy              However  a      review article found that most cognitive scientists view conspiracy theorizing as typically nonpathological  given that unfounded belief in conspiracy is common across both historical and contemporary cultures  and may arise from innate human tendencies towards gossip  group cohesion  and religion             One historical review of conspiracy theories concluded that  Evidence suggests that the aversive feelings that people experience when in crisis fear  uncertainty  and the feeling of being out of control stimulate a motivation to make sense of the situation  increasing the likelihood of perceiving conspiracies in social situations              
Historically  conspiracy theories have been closely linked to prejudice  propaganda  witch hunts  wars  and genocides                                                              They are often strongly believed by the perpetrators of terrorist attacks  and were used as justification by Timothy McVeigh and Anders Breivik  as well as by governments such as Nazi Germany  the Soviet Union              and Turkey              AIDS denialism by the government of South Africa  motivated by conspiracy theories  caused an estimated         deaths from AIDS                                      QAnon and denialism about the      United States presidential election results led to the January   United States Capitol attack                                      and belief in conspiracy theories about genetically modified foods led the government of Zambia to reject food aid during a famine              at a time when three million people in the country were suffering from hunger              Conspiracy theories are a significant obstacle to improvements in public health                          encouraging opposition to such public health measures as vaccination and water fluoridation  They have been linked to outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases                                                  Other effects of conspiracy theories include reduced trust in scientific evidence                                      radicalization and ideological reinforcement of extremist groups                          and negative consequences for the economy             
Conspiracy theories once limited to fringe audiences have become commonplace in mass media  the Internet  and social media                         emerging as a cultural phenomenon of the late   th and early   st centuries                                                  They are widespread around the world and are often commonly believed  some even held by the majority of the population                                      Interventions to reduce the occurrence of conspiracy beliefs include maintaining an open society  encouraging people to use analytical thinking  and reducing feelings of uncertainty  anxiety  or powerlessness                                                 


Origin and usage
The Oxford English Dictionary defines conspiracy theory as  the theory that an event or phenomenon occurs as a result of a conspiracy between interested parties  spec  a belief that some covert but influential agency  typically political in motivation and oppressive in intent  is responsible for an unexplained event   It cites a      article in The American Historical Review as the earliest usage example                          although it also appeared in print for several decades before             
The earliest known usage was by the American author Charles Astor Bristed  in a letter to the editor published in The New York Times on    January                   He used it to refer to claims that British aristocrats were intentionally weakening the United States during the American Civil War in order to advance their financial interests 

England has had quite enough to do in Europe and Asia  without going out of her way to meddle with America  It was a physical and moral impossibility that she could be carrying on a gigantic conspiracy against us  But our masses  having only a rough general knowledge of foreign affairs  and not unnaturally somewhat exaggerating the space which we occupy in the world s eye  do not appreciate the complications which rendered such a conspiracy impossible  They only look at the sudden right about face movement of the English Press and public  which is most readily accounted for on the conspiracy theory             
The term is also used as a way to discredit dissenting analyses              Robert Blaskiewicz comments that examples of the term were used as early as the nineteenth century and states that its usage has always been derogatory              According to a study by Andrew McKenzie McHarg  in contrast  in the nineteenth century the term conspiracy theory simply  suggests a plausible postulate of a conspiracy  and  did not  at this stage  carry any connotations  either negative or positive   though sometimes a postulate so labeled was criticized              The author and activist George Monbiot argued that the terms  conspiracy theory  and  conspiracy theorist  are misleading  as conspiracies truly exist and theories are  rational explanations subject to disproof   Instead  he proposed the terms  conspiracy fiction  and  conspiracy fantasist              

Alleged CIA origins
The Warren Report
The term  conspiracy theory  is itself the subject of a conspiracy theory  which posits that the term was popularized by the CIA in order to discredit conspiratorial believers  particularly critics of the Warren Commission  by making them a target of ridicule              In his      book Conspiracy Theory in America  the political scientist Lance deHaven Smith wrote that the term entered everyday language in the United States after       the year in which the Warren Commission published its findings on the assassination of John F  Kennedy  with The New York Times running five stories that year using the term             
Whether the CIA was responsible for popularising the term  conspiracy theory  was analyzed by Michael Butter  a Professor of American Literary and Cultural History at the University of T bingen  Butter wrote in      that the CIA document Concerning Criticism of the Warren Report  which proponents of the theory use as evidence of CIA motive and intention  does not contain the phrase  conspiracy theory  in the singular  and only uses the term  conspiracy theories  once  in the sentence   Conspiracy theories have frequently thrown suspicion on our organisation           sic       for example  by falsely alleging that Lee Harvey Oswald worked for us              

Difference from conspiracy
A conspiracy theory is not simply a conspiracy  which refers to any covert plan involving two or more people              In contrast  the term  conspiracy theory  refers to hypothesized conspiracies that have specific characteristics  For example  conspiracist beliefs invariably oppose the mainstream consensus among those people who are qualified to evaluate their accuracy  such as scientists or historians              Conspiracy theorists see themselves as having privileged access to socially persecuted knowledge or a stigmatized mode of thought that separates them from the masses who believe the official account              Michael Barkun describes a conspiracy theory as a  template imposed upon the world to give the appearance of order to events              
Real conspiracies  even very simple ones  are difficult to conceal and routinely experience unexpected problems              In contrast  conspiracy theories suggest that conspiracies are unrealistically successful and that groups of conspirators  such as bureaucracies  can act with near perfect competence and secrecy  The causes of events or situations are simplified to exclude complex or interacting factors  as well as the role of chance and unintended consequences  Nearly all observations are explained as having been deliberately planned by the alleged conspirators             
In conspiracy theories  the conspirators are usually claimed to be acting with extreme malice              As described by Robert Brotherton 

The malevolent intent assumed by most conspiracy theories goes far beyond everyday plots borne out of self interest  corruption  cruelty  and criminality  The postulated conspirators are not merely people with selfish agendas or differing values  Rather  conspiracy theories postulate a black and white world in which good is struggling against evil  The general public is cast as the victim of organised persecution  and the motives of the alleged conspirators often verge on pure maniacal evil  At the very least  the conspirators are said to have an almost inhuman disregard for the basic liberty and well being of the general population  More grandiose conspiracy theories portray the conspirators as being Evil Incarnate  of having caused all the ills from which we suffer  committing abominable acts of unthinkable cruelty on a routine basis  and striving ultimately to subvert or destroy everything we hold dear             
Examples
Further information  List of conspiracy theories
A conspiracy theory may take any matter as its subject  but certain subjects attract greater interest than others  Favored subjects include famous deaths and assassinations  morally dubious government activities  suppressed technologies  and  false flag  terrorism  Among the longest standing and most widely recognized conspiracy theories are notions concerning the assassination of John F  Kennedy  the      Apollo Moon landings  and the      terrorist attacks  as well as numerous theories pertaining to alleged plots for world domination by various groups  both real and imaginary             

Popularity
Conspiracy beliefs are widespread around the world              In rural Africa  common targets of conspiracy theorizing include societal elites  enemy tribes  and the Western world  with conspirators often alleged to enact their plans via sorcery or witchcraft  one common belief identifies modern technology as itself being a form of sorcery  created with the goal of harming or controlling the people              In China  one widely published conspiracy theory claims that a number of events including the rise of Hitler  the      Asian financial crisis  and climate change were planned by the Rothschild family  which may have led to effects on discussions about China s currency policy                         
Conspiracy theories once limited to fringe audiences have become commonplace in mass media  contributing to conspiracism emerging as a cultural phenomenon in the United States of the late   th and early   st centuries                                                  The general predisposition to believe conspiracy theories cuts across partisan and ideological lines  Conspiratorial thinking is correlated with antigovernmental orientations and a low sense of political efficacy  with conspiracy believers perceiving a governmental threat to individual rights and displaying a deep skepticism that who one votes for really matters             
Conspiracy theories are often commonly believed  some even being held by the majority of the population                                      A broad cross section of Americans today gives credence to at least some conspiracy theories              For instance  a study conducted in      found that     of Americans think the chemtrail conspiracy theory is  completely true  and        think it is  somewhat true               This puts  the equivalent of     million Americans in the  chemtrails are real  camp               Belief in conspiracy theories has therefore become a topic of interest for sociologists  psychologists and experts in folklore 
Conspiracy theories are widely present on the Web in the form of blogs and YouTube videos  as well as on social media  Whether the Web has increased the prevalence of conspiracy theories or not is an open research question              The presence and representation of conspiracy theories in search engine results has been monitored and studied  showing significant variation across different topics  and a general absence of reputable  high quality links in the results             
One conspiracy theory that propagated through former US President Barack Obama s time in office             claimed that he was born in Kenya  instead of Hawaii where he was actually born              Former governor of Arkansas and political opponent of Obama Mike Huckabee made headlines in                  when he  among other members of Republican leadership  continued to question Obama s citizenship status

Types
A conspiracy theory can be local or international  focused on single events or covering multiple incidents and entire countries  regions and periods of history              According to Russell Muirhead and Nancy Rosenblum  historically  traditional conspiracism has entailed a  theory   but over time   conspiracy  and  theory  have become decoupled  as modern conspiracism is often without any kind of theory behind it                         

Walker s five kinds
Jesse Walker        has identified five kinds of conspiracy theories             

The  Enemy Outside  refers to theories based on figures alleged to be scheming against a community from without 
The  Enemy Within  finds the conspirators lurking inside the nation  indistinguishable from ordinary citizens 
The  Enemy Above  involves powerful people manipulating events for their own gain 
The  Enemy Below  features the lower classes working to overturn the social order 
The  Benevolent Conspiracies  are angelic forces that work behind the scenes to improve the world and help people 
Barkun s three types
Michael Barkun has identified three classifications of conspiracy theory             

Event conspiracy theories  This refers to limited and well defined events  Examples may include such conspiracies theories as those concerning the Kennedy assassination        and the spread of AIDS 
Systemic conspiracy theories  The conspiracy is believed to have broad goals  usually conceived as securing control of a country  a region  or even the entire world  The goals are sweeping  whilst the conspiratorial machinery is generally simple  a single  evil organization implements a plan to infiltrate and subvert existing institutions  This is a common scenario in conspiracy theories that focus on the alleged machinations of Jews  Freemasons  Communism  or the Catholic Church 
Superconspiracy theories  For Barkun  such theories link multiple alleged conspiracies together hierarchically  At the summit is a distant but all powerful evil force  His cited examples are the ideas of David Icke and Milton William Cooper 
Rothbard  shallow vs  deep
Murray Rothbard argues in favor of a model that contrasts  deep  conspiracy theories to  shallow  ones  According to Rothbard  a  shallow  theorist observes an event and asks Cui bono    Who benefits     jumping to the conclusion that a posited beneficiary is responsible for covertly influencing events  On the other hand  the  deep  conspiracy theorist begins with a hunch and then seeks out evidence  Rothbard describes this latter activity as a matter of confirming with certain facts one s initial paranoia             

Lack of evidence
Belief in conspiracy theories is generally based not on evidence but on the faith of the believer              Noam Chomsky contrasts conspiracy theory to institutional analysis  which focuses mainly on the public  long term behavior of publicly known institutions  as recorded in  for example  scholarly documents or mainstream media reports              Conspiracy theory conversely posits the existence of secretive coalitions of individuals and speculates on their alleged activities                          Belief in conspiracy theories is associated with biases in reasoning  such as the conjunction fallacy             
Clare Birchall at King s College London describes conspiracy theory as a  form of popular knowledge or interpretation       a      The use of the word  knowledge  here suggests ways in which conspiracy theory may be considered in relation to legitimate modes of knowing      b      The relationship between legitimate and illegitimate knowledge  Birchall claims  is closer than common dismissals of conspiracy theory contend             
Theories involving multiple conspirators that are proven to be correct  such as the Watergate scandal  are usually referred to as investigative journalism or historical analysis rather than conspiracy theory              Bjerg        writes   the way we normally use
the term conspiracy theory excludes instances where the theory has been
generally accepted as true  The Watergate scandal serves as the standard
reference               By contrast  the term  Watergate conspiracy theory  is used to refer to a variety of hypotheses in which those convicted in the conspiracy were in fact the victims of a deeper conspiracy              There are also attempts to analyze the theory of conspiracy theories  conspiracy theory theory  to ensure that the term  conspiracy theory  is used to refer to narratives that have been debunked by experts  rather than as a generalized dismissal             

Rhetoric
Conspiracy theory rhetoric exploits several important cognitive biases  including proportionality bias  attribution bias  and confirmation bias              Their arguments often take the form of asking reasonable questions  but without providing an answer based on strong evidence              Conspiracy theories are most successful when proponents can gather followers from the general public  such as in politics  religion and journalism  These proponents may not necessarily believe the conspiracy theory  instead  they may just use it in an attempt to gain public approval  Conspiratorial claims can act as a successful rhetorical strategy to convince a portion of the public via appeal to emotion             
Conspiracy theories typically justify themselves by focusing on gaps or ambiguities in knowledge  and then arguing that the true explanation for this must be a conspiracy              In contrast  any evidence that directly supports their claims is generally of low quality  For example  conspiracy theories are often dependent on eyewitness testimony  despite its unreliability  while disregarding objective analyses of the evidence             
Conspiracy theories are not able to be falsified and are reinforced by fallacious arguments  In particular  the logical fallacy circular reasoning is used by conspiracy theorists  both evidence against the conspiracy and an absence of evidence for it are re interpreted as evidence of its truth                         whereby the conspiracy becomes a matter of faith rather than something that can be proved or disproved                         The epistemic strategy of conspiracy theories has been called  cascade logic   each time new evidence becomes available  a conspiracy theory is able to dismiss it by claiming that even more people must be part of the cover up                          Any information that contradicts the conspiracy theory is suggested to be disinformation by the alleged conspiracy              Similarly  the continued lack of evidence directly supporting conspiracist claims is portrayed as confirming the existence of a conspiracy of silence  the fact that other people have not found or exposed any conspiracy is taken as evidence that those people are part of the plot  rather than considering that it may be because no conspiracy exists                          This strategy lets conspiracy theories insulate themselves from neutral analyses of the evidence  and makes them resistant to questioning or correction  which is called  epistemic self insulation                          

In           of peer reviewed climate science papers that took a position on the cause of global warming said that humans are responsible     said they were not  Among Fox News guests the same year  this was presented as a false balance between the two viewpoints  with     of invited guests believing it was happening and     not             
Conspiracy theorists often take advantage of false balance in the media  They may claim to be presenting a legitimate alternative viewpoint that deserves equal time to argue its case  for example  this strategy has been used by the Teach the Controversy campaign to promote intelligent design  which often claims that there is a conspiracy of scientists suppressing their views  If they successfully find a platform to present their views in a debate format  they focus on using rhetorical ad hominems and attacking perceived flaws in the mainstream account  while avoiding any discussion of the shortcomings in their own position             
The typical approach of conspiracy theories is to challenge any action or statement from authorities  using even the most tenuous justifications  Responses are then assessed using a double standard  where failing to provide an immediate response to the satisfaction of the conspiracy theorist will be claimed to prove a conspiracy  Any minor errors in the response are heavily emphasized  while deficiencies in the arguments of other proponents are generally excused             
In science  conspiracists may suggest that a scientific theory can be disproven by a single perceived deficiency  even though such events are extremely rare  In addition  both disregarding the claims and attempting to address them will be interpreted as proof of a conspiracy              Other conspiracist arguments may not be scientific  for example  in response to the IPCC Second Assessment Report in       much of the opposition centered on promoting a procedural objection to the report s creation  Specifically  it was claimed that part of the procedure reflected a conspiracy to silence dissenters  which served as motivation for opponents of the report and successfully redirected a significant amount of the public discussion away from the science             

Consequences

Historically  conspiracy theories have been closely linked to prejudice  witch hunts  wars  and genocides                          They are often strongly believed by the perpetrators of terrorist attacks  and were used as justification by Timothy McVeigh  Anders Breivik and Brenton Tarrant  as well as by governments such as Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union              AIDS denialism by the government of South Africa  motivated by conspiracy theories  caused an estimated         deaths from AIDS                                      while belief in conspiracy theories about genetically modified foods led the government of Zambia to reject food aid during a famine              at a time when   million people in the country were suffering from hunger             
Conspiracy theories are a significant obstacle to improvements in public health                          People who believe in health related conspiracy theories are less likely to follow medical advice  and more likely to use alternative medicine instead              Conspiratorial anti vaccination beliefs  such as conspiracy theories about pharmaceutical companies  can result in reduced vaccination rates and have been linked to outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases                                                  Health related conspiracy theories often inspire resistance to water fluoridation  and contributed to the impact of the Lancet MMR autism fraud                         
Conspiracy theories are a fundamental component of a wide range of radicalized and extremist groups  where they may play an important role in reinforcing the ideology and psychology of their members as well as further radicalizing their beliefs                          These conspiracy theories often share common themes  even among groups that would otherwise be fundamentally opposed  such as the antisemitic conspiracy theories found among political extremists on both the far right and far left              More generally  belief in conspiracy theories is associated with holding extreme and uncompromising viewpoints  and may help people in maintaining those viewpoints              While conspiracy theories are not always present in extremist groups  and do not always lead to violence when they are  they can make the group more extreme  provide an enemy to direct hatred towards  and isolate members from the rest of society  Conspiracy theories are most likely to inspire violence when they call for urgent action  appeal to prejudices  or demonize and scapegoat enemies             
Conspiracy theorizing in the workplace can also have economic consequences  For example  it leads to lower job satisfaction and lower commitment  resulting in workers being more likely to leave their jobs              Comparisons have also been made with the effects of workplace rumors  which share some characteristics with conspiracy theories and result in both decreased productivity and increased stress  Subsequent effects on managers include reduced profits  reduced trust from employees  and damage to the company s image                         
Conspiracy theories can divert attention from important social  political  and scientific issues                          In addition  they have been used to discredit scientific evidence to the general public or in a legal context  Conspiratorial strategies also share characteristics with those used by lawyers who are attempting to discredit expert testimony  such as claiming that the experts have ulterior motives in testifying  or attempting to find someone who will provide statements to imply that expert opinion is more divided than it actually is             
It is possible that conspiracy theories may also produce some compensatory benefits to society in certain situations  For example  they may help people identify governmental deceptions  particularly in repressive societies  and encourage government transparency                          However  real conspiracies are normally revealed by people working within the system  such as whistleblowers and journalists  and most of the effort spent by conspiracy theorists is inherently misdirected              The most dangerous conspiracy theories are likely to be those that incite violence  scapegoat disadvantaged groups  or spread misinformation about important societal issues             

Interventions

Target audience
Strategies to address conspiracy theories have been divided into two categories based on whether the target audience is the conspiracy theorists or the general public                          These strategies have been described as reducing either the supply or the demand for conspiracy theories              Both approaches can be used at the same time  although there may be issues of limited resources  or if arguments are used which may appeal to one audience at the expense of the other             
Brief scientific literacy interventions  particularly those focusing on critical thinking skills  can effectively undermine conspiracy beliefs and related behaviors  Research led by Penn State scholars  published in the Journal of Consumer Research  found that enhancing scientific knowledge and reasoning through short interventions  such as videos explaining concepts like correlation and causation  reduces the endorsement of conspiracy theories  These interventions were most effective against conspiracy theories based on faulty reasoning and were successful even among groups prone to conspiracy beliefs  The studies  involving over       participants  highlight the importance of educational interventions in mitigating conspiracy beliefs  especially when timed to influence critical decision making                         

General public
People who feel empowered are more resistant to conspiracy theories  Methods to promote empowerment include encouraging people to use analytical thinking  priming people to think of situations where they are in control  and ensuring that decisions by society and government are seen to follow procedural fairness  the use of fair decision making procedures              
Methods of refutation which have shown effectiveness in various circumstances include  providing facts that demonstrate the conspiracy theory is false  attempting to discredit the source  explaining how the logic is invalid or misleading  and providing links to fact checking websites              It can also be effective to use these strategies in advance  informing people that they could encounter misleading information in the future  and why the information should be rejected  also called inoculation or prebunking                                        While it has been suggested that discussing conspiracy theories can raise their profile and make them seem more legitimate to the public  the discussion can put people on guard instead as long as it is sufficiently persuasive            
Other approaches to reduce the appeal of conspiracy theories in general among the public may be based in the emotional and social nature of conspiratorial beliefs  For example  interventions that promote analytical thinking in the general public are likely to be effective  Another approach is to intervene in ways that decrease negative emotions  and specifically to improve feelings of personal hope and empowerment

It is much more difficult to convince people who already believe in conspiracy theories                          Conspiracist belief systems are not based on external evidence  but instead use circular logic where every belief is supported by other conspiracist beliefs              In addition  conspiracy theories have a  self sealing  nature  in which the types of arguments used to support them make them resistant to questioning from others             
Characteristics of successful strategies for reaching conspiracy theorists have been divided into several broad categories     Arguments can be presented by  trusted messengers   such as people who were formerly members of an extremist group     Since conspiracy theorists think of themselves as people who value critical thinking  this can be affirmed and then redirected to encourage being more critical when analyzing the conspiracy theory     Approaches demonstrate empathy  and are based on building understanding together  which is supported by modeling open mindedness in order to encourage the conspiracy theorists to do likewise     The conspiracy theories are not attacked with ridicule or aggressive deconstruction  and interactions are not treated like an argument to be won  this approach can work with the general public  but among conspiracy theorists it may simply be rejected             
Interventions that reduce feelings of uncertainty  anxiety  or powerlessness result in a reduction in conspiracy beliefs              Other possible strategies to mitigate the effect of conspiracy theories include education  media literacy  and increasing governmental openness and transparency              Due to the relationship between conspiracy theories and political extremism  the academic literature on deradicalization is also important             
One approach describes conspiracy theories as resulting from a  crippled epistemology   in which a person encounters or accepts very few relevant sources of information                           A conspiracy theory is more likely to appear justified to people with a limited  informational environment  who only encounter misleading information  These people may be  epistemologically isolated  in self enclosed networks  From the perspective of people within these networks  disconnected from the information available to the rest of society  believing in conspiracy theories may appear to be justified                           In these cases  the solution would be to break the group s informational isolation             

Reducing transmission
Public exposure to conspiracy theories can be reduced by interventions that reduce their ability to spread  such as by encouraging people to reflect before sharing a news story              Researchers Carlos Diaz Ruiz and Tomas Nilsson have proposed technical and rhetorical interventions to counter the spread of conspiracy theories on social media              


Interventions to counter the spread of conspiracy theories on social media             


Type of intervention

Intervention


Technical

Expose sources that insert and circulate conspiracy theories on social media  flagging  


Diminish the source s capacity to monetize conspiracies  demonetization  


Slow down the circulation of conspiracy theories  algorithm 


Rhetorical

Issue authoritative corrections  fact checking  


Authority based corrections and fact checking may backfire because personal worldviews cannot be proved wrong 


Enlist spokespeople that can be perceived as allies and insiders 


Rebuttals must spring from an epistemology that participants are already familiar with 


Give believers of conspiracies an  exit ramp  to dis invest themselves without facing ridicule 

Government policies
The primary defense against conspiracy theories is to maintain an open society  in which many sources of reliable information are available  and government sources are known to be credible rather than propaganda  Additionally  independent nongovernmental organizations are able to correct misinformation without requiring people to trust the government              The absence of civil rights and civil liberties reduces the number of information sources available to the population  which may lead people to support conspiracy theories              Since the credibility of conspiracy theories can be increased if governments act dishonestly or otherwise engage in objectionable actions  avoiding such actions is also a relevant strategy             
Joseph Pierre has said that mistrust in authoritative institutions is the core component underlying many conspiracy theories and that this mistrust creates an epistemic vacuum and makes individuals searching for answers vulnerable to misinformation  Therefore  one possible solution is offering consumers a seat at the table to mend their mistrust in institutions               Regarding the challenges of this approach  Pierre has said   The challenge with acknowledging areas of uncertainty within a public sphere is that doing so can be weaponized to reinforce a post truth view of the world in which everything is debatable  and any counter position is just as valid  Although I like to think of myself as a middle of the road kind of individual  it is important to keep in mind that the truth does not always lie in the middle of a debate  whether we are talking about climate change  vaccines  or antipsychotic medications               
Researchers have recommended that public policies should take into account the possibility of conspiracy theories relating to any policy or policy area  and prepare to combat them in advance                         Conspiracy theories have suddenly arisen in the context of policy issues as disparate as land use laws and bicycle sharing programs              In the case of public communications by government officials  factors that improve the effectiveness of communication include using clear and simple messages  and using messengers which are trusted by the target population  Government information about conspiracy theories is more likely to be believed if the messenger is perceived as being part of someone s in group  Official representatives may be more effective if they share characteristics with the target groups  such as ethnicity             
In addition  when the government communicates with citizens to combat conspiracy theories  online methods are more efficient compared to other methods such as print publications  This also promotes transparency  can improve a message s perceived trustworthiness  and is more effective at reaching underrepresented demographics  However  as of          update       many governmental websites do not take full advantage of the available information sharing opportunities  Similarly  social media accounts need to be used effectively in order to achieve meaningful communication with the public  such as by responding to requests that citizens send to those accounts  Other steps include adapting messages to the communication styles used on the social media platform in question  and promoting a culture of openness  Since mixed messaging can support conspiracy theories  it is also important to avoid conflicting accounts  such as by ensuring the accuracy of messages on the social media accounts of individual members of the organization             

Public health campaigns
Successful methods for dispelling conspiracy theories have been studied in the context of public health campaigns  A key characteristic of communication strategies to address medical conspiracy theories is the use of techniques that rely less on emotional appeals  It is more effective to use methods that encourage people to process information rationally  The use of visual aids is also an essential part of these strategies  Since conspiracy theories are based on intuitive thinking  and visual information processing relies on intuition  visual aids are able to compete directly for the public s attention            
In public health campaigns  information retention by the public is highest for loss framed messages that include more extreme outcomes  However  excessively appealing to catastrophic scenarios  e g  low vaccination rates causing an epidemic  may provoke anxiety  which is associated with conspiracism and could increase belief in conspiracy theories instead  Scare tactics have sometimes had mixed results  but are generally considered ineffective  An example of this is the use of images that showcase disturbing health outcomes  such as the impact of smoking on dental health  One possible explanation is that information processed via the fear response is typically not evaluated rationally  which may prevent the message from being linked to the desired behaviors            
A particularly important technique is the use of focus groups to understand exactly what people believe  and the reasons they give for those beliefs  This allows messaging to focus on the specific concerns that people identify  and on topics that are easily misinterpreted by the public  since these are factors which conspiracy theories can take advantage of  In addition  discussions with focus groups and observations of the group dynamics can indicate which anti conspiracist ideas are most likely to spread            
Interventions that address medical conspiracy theories by reducing powerlessness include emphasizing the principle of informed consent  giving patients all the relevant information without imposing decisions on them  to ensure that they have a sense of control  Improving access to healthcare also reduces medical conspiracism  However  doing so by political efforts can also fuel additional conspiracy theories  which occurred with the Affordable Care Act  Obamacare  in the United States  Another successful strategy is to require people to watch a short video when they fulfil requirements such as registration for school or a drivers  license  which has been demonstrated to improve vaccination rates and signups for organ donation            
Another approach is based on viewing conspiracy theories as narratives which express personal and cultural values  making them less susceptible to straightforward factual corrections  and more effectively addressed by counter narratives                            Counter narratives can be more engaging and memorable than simple corrections  and can be adapted to the specific values held by individuals and cultures  These narratives may depict personal experiences  or alternatively they can be cultural narratives  In the context of vaccination  examples of cultural narratives include stories about scientific breakthroughs  about the world before vaccinations  or about heroic and altruistic researchers  The themes to be addressed would be those that could be exploited by conspiracy theories to increase vaccine hesitancy  such as perceptions of vaccine risk  lack of patient empowerment  and lack of trust in medical authorities              

Backfire effects
It has been suggested that directly countering misinformation can be counterproductive  For example  since conspiracy theories can reinterpret disconfirming information as part of their narrative  refuting a claim can result in accidentally reinforcing it                           which is referred to as a  backfire effect                In addition  publishing criticism of conspiracy theories can result in legitimizing them              In this context  possible interventions include carefully selecting which conspiracy theories to refute  requesting additional analyses from independent observers  and introducing cognitive diversity into conspiratorial communities by undermining their poor epistemology              Any legitimization effect might also be reduced by responding to more conspiracy theories rather than fewer             
There are psychological mechanisms by which backfire effects could potentially occur  but the evidence on this topic is mixed  and backfire effects are very rare in practice                                         A      review of the scientific literature on backfire effects found that there have been widespread failures to replicate their existence  even under conditions that would be theoretically favorable to observing them               Due to the lack of reproducibility  as of          update      most researchers believe that backfire effects are either unlikely to occur on the broader population level  or they only occur in very specific circumstances  or they do not exist               Brendan Nyhan  one of the researchers who initially proposed the occurrence of backfire effects  wrote in      that the persistence of misinformation is most likely due to other factors              
In general  people do reject conspiracy theories when they learn about their contradictions and lack of evidence             For most people  corrections and fact checking are very unlikely to have a negative impact  and there is no specific group of people in which backfire effects have been consistently observed               Presenting people with factual corrections  or highlighting the logical contradictions in conspiracy theories  has been demonstrated to have a positive effect in many circumstances                           For example  this has been studied in the case of informing believers in      conspiracy theories about statements by actual experts and witnesses              One possibility is that criticism is most likely to backfire if it challenges someone s worldview or identity  This suggests that an effective approach may be to provide criticism while avoiding such challenges              

Psychology
The widespread belief in conspiracy theories has become a topic of interest for sociologists  psychologists  and experts in folklore since at least the     s  when a number of conspiracy theories arose regarding the assassination of U S  President John F  Kennedy  Sociologist T rkay Salim Nefes underlines the political nature of conspiracy theories  He suggests that one of the most important characteristics of these accounts is their attempt to unveil the  real but hidden  power relations in social groups                            The term  conspiracism  was popularized by academic Frank P  Mintz in the     s  According to Mintz  conspiracism denotes  belief in the primacy of conspiracies in the unfolding of history                                   

Conspiracism serves the needs of diverse political and social groups in America and elsewhere  It identifies elites  blames them for economic and social catastrophes  and assumes that things will be better once popular action can remove them from positions of power  As such  conspiracy theories do not typify a particular epoch or ideology                                    
Research suggests  on a psychological level  conspiracist ideation belief in conspiracy theories can be harmful or pathological                          and is highly correlated with psychological projection  as well as with paranoia  which is predicted by the degree of a person s Machiavellianism               The propensity to believe in conspiracy theories is strongly associated with the mental health disorder of schizotypy                                                                   Conspiracy theories once limited to fringe audiences have become commonplace in mass media  emerging as a cultural phenomenon of the late   th and early   st centuries                                                  Exposure to conspiracy theories in news media and popular entertainment increases receptiveness to conspiratorial ideas  and has also increased the social acceptability of fringe beliefs                          
Conspiracy theories often use complicated and detailed arguments  including ones that appear analytical or scientific  However  belief in conspiracy theories is primarily driven by emotion              One of the most widely confirmed facts about conspiracy theories is that belief in a single conspiracy theory is often associated with belief in other conspiracy theories                           This even applies when the conspiracy theories directly contradict each other e g   believing that Osama bin Laden was already dead before his compound in Pakistan was attacked makes the same person more likely to believe that he is still alive  One conclusion from this finding is that the content of a conspiracist belief is less important than the idea of a coverup by the authorities                                       Analytical thinking aids in reducing belief in conspiracy theories  in part because it emphasizes rational and critical cognition             
Some psychological scientists assert that explanations related to conspiracy theories can be  and often are   internally consistent  with strong beliefs previously held prior to the event that sparked the belief in a conspiracy              People who believe in conspiracy theories tend to believe in other unsubstantiated claims  including pseudoscience and paranormal phenomena              

Attractions
Psychological motives for believing in conspiracy theories can be categorized as epistemic  existential  or social  These motives are particularly acute in vulnerable and disadvantaged populations  However  it does not appear that the beliefs help to address these motives  in fact  they may be self defeating  acting to make the situation worse instead                           For example  while conspiratorial beliefs can result from a perceived sense of powerlessness  exposure to conspiracy theories immediately suppresses personal feelings of autonomy and control  Furthermore  they also make people less likely to take actions that could improve their circumstances                          
This is additionally supported by the fact that conspiracy theories have a number of disadvantageous attributes              For example  they promote a hostile and distrustful view of other people and groups allegedly acting based on antisocial and cynical motivations  This is expected to lead to increased social alienation and anomie and reduced social capital  Similarly  they depict the public as ignorant and powerless against the alleged conspirators  with important aspects of society determined by malevolent forces  a viewpoint that is likely to be disempowering             
Each person may endorse conspiracy theories for one of many different reasons               The most consistently demonstrated characteristics of people who find conspiracy theories appealing are a feeling of alienation  unhappiness or dissatisfaction with their situation  an unconventional worldview  and a sense of disempowerment               While various aspects of personality affect susceptibility to conspiracy theories  none of the Big Five personality traits are associated with conspiracy beliefs              
The political scientist Michael Barkun  discussing the usage of  conspiracy theory  in contemporary American culture  holds that this term is used for a belief that explains an event as the result of a secret plot by exceptionally powerful and cunning conspirators to achieve a malevolent end                            According to Barkun  the appeal of conspiracism is threefold 


First  conspiracy theories claim to explain what institutional analysis cannot  They appear to make sense out of a world that is otherwise confusing 
Second  they do so in an appealingly simple way  by dividing the world sharply between the forces of light  and the forces of darkness  They trace all evil back to a single source  the conspirators and their agents 
Third  conspiracy theories are often presented as special  secret knowledge unknown or unappreciated by others  For conspiracy theorists  the masses are a brainwashed herd  while the conspiracy theorists in the know can congratulate themselves on penetrating the plotters  deceptions              
This third point is supported by the research of Roland Imhoff  professor of social psychology at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz  His research suggests that the smaller the minority believing in a specific theory  the more attractive it is to conspiracy theorists               Humanistic psychologists argue that even if a posited cabal behind an alleged conspiracy is almost always perceived as hostile  there often remains an element of reassurance for theorists  This is because it is a consolation to imagine that humans create difficulties in human affairs and remain within human control  If a cabal can be implicated  there may be a hope of breaking its power or of joining it  Belief in the power of a cabal is an implicit assertion of human dignity an unconscious affirmation that man is responsible for his own destiny              
People formulate conspiracy theories to explain  for example  power relations in social groups and the perceived existence of evil forces      c                                             Proposed psychological origins of conspiracy theorising include projection  the personal need to explain  a significant event  with  a significant cause   and the product of various kinds and stages of thought disorder  such as paranoid disposition  ranging in severity to diagnosable mental illnesses  Some people prefer socio political explanations over the insecurity of encountering random  unpredictable  or otherwise inexplicable events                                                                                According to Berlet and Lyons   Conspiracism is a particular narrative form of scapegoating that frames demonized enemies as part of a vast insidious plot against the common good  while it valorizes the scapegoater as a hero for sounding the alarm               

Causes

Some psychologists believe that a search for meaning is common in conspiracism  Once cognized  confirmation bias and avoidance of cognitive dissonance may reinforce the belief  When a conspiracy theory has become embedded within a social group  communal reinforcement may also play a part              
Inquiry into possible motives behind the accepting of irrational conspiracy theories has linked              these beliefs to distress resulting from an event that occurred  such as the events of       Additional research suggests that  delusional ideation  is the trait most likely to indicate a stronger belief in conspiracy theories               Research also shows an increased attachment to these irrational beliefs leads to a decreased desire for civic engagement              Belief in conspiracy theories is correlated with low intelligence  lower analytical thinking  anxiety disorders  paranoia  and authoritarian beliefs                                        
Professor Quassim Cassam argues that conspiracy theorists hold their beliefs due to flaws in their thinking and  more precisely  their intellectual character  He cites philosopher Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski and her book Virtues of the Mind in outlining intellectual virtues  such as humility  caution  and carefulness  and intellectual vices  such as gullibility  carelessness  and closed mindedness   Whereas intellectual virtues help reach sound examination  intellectual vices  impede effective and responsible inquiry   meaning that those prone to believing in conspiracy theories possess certain vices while lacking necessary virtues              
Some researchers have suggested that conspiracy theories could be partially caused by the human brain s mechanisms for detecting dangerous coalitions  Such a mechanism could have been helpful in the small scale environment humanity evolved in but is mismatched in a modern  complex society and thus  misfire   perceiving conspiracies where none exist              

Projection
Some historians have argued that psychological projection is prevalent amongst conspiracy theorists  According to the argument  this projection is manifested in the form of attributing undesirable characteristics of the self to the conspirators  Historian Richard Hofstadter stated that 

This enemy seems on many counts a projection of the self  both the ideal and the unacceptable aspects of the self are attributed to him  A fundamental paradox of the paranoid style is the imitation of the enemy  The enemy  for example  may be the cosmopolitan intellectual  but the paranoid will outdo him in the apparatus of scholarship  even of pedantry                The Ku Klux Klan imitated Catholicism to the point of donning priestly vestments  developing an elaborate ritual and an equally elaborate hierarchy  The John Birch Society emulates Communist cells and quasi secret operation through  front  groups  and preaches a ruthless prosecution of the ideological war along lines very similar to those it finds in the Communist enemy  Spokesmen of the various fundamentalist anti Communist  crusades  openly express their admiration for the dedication  discipline  and strategic ingenuity the Communist cause calls forth              
Hofstadter also noted that  sexual freedom  is a vice frequently attributed to the conspiracist s target group  noting that  very often the fantasies of true believers reveal strong sadomasochistic outlets  vividly expressed  for example  in the delight of anti Masons with the cruelty of Masonic punishments               

Physiology
Marcel Danesi suggests that people who believe conspiracy theories have difficulty rethinking situations  Exposure to those theories has caused neural pathways to be more rigid and less subject to change  Initial susceptibility to believing these theories  lies  dehumanizing language  and metaphors leads to the acceptance of larger and more extensive theories because the hardened neural pathways are already present  Repetition of the  facts  of conspiracy theories and their connected lies simply reinforces the rigidity of those pathways  Thus  conspiracy theories and dehumanizing lies are not mere hyperbole  they can actually change the way people think 

Unfortunately  research into this brain wiring also shows that once people begin to believe lies  they are unlikely to change their minds even when confronted with evidence that contradicts their beliefs  It is a form of brainwashing  Once the brain has carved out a well worn path of believing deceit  it is even harder to step out of that path   which is how fanatics are born  Instead  these people will seek out information that confirms their beliefs  avoid anything that is in conflict with them  or even turn the contrasting information on its head  so as to make it fit their beliefs People with strong convictions will have a hard time changing their minds  given how embedded a lie becomes in the mind  In fact  there are scientists and scholars still studying the best tools and tricks to combat lies with some combination of brain training and linguistic awareness              
Sociology
In addition to psychological factors such as conspiracist ideation  sociological factors also help account for who believes in which conspiracy theories  Such theories tend to get more traction among election losers in society  for example  and the emphasis on conspiracy theories by elites and leaders tends to increase belief among followers with higher levels of conspiracy thinking               Christopher Hitchens described conspiracy theories as the  exhaust fumes of democracy                the unavoidable result of a large amount of information circulating among a large number of people 
Conspiracy theories may be emotionally satisfying  as they assign blame to a group to which the theorist does not belong and  thus  absolve the theorist of moral or political responsibility in society               Likewise  Roger Cohen writing for The New York Times has said that   captive minds      resort to conspiracy theory because it is the ultimate refuge of the powerless  If you cannot change your own life  it must be that some greater force controls the world               
Sociological historian Holger Herwig found in studying German explanations for the origins of World War I   Those events that are most important are hardest to understand because they attract the greatest attention from myth makers and charlatans                Justin Fox of Time magazine argues that Wall Street traders are among the most conspiracy minded group of people  and ascribes this to the reality of some financial market conspiracies  and to the ability of conspiracy theories to provide necessary orientation in the market s day to day movements              

Influence of critical theory
Bruno Latour notes that the language and intellectual tactics of critical theory have been appropriated by those he describes as conspiracy theorists  including climate change denialists and the      Truth movement   Maybe I am taking conspiracy theories too seriously  but I am worried to detect  in those mad mixtures of knee jerk disbelief  punctilious demands for proofs  and free use of powerful explanation from the social neverland  many of the weapons of social critique               

Fusion paranoia
Michael Kelly  a Washington Post journalist and critic of anti war movements on both the left and right  coined the term  fusion paranoia  to refer to a political convergence of left wing and right wing activists around anti war issues and civil liberties  which he said were motivated by a shared belief in conspiracism or shared anti government views              
Barkun has adopted this term to refer to how the synthesis of paranoid conspiracy theories  which were once limited to American fringe audiences  has given them mass appeal and enabled them to become commonplace in mass media               thereby inaugurating an unrivaled period of people actively preparing for apocalyptic or millenarian scenarios in the United States of the late   th and early   st centuries               Barkun notes the occurrence of lone wolf conflicts with law enforcement acting as a proxy for threatening the established political powers              

Viability
As evidence that undermines an alleged conspiracy grows  the number of alleged conspirators also grows in the minds of conspiracy theorists  This is because of an assumption that the alleged conspirators often have competing interests  For example  if Republican President George W  Bush is allegedly responsible for the      terrorist attacks  and the Democratic party did not pursue exposing this alleged plot  that must mean that both the Democratic and Republican parties are conspirators in the alleged plot  It also assumes that the alleged conspirators are so competent that they can fool the entire world  but so incompetent that even the unskilled conspiracy theorists can find mistakes they make that prove the fraud  At some point  the number of alleged conspirators  combined with the contradictions within the alleged conspirators  interests and competence  becomes so great that maintaining the theory becomes an obvious exercise in absurdity              
The physicist David Robert Grimes estimated the time it would take for a conspiracy to be exposed based on the number of people involved                            His calculations used data from the PRISM surveillance program  the Tuskegee syphilis experiment  and the FBI forensic scandal  Grimes estimated that 

A Moon landing hoax would require the involvement of         people and would be exposed within      years 
Climate change fraud would require a minimum of        people  published climate scientists only  and would be exposed within       years  or up to         people  in which case it would be exposed within      years 
A vaccination conspiracy would require a minimum of        people  without drug companies  and would be exposed within at least      years and at most       years depending on the number involved 
A conspiracy to suppress a cure for cancer would require         people and would be exposed within      years 
Grimes s study did not consider exposure by sources outside of the alleged conspiracy  It only considered exposure from within the alleged conspiracy through whistleblowers or through incompetence               Subsequent comments on the PubPeer website              point out that these calculations must exclude successful conspiracies since  by definition  we don t know about them  and are wrong by an order of magnitude about Bletchley Park  which remained a secret far longer than Grimes  calculations predicted 

Terminology
The term  truth seeker  is adopted by some conspiracy theorists when describing themselves on social media               Conspiracy theorists are often referred to derogatorily as  cookers  in Australia               The term  cooker  is also loosely associated with the far right                           

Politics
A      poll found that majorities in only   of    countries believed that al Qaeda carried out the      attacks              
The philosopher Karl Popper described the central problem of conspiracy theories as a form of fundamental attribution error  where every event is generally perceived as being intentional and planned  greatly underestimating the effects of randomness and unintended consequences              In his book The Open Society and Its Enemies  he used the term  the conspiracy theory of society  to denote the idea that social phenomena such as  war  unemployment  poverty  shortages           are  the result of direct design by some powerful individuals and groups                Popper argued that totalitarianism was founded on conspiracy theories which drew on imaginary plots which were driven by paranoid scenarios predicated on tribalism  chauvinism  or racism  He also noted that conspirators very rarely achieved their goal              
Historically  real conspiracies have usually had little effect on history and have had unforeseen consequences for the conspirators  in contrast to conspiracy theories  which often posit grand  sinister organizations or world changing events  the evidence for which has been erased or obscured                            As described by Bruce Cumings  history is instead  moved by the broad forces and large structures of human collectivities

Conspiracy theories are a prevalent feature of Arab culture and politics               Variants include conspiracies involving colonialism  Zionism  superpowers  oil  and the war on terrorism  which is often referred to in Arab media as a  war against Islam                For example  The Protocols of the Elders of Zion  an infamous hoax document purporting to be a Jewish plan for world domination  is commonly read and promoted in the Muslim world                                         Roger Cohen has suggested that the popularity of conspiracy theories in the Arab world is  the ultimate refuge of the powerless                Al Mumin Said has noted the danger of such theories  for they  keep us not only from the truth but also from confronting our faults and problems                Osama bin Laden and Ayman al Zawahiri used conspiracy theories about the United States to gain support for al Qaeda in the Arab world  and as rhetoric to distinguish themselves from similar groups  although they may not have believed the conspiratorial claims themselves              

Turkey
Main article  Conspiracy theories in Turkey
Conspiracy theories are a prevalent feature of culture and politics in Turkey  Conspiracism is an important phenomenon in understanding Turkish politics               This is explained by a desire to  make up for our lost Ottoman grandeur                the humiliation of perceiving Turkey as part of  the malfunctioning half  of the world               and a  low level of media literacy among the Turkish population               
There are a wide variety of conspiracy theories including the Judeo Masonic conspiracy theory                            the international Jewish conspiracy theory  and the war against Islam conspiracy theory  For example  Islamists  dissatisfied with the modernist and secularist reforms that took place throughout the history of the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic  have put forward many conspiracy theories to defame the Treaty of Lausanne  an important peace treaty for the country  and the republic s founder Kemal Atat rk                            Another example is the S vres syndrome  a reference to the Treaty of S vres of       a popular belief in Turkey that dangerous internal and external enemies  especially the West  are  conspiring to weaken and carve up the Turkish Republic

The historian Richard Hofstadter addressed the role of paranoia and conspiracism throughout U S  history in his      essay  The Paranoid Style in American Politics   Bernard Bailyn s classic The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution        notes that a similar phenomenon could be found in North America during the time preceding the American Revolution  Conspiracism labels people s attitudes and the type of conspiracy theories that are more global and historical in proportion              
Harry G  West and others have noted that while conspiracy theorists may often be dismissed as a fringe minority  certain evidence suggests that a wide range of the U S  believes in conspiracy theories  West also compares those theories to hypernationalism and religious fundamentalism                            Theologian Robert Jewett and philosopher John Shelton Lawrence attribute the enduring popularity of conspiracy theories in the U S  to the Cold War  McCarthyism  and counterculture rejection of authority  They state that among both the left wing and right wing  there remains a willingness to use real events  such as Soviet plots  inconsistencies in the Warren Report  and the      attacks  to support the existence of unverified and ongoing large scale conspiracies              
In his studies of  American political demonology   historian Michael Paul Rogin too analyzed this paranoid style of politics that has occurred throughout American history  Conspiracy theories frequently identify an imaginary subversive group that is supposedly attacking the nation and requires the government and allied forces to engage in harsh extra legal repression of those threatening subversives  Rogin cites examples from the Red Scares of      to McCarthy s anti communist campaign in the     s and  more recently  fears of immigrant hordes invading the US  Unlike Hofstadter  Rogin saw these  countersubversive  fears as frequently coming from those in power and dominant groups instead of from the dispossessed  Unlike Robert Jewett  Rogin blamed not the counterculture but America s dominant culture of liberal individualism and the fears it stimulated to explain the periodic eruption of irrational conspiracy theories               The Watergate scandal has also been used to bestow legitimacy to other conspiracy theories  with Richard Nixon himself commenting that it served as a  Rorschach ink blot  which invited others to fill in the underlying pattern             
Historian Kathryn S  Olmsted cites three reasons why Americans are prone to believing in government conspiracy theories 

Genuine government overreach and secrecy during the Cold War  such as Watergate  the Tuskegee syphilis experiment  Project MKUltra  and the CIA s assassination attempts on Fidel Castro in collaboration with mobsters 
Precedent set by official government sanctioned conspiracy theories for propaganda  such as claims of German infiltration of the U S  during World War II or the debunked claim that Saddam Hussein played a role in the      attacks 
Distrust fostered by the government s spying on and harassment of dissenters  such as the Sedition Act of       COINTELPRO  and as part of various Red Scares              
Alex Jones referenced numerous conspiracy theories for convincing his supporters to endorse Ron Paul over Mitt Romney in the      Republican Party presidential primaries and Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton in the      United States presidential election                            Into the     s  the QAnon conspiracy theory alleges that Trump is fighting against a deep state cabal of child sex abusing and Satan worshipping Democrats

  Birchall         W e can appreciate conspiracy theory as a unique form of popular knowledge or interpretation  and address what this might mean for any knowledge we produce about it or how we interpret it                                   

  Birchall        What we quickly discover          is that it becomes impossible to map conspiracy theory and academic discourse onto a clear illegitimate legitimate divide                                   

  Barkun        The essence of conspiracy beliefs lies in attempts to delineate and explain evil  At their broadest  conspiracy theories  view history as controlled by massive  demonic forces            For our purposes  a conspiracy belief is the belief that an organization made up of individuals or groups was or is acting covertly to achieve a malevolent end
