Facebook filed for an initial public offering  IPO  on January                      The preliminary prospectus stated that the company sought to raise    billion  had     million monthly active users  and a website accruing     billion likes and comments daily              After the IPO  Zuckerberg would retain     of the total shares and     of the total voting power in Facebook             
Underwriters valued the shares at     each  valuing the company at      billion  the largest valuation yet for a newly public company              On May     one day before the IPO  Facebook announced it would sell     more shares than originally planned due to high demand              The IPO raised     billion  making it the third largest in US history  slightly ahead of AT amp T Mobility and behind only General Motors and Visa   The stock price left the company with a higher market capitalization than all but a few U S  corporations surpassing heavyweights such as Amazon  McDonald s  Disney  and Kraft Foods and made Zuckerberg s stock worth     billion                          The New York Times stated that the offering overcame questions about Facebook s difficulties in attracting advertisers to transform the company into a  must own stock   Jimmy Lee of JPMorgan Chase described it as  the next great blue chip               Writers at TechCrunch  on the other hand  expressed skepticism  stating   That s a big multiple to live up to  and Facebook will likely need to add bold new revenue streams to justify the mammoth valuation              
Trading in the stock  which began on May     was delayed that day due to technical problems with the Nasdaq exchange              The stock struggled to stay above the IPO price for most of the day  forcing underwriters to buy back shares to support the price              At the closing bell  shares were valued at                     only       above the IPO price and down       from the opening bell value  The opening was widely described by the financial press as a disappointment              The stock nonetheless set a new record for trading volume of an IPO              On May           the stock ended its first full week of trading at         a       decline             
On May           regulators from Wall Street s Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced that they had begun to investigate whether banks underwriting Facebook had improperly shared information only with select clients rather than the general public  Massachusetts Secretary of State William F  Galvin subpoenaed Morgan Stanley over the same issue              The allegations sparked  fury  among some investors and led to the immediate filing of several lawsuits  one of them a class action suit claiming more than      billion in losses due to the IPO              Bloomberg estimated that retail investors may have lost approximately      million on Facebook stock since its debut              S amp P Global Ratings added Facebook to its S amp P     index on December                      
On May          Zuckerberg announced that the company would be changing its internal motto from  Move fast and break things  to  Move fast with stable infrastructure                           The earlier motto had been described as Zuckerberg s  prime directive to his developers and team  in a      interview in Business Insider  in which he also said   Unless you are breaking stuff  you are not moving fast enough              

           Focus on the metaverse
Lasso was a short video sharing app from Facebook similar to TikTok that was launched on iOS and Android in      and was aimed at teenagers  On July          Facebook announced that Lasso would be shutting down on July                                        
In       the Oculus lead Jason Rubin sent his    page vision document titled  The Metaverse  to Facebook s leadership  In the document  Rubin acknowledged that Facebook s virtual reality business had not caught on as expected  despite the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on content for early adopters  He also urged the company to execute fast and invest heavily in the vision  to shut out HTC  Apple  Google and other competitors in the VR space  Regarding other players  participation in the metaverse vision  he called for the company to build the  metaverse  to prevent their competitors from  being in the VR business in a meaningful way at all              
In May       Facebook founded Libra Networks  reportedly to develop their own stablecoin cryptocurrency              Later  it was reported that Libra was being supported by financial companies such as Visa  Mastercard  PayPal and Uber  The consortium of companies was expected to pool in     million each to fund the launch of the cryptocurrency coin named Libra              Depending on when it would receive approval from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory authority to operate as a payments service  the Libra Association had planned to launch a limited format cryptocurrency in                   Libra was renamed Diem  before being shut down and sold in January      after backlash from Swiss government regulators and the public                         
During the COVID    pandemic  the use of online services  including Facebook  grew globally              Zuckerberg predicted this would be a  permanent acceleration  that would continue after the pandemic  Facebook hired aggressively  growing from        employees in March      to more than        by September

Following a period of intense scrutiny and damaging whistleblower leaks  news started to emerge on October          about Facebook s plan to rebrand the company and change its name                          In the Q       Earnings Call on October     Mark Zuckerberg discussed the ongoing criticism of the company s social services and the way it operates  and pointed to the pivoting efforts to building the metaverse   without mentioning the rebranding and the name change              The metaverse vision and the name change from Facebook  Inc  to Meta Platforms was introduced at Facebook Connect on October                       Based on Facebook s PR campaign  the name change reflects the company s shifting long term focus of building the metaverse  a digital extension of the physical world by social media  virtual reality and augmented reality features                         
 Meta  had been registered as a trademark in the United States in       after an initial filing in       for marketing  advertising  and computer services  by a Canadian company that provided big data analysis of scientific literature              This company was acquired in      by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative  CZI   a foundation established by Zuckerberg and his wife  Priscilla Chan  and became one of their projects              Following the rebranding announcement  CZI announced that it had already decided to deprioritize the earlier Meta project  thus it would be transferring its rights to the name to Meta Platforms  and the previous project would end in                  

      Declining profits and mass lay offs
Soon after the rebranding  in early February       Meta reported a greater than expected decline in profits in the fourth quarter of                   It reported no growth in monthly users              and indicated it expected revenue growth to stall              It also expected measures taken by Apple Inc  to protect user privacy to cost it some     billion in advertisement revenue  an amount equal to roughly    of its revenue for                   In meeting with Meta staff the day after earnings were reported  Zuckerberg blamed competition for user attention  particularly from video based apps such as TikTok             
The     reduction in the company s share price which occurred in reaction to the news eliminated some      billion of value from Meta s market capitalization              Bloomberg described the decline as  an epic rout that  in its sheer scale  is unlike anything Wall Street or Silicon Valley has ever seen               Zuckerberg s net worth fell by as much as     billion              Zuckerberg owns     of Meta  and the holding makes up the bulk of his wealth                         
According to published reports by Bloomberg on March           Meta turned over data such as phone numbers  physical addresses  and IP addresses to hackers posing as law enforcement officials using forged documents  The law enforcement requests sometimes included forged signatures of real or fictional officials  When asked about the allegations  a Meta representative said   We review every data request for legal sufficiency and use advanced systems and processes to validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse               In June       Sheryl Sandberg  the chief operating officer of    years  announced she would step down that year  Zuckerberg said that Javier Olivan would replace Sandberg  though in a  more traditional  role

Also in March       Meta and Italian eyewear giant Luxottica released Ray Ban Stories  a series of smartglasses which could play music and take pictures  Meta and Luxottica parent company EssilorLuxottica declined to disclose sales on the line of products as of September       though Meta has expressed satisfaction with its customer feedback                                     
In July       Meta saw its first year on year revenue decline when its total revenue slipped by    to      bn              Analysts and journalists accredited the loss to its advertising business  which has been limited by Apple s app tracking transparency feature and the number of people who have opted not to be tracked by Meta apps  Zuckerberg also accredited the decline to increasing competition from TikTok                                      On October           Meta s market value dropped to      billion  a loss of around      billion compared to       and its shares fell by      It lost its spot among the top    US companies by market cap  despite reaching the top   in the previous year             
In November       Meta laid off        employees      of its workforce  Zuckerberg said the decision to aggressively increase Meta s investments had been a mistake  as he had wrongly predicted that the surge in e commerce would last beyond the COVID    pandemic  He also attributed the decline to increased competition  a global economic downturn and  ads signal loss               Plans to lay off a further        employees began in April                   The layoffs were part of a general downturn in the technology industry  alongside layoffs by companies including Google  Amazon  Tesla  Snap  Twitter and Lyft                         
Starting from       Meta scrambled to catch up to other tech companies in adopting specialized artificial intelligence hardware and software  It had been using less expensive CPUs instead of GPUs for AI work  but that approach turned out to be less efficient             

Since       Threads  AI and all time high stock value
In       Ireland s Data Protection Commissioner imposed a record EUR     billion fine on Meta for transferring data from Europe to the United States without adequate protections for EU citizens                                   
In March       Meta announced a new round of layoffs that would cut        employees and close       open positions to make the company more efficient              Meta revenue surpassed analyst expectations for the first quarter of      after announcing that it was increasing its focus on AI              On July    Meta launched a new app  Threads  a competitor to Twitter

In November      Meta Platforms launched an ad free service in Europe  allowing subscribers to opt out of personal data being collected for targeted advertising  A group of    European organizations  including Max Schrems  advocacy group NOYB  the Irish Council for Civil Liberties  Wikimedia Europe  and the Electronic Privacy Information Center  signed a      letter to the European Data Protection Board  EDPB  expressing concern that this subscriber model would undermine privacy protections  specifically GDPR data protection standards

On    September       Meta announced it had banned Russian state media outlets from its platforms worldwide due to concerns about  foreign interference activity   This decision followed allegations that RT and its employees funneled     million through shell companies to secretly fund influence campaigns on various social media channels  Meta s actions were part of a broader effort to counter Russian covert influence operations  which had intensified since the invasion             
At its      Connect conference  Meta presented Orion              its first pair of augmented reality glasses  Though Orion was originally intended to be sold to consumers  the manufacturing process turned out to be too complex and expensive              Instead  the company pivoted to producing a small number of the glasses to be used internally             
On   October       Meta announced about its new AI model called Movie Gen  capable of generating realistic video and audio clips based on user prompts  Meta stated it would not release Movie Gen for open development  preferring to collaborate directly with content creators and integrate it into its products by the following year  The model was built using a combination of licensed and publicly available datasets              
On October           ProPublica published an investigation into deceptive political advertisement scams that sometimes use hundreds of hijacked profiles and facebook pages run by organized networks of scammers  The authors cited spotty enforcement by Meta as a major reason for the extent of the issue

In August       Mark Zuckerberg sent a letter to Jim Jordan indicating that during the COVID    pandemic the Biden administration repeatedly asked Meta to limit certain COVID    content  including humor and satire  on Facebook and Instagram              
In      Meta hired Jordana Cutler  formerly an employee at the Israeli Embassy to the United States  as its policy chief for Israel and the Jewish Diaspora  In this role  Cutler pushed for the censorship of accounts belonging to Students for Justice in Palestine chapters in the United States  Critics have said that Cutler s position gives the Israeli government an undue influence over Meta policy  and that few countries have such high levels of contact with Meta policymakers              
Following the election of Donald Trump in       various sources noted possible censorship related to the Democratic Party on Instagram and other Meta platforms                                         In February       a Meta rep flagged journalist Gil Duran s article and other  critiques of tech industry figures  as spam or sensitive content  limiting their reach

Disinformation concerns
Since its inception  Meta has been accused of being a host for fake news and misinformation               In the wake of the      United States presidential election  Zuckerberg began to take steps to eliminate the prevalence of fake news  as the platform had been criticized for its potential influence on the outcome of the election               The company initially partnered with ABC News  the Associated Press  FactCheck org  Snopes and PolitiFact for its fact checking initiative               as of       it had over    fact checking partners across the world  including The Weekly Standard              
A May      review by The Guardian found that the platform s fact checking initiatives of partnering with third party fact checkers and publicly flagging fake news were regularly ineffective  and appeared to be having minimal impact in some cases               In       journalists working as fact checkers for the company criticized the partnership  stating that it had produced minimal results and that the company had ignored their concerns              
In      Meta s decision to continue to disseminate a falsified video of US president Joe Biden  even after it had been proven to be fake  attracted criticism and concern                           

Misinformation and hate speech
In January       Meta ended its use of third party fact checkers in favor of a user run community notes system similar to the one used on X                           
While Zuckerberg supported these changes  saying that the amount of censorship on the platform was excessive  the decision received criticism by fact checking institutions  stating that the changes would make it more difficult for users to identify misinformation               Meta also faced criticism for weakening its policies on hate speech that were designed to protect minorities and LGBTQ  individuals from bullying and discrimination                                         While moving its content review teams from California to Texas  Meta changed their hateful conduct policy to eliminate restrictions on anti LGBT and anti immigrant hate speech  as well as explicitly allowing users to accuse LGBT people of being mentally ill or abnormal based on their sexual orientation or gender identity                                                     
In January       Meta faced significant criticism for its role in removing LGBTQ  content from its platforms  amid its broader efforts to address anti LGBTQ  hate speech  The removal of LGBTQ  themes was noted as part of the wider crackdown on content deemed to violate its community guidelines  Meta s content moderation policies  which were designed to combat harmful speech and protect users from discrimination  inadvertently led to the removal or restriction of LGBTQ  content  particularly posts highlighting LGBTQ  identities  support  or political issues  According to reports  LGBTQ  posts  including those that simply celebrated pride or advocated for LGBTQ  rights  were flagged and removed for reasons that some critics argue were vague or inconsistently applied  Many LGBTQ  activists and users on Meta s platforms expressed concern that such actions stifled visibility and expression  potentially isolating LGBTQ  individuals and communities  especially in spaces that were historically important for outreach and support

In June       Meta settled a lawsuit with the US Department of Justice  The lawsuit  which was filed in       alleged that the company enabled housing discrimination through targeted advertising  as it allowed homeowners and landlords to run housing ads excluding people based on sex  race  religion  and other characteristics  The U S  Department of Justice stated that this was in violation of the Fair Housing Act  Meta was handed a penalty of          and given until December           to shadow the algorithm tool

In late April       a case was filed against Meta in Ghana over the alleged psychological distress experienced by content moderators employed to take down disturbing social media content including depictions of murders  extreme violence and child sexual abuse               Meta moved the moderation service to the Ghanaian capital of Accra after legal issues in the previous location Kenya  The new moderation company is Teleperformance  a multinational corporation with a history of worker s rights violation               Reports suggests the conditions are worse here than in the previous Kenyan location  with many workers afraid of speaking out due to fear of returning to conflict zones  Workers reported developing mental illnesses  attempted suicides  and low pay

Facebook ranked No     in the      Fortune     list of the largest United States corporations by revenue  with almost     billion in revenue              most of it coming from advertising                            One analysis of      data determined that the company earned US       per user from advertising              
According to New York  since its rebranding  Meta has reportedly lost      billion as a result of new privacy measures put in place by companies such as Apple and Google which prevents Meta from gathering users  data                           

Number of advertisers
In February       Facebook announced it had reached two million active advertisers  with most of the gain coming from small businesses  An active advertiser was defined as an entity that had advertised on the Facebook platform in the last    days               In March       Facebook announced it had reached three million active advertisers with more than     from outside the United States               Prices for advertising follow a variable pricing model based on auctioning ad placements  and potential engagement levels of the advertisement itself  Similar to other online advertising platforms like Google and Twitter  targeting of advertisements is one of the chief merits of digital advertising compared to traditional media  Marketing on Meta is employed through two methods based on the viewing habits  likes and shares  and purchasing data of the audience  namely targeted audiences and  look alike  audiences

Reception
Further information  Criticism of Facebook  Privacy concerns with Facebook  and Censorship by Facebook
US Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez responded in a tweet to Zuckerberg s announcement about Meta  saying   Meta as in  we are a cancer to democracy metastasizing into a global surveillance and propaganda machine for boosting authoritarian regimes and destroying civil society          for profit                
Ex Facebook employee Frances Haugen and whistleblower behind the Facebook Papers responded to the rebranding efforts by expressing doubts about the company s ability to improve while led by Mark Zuckerberg  and urged the chief executive officer to resign              
In November       a video published by Inspired by Iceland went viral  in which a Zuckerberg look alike promoted the Icelandverse  a place of  enhanced actual reality without silly looking headsets               
In a December      interview  SpaceX and Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk said he could not see a compelling use case for the VR driven metaverse  adding   I don t see someone strapping a frigging screen to their face all day               
In January       Louise Eccles of The Sunday Times logged into the metaverse with the intention of making a video guide  She wrote 

Initially  my experience with the Oculus went well  I attended work meetings as an avatar and tried an exercise class set in the streets of Paris  The headset enabled me to feel the thrill of carving down mountains on a snowboard and the adrenaline rush of climbing a mountain without ropes  Yet switching to the social apps  where you mingle with strangers also using VR headsets  it was at times predatory and vile 
Eccles described being sexually harassed by another user  as well as  accents from all over the world  American  Indian  English  Australian  using racist  sexist  homophobic and transphobic language   She also encountered users as young as   years old on the platform  despite Oculus headsets being intended for users over
