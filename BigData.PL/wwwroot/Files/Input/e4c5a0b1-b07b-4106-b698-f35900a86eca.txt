Condition in economics and game theory
Chess is an example of a game of perfect information 
In economics  perfect information  sometimes referred to as  no hidden information   is a feature of perfect competition  With perfect information in a market  all consumers and producers have complete and instantaneous knowledge of all market prices  their own utility  and own cost functions 
In game theory  a sequential game has perfect information if each player  when making any decision  is perfectly informed of all the events that have previously occurred  including the  initialization event  of the game  e g  the starting hands of each player in a card game                                              
Perfect information is importantly different from complete information  which implies common knowledge of each player s utility functions  payoffs  strategies and  types   A game with perfect information may or may not have complete information 

Poker is a game of imperfect information  as players do not know the private cards of their opponents 
Games where some aspect of play is hidden from opponents   such as the cards in poker and bridge   are examples of games with imperfect information                       


Examples edit 
Backgammon includes chance events  but by some definitions is classified as a game of perfect information 
Chess is an example of a game with perfect information  as each player can see all the pieces on the board at all times             Other games with perfect information include tic tac toe  Reversi  checkers  and Go            
Academic literature has not produced consensus on a standard definition of perfect information which defines whether games with chance  but no secret information  and games with simultaneous moves are games of perfect information                                             
Games which are sequential  players alternate in moving  and which have chance events  with known probabilities to all players  but no secret information  are sometimes considered games of perfect information  This includes games such as backgammon and Monopoly  However  some academic papers do not regard such games as games of perfect information because the results of chance themselves are unknown prior to them occurring                                             
Games with simultaneous moves are generally not considered games of perfect information  This is because each player holds information  which is secret  and must play a move without knowing the opponent s secret information  Nevertheless  some such games are symmetrical  and fair  An example of a game in this category includes rock paper scissors
