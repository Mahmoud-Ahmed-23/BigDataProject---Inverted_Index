Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of the mind and its relation to the body and the external world 
The mind body problem is a paradigmatic issue in philosophy of mind  although a number of other issues are addressed  such as the hard problem of consciousness and the nature of particular mental states                                   Aspects of the mind that are studied include mental events  mental functions  mental properties  consciousness and its neural correlates  the ontology of the mind  the nature of cognition and of thought  and the relationship of the mind to the body 
Dualism and monism are the two central schools of thought on the mind body problem  although nuanced views have arisen that do not fit one or the other category neatly 

Dualism finds its entry into Western philosophy thanks to Ren  Descartes in the   th century             Substance dualists like Descartes argue that the mind is an independently existing substance  whereas property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain  but that it is not a distinct substance            
Monism is the position that mind and body are ontologically indiscernible entities  not dependent substances  This view was espoused by the   th century rationalist Baruch Spinoza             Physicalists argue that only entities postulated by physical theory exist  and that mental processes will eventually be explained in terms of these entities as physical theory continues to evolve  Physicalists maintain various positions on the prospects of reducing mental properties to physical properties  many of whom adopt compatible forms of property dualism                                                                        and the ontological status of such mental properties remains unclear                                      Idealists maintain that the mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself  or an illusion created by the mind  Neutral monists such as Ernst Mach and William James argue that events in the world can be thought of as either mental  psychological  or physical depending on the network of relationships into which they enter  and dual aspect monists such as Spinoza adhere to the position that there is some other  neutral substance  and that both matter and mind are properties of this unknown substance  The most common monisms in the   th and   st centuries have all been variations of physicalism  these positions include behaviorism  the type identity theory  anomalous monism and functionalism             
Most modern philosophers of mind adopt either a reductive physicalist or non reductive physicalist position  maintaining in their different ways that the mind is not something separate from the body              These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences  especially in the fields of sociobiology  computer science  specifically  artificial intelligence   evolutionary psychology and the various neurosciences                                                  Reductive physicalists assert that all mental states and properties will eventually be explained by scientific accounts of physiological processes and states                                      Non reductive physicalists argue that although the mind is not a separate substance  mental properties supervene on physical properties  or that the predicates and vocabulary used in mental descriptions and explanations are indispensable  and cannot be reduced to the language and lower level explanations of physical science                          Continued neuroscientific progress has helped to clarify some of these issues  however  they are far from being resolved  Modern philosophers of mind continue to ask how the subjective qualities and the intentionality of mental states and properties can be explained in naturalistic terms                         
The problems of physicalist theories of the mind have led some contemporary philosophers to assert that the traditional view of substance dualism should be defended  From this perspective  this theory is coherent  and problems such as  the interaction of mind and body  can be rationally resolved             


Mind body problem edit 
Main article  Mind body problem
Illustration of mind body dualism by Ren  Descartes  Inputs are passed by the sensory organs to the pineal gland  and from there to the immaterial spirit 
The mind body problem concerns the explanation of the relationship that exists between minds  or mental processes  and bodily states or processes             The main aim of philosophers working in this area is to determine the nature of the mind and mental states processes  and how or even if minds are affected by and can affect the body 
Perceptual experiences depend on stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world  and these stimuli cause changes in our mental states  ultimately causing us to feel a sensation  which may be pleasant or unpleasant  For example  someone s desire for a slice of pizza will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and direction to obtain what he or she wants  The question  then  is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties             
A related problem is how someone s propositional attitudes  e g  beliefs and desires  cause that individual s neurons to fire and muscles to contract  These comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted epistemologists and philosophers of mind from the time of Ren  Descartes            

Dualist solutions to the mind body problem edit 
See also  Mind in eastern philosophy
Dualism is a set of views about the relationship between mind and matter  or body   It begins with the claim that mental phenomena are  in some respects  non physical             One of the earliest known formulations of mind body dualism was expressed in the eastern Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy  c            BCE   which divided the world into purusha  mind spirit  and prakriti  material substance               Specifically  the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali presents an analytical approach to the nature of the mind 
In Western philosophy  the earliest discussions of dualist ideas are in the writings of Plato who suggested that humans  intelligence  a faculty of the mind or soul  could not be identified with  or explained in terms of  their physical body                          However  the best known version of dualism is due to Ren  Descartes         and holds that the mind is a non extended  non physical substance  a  res cogitans              Descartes was the first to clearly identify the mind with consciousness and self awareness  and to distinguish this from the brain  which was the seat of intelligence  He was therefore the first to formulate the mind body problem in the form in which it still exists today            

Arguments for dualism edit 
The most frequently used argument in favor of dualism appeals to the common sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter  If asked what the mind is  the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self  their personality  their soul  or another related entity  They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain  or vice versa  finding the idea that there is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic or unintelligible             Modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading  and that critical faculties  along with empirical evidence from the sciences  should be used to examine these assumptions and determine whether there is any real basis to them            
According to some      who       the mental and the physical seem to have quite different  and perhaps irreconcilable  properties              Mental events have a subjective quality  whereas physical events do not  So  for example  one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger feels like  or what a blue sky looks like  or what nice music sounds like to a person  But it is meaningless  or at least odd  to ask what a surge in the uptake of glutamate in the dorsolateral portion of the prefrontal cortex feels like 
Philosophers of mind call the subjective aspects of mental events  qualia  or  raw feels               There are qualia involved in these mental events that seem particularly difficult to reduce to anything physical  David Chalmers explains this argument by stating that we could conceivably know all the objective information about something  such as the brain states and wavelengths of light involved with seeing the color red  but still not know something fundamental about the situation   what it is like to see the color red             
If consciousness  the mind  can exist independently of physical reality  the brain   one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness  Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality  One possible explanation is that of a miracle  proposed by Arnold Geulincx and Nicolas Malebranche  where all mind body interactions require the direct intervention of God 
Another argument that has been proposed by C  S  Lewis             is the Argument from Reason  if  as monism implies  all of our thoughts are the effects of physical causes  then we have no reason for assuming that they are also the consequent of a reasonable ground  Knowledge  however  is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent  Therefore  if monism is correct  there would be no way of knowing this or anything else we could not even suppose it  except by a fluke 
The zombie argument is based on a thought experiment proposed by Todd Moody  and developed by David Chalmers in his book The Conscious Mind  The basic idea is that one can imagine one s body  and therefore conceive the existence of one s body  without any conscious states being associated with this body  Chalmers  argument is that it seems possible that such a being could exist because all that is needed is that all and only the things that the physical sciences describe about a zombie must be true of it  Since none of the concepts involved in these sciences make reference to consciousness or other mental phenomena  and any physical entity can be by definition described scientifically via physics  the move from conceivability to possibility is not such a large one              Others such as Dennett have argued that the notion of a philosophical zombie is an incoherent              or unlikely              concept  It has been argued under physicalism that one must either believe that anyone including oneself might be a zombie  or that no one can be a zombie following from the assertion that one s own conviction about being  or not being  a zombie is a product of the physical world and is therefore no different from anyone else s  This argument has been expressed by Dennett who argues that  Zombies think they are conscious  think they have qualia  think they suffer pains they are just  wrong   according to this lamentable tradition  in ways that neither they nor we could ever discover

Avshalom Elitzur has described himself as a  reluctant dualist   One argument Elitzur makes in favor of dualism is an argument from bafflement  According to Elitzur  a conscious being can conceive of a P zombie version of his herself  However  a P zombie cannot conceive of a version of itself that lacks corresponding qualia             
Christian List argues that the existence of first person perspectives is evidence against physicalist views of consciousness              According to List  first personal phenomenal facts cannot supervene on third person physical facts  However  List argues that this also refutes versions of dualism that have purely third personal metaphysics  List has proposed a model he calls the  many worlds theory of consciousness  in order to reconcile the subjective nature of consciousness without lapsing into solipsism             

Interactionist dualism edit 
Portrait of Ren  Descartes by Frans Hals       
Interactionist dualism  or simply interactionism  is the particular form of dualism first espoused by Descartes in the Meditations             In the   th century  its major defenders have been Karl Popper and John Carew Eccles              It is the view that mental states  such as beliefs and desires  causally interact with physical states            
Descartes s argument for this position can be summarized as follows  Seth has a clear and distinct idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no spatial extension  i e   it cannot be measured in terms of length  weight  height  and so on   He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body as something that is spatially extended  subject to quantification and not able to think  It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties            
Seth s mental states  desires  beliefs  etc   have causal effects on his body and vice versa  A child touches a hot stove  physical event  which causes pain  mental event  and makes her yell  physical event   this in turn provokes a sense of fear and protectiveness in the caregiver  mental event   and so on 
Descartes  argument depends on the premise that what Seth believes to be  clear and distinct  ideas in his mind are necessarily true  Many contemporary philosophers doubt this                                      For example  Joseph Agassi suggests that several scientific discoveries made since the early   th century have undermined the idea of privileged access to one s own ideas  Freud claimed that a psychologically trained observer can understand a person s unconscious motivations better than the person himself does  Duhem has shown that a philosopher of science can know a person s methods of discovery better than that person herself does  while Malinowski has shown that an anthropologist can know a person s customs and habits better than the person whose customs and habits they are  He also asserts that modern psychological experiments that cause people to see things that are not there provide grounds for rejecting Descartes  argument  because scientists can describe a person s perceptions better than the person themself can                         

Other forms of dualism edit 
Four varieties of dualism  The arrows indicate the direction of the causal interactions  Occasionalism is not shown 
Psychophysical parallelism edit 
Psychophysical parallelism  or simply parallelism  is the view that mind and body  while having distinct ontological statuses  do not causally influence one another  Instead  they run along parallel paths  mind events causally interact with mind events and brain events causally interact with brain events  and only seem to influence each other              This view was most prominently defended by Gottfried Leibniz  Although Leibniz was an ontological monist who believed that only one type of substance  the monad  exists in the universe  and that everything is reducible to it  he nonetheless maintained that there was an important distinction between  the mental  and  the physical  in terms of causation  He held that God had arranged things in advance so that minds and bodies would be in harmony with each other  This is known as the doctrine of pre established harmony             

Occasionalism edit 
Occasionalism is the view espoused by Nicholas Malebranche as well as Islamic philosophers such as Abu Hamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad al Ghazali that asserts all supposedly causal relations between physical events  or between physical and mental events  are not really causal at all  While body and mind are different substances  causes  whether mental or physical  are related to their effects by an act of God s intervention on each specific occasion             

Property dualism edit 
Property dualism is the view that the world is constituted of one kind of substance   the physical kind   and there exist two distinct kinds of properties  physical properties and mental properties  It is the view that non physical  mental properties  such as beliefs  desires and emotions  inhere in some physical bodies  at least  brains   Sub varieties of property dualism include 

Emergent materialism asserts that when matter is organized in the appropriate way  i e   in the way that living human bodies are organized   mental properties emerge in a way not fully accountable for by physical laws             These emergent properties have an independent ontological status and cannot be reduced to  or explained in terms of  the physical substrate from which they emerge  They are dependent on the physical properties from which they emerge  but opinions vary as to the coherence of top down causation  that is  the causal effectiveness of such properties  A form of emergent materialism has been espoused by David Chalmers and the concept has undergone something of a renaissance in recent years              but it was already suggested in the   th century by William James 
Epiphenomenalism is a doctrine first formulated by Thomas Henry Huxley              It consists of the view that mental phenomena are causally ineffectual  where one or more mental states do not have any influence on physical states or mental phenomena are the effects  but not the causes  of physical phenomena  Physical events can cause other physical and mental events  but mental events cannot cause anything since they are just causally inert by products  i e   epiphenomena  of the physical world              This view has been defended by Frank Jackson             
Non reductive physicalism is the view that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties  mental states  such as qualia  are not reducible to physical states  The ontological stance towards qualia in the case of non reductive physicalism does not imply that qualia are causally inert  this is what distinguishes it from epiphenomenalism 
Panpsychism is the view that all matter has a mental aspect  or  alternatively  all objects have a unified center of experience or point of view  Superficially  it seems to be a form of property dualism  since it regards everything as having both mental and physical properties  However  some panpsychists say that mechanical behaviour is derived from the primitive mentality of atoms and molecules as are sophisticated mentality and organic behaviour  the difference being attributed to the presence or absence of complex structure in a compound object  So long as the reduction of non mental properties to mental ones is in place  panpsychism is not a  strong  form of property dualism  otherwise it is 
Dual aspect theory edit 
Dual aspect theory or dual aspect monism is the view that the mental and the physical are two aspects of  or perspectives on  the same substance   Thus it is a mixed position  which is monistic in some respects   In modern philosophical writings  the theory s relationship to neutral monism has become somewhat ill defined  but one proffered distinction says that whereas neutral monism allows the context of a given group of neutral elements and the relationships into which they enter to determine whether the group can be thought of as mental  physical  both  or neither  dual aspect theory suggests that the mental and the physical are manifestations  or aspects  of some underlying substance  entity or process that is itself neither mental nor physical as normally understood  Various formulations of dual aspect monism also require the mental and the physical to be complementary  mutually irreducible and perhaps inseparable  though distinct                                      

Experiential dualism edit 
This is a philosophy of mind that regards the degrees of freedom between mental and physical well being as not synonymous thus implying an experiential dualism between body and mind  An example of these disparate degrees of freedom is given by Allan Wallace who notes that it is  experientially apparent that one may be physically uncomfortable for instance  while engaging in a strenuous physical workout while mentally cheerful  conversely  one may be mentally distraught while experiencing physical comfort               Experiential dualism notes that our subjective experience of merely seeing something in the physical world seems qualitatively different from mental processes like grief that comes from losing a loved one  This philosophy is a proponent of causal dualism  which is defined as the dual ability for mental states and physical states to affect one another  Mental states can cause changes in physical states and vice versa 
However  unlike cartesian dualism or some other systems  experiential dualism does not posit two fundamental substances in reality  mind and matter  Rather  experiential dualism is to be understood as a conceptual framework that gives credence to the qualitative difference between the experience of mental and physical states  Experiential dualism is accepted as the conceptual framework of Madhyamaka Buddhism 

Madhayamaka Buddhism goes further  finding fault with the monist view of physicalist philosophies of mind as well in that these generally posit matter and energy as the fundamental substance of reality  Nonetheless  this does not imply that the cartesian dualist view is correct  rather Madhyamaka regards as error any affirming view of a fundamental substance to reality In denying the independent self existence of all the phenomena that make up the world of our experience  the Madhyamaka view departs from both the substance dualism of Descartes and the substance monism namely  physicalism that is characteristic of modern science  The physicalism propounded by many contemporary scientists seems to assert that the real world is composed of physical things in themselves  while all mental phenomena are regarded as mere appearances  devoid of any reality in and of themselves  Much is made of this difference between appearances and reality             
Indeed  physicalism  or the idea that matter is the only fundamental substance of reality  is explicitly rejected by Buddhism In the Madhyamaka view  mental events are no more or less real than physical events  In terms of our common sense experience  differences of kind do exist between physical and mental phenomena  While the former commonly have mass  location  velocity  shape  size  and numerous other physical attributes  these are not generally characteristic of mental phenomena  For example  we do not commonly conceive of the feeling of affection for another person as having mass or location  These physical attributes are no more appropriate to other mental events such as sadness  a recalled image from one s childhood  the visual perception of a rose  or consciousness of any sort  Mental phenomena are  therefore  not regarded as being physical  for the simple reason that they lack many of the attributes that are uniquely characteristic of physical phenomena  Thus  Buddhism has never adopted the physicalist principle that regards only physical things as real             
Monist solutions to the mind body problem edit 
In contrast to dualism  monism does not accept any fundamental divisions  The fundamentally disparate nature of reality has been central to forms of eastern philosophies for over two millennia  In Indian and Chinese philosophy  monism is integral to how experience is understood  Today  the most common forms of monism in Western philosophy are physicalist              Physicalistic monism asserts that the only existing substance is physical  in some sense of that term to be clarified by our best science              However  a variety of formulations  see below  are possible  Another form of monism  idealism  states that the only existing substance is mental  Although pure idealism  such as that of George Berkeley  is uncommon in contemporary Western philosophy  a more sophisticated variant called panpsychism  according to which mental experience and properties may be at the foundation of physical experience and properties  has been espoused by some philosophers such as Alfred North Whitehead             and David Ray Griffin             
Phenomenalism is the theory that representations  or sense data  of external objects are all that exist  Such a view was briefly adopted by Bertrand Russell and many of the logical positivists during the early   th century              A third possibility is to accept the existence of a basic substance that is neither physical nor mental  The mental and physical would then both be properties of this neutral substance  Such a position was adopted by Baruch Spinoza            and was popularized by Ernst Mach             in the   th century  This neutral monism  as it is called  resembles property dualism 

Physicalistic monisms edit 
Behaviorism edit 
Main article  Behaviorism
Behaviorism dominated philosophy of mind for much of the   th century  especially the first half              In psychology  behaviorism developed as a reaction to the inadequacies of introspectionism              Introspective reports on one s own interior mental life are not subject to careful examination for accuracy and cannot be used to form predictive generalizations  Without generalizability and the possibility of third person examination  the behaviorists argued  psychology cannot be scientific              The way out  therefore  was to eliminate the idea of an interior mental life  and hence an ontologically independent mind  altogether and focus instead on the description of observable behavior             
Parallel to these developments in psychology  a philosophical behaviorism  sometimes called logical behaviorism  was developed              This is characterized by a strong verificationism  which generally considers unverifiable statements about interior mental life pointless  For the behaviorist  mental states are not interior states on which one can make introspective reports  They are just descriptions of behavior or dispositions to behave in certain ways  made by third parties to explain and predict another s behavior             
Philosophical behaviorism has fallen out of favor since the latter half of the   th century  coinciding with the rise of cognitivism            

Identity theory edit 
Main article  Type physicalism
Type physicalism  or type identity theory  was developed by Jack Smart             and Ullin Place             as a direct reaction to the failure of behaviorism  These philosophers reasoned that  if mental states are something material  but not behavioral  then mental states are probably identical to internal states of the brain  In very simplified terms  a mental state M is nothing other than brain state B  The mental state  desire for a cup of coffee  would thus be nothing more than the  firing of certain neurons in certain brain regions              

The classic Identity theory and Anomalous Monism in contrast  For the Identity theory  every token instantiation of a single mental type corresponds  as indicated by the arrows  to a physical token of a single physical type  For anomalous monism  the token token correspondences can fall outside of the type type correspondences  The result is token identity 
On the other hand  even granted the above  it does not follow that identity theories of all types must be abandoned  According to token identity theories  the fact that a certain brain state is connected with only one mental state of a person does not have to mean that there is an absolute correlation between types of mental state and types of brain state  The type token distinction can be illustrated by a simple example  the word  green  contains four types of letters  g  r  e  n  with two tokens  occurrences  of the letter e along with one each of the others 
The idea of token identity is that only particular occurrences of mental events are identical with particular occurrences or tokenings of physical events              Anomalous monism  see below  and most other non reductive physicalisms are token identity theories              Despite these problems  there is a renewed interest in the type identity theory today  primarily due to the influence of Jaegwon Kim             

Functionalism edit 
Main article  Functionalism  philosophy of mind 
Functionalism was formulated by Hilary Putnam and Jerry Fodor as a reaction to the inadequacies of the identity theory              Putnam and Fodor saw mental states in terms of an empirical computational theory of the mind              At about the same time or slightly after  D M  Armstrong and David Kellogg Lewis formulated a version of functionalism that analyzed the mental concepts of folk psychology in terms of functional roles              Finally  Wittgenstein s idea of meaning as use led to a version of functionalism as a theory of meaning  further developed by Wilfrid Sellars and Gilbert Harman  Another one  psychofunctionalism  is an approach adopted by the naturalistic philosophy of mind associated with Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn 
Mental states are characterized by their causal relations with other mental states and with sensory inputs and behavioral outputs  Functionalism abstracts away from the details of the physical implementation of a mental state by characterizing it in terms of non mental functional properties  For example  a kidney is characterized scientifically by its functional role in filtering blood and maintaining certain chemical balances             

Non reductive physicalism edit 
Main article  Physicalism
Non reductionist philosophers hold firmly to two essential convictions with regard to mind body relations     Physicalism is true and mental states must be physical states  but    All reductionist proposals are unsatisfactory  mental states cannot be reduced to behavior  brain states or functional states              Hence  the question arises whether there can still be a non reductive physicalism  Donald Davidson s anomalous monism             is an attempt to formulate such a physicalism  He  thinks that when one runs across what are traditionally seen as absurdities of Reason  such as akrasia or self deception  the personal psychology framework is not to be given up in favor of the subpersonal one  but rather must be enlarged or extended so that the rationality set out by the principle of charity can be found elsewhere              
Davidson uses the thesis of supervenience  mental states supervene on physical states  but are not reducible to them   Supervenience  therefore describes a functional dependence  there can be no change in the mental without some change in the physical causal reducibility between the mental and physical without ontological reducibility             

Weak emergentism edit 
Main article  Emergentism
Weak emergentism is a form of  non reductive physicalism  that involves a layered view of nature  with the layers arranged in terms of increasing complexity and each corresponding to its own special science  Some philosophers     who       hold that emergent properties causally interact with more fundamental levels  while others maintain that higher order properties simply supervene over lower levels without direct causal interaction  The latter group therefore holds a less strict  or  weaker   definition of emergentism  which can be rigorously stated as follows  a property P of composite object O is emergent if it is metaphysically impossible for another object to lack property P if that object is composed of parts with intrinsic properties identical to those in O and has those parts in an identical configuration      citation needed     
Sometimes emergentists use the example of water having a new property when Hydrogen H and Oxygen O combine to form H O  water   In this example there  emerges  a new property of a transparent liquid that would not have been predicted by understanding hydrogen and oxygen as gases  This is analogous to physical properties of the brain giving rise to a mental state  Emergentists try to solve the notorious mind body gap this way  One problem for emergentism is the idea of causal closure in the world that does not allow for a mind to body causation             

Eliminative materialism edit 
Main article  Eliminative materialism
If one is a materialist and believes that all aspects of our common sense psychology will find reduction to a mature cognitive neuroscience  and that non reductive materialism is mistaken  then one can adopt a final  more radical position  eliminative materialism 
There are several varieties of eliminative materialism  but all maintain that our common sense  folk psychology  badly misrepresents the nature of some aspect of cognition  Eliminativists such as Patricia and Paul Churchland argue that while folk psychology treats cognition as fundamentally sentence like  the non linguistic vector matrix model of neural network theory or connectionism will prove to be a much more accurate account of how the brain works             
The Churchlands often invoke the fate of other  erroneous popular theories and ontologies that have arisen in the course of history                          For example  Ptolemaic astronomy served to explain and roughly predict the motions of the planets for centuries  but eventually this model of the Solar System was eliminated in favor of the Copernican model  The Churchlands believe the same eliminative fate awaits the  sentence cruncher  model of the mind in which thought and behavior are the result of manipulating sentence like states called  propositional attitudes   Sociologist Jacy Reese Anthis argues for eliminative materialism on all faculties of mind  including consciousness  stating   The deepest mysteries of the mind are within our reach              

Mysterianism edit 
Main article  New mysterianism
Some philosophers take an epistemic approach and argue that the mind body problem is currently unsolvable  and perhaps will always remain unsolvable to human beings  This is usually termed New mysterianism  Colin McGinn holds that human beings are cognitively closed in regards to their own minds  According to McGinn human minds lack the concept forming procedures to fully grasp how mental properties such as consciousness arise from their causal basis              An example would be how an elephant is cognitively closed in regards to particle physics 
A more moderate conception has been expounded by Thomas Nagel  which holds that the mind body problem is currently unsolvable at the present stage of scientific development and that it might take a future scientific paradigm shift or revolution to bridge the explanatory gap  Nagel posits that in the future a sort of  objective phenomenology  might be able to bridge the gap between subjective conscious experience and its physical basis             

Linguistic criticism of the mind body problem edit 
Each attempt to answer the mind body problem encounters substantial problems  Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion              These philosophers  such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and his followers in the tradition of linguistic criticism  therefore reject the problem as illusory              They argue that it is an error to ask how mental and biological states fit together  Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways for instance  in a mental and in a biological vocabulary  Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other s vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts              This is the case  for instance  if one searches for mental states of the brain  The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a category error or a sort of fallacy of reasoning             
Today  such a position is often adopted by interpreters of Wittgenstein such as Peter Hacker              However  Hilary Putnam  the originator of functionalism  has also adopted the position that the mind body problem is an illusory problem which should be dissolved according to the manner of Wittgenstein             

Naturalism and its problems edit 
The thesis of physicalism is that the mind is part of the material  or physical  world  Such a position faces the problem that the mind has certain properties that no other material thing seems to possess  Physicalism must therefore explain how it is possible that these properties can nonetheless emerge from a material thing  The project of providing such an explanation is often referred to as the  naturalization of the mental               Some of the crucial problems that this project attempts to resolve include the existence of qualia and the nature of intentionality             

Qualia edit 
Main article  Qualia
Many mental states seem to be experienced subjectively in different ways by different individuals              And it is characteristic of a mental state that it has some experiential quality  e g  of pain  that it hurts  However  the sensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical  since no one has a perfect way to measure how much something hurts or of describing exactly how it feels to hurt  Philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these experiences come from  The existence of cerebral events  in and of themselves  cannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences  The puzzle of why many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness seems impossible to explain             
Yet it also seems to many that science will eventually have to explain such experiences              This follows from an assumption about the possibility of reductive explanations  According to this view  if an attempt can be successfully made to explain a phenomenon reductively  e g   water   then it can be explained why the phenomenon has all of its properties  e g   fluidity  transparency               In the case of mental states  this means that there needs to be an explanation of why they have the property of being experienced in a certain way 
The   th century German philosopher Martin Heidegger criticized the ontological assumptions underpinning such a reductive model  and claimed that it was impossible to make sense of experience in these terms  This is because  according to Heidegger  the nature of our subjective experience and its qualities is impossible to understand in terms of Cartesian  substances  that bear  properties   Another way to put this is that the very concept of qualitative experience is incoherent in terms of or is semantically incommensurable with the concept of substances that bear properties             
This problem of explaining introspective first person aspects of mental states and consciousness in general in terms of third person quantitative neuroscience is called the explanatory gap              There are several different views of the nature of this gap among contemporary philosophers of mind  David Chalmers and the early Frank Jackson interpret the gap as ontological in nature  that is  they maintain that qualia can never be explained by science because physicalism is false  There are two separate categories involved and one cannot be reduced to the other              An alternative view is taken by philosophers such as Thomas Nagel and Colin McGinn  According to them  the gap is epistemological in nature  For Nagel  science is not yet able to explain subjective experience because it has not yet arrived at the level or kind of knowledge that is required  We are not even able to formulate the problem coherently              For McGinn  on other hand  the problem is one of permanent and inherent biological limitations  We are not able to resolve the explanatory gap because the realm of subjective experiences is cognitively closed to us in the same manner that quantum physics is cognitively closed to elephants              Other philosophers liquidate the gap as purely a semantic problem  This semantic problem  of course  led to the famous  Qualia Question   which is  Does Red cause Redness 

Intentionality edit 
Main article  Intentionality
John Searle one of the most influential philosophers of mind  proponent of biological naturalism  Berkeley      
Intentionality is the capacity of mental states to be directed towards  about  or be in relation with something in the external world              This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values  When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem  natural processes are not true or false  they simply happen              It would not make any sense to say that a natural process is true or false  But mental ideas or judgments are true or false  so how then can mental states  ideas or judgments  be natural processes  The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts  Thus  for example  the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and to the fact that he was a historian  If the fact is true  then the idea is true  otherwise  it is false  But where does this relation come from  In the brain  there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus             

Philosophy of perception edit 
Main article  Philosophy of perception
Philosophy of perception is concerned with the nature of perceptual experience and the status of perceptual objects  in particular how perceptual experience relates to appearances and beliefs about the world  The main contemporary views within philosophy of perception include naive realism  enactivism and representational views                                   

Philosophy of mind and science edit 
A phrenological mapping of the brain   phrenology was among the first attempts to correlate mental functions with specific parts of the brain although it is now widely discredited 
Humans are corporeal beings and  as such  they are subject to examination and description by the natural sciences  Since mental processes are intimately related to bodily processes  e g   embodied cognition theory of mind   the descriptions that the natural sciences furnish of human beings play an important role in the philosophy of mind             There are many scientific disciplines that study processes related to the mental  The list of such sciences includes  biology  computer science  cognitive science  cybernetics  linguistics  medicine  pharmacology  and psychology             

Neurobiology edit 
Main article  Neuroscience
The theoretical background of biology  as is the case with modern natural sciences in general  is fundamentally materialistic  The objects of study are  in the first place  physical processes  which are considered to be the foundations of mental activity and behavior              The increasing success of biology in the explanation of mental phenomena can be seen by the absence of any empirical refutation of its fundamental presupposition   there can be no change in the mental states of a person without a change in brain states              
Within the field of neurobiology  there are many subdisciplines that are concerned with the relations between mental and physical states and processes              Sensory neurophysiology investigates the relation between the processes of perception and stimulation              Cognitive neuroscience studies the correlations between mental processes and neural processes              Neuropsychology describes the dependence of mental faculties on specific anatomical regions of the brain              Lastly  evolutionary biology studies the origins and development of the human nervous system and  in as much as this is the basis of the mind  also describes the ontogenetic and phylogenetic development of mental phenomena beginning from their most primitive stages              Evolutionary biology furthermore places tight constraints on any philosophical theory of the mind  as the gene based mechanism of natural selection does not allow any giant leaps in the development of neural complexity or neural software but only incremental steps over long time periods             

Since the     s  sophisticated neuroimaging procedures  such as fMRI  above   have furnished increasing knowledge about the workings of the human brain  shedding light on ancient philosophical problems 
The methodological breakthroughs of the neurosciences  in particular the introduction of high tech neuroimaging procedures  has propelled scientists toward the elaboration of increasingly ambitious research programs  one of the main goals is to describe and comprehend the neural processes which correspond to mental functions  see  neural correlate               Several groups are inspired by these advances 

Neurophilosophy edit 
Main article  Neurophilosophy
Neurophilosophy is an interdisciplinary field that examines the intersection of neuroscience and philosophy  particularly focusing on how neuroscientific findings inform and challenge traditional arguments in the philosophy of mind  offering insights into the nature of consciousness  cognition  and the mind brain relationship 
Patricia Churchland argues for a deep integration of neuroscience and philosophy  emphasizing that understanding the mind requires grounding philosophical questions in empirical findings about the brain  Churchland challenges traditional dualistic and purely conceptual approaches to the mind  advocating for a materialistic framework where mental phenomena are understood as brain processes  She posits that philosophical theories of mind must be informed by advances in neuroscience  such as the study of neural networks  brain plasticity  and the biochemical basis of cognition and behavior  Churchland critiques the idea that introspection or purely conceptual analysis can sufficiently explain consciousness  arguing instead that empirical methods can illuminate how subjective experiences arise from neural mechanisms             
An unsolved question in neuroscience and the philosophy of mind is the binding problem  which is the problem of how objects  background  and abstract or emotional features are combined into a single experience              It is considered a  problem  because no complete model exists  The binding problem can be subdivided into the four areas of perception  neuroscience  cognitive science  and the philosophy of mind  It includes general considerations on coordination  the subjective unity of perception  and variable binding              Another related problem is known as the boundary problem              The boundary problem is essentially the inverse of the binding problem  and asks how binding stops occurring and what prevents other neurological phenomena from being included in first person perspectives  giving first person perspectives hard boundaries 

Computer science edit 
Main article  Computer science
Computer science concerns itself with the automatic processing of information  or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned  by means of such things as computers              From the beginning  computer programmers have been able to develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind  A simple example is multiplication  It is not clear whether computers could be said to have a mind  Could they  someday  come to have what we call a mind  This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence  AI  
Within AI  it is common to distinguish between a modest research program and a more ambitious one  this distinction was coined by John Searle in terms of a weak AI and strong AI  The exclusive objective of  weak AI   according to Searle  is the successful simulation of mental states  with no attempt to make computers become conscious or aware  etc  The objective of strong AI  on the contrary  is a computer with consciousness similar to that of human beings              The program of strong AI goes back to one of the pioneers of computation Alan Turing  As an answer to the question  Can computers think    he formulated the famous Turing test              Turing believed that a computer could be said to  think  when  if placed in a room by itself next to another room that contained a human being and with the same questions being asked of both the computer and the human being by a third party human being  the computer s responses turned out to be indistinguishable from those of the human  Essentially  Turing s view of machine intelligence followed the behaviourist model of the mind intelligence is as intelligence does  The Turing test has received many criticisms  among which the most famous is probably the Chinese room thought experiment formulated by Searle             
The question about the possible sensitivity  qualia  of computers or robots still remains open  Some computer scientists believe that the specialty of AI can still make new contributions to the resolution of the  mind body problem   They suggest that based on the reciprocal influences between software and hardware that takes place in all computers  it is possible that someday theories can be discovered that help us to understand the reciprocal influences between the human mind and the brain  wetware              

Psychology edit 
Main article  Psychology
Psychology is the science that investigates mental states directly  It uses generally empirical methods to investigate concrete mental states like joy  fear or obsessions  Psychology investigates the laws that bind these mental states to each other or with inputs and outputs to the human organism             
An example of this is the psychology of perception  Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the perception of forms  A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other              This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states  However  it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states  The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind body problem already described 

Cognitive science edit 
Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes  It examines what cognition is  what it does  and how it works  It includes research on intelligence and behavior  especially focusing on how information is represented  processed  and transformed  in faculties such as perception  language  memory  reasoning  and emotion  within nervous systems  human or other animals  and machines  e g  computers   Cognitive science consists of multiple research disciplines  including psychology  artificial intelligence  philosophy  neuroscience  linguistics  anthropology  sociology  and education              It spans many levels of analysis  from low level learning and decision mechanisms to high level logic and planning  from neural circuitry to modular brain organization  Over the years  cognitive science has evolved from a representational and information processing approach to explaining the mind to embrace an embodied perspective of it  Accordingly  bodily processes play a significant role in the acquisition  development  and shaping of cognitive capabilities              For instance  Rowlands        argues that cognition is enactive  embodied  embedded  affective and  potentially  extended  The position is taken that the  classical sandwich  of cognition sandwiched between perception and action is artificial  cognition has to be seen as a product of a strongly coupled interaction that cannot be divided this way                         

Near death research edit 
Main article  Near death studies
In the field of near death research  the following phenomenon  among others  occurs  For example  during some brain operations the brain is artificially and measurably deactivated  Nevertheless  some patients report during this phase that they have perceived what is happening in their surroundings  that is  that they have had consciousness  Patients also report experiences during a cardiac arrest  There is the following problem  As soon as the brain is no longer supplied with blood and thus with oxygen after a cardiac arrest  the brain ceases its normal operation after about    seconds  that is  the brain falls into a state of unconsciousness             

Philosophy of mind in the continental tradition edit 
Most of the discussion in this article has focused on one style or tradition of philosophy in modern Western culture  usually called analytic philosophy  sometimes described as Anglo American philosophy                Many other schools of thought exist  however  which are sometimes subsumed under the broad  and vague  label of continental philosophy               In any case  though topics and methods here are numerous  in relation to the philosophy of mind the various schools that fall under this label  phenomenology  existentialism  etc   can globally be seen to differ from the analytic school in that they focus less on language and logical analysis alone but also take in other forms of understanding human existence and experience  With reference specifically to the discussion of the mind  this tends to translate into attempts to grasp the concepts of thought and perceptual experience in some sense that does not merely involve the analysis of linguistic forms              
Immanuel Kant s Critique of Pure Reason  first published in      and presented again with major revisions in       represents a significant intervention into what will later become known as the philosophy of mind  Kant s first critique is generally recognized as among the most significant works of modern philosophy in the West  Kant is a figure whose influence is marked in both continental and analytic Anglo American philosophy  Kant s work develops an in depth study of transcendental consciousness  or the life of the mind as conceived through the universal categories of understanding 
In Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel s Philosophy of Mind  frequently translated as Philosophy of Spirit or Geist                the third part of his Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences  Hegel discusses three distinct types of mind  the  subjective mind spirit   the mind of an individual  the  objective mind spirit   the mind of society and of the State  and the  Absolute mind spirit   the position of religion  art  and philosophy  See also Hegel s The Phenomenology of Spirit  Nonetheless  Hegel s work differs radically from the style of Anglo American philosophy of mind 
In       Henri Bergson made in Matter and Memory  Essay on the relation of body and spirit  a forceful case for the ontological difference of body and mind by reducing the problem to the more definite one of memory  thus allowing for a solution built on the empirical test case of aphasia 
In modern times  the two main schools that have developed in response or opposition to this Hegelian tradition are phenomenology and existentialism  Phenomenology  founded by Edmund Husserl  focuses on the contents of the human mind  see noema  and how processes shape our experiences               Existentialism  a school of thought founded upon the work of S ren Kierkegaard  focuses on Human predicament and how people deal with the situation of being alive  Existential phenomenology represents a major branch of continental philosophy  they are not contradictory   rooted in the work of Husserl but expressed in its fullest forms in the work of Martin Heidegger  Jean Paul Sartre  Simone de Beauvoir and Maurice Merleau Ponty  See Heidegger s Being and Time  Merleau Ponty s Phenomenology of Perception  Sartre s Being and Nothingness  and Simone de Beauvoir s The Second Sex 

Topics related to the philosophy of mind edit 
There are countless subjects that are affected by the ideas developed in the philosophy of mind  Clear examples of this are the nature of death and its definitive character  the nature of emotion  of perception and of memory  Questions about what a person is and what his or her identity have to do with the philosophy of mind  There are two subjects that  in connection with the philosophy of the mind  have aroused special attention  free will and the self            

Free will edit 
Main article  Free will
In the context of philosophy of mind  the problem of free will takes on renewed intensity  This is the case for materialistic determinists             According to this position  natural laws completely determine the course of the material world  Mental states  and therefore the will as well  would be material states  which means human behavior and decisions would be completely determined by natural laws  Some take this reasoning a step further  people cannot determine by themselves what they want and what they do  Consequently  they are not free              
This argumentation is rejected  on the one hand  by the compatibilists  Those who adopt this position suggest that the question  Are we free   can only be answered once we have determined what the term  free  means  The opposite of  free  is not  caused  but  compelled  or  coerced   It is not appropriate to identify freedom with indetermination  A free act is one where the agent could have done otherwise if it had chosen otherwise  In this sense a person can be free even though determinism is true               The most important compatibilist in the history of the philosophy was David Hume               More recently      when       this position was defended  for example  by Daniel Dennett              
On the other hand  there are also many incompatibilists who reject the argument because they believe that the will is free in a stronger sense called libertarianism               These philosophers affirm the course of the world is either a  not completely determined by natural law where natural law is intercepted by physically independent agency               b  determined by indeterministic natural law only  or c  determined by indeterministic natural law in line with the subjective effort of physically non reducible agency               Under Libertarianism  the will does not have to be deterministic and  therefore  it is potentially free  Critics of the second proposition  b  accuse the incompatibilists of using an incoherent concept of freedom  They argue as follows  if our will is not determined by anything  then we desire what we desire by pure chance  And if what we desire is purely accidental  we are not free  So if our will is not determined by anything  we are not free              

Self edit 
Main article  Philosophy of self
The philosophy of mind also has important consequences for the concept of  self   If by  self  or  I  one refers to an essential  immutable nucleus of the person  some modern philosophers of mind  such as Daniel Dennett believe that no such thing exists  According to Dennett and other contemporaries  the self is considered an illusion               The idea of a self as an immutable essential nucleus derives from the idea of an immaterial soul  Such an idea is unacceptable to modern philosophers with physicalist orientations and their general skepticism of the concept of  self  as postulated by David Hume  who could never catch himself not doing  thinking or feeling anything               However  in the light of empirical results from developmental psychology  developmental biology and neuroscience  the idea of an essential inconstant  material nucleus an integrated representational system distributed over changing patterns of synaptic connections seems reasonable              
One question central to the philosophy of personal identity is Benj Hellie s vertiginous question  The vertiginous question asks why  of all the subjects of experience out there  this one the one corresponding to the human being referred to as Benj Hellie is the one whose experiences are live   The reader is supposed to substitute their own case for Hellie s                In other words  Why am I me and not someone else  A common response to the question is that it reduces to  Why are Hellie s experiences live from Hellie s perspective   and thus the entire question is a tautology  However  Hellie argues  through a parable  that this response leaves something out  His parable describes two situations  one reflecting a broad global constellation view of the world and everyone s phenomenal features  and one describing an embedded view from the perspective of a single subject  Caspar Hare has discussed similar ideas with the concepts of egocentric presentism                           and perspectival realism              
In his book I am You  The Metaphysical Foundations for Global Ethics  Daniel Kolak advocates for a philosophy he calls open individualism               Open individualism states that individual personal identity is an illusion and all individual conscious minds are in reality the same being  similar to the idea of anatt  in Buddhist philosophy  Kolak describes three opposing philosophical views of personal identity  closed individualism  empty individualism  and open individualism  Closed individualism is considered to be the default view of personal identity  which is that one s personal identity consists of a ray or line traveling through time  and that one has a future self  Empty individualism is another view  which is that personal identity exists  but one s  identity  only persists for an infinitesimally small amount of time  and the  you  that will exist in the future is an ontologically different being from the  you  that exists now  Similar ideas have been discussed by Derek Parfit in the book Reasons and Persons with thought experiments such as the teletransportation paradox              
Thomas Nagel further discusses the philosophy of self and perspective in the book The View from Nowhere  It contrasts passive and active points of view in how humanity interacts with the world  relying either on a subjective perspective that reflects a point of view or an objective perspective that takes a more detached perspective               Nagel describes the objective perspective as the  view from nowhere   one where the only valuable ideas are ones derived independently
