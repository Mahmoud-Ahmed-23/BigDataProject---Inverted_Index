							Egypt intends to present a comprehensive plan for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip  aimed at guaranteeing the Palestinian people remain on their land and in accordance with their legitimate legal rights 
In a statement released on Tuesday  Egypt       s Foreign Ministry said it looks        forward to cooperating with the US administration  led by President Donald Trump  to achieve a comprehensive and just peace in the region        
It added that this would be accomplished        through a fair settlement of the Palestinian issue  taking into account the rights of all peoples in the region        
Egypt emphasised that        any vision for resolving the Palestinian issue should consider avoiding the jeopardising of existing peace gains in the region  while striving to contain and address the causes and roots of the conflict        
The statement said this included        ending the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and implementing a two state solution as the only way to achieve stability and coexistence among the peoples of the region
