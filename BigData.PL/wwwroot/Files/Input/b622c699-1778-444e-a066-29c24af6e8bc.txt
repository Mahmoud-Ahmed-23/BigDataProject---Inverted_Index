A heuristic            or heuristic technique  problem solving  mental shortcut  rule of thumb                                              is any approach to problem solving that employs a pragmatic method that is not fully optimized  perfected  or rationalized  but is nevertheless  good enough  as an approximation or attribute substitution                        Where finding an optimal solution is impossible or impractical  heuristic methods can be used to speed up the process of finding a satisfactory solution                        Heuristics can be mental shortcuts that ease the cognitive load of making a decision                                     

Heuristic reasoning is often based on induction  or on analogy          Induction is the process of discovering general laws           Induction tries to find regularity and coherence          Its most conspicuous instruments are generalization  specialization  analogy             Heuristic discusses human behavior in the face of problems      that have been  preserved in the wisdom of proverbs                     George P lya  How to Solve It

Gigerenzer  amp  Gaissmaier        state that sub sets of strategy include heuristics  regression analysis  and Bayesian inference             

A heuristic is a strategy that ignores part of the information  with the goal of making decisions more quickly  frugally  and or accurately than more complex methods  Gigerenzer and Gaissmaier         p       see also Todd et al          p                         S  Chow   Many Meanings of  Heuristic    The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science
Heuristics are strategies based on rules to generate optimal decisions  like the anchoring effect and utility maximization problem              These strategies depend on using readily accessible  though loosely applicable  information to control problem solving in human beings  machines and abstract issues                          When an individual applies a heuristic in practice  it generally performs as expected  However it can alternatively create systematic errors             
The most fundamental heuristic is trial and error  which can be used in everything from matching nuts and bolts to finding the values of variables in algebra problems  In mathematics  some common heuristics involve the use of visual representations  additional assumptions  forward backward reasoning and simplification 
Dual process theory concerns embodied heuristics

Contemporary edit 
The study of heuristics in human decision making was developed in the     s and the     s  by the psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman              although the concept had been originally introduced by the Nobel laureate Herbert A  Simon  Simon s original primary object of research was problem solving that showed that we operate within what he calls bounded rationality  He coined the term satisficing  which denotes a situation in which people seek solutions  or accept choices or judgements  that are  good enough  for their purposes although they could be optimised             
Rudolf Groner analysed the history of heuristics from its roots in ancient Greece up to contemporary work in cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence              proposing a cognitive style  heuristic versus algorithmic thinking   which can be assessed by means of a validated questionnaire             

Adaptive toolbox edit 
The adaptive toolbox contains strategies for fabricating heuristic devices              The core mental capacities are recall  memory   frequency  object permanence  and imitation              Gerd Gigerenzer and his research group argued that models of heuristics need to be formal to allow for predictions of behavior that can be tested              They study the fast and frugal heuristics in the  adaptive toolbox  of individuals or institutions  and the ecological rationality of these heuristics  that is  the conditions under which a given heuristic is likely to be successful              The descriptive study of the  adaptive toolbox  is done by observation and experiment  while the prescriptive study of ecological rationality requires mathematical analysis and computer simulation  Heuristics   such as the recognition heuristic  the take the best heuristic and fast and frugal trees   have been shown to be effective in predictions  particularly in situations of uncertainty  It is often said that heuristics trade accuracy for effort but this is only the case in situations of risk  Risk refers to situations where all possible actions  their outcomes and probabilities are known  In the absence of this information  that is under uncertainty  heuristics can achieve higher accuracy with lower effort              This finding  known as a less is more effect  would not have been found without formal models  The valuable insight of this program is that heuristics are effective not despite their simplicity   but because of it  Furthermore  Gigerenzer and Wolfgang Gaissmaier found that both individuals and organisations rely on heuristics in an adaptive way             

Cognitive experiential self theory edit 
Heuristics  through greater refinement and research  have begun to be applied to other theories  or be explained by them  For example  the cognitive experiential self theory  CEST  is also an adaptive view of heuristic processing  CEST breaks down two systems that process information  At some times  roughly speaking  individuals consider issues rationally  systematically  logically  deliberately  effortfully  and verbally  On other occasions  individuals consider issues intuitively  effortlessly  globally  and emotionally              From this perspective  heuristics are part of a larger experiential processing system that is often adaptive  but vulnerable to error in situations that require logical analysis             

Attribute substitution edit 
In       Daniel Kahneman and Shane Frederick proposed that cognitive heuristics work by a process called attribute substitution  which happens without conscious awareness              According to this theory  when somebody makes a judgement  of a  target attribute   that is computationally complex  a more easily calculated  heuristic attribute  is substituted  In effect  a cognitively difficult problem is dealt with by answering a rather simpler problem  without being aware of this happening              This theory explains cases where judgements fail to show regression toward the mean              Heuristics can be considered to reduce the complexity of clinical judgments in health care

In psychology  heuristics are simple  efficient rules  either learned or inculcated by evolutionary processes  These psychological heuristics have been proposed to explain how people make decisions  come to judgements  and solve problems  These rules typically come into play when people face complex problems or incomplete information  Researchers employ various methods to test whether people use these rules  The rules have been shown to work well under most circumstances  but in certain cases can lead to systematic errors or cognitive biases             

Philosophy edit 
A heuristic device is used when an entity X exists to enable understanding of  or knowledge concerning  some other entity Y 
A good example is a model that  as it is never identical with what it models  is a heuristic device to enable understanding of what it models  Stories  metaphors  etc   can also be termed heuristic in this sense  A classic example is the notion of utopia as described in Plato s best known work  The Republic  This means that the  ideal city  as depicted in The Republic is not given as something to be pursued  or to present an orientation point for development  Rather  it shows how things would have to be connected  and how one thing would lead to another  often with highly problematic results   if one opted for certain principles and carried them through rigorously 
Heuristic is also often used as a noun to describe a rule of thumb  procedure  or method              Philosophers of science have emphasised the importance of heuristics in creative thought and the construction of scientific theories              Seminal works include Karl Popper s The Logic of Scientific Discovery and others by Imre Lakatos              Lindley Darden  and William C  Wimsatt 

Law edit 
In legal theory  especially in the theory of law and economics  heuristics are used in the law when case by case analysis would be impractical  insofar as  practicality  is defined by the interests of a governing body              
The present securities regulation regime largely assumes that all investors act as perfectly rational persons  In truth  actual investors face cognitive limitations from biases  heuristics  and framing effects  For instance  in all states in the United States the legal drinking age for unsupervised persons is    years  because it is argued that people need to be mature enough to make decisions involving the risks of alcohol consumption  However  assuming people mature at different rates  the specific age of    would be too late for some and too early for others  In this case  the somewhat arbitrary delineation is used because it is impossible or impractical to tell whether an individual is sufficiently mature for society to trust them with that kind of responsibility  Some proposed changes  however  have included the completion of an alcohol education course rather than the attainment of    years of age as the criterion for legal alcohol possession  This would put youth alcohol policy more on a case by case basis and less on a heuristic one  since the completion of such a course would presumably be voluntary and not uniform across the population 
The same reasoning applies to patent law  Patents are justified on the grounds that inventors must be protected so they have incentive to invent  It is therefore argued that it is in society s best interest that inventors receive a temporary government granted monopoly on their idea  so that they can recoup investment costs and make economic profit for a limited period  In the United States  the length of this temporary monopoly is    years from the date the patent application was filed  though the monopoly does not actually begin until the application has matured into a patent  However  like the drinking age problem above  the specific length of time would need to be different for every product to be efficient  A    year term is used because it is difficult to tell what the number should be for any individual patent  More recently  some  including University of North Dakota law professor Eric E  Johnson  have argued that patents in different kinds of industries   such as software patents   should be protected for different lengths of time              

Artificial intelligence edit 
The bias variance tradeoff gives insight into describing the less is more strategy               A heuristic can be used in artificial intelligence systems while searching a solution space  The heuristic is derived by using some function that is put into the system by the designer  or by adjusting the weight of branches based on how likely each branch is to lead to a goal node 

Behavioural economics edit 
Heuristics refers to the cognitive shortcuts that individuals use to simplify decision making processes in economic situations  Behavioral economics is a field that integrates insights from psychology and economics to better understand how people make decisions 
Anchoring and adjustment is one of the most extensively researched heuristics in behavioural economics  Anchoring is the tendency of people to make future judgements or conclusions based too heavily on the original information supplied to them  This initial knowledge functions as an anchor  and it can influence future judgements even if the anchor is entirely unrelated to the decisions at hand  Adjustment  on the other hand  is the process through which individuals make gradual changes to their initial judgements or conclusions 
Anchoring and adjustment has been observed in a wide range of decision making contexts  including financial decision making  consumer behavior  and negotiation  Researchers have identified a number of strategies that can be used to mitigate the effects of anchoring and adjustment  including providing multiple anchors  encouraging individuals to generate alternative anchors  and providing cognitive prompts to encourage more deliberative decision making 
Other heuristics studied in behavioral economics include the representativeness heuristic  which refers to the tendency of individuals to categorize objects or events based on how similar they are to typical examples               and the availability heuristic  which refers to the tendency of individuals to judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily it comes to mind              

Stereotyping edit 
Stereotyping is a type of heuristic that people use to form opinions or make judgements about things they have never seen or experienced               They work as a mental shortcut to assess everything from the social status of a person  based on their actions               to classifying a plant as a tree based on it being tall  having a trunk  and that it has leaves  even though the person making the evaluation might never have seen that particular type of tree before  
Stereotypes  as first described by journalist Walter Lippmann in his book Public Opinion         are the pictures we have in our heads that are built around experiences as well as what we are told about the world
