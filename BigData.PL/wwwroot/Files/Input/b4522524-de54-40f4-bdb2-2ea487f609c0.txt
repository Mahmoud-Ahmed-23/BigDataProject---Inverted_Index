 Literature     portalvte
Science fiction  often shortened to sci fi or abbreviated SF  is a genre of speculative fiction which stereotypically deals with imaginative and futuristic concepts such as advanced science and technology  space exploration  time travel  parallel universes  and extraterrestrial life  It can explore science and technology in different ways  such as human responses to theoretical new advancements  or the consequences thereof  
Science fiction is related to fantasy  together abbreviated SF amp F   horror  and superhero fiction  and contains many subgenres  Its exact definition has long been disputed among authors  critics  scholars  and readers  Subgenres include hard science fiction  which emphasizes scientific accuracy  and soft science fiction  focusing on social sciences  Other notable subgenres are cyberpunk  which explores the interface between technology and society  and climate fiction addressing environmental issues 
Precedents for science fiction are argued to exist as far back as antiquity  but the modern genre primarily arose in the   th and early   th centuries when popular writers began looking to technological progress for inspiration and speculation  Mary Shelley s Frankenstein  written in       is often credited as the first true science fiction novel  Jules Verne and H G  Wells are pivotal figures in the genre s development  In the   th century  the genre grew during the Golden Age of Science Fiction and expanded with the introduction of space operas  dystopian literature  and pulp magazines 
Science fiction has come to influence not just literature but film  television  and culture at large  Science fiction can criticize present day society and explore alternatives as well as provide entertainment and inspire a  sense of wonder  


Definitions edit 
Main article  Definitions of science fiction
According to Isaac Asimov   Science fiction can be defined as that branch of literature which deals with the reaction of human beings to changes in science and technology              
Robert A  Heinlein wrote that  A handy short definition of almost all science fiction might read  realistic speculation about possible future events  based solidly on adequate knowledge of the real world  past and present  and on a thorough understanding of the nature and significance of the scientific method             
American science fiction author and editor Lester del Rey wrote   Even the devoted aficionado or fan has a hard time trying to explain what science fiction is   and the lack of a  full satisfactory definition  is because  there are no easily delineated limits to science fiction             
Another definition comes from The Literature Book by DK and is   scenarios that are at the time of writing technologically impossible  extrapolating from present day science         or that deal with some form of speculative science based conceit  such as a society  on Earth or another planet  that has developed in wholly different ways from our own             
There is a tendency among science fiction enthusiasts as their own arbiter in deciding what exactly constitutes science fiction             David Seed says it may be more useful to talk about science fiction as the intersection of other more concrete subgenres             Damon Knight summed up the difficulty  saying  Science fiction is what we point to when we say it             

Alternative terms edit

Forrest J Ackerman has been credited with first using the term  sci fi   analogous to the then trendy  hi fi   in about                  The first known use in print was a description of Donovan s Brain by movie critic Jesse Zunser in January                  As science fiction entered popular culture  writers and fans active in the field came to associate the term with low budget  low tech  B movies  and with low quality pulp science fiction                                      By the     s  critics within the field  such as Damon Knight and Terry Carr  were using  sci fi  to distinguish hack work from serious science fiction              
Peter Nicholls writes that  SF   or  sf   is  the preferred abbreviation within the community of sf writers and readers               
Robert Heinlein found even  science fiction  insufficient for certain types of works in this genre  and suggested the term speculative fiction to be used instead for those that are more  serious  or  thoughtful

In      the National Science Foundation conducted a survey on  Public Attitudes and Public Understanding  Science Fiction and Pseudoscience                It found that people who read or prefer science fiction may think about or relate to science differently than other people  They also tend to support the space program and the idea of contacting extraterrestrial civilizations                            Carl Sagan wrote   Many scientists deeply involved in the exploration of the solar system  myself among them  were first turned in that direction by science fiction               
Science fiction has predicted several existing inventions  such as the atomic bomb               robots               and borazon               In the      series Away astronauts use a Mars rover called InSight to listen intently for a landing on Mars  In      scientists used InSight to listen for the landing of a spacecraft               
Science fiction  can act as a vehicle to analyze and recognize a society s past  present  and potential future social relationships with the other  Science fiction offers a medium and representation of alterity and differences in social identity               Brian Aldiss described science fiction as  cultural wallpaper                This widespread influence can be found in trends for writers to employ science fiction as a tool for advocacy and generating cultural insights  as well as for educators when teaching across a range of academic disciplines not limited to the natural sciences               
Scholar and science fiction critic George Edgar Slusser said that science fiction  is the one real international literary form we have today  and as such has branched out to visual media  interactive media and on to whatever new media the world will invent in the   st century  Crossover issues between the sciences and the humanities are crucial for the century to come               

As protest literature edit

 Happy       in Spanish or Portuguese  referencing George Orwell s Nineteen Eighty Four  on a standing piece of the Berlin Wall  sometime after      
Science fiction has sometimes been used as a means of social protest  George Orwell s Nineteen Eighty Four        is an important work of dystopian science fiction                             It is often invoked in protests against governments and leaders who are seen as totalitarian                            James Cameron s      film Avatar was intended as a protest against imperialism  and specifically the European colonization of the Americas               Science fiction in Latin America and Spain explore the concept of  authoritarianism              
Robots  artificial humans  human clones  intelligent computers  and their possible conflicts with human society have all been major themes of science fiction since  at least  the publication of Shelly s Frankenstein  Some critics have seen this as reflecting authors  concerns over the social alienation seen in modern society              
Feminist science fiction poses questions about social issues such as how society constructs gender roles  the role reproduction plays in defining gender  and the inequitable political or personal power of one gender over others  Some works have illustrated these themes using utopias to explore a society in which gender differences or gender power imbalances do not exist  or dystopias to explore worlds in which gender inequalities are intensified  thus asserting a need for feminist work to continue                           
Climate fiction  or  cli fi   deals with issues concerning climate change and global warming                            University courses on literature and environmental issues may include climate change fiction in their syllabi               and it is often discussed by other media outside of science fiction fandom              
Libertarian science fiction focuses on the politics and social order implied by right libertarian philosophies with an emphasis on individualism and private property  and in some cases anti statism               Robert A  Heinlein is one of the most popular authors of this subgenre  including The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and Stranger in a Strange Land              
Science fiction comedy often satirizes and criticizes present day society  and sometimes makes fun of the conventions and clich s of more serious science fiction                           

Sense of wonder edit

     illustration by Aubrey Beardsley for Lucian s A True Story 
Science fiction is often said to inspire a  sense of wonder    Science fiction editor  publisher and critic David Hartwell wrote              

Science fiction s appeal lies in combination of the rational  the believable  with the miraculous  It is an appeal to the sense of wonder 
Carl Sagan said              

One of the great benefits of science fiction is that it can convey bits and pieces  hints  and phrases  of knowledge unknown or inaccessible to the reader       works you ponder over as the water is running out of the bathtub or as you walk through the woods in an early winter snowfall 
In       Isaac Asimov commented on the changes then occurring in the science fiction community              

And because today s real life so resembles day before yesterday s fantasy  the old time fans are restless  Deep within  whether they admit it or not  is a feeling of disappointment and even outrage that the outer world has invaded their private domain  They feel the loss of a  sense of wonder  because what was once truly confined to  wonder  has now become prosaic and mundane 
Science fiction studies edit

The centrepiece of the university estate  the Victoria Building  University of Liverpool  as a science fiction degree granting program 
The science fiction studies is the critical assessment interpretation  and discussion of science fiction literature  film  TV shows  new media  fandom  and fan fiction               Science fiction scholars study science fiction to better understand it and its relationship to science  technology  politics  other genres  and culture at large               
Science fiction studies began around the turn of the   th century  but it was not until later that science fiction studies solidified as a discipline with the publication of the academic journals Extrapolation         Foundation  The International Review of Science Fiction         and Science Fiction Studies                                   and the establishment of the oldest organizations devoted to the study of science fiction in       the Science Fiction Research Association and the Science Fiction Foundation                            The field has grown considerably since the     s with the establishment of more journals  organizations  and conferences  as well as science fiction degree granting programs such as those offered by the University of Liverpool              

Classification edit 
Further information  Hard science fiction and Soft science fiction
Science fiction has historically been sub divided between hard science fiction and soft science fiction  with the division centering on the feasibility of the science               However  this distinction has come under increasing scrutiny in the   st century  Some authors  such as Tade Thompson and Jeff VanderMeer  have pointed out that stories that focus explicitly on physics  astronomy  mathematics  and engineering tend to be considered  hard  science fiction  while stories that focus on botany  mycology  zoology  and the social sciences tend to be categorized as  soft   regardless of the relative rigor of the science              
Max Gladstone defined  hard  science fiction as stories  where the math works   but pointed out that this ends up with stories that often seem  weirdly dated   as scientific paradigms shift over time               Michael Swanwick dismissed the traditional definition of  hard  SF altogether  instead saying that it was defined by characters striving to solve problems  in the right way with determination  a touch of stoicism  and the consciousness that the universe is not on his or her side               
Ursula K  Le Guin also criticized the more traditional view on the difference between  hard  and  soft  SF   The  hard  science fiction writers dismiss everything except  well  physics  astronomy  and maybe chemistry  Biology  sociology  anthropology that s not science to them  that s soft stuff  They re not that interested in what human beings do  really  But I am  I draw on the social sciences a great deal

Many critics remain skeptical of the literary value of science fiction and other forms of genre fiction  though some accepted authors have written works argued by opponents to constitute science fiction  Mary Shelley wrote a number of scientific romance novels in the Gothic literature tradition  including Frankenstein  or  The Modern Prometheus                      Kurt Vonnegut was a highly respected American author whose works have been argued by some to contain science fiction premises or themes                            
Other science fiction authors whose works are widely considered to be  serious  literature include Ray Bradbury  including  especially  Fahrenheit            and The Martian Chronicles                       Arthur C  Clarke  especially for Childhood s End                             and Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger  writing under the name Cordwainer Smith               Doris Lessing  who was later awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature  wrote a series of five SF novels  Canopus in Argos  Archives              which depict the efforts of more advanced species and civilizations to influence those less advanced  including humans on Earth                                                     
David Barnett has pointed out that there are books such as The Road        by Cormac McCarthy  Cloud Atlas        by David Mitchell  The Gone Away World        by Nick Harkaway  The Stone Gods        by Jeanette Winterson  and Oryx and Crake        by Margaret Atwood  which use recognizable science fiction tropes  but which are not classified by their authors and publishers as science fiction               Atwood in particular argued against the categorization of works like the Handmaid s Tale as science fiction  labeling it  Oryx  and the Testaments as speculative fiction              and deriding science fiction as  talking squids in outer space                
In his book  The Western Canon   literary critic Harold Bloom includes Brave New World  Stanis aw Lem s Solaris  Kurt Vonnegut s Cat s Cradle  and The Left Hand of Darkness as culturally and aesthetically significant works of western literature  though Lem actively spurned the Western label of  science fiction               
In her      essay  Science Fiction and Mrs Brown   Ursula K  Le Guin was asked   Can a science fiction writer write a novel   She answered   I believe that all novels     deal with character    The great novelists have brought us to see whatever they wish us to see through some character  Otherwise  they would not be novelists  but poets  historians  or pamphleteers               
Orson Scott Card  best known for his      science fiction novel Ender s Game  has postulated that in science fiction the message and intellectual significance of the work are contained within the story itself and  therefore  does not require accepted literary devices and techniques he instead characterized as gimmicks or literary games                           
Jonathan Lethem  in a      essay in the Village Voice entitled  Close Encounters  The Squandered Promise of Science Fiction   suggested that the point in      when Thomas Pynchon s Gravity s Rainbow was nominated for the Nebula Award and was passed over in favor of Clarke s Rendezvous with Rama  stands as  a hidden tombstone marking the death of the hope that SF was about to merge with the mainstream                In the same year science fiction author and physicist Gregory Benford wrote   SF is perhaps the defining genre of the twentieth century  although its conquering armies are still camped outside the Rome of the literary citadels
