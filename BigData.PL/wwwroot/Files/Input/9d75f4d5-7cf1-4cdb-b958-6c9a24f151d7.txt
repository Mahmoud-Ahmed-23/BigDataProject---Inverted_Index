Accusations leveled against Hamas of participation in military operations in Egypt are false and without evidence  said Ihab Al Ghussein  spokesman the Hamas government in the Gaza strip  in a Sunday press conference 
Al Ghussein said that his government completely rejects the        official and unofficial        accusations of intervention in Egypt s internal affairs  which he said were  only  made  to demonise Gaza and Hamas        
The remarks came in response to the press conference held by the Egyptian Army spokesman Colonel Ahmed Ali on the same day 
Ali accused Gaza Strip authorities in the press conference of not securing the borders  He also reviewed two attempts to detonate border checkpoints remotely from Gaza  a video of a large number of the arrested in Sinai disclosing that they are from Gaza  Ali also said that many grenades and explosives confiscated were marked with the label of Ezzedine Al Qassam brigades  the military wing of Hamas 
Al Ghussein said he completely rejected all the accusations  especially those of attempting to detonate explosives at checkpoints and Al Qassam labeled explosives  saying that the latter were brought into Egypt by members of Fatah  Hamas issued a statement on its website denying Ali       s claims of Al Qassam labeled explosives  describing them as        lies and fabrications        
Al Ghussein declared that        working against the Egyptian army is not in our agenda         and that the        restoration of security in Egypt is for the good of Palestine         He also condemned the destruction of the tunnels between Sinai and Gaza  describing them as        the lifelines to Gaza        so long as the Rafah border crossing is closed by the Egyptian side 
Al Ghussein added that Gaza is not        a source of terrorism         and called on Egypt to halt        the media campaign aimed at demonising Gaza and Hamas and to re open the Rafah border crossing         He also hoped to find a        means of communication with Cairo and procedures to secure the mutual borders and the removal of all tension between both sides        
The press conference was followed by a statement from the Hamas government in Gaza  saying that        the Palestinian people  and their political factions  stand at an equal distance from all the factions in Egypt        
The statement also denied the presence of prominent Muslim Brotherhood leader Mahmoud Ezzat in Gaza  and rejected accusations regarding Hamas participation in the    January      revolution or in Rabaa Al Adaweya incidents 
Hamas        political bureau member  Moussa Abu Marzouk  said on his Facebook page that        Gaza needs Egypt  
Â        Does it  sound reasonable  that the people of Gaza perceive the Egyptians as enemies         Abu Marzuk asked 
The Egyptian ambassador in Palestine  Yasser Othman  told state owned news agency MENA that Hamas should stop issuing        conflicting opinions regarding Egypt       
Othman added that        while the Hamas government statement said it appreciated the Egyptian army  a Hamas        official accused the Egyptian army of digging tunnels and putting explosives in them  in order to accuse Hamas of doing so        
Fatah  which reigns over the West Bank  responded to the opposing statements by Egypt and Hamas through Palestinian Ambassador to Egypt Barakat Al Farra  In an interview with Al Hayat TV channel       s news show Al Hayat Al       an  Life Now   Al Farra said   Hamas is unable to see the situation correctly and has to review its policies regarding Egypt   adding that Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people  but rather the organisation itself 
The tension between Egyptian authorities and Hamas  a sub group of the Brotherhood  emerged after the ouster of former President Mohamed Morsi and the toppling of the Brotherhood government in Egypt on   July
