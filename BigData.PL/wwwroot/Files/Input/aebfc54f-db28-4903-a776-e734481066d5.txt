Energy storage is the capture of energy produced at one time for use at a later time            to reduce imbalances between energy demand and energy production  A device that stores energy is generally called an accumulator or battery  Energy comes in multiple forms including radiation  chemical  gravitational potential  electrical potential  electricity  elevated temperature  latent heat and kinetic  Energy storage involves converting energy from forms that are difficult to store to more conveniently or economically storable forms 
Some technologies provide short term energy storage  while others can endure for much longer  Bulk energy storage is currently dominated by hydroelectric dams  both conventional as well as pumped  Grid energy storage is a collection of methods used for energy storage on a large scale within an electrical power grid 
Common examples of energy storage are the rechargeable battery  which stores chemical energy readily convertible to electricity to operate a mobile phone  the hydroelectric dam  which stores energy in a reservoir as gravitational potential energy  and ice storage tanks  which store ice frozen by cheaper energy at night to meet peak daytime demand for cooling   Fossil fuels such as coal and gasoline store ancient energy derived from sunlight by organisms that later died  became buried and over time were then converted into these fuels  Food  which is made by the same process as fossil fuels  is a form of energy stored in chemical form 


History edit 
In the   th century grid  electrical power was largely generated by burning fossil fuel  When less power was required  less fuel was burned             Hydropower  a mechanical energy storage method  is the most widely adopted mechanical energy storage  and has been in use for centuries  Large hydropower dams have been energy storage sites for more than one hundred years             Concerns with air pollution  energy imports  and global warming have spawned the growth of renewable energy such as solar and wind power             Wind power is uncontrolled and may be generating at a time when no additional power is needed  Solar power varies with cloud cover and at best is only available during daylight hours  while demand often peaks after sunset  see duck curve   Interest in storing power from these intermittent sources grows as the renewable energy industry begins to generate a larger fraction of overall energy consumption             In      BloombergNEF forecast total energy storage deployments to grow at a compound annual growth rate of    percent through                 
Off grid electrical use was a niche market in the   th century  but in the   st century  it has expanded  Portable devices are in use all over the world  Solar panels are now common in the rural settings worldwide  Access to electricity is now a question of economics and financial viability  and not solely on technical aspects  Electric vehicles are gradually replacing combustion engine vehicles  However  powering long distance transportation without burning fuel remains in development

Mechanical edit 
Energy from sunlight or other renewable energy is converted to potential energy for storage in devices such as electric batteries  The stored potential energy is later converted to electricity that is added to the power grid  even when the original energy source is not available  In pumped hydro systems  energy from the source is used to lift water upward against the force of gravity  giving it potential energy that is later converted to electricity provided to the power grid 
Energy can be stored in water pumped to a higher elevation using pumped storage methods or by moving solid matter to higher locations  gravity batteries   Other commercial mechanical methods include compressing air and flywheels that convert electric energy into internal energy or kinetic energy and then back again when electrical demand peaks 

Hydroelectricity edit 
Main article  Hydroelectricity
Hydroelectric dams with reservoirs can be operated to provide electricity at times of peak demand  
Water is stored in the reservoir during periods of low demand and released when demand is high  
The net effect is similar to pumped storage  but without the pumping loss 
While a hydroelectric dam does not directly store energy from other generating units  it behaves equivalently by lowering output in periods of excess electricity from other sources  
In this mode  dams are one of the most efficient forms of energy storage  because only the timing of its generation changes  
Hydroelectric turbines have a start up time on the order of a few minutes            

Pumped hydro edit 
The Sir Adam Beck Generating Complex at Niagara Falls  Canada  which includes a large pumped storage hydroelectricity reservoir to provide an extra     MW of electricity during periods of peak demand
Main article  Pumped storage hydroelectricity
Worldwide  pumped storage hydroelectricity  PSH  is the largest capacity form of active grid energy storage available  and  as of March       the Electric Power Research Institute  EPRI  reports that PSH accounts for more than     of bulk storage capacity worldwide  representing around         MW             PSH energy efficiency varies in practice between     and                                                   with claims of up to                 
At times of low electrical demand  excess generation capacity is used to pump water from a lower source into a higher reservoir  When demand grows  water is released back into a lower reservoir  or waterway or body of water  through a turbine  generating electricity  Reversible turbine generator assemblies act as both a pump and turbine  usually a Francis turbine design   Nearly all facilities use the height difference between two water bodies  Pure pumped storage plants shift the water between reservoirs  while the  pump back  approach is a combination of pumped storage and conventional hydroelectric plants that use natural stream flow 

Compressed air edit

Main articles  Compressed air energy storage and Salt dome
Compressed air energy storage  CAES  uses surplus energy to compress air for subsequent electricity generation              Small scale systems have long been used in such applications as propulsion of mine locomotives  The compressed air is stored in an underground reservoir  such as a salt dome 
Compressed air energy storage  CAES  plants can bridge the gap between production volatility and load  CAES storage addresses the energy needs of consumers by effectively providing readily available energy to meet demand  Renewable energy sources like wind and solar energy vary  So at times when they provide little power  they need to be supplemented with other forms of energy to meet energy demand  Compressed air energy storage plants can take in the surplus energy output of renewable energy sources during times of energy over production  This stored energy can be used at a later time when demand for electricity increases or energy resource availability decreases             
Compression of air creates heat  the air is warmer after compression  Expansion requires heat  If no extra heat is added  the air will be much colder after expansion  If the heat generated during compression can be stored and used during expansion  efficiency improves considerably              A CAES system can deal with the heat in three ways  Air storage can be adiabatic  diabatic  or isothermal  Another approach uses compressed air to power vehicles                         

Flywheel edit 
The main components of a typical flywheel
A Flybrid Kinetic Energy Recovery System flywheel  Built for use on Formula   racing cars  it is employed to recover and reuse kinetic energy captured during braking 
Main articles  Flywheel energy storage and Flywheel storage power system
Flywheel energy storage  FES  works by accelerating a rotor  a flywheel  to a very high speed  holding energy as rotational energy  When energy is added the rotational speed of the flywheel increases  and when energy is extracted  the speed declines  due to conservation of energy 
Most FES systems use electricity to accelerate and decelerate the flywheel  but devices that directly use mechanical energy are under consideration             
FES systems have rotors made of high strength carbon fiber composites  suspended by magnetic bearings and spinning at speeds from        to over             revolutions per minute  rpm  in a vacuum enclosure              Such flywheels can reach maximum speed        charge   in a matter of minutes  The flywheel system is connected to a combination electric motor generator 
FES systems have relatively long lifetimes  lasting decades with little or no maintenance              full cycle lifetimes quoted for flywheels range from in excess of      up to      cycles of use               high specific energy               W h kg  or         kJ kg                          and power density 

Solid mass gravitational  edit 
Main article  Gravity battery
Changing the altitude of solid masses can store or release energy via an elevating system driven by an electric motor generator  Studies suggest energy can begin to be released with as little as   second warning  making the method a useful supplemental feed into an electricity grid to balance load surges             
Efficiencies can be as high as     recovery of stored energy             
This can be achieved by siting the masses inside old vertical mine shafts or in specially constructed towers where the heavy weights are winched up to store energy and allowed a controlled descent to release it  At      a prototype vertical store is being built in Edinburgh  Scotland            
Potential energy storage or gravity energy storage was under active development in      in association with the California Independent System Operator                                      It examined the movement of earth filled hopper rail cars driven by electric locomotives from lower to higher elevations             
Other proposed methods include  

using rails                          cranes              or elevators             to move weights up and down 
using high altitude solar powered balloon platforms supporting winches to raise and lower solid masses slung underneath them             
using winches supported by an ocean barge to take advantage of a        km              ft  elevation difference between the sea surface and the seabed

Thermal edit 
Main articles  Thermal energy storage  Molten salt  and Seasonal thermal energy storage
Thermal energy storage  TES  is the temporary storage or removal of heat 

Sensible heat thermal edit 
Sensible heat storage take advantage of sensible heat in a material to store energy             
Seasonal thermal energy storage  STES  allows heat or cold to be used months after it was collected from waste energy or natural sources  The material can be stored in contained aquifers  clusters of boreholes in geological substrates such as sand or crystalline bedrock  in lined pits filled with gravel and water  or water filled mines              Seasonal thermal energy storage  STES  projects often have paybacks in four to six years              An example is Drake Landing Solar Community in Canada  for which     of the year round heat is provided by solar thermal collectors on garage roofs  enabled by a borehole thermal energy store  BTES                                       In Braedstrup  Denmark  the community s solar district heating system also uses STES  at a temperature of          C            F   A heat pump  which runs only while surplus wind power is available  It is used to raise the temperature to          C            F  for distribution  When wind energy is not available  a gas fired boiler is used  Twenty percent of Braedstrup s heat is solar             

 Latent heat thermal  LHTES  edit 
Latent heat thermal energy storage systems work by transferring heat to or from a material to change its phase  A phase change is the melting  solidifying  vaporizing or liquifying  Such a material is called a phase change material  PCM   Materials used in LHTESs often have a high latent heat so that at their specific temperature  the phase change absorbs a large amount of energy  much more than sensible heat             
A steam accumulator is a type of LHTES where the phase change is between liquid and gas and uses the latent heat of vaporization of water  Ice storage air conditioning systems use off peak electricity to store cold by freezing water into ice  The stored cold in ice releases during melting process and can be used for cooling at peak hours 

Cryogenic thermal energy storage edit 
Main article  Cryogenic energy storage
Air can be liquefied by cooling using electricity and stored as a cryogen with existing technologies  The liquid air can then be expanded through a turbine and the energy recovered as electricity  The system was demonstrated at a pilot plant in the UK in                  
In       Highview announced plans to build a    MW in the North of England and northern Vermont  with the proposed facility able to store five to eight hours of energy  for a              MWh storage capacity             

Carnot battery edit 
Main article  Carnot battery
Electrical energy can be stored thermally by resistive heating or heat pumps  and the stored heat can be converted back to electricity via Rankine cycle or Brayton cycle              This technology has been studied to retrofit coal fired power plants into fossil fuel free generation systems              Coal fired boilers are replaced by high temperature heat storage charged by excess electricity from renewable energy sources  In       German Aerospace Center started to construct the world s first large scale Carnot battery system  which has             MWh storage capacity             

Electrochemical edit 
Rechargeable battery edit 
A rechargeable battery bank used as an uninterruptible power supply in a data center                        
Main articles  Rechargeable battery and Battery storage power station
A rechargeable battery comprises one or more electrochemical cells  It is known as a  secondary cell  because its electrochemical reactions are electrically reversible  Rechargeable batteries come in many shapes and sizes  ranging from button cells to megawatt grid systems 
Rechargeable batteries have lower total cost of use and environmental impact than non rechargeable  disposable  batteries  Some rechargeable battery types are available in the same form factors as disposables  Rechargeable batteries have higher initial cost but can be recharged very cheaply and used many times 
Common rechargeable battery chemistries include 

Lead acid battery  Lead acid batteries hold the largest market share of electric storage products  A single cell produces about  V when charged  In the charged state the metallic lead negative electrode and the lead sulfate positive electrode are immersed in a dilute sulfuric acid  H SO   electrolyte  In the discharge process electrons are pushed out of the cell as lead sulfate is formed at the negative electrode while the electrolyte is reduced to water 
Lead acid battery technology has been developed extensively  Upkeep requires minimal labor and its cost is low  The battery s available energy capacity is subject to a quick discharge resulting in a low life span and low energy density             
Nickel cadmium battery  NiCd   Uses nickel oxide hydroxide and metallic cadmium as electrodes  Cadmium is a toxic element  and was banned for most uses by the European Union in       Nickel cadmium batteries have been almost completely replaced by nickel metal hydride  NiMH  batteries 
Nickel metal hydride battery  NiMH   First commercial types were available in                   These are now a common consumer and industrial type  The battery has a hydrogen absorbing alloy for the negative electrode instead of cadmium 
Lithium ion battery  The choice in many consumer electronics and have one of the best energy to mass ratios and a very slow self discharge when not in use 
Lithium ion polymer battery  These batteries are light in weight and can be made in any shape desired 
Aluminium sulfur battery with rock salt crystals as electrolyte  aluminium and sulfur are Earth abundant materials and are much more cheaper than traditional Lithium             
Flow battery edit 
Main articles  Flow battery and Vanadium redox battery
A flow battery works by passing a solution over a membrane where ions are exchanged to charge or discharge the cell  Cell voltage is chemically determined by the Nernst equation and ranges  in practical applications  from     V to     V  Storage capacity depends on the volume of solution  A flow battery is technically akin both to a fuel cell and an electrochemical accumulator cell  Commercial applications are for long half cycle storage such as backup grid power 

Supercapacitor edit 
One of a fleet of electric capabuses powered by supercapacitors  at a quick charge station bus stop  in service during Expo      Shanghai China  Charging rails can be seen suspended over the bus 
Main article  Supercapacitor
Supercapacitors  also called electric double layer capacitors  EDLC  or ultracapacitors  are a family of electrochemical capacitors             that do not have conventional solid dielectrics  Capacitance is determined by two storage principles  double layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance                         
Supercapacitors bridge the gap between conventional capacitors and rechargeable batteries  They store the most energy per unit volume or mass  energy density  among capacitors  They support up to        farads     Volt              up to        times that of electrolytic capacitors  but deliver or accept less than half as much power per unit time  power density              
While supercapacitors have specific energy and energy densities that are approximately     of batteries  their power density is generally    to     times greater  This results in much shorter charge discharge cycles  Also  they tolerate many more charge discharge cycles than batteries 
Supercapacitors have many applications  including 

Low supply current for memory backup in static random access memory  SRAM 
Power for cars  buses  trains  cranes and elevators  including energy recovery from braking  short term energy storage and burst mode power delivery
Chemical edit 
Power to gas edit 
The new technology helps reduce greenhouse gases and operating costs at two existing peaker plants in Norwalk and Rancho Cucamonga  The    megawatt battery storage system  combined with the gas turbine  allows the peaker plant to more quickly respond to changing energy needs  thus increasing the reliability of the electrical grid 
Main article  Power to gas
Power to gas is the conversion of electricity to a gaseous fuel such as hydrogen or methane  The three commercial methods use electricity to reduce water into hydrogen and oxygen by means of electrolysis 
In the first method  hydrogen is injected into the natural gas grid or is used for transportation  The second method is to combine the hydrogen with carbon dioxide to produce methane using a methanation reaction such as the Sabatier reaction  or biological methanation  resulting in an extra energy conversion loss of     The methane may then be fed into the natural gas grid  The third method uses the output gas of a wood gas generator or a biogas plant  after the biogas upgrader is mixed with the hydrogen from the electrolyzer  to upgrade the quality of the biogas 

Hydrogen edit 
Main article  Hydrogen storage
See also  Combined cycle hydrogen power plant and Hydrogen fuel cell power plant
The element hydrogen can be a form of stored energy  Hydrogen can produce electricity via a hydrogen fuel cell 
At penetrations below     of the grid demand  renewables do not severely change the economics  but beyond about     of the total demand              external storage becomes important  If these sources are used to make ionic hydrogen  they can be freely expanded  A   year community based pilot program using wind turbines and hydrogen generators began in      in the remote community of Ramea  Newfoundland and Labrador              A similar project began in      on Utsira  a small Norwegian island 
Energy losses involved in the hydrogen storage cycle come from the electrolysis of water  liquification or compression of the hydrogen and conversion to electricity             
Hydrogen can also be produced from aluminum and water by stripping aluminum s naturally occurring aluminum oxide barrier and introducing it to water  This method is beneficial because recycled aluminum cans can be used to generate hydrogen  however systems to harness this option have not been commercially developed and are much more complex than electrolysis systems              Common methods to strip the oxide layer include caustic catalysts such as sodium hydroxide and alloys with gallium  mercury and other metals             
Underground hydrogen storage is the practice of hydrogen storage in caverns  salt domes and depleted oil and gas fields                          Large quantities of gaseous hydrogen have been stored in caverns by Imperial Chemical Industries for many years without any difficulties              The European Hyunder project indicated in      that storage of wind and solar energy using underground hydrogen would require    caverns             
Powerpaste is a magnesium and hydrogen  based fluid gel that releases hydrogen when reacting with water  It was invented  patented and is being developed by the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials  IFAM  of the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft   Powerpaste is made by combining magnesium powder with hydrogen to form magnesium hydride in a process conducted at           C and five to six times atmospheric pressure  An ester and a metal salt are then added to make the finished product   Fraunhofer states that they are building a production plant slated to start production in       which will produce   tons of Powerpaste annually              Fraunhofer has patented their invention in the United States and EU              Fraunhofer claims that Powerpaste is able to store hydrogen energy at    times the energy density of a lithium battery of a similar dimension and is safe and convenient for automotive situations             

Methane edit 
Main article  Substitute natural gas
Methane is the simplest hydrocarbon with the molecular formula CH   Methane is more easily stored and transported than hydrogen  Storage and combustion infrastructure  pipelines  gasometers  power plants  are mature 
Synthetic natural gas  syngas or SNG  can be created in a multi step process  starting with hydrogen and oxygen  Hydrogen is then reacted with carbon dioxide in a Sabatier process  producing methane and water  Methane can be stored and later used to produce electricity  The resulting water is recycled  reducing the need for water  In the electrolysis stage  oxygen is stored for methane combustion in a pure oxygen environment at an adjacent power plant  eliminating nitrogen oxides 
Methane combustion produces carbon dioxide  CO   and water  The carbon dioxide can be recycled to boost the Sabatier process and water can be recycled for further electrolysis  Methane production  storage and combustion recycles the reaction products 
The CO  has economic value as a component of an energy storage vector  not a cost as in carbon capture and storage 

Power to liquid edit 
Power to liquid is similar to power to gas except that the hydrogen is converted into liquids such as methanol or ammonia  These are easier to handle than gases  and require fewer safety precautions than hydrogen  They can be used for transportation  including aircraft  but also for industrial purposes or in the power sector             

Biofuels edit 
Main article  Biofuel
Various biofuels such as biodiesel  vegetable oil  alcohol fuels  or biomass can replace fossil fuels  Various chemical processes can convert the carbon and hydrogen in coal  natural gas  plant and animal biomass and organic wastes into short hydrocarbons suitable as replacements for existing hydrocarbon fuels  Examples are Fischer Tropsch diesel  methanol  dimethyl ether and syngas  This diesel source was used extensively in World War II in Germany  which faced limited access to crude oil supplies  South Africa produces most of the country s diesel from coal for similar reasons              A long term oil price above US    bbl may make such large scale synthetic liquid fuels economical 

Aluminum edit 
Aluminum has been proposed as an energy store by a number of researchers  Its electrochemical equivalent       Ah cm   is nearly four times greater than that of lithium       Ah cm                Energy can be extracted from aluminum by reacting it with water to generate hydrogen              However  it must first be stripped of its natural oxide layer  a process which requires pulverization              chemical reactions with caustic substances  or alloys              The byproduct of the reaction to create hydrogen is aluminum oxide  which can be recycled into aluminum with the Hall H roult process  making the reaction theoretically renewable              If the Hall Heroult Process is run using solar or wind power  aluminum could be used to store the energy produced at higher efficiency than direct solar electrolysis             

Boron  silicon  and zinc edit 
Boron              silicon              and zinc             have been proposed as energy storage solutions 

Other chemical edit 
The organic compound norbornadiene      converts to quadricyclane upon exposure to light  storing solar energy as the energy of chemical bonds  A working system has been developed in Sweden as a molecular solar thermal system             

Electrical methods edit 
Capacitor edit 
Main article  capacitor
This mylar film  oil filled capacitor has very low inductance and low resistance  to provide the high power     megawatts  and the very high speed      microsecond  discharges needed to operate a dye laser 
A capacitor  originally known as a  condenser   is a passive two terminal electrical component used to store energy electrostatically  Practical capacitors vary widely  but all contain at least two electrical conductors  plates  separated by a dielectric  i e   insulator   A capacitor can store electric energy when disconnected from its charging circuit  so it can be used like a temporary battery  or like other types of rechargeable energy storage system              Capacitors are commonly used in electronic devices to maintain power supply while batteries change   This prevents loss of information in volatile memory   Conventional capacitors provide less than     joules per kilogram  while a conventional alkaline battery has a density of     kJ kg 
Capacitors store energy in an electrostatic field between their plates  Given a potential difference across the conductors  e g   when a capacitor is attached across a battery   an electric field develops across the dielectric  causing positive charge   Q  to collect on one plate and negative charge   Q  to collect on the other plate  If a battery is attached to a capacitor for a sufficient amount of time  no current can flow through the capacitor  However  if an accelerating or alternating voltage is applied across the leads of the capacitor  a displacement current can flow  Besides capacitor plates  charge can also be stored in a dielectric layer             
Capacitance is greater given a narrower separation between conductors and when the conductors have a larger surface area  In practice  the dielectric between the plates emits a small amount of leakage current and has an electric field strength limit  known as the breakdown voltage  However  the effect of recovery of a dielectric after a high voltage breakdown holds promise for a new generation of self healing capacitors                          The conductors and leads introduce undesired inductance and resistance 
Research is assessing the quantum effects of nanoscale capacitors             for digital quantum batteries                         

Superconducting magnetics edit 
Main article  Superconducting magnetic energy storage
Superconducting magnetic energy storage  SMES  systems store energy in a magnetic field created by the flow of direct current in a superconducting coil that has been cooled to a temperature below its superconducting critical temperature  A typical SMES system includes a superconducting coil  power conditioning system and refrigerator  Once the superconducting coil is charged  the current does not decay and the magnetic energy can be stored indefinitely             
The stored energy can be released to the network by discharging the coil  The associated inverter rectifier accounts for about      energy loss in each direction  SMES loses the least amount of electricity in the energy storage process compared to other methods of storing energy  SMES systems offer round trip efficiency greater than                 
Due to the energy requirements of refrigeration and the cost of superconducting wire  SMES is used for short duration storage such as improving power quality  It also has applications in grid balancing             

Applications edit 
Mills edit 
The classic application before the Industrial Revolution was the control of waterways to drive water mills for processing grain or powering machinery  Complex systems of reservoirs and dams were constructed to store and release water  and the potential energy it contained  when required             

Homes edit 
Main article  Home energy storage
Home energy storage is expected to become increasingly common given the growing importance of distributed generation of renewable energies  especially photovoltaics  and the important share of energy consumption in buildings              To exceed a self sufficiency of     in a household equipped with photovoltaics  energy storage is needed              Multiple manufacturers produce rechargeable battery systems for storing energy  generally to hold surplus energy from home solar or wind generation  Today  for home energy storage  Li ion batteries are preferable to lead acid ones given their similar cost but much better performance             
Tesla Motors produces two models of the Tesla Powerwall  One is a    kWh weekly cycle version for backup applications and the other is a   kWh version for daily cycle applications              In       a limited version of the Tesla Powerpack   cost      US  kWh to store electricity worth      cents kWh  US average grid price  making a positive return on investment doubtful unless electricity prices are higher than    cents kWh             
RoseWater Energy produces two models of the  Energy  amp  Storage System   the HUB                 and SB                Both versions provide      kWh of output  enabling it to run larger houses or light commercial premises  and protecting custom installations  The system provides five key elements into one system  including providing a clean         Hz Sine wave  zero transfer time  industrial grade surge protection  renewable energy grid sell back  optional   and battery backup                         
Enphase Energy announced an integrated system that allows home users to store  monitor and manage electricity  The system stores     kWh of energy and    W    W power output             
Storing wind or solar energy using thermal energy storage though less flexible  is considerably cheaper than batteries  A simple    gallon electric water heater can store roughly    kWh of energy for supplementing hot water or space heating             
For purely financial purposes in areas where net metering is available  home generated electricity may be sold to the grid through a grid tie inverter without the use of batteries for storage 

Grid electricity and power stations edit

Renewable energy edit 
 Construction of the Salt Tanks which provide efficient thermal energy storage             so that electricity can be generated after the sun goes down  and output can be scheduled to meet demand              The     MW Solana Generating Station is designed to provide six hours of storage  This allows the plant to generate about     of its rated capacity over the course of a year             
 The     MW Andasol solar power station in Spain is a parabolic trough solar thermal power plant that stores energy in tanks of molten salt so that it can continue generating electricity when the sun is not shining             
The largest source and the greatest store of renewable energy is provided by hydroelectric dams  A large reservoir behind a dam can store enough water to average the annual flow of a river between dry and wet seasons  and a very large reservoir can store enough water to average the flow of a river between dry and wet years  While a hydroelectric dam does not directly store energy from intermittent sources  it does balance the grid by lowering its output and retaining its water when power is generated by solar or wind  If wind or solar generation exceeds the region s hydroelectric capacity  then some additional source of energy is needed 
Many renewable energy sources  notably solar and wind  produce variable power              Storage systems can level out the imbalances between supply and demand that this causes  Electricity must be used as it is generated or converted immediately into storable forms              
The main method of electrical grid storage is pumped storage hydroelectricity  Areas of the world such as Norway  Wales  Japan and the US have used elevated geographic features for reservoirs  using electrically powered pumps to fill them  When needed  the water passes through generators and converts the gravitational potential of the falling water into electricity              Pumped storage in Norway  which gets almost all its electricity from hydro  has currently a capacity of     GW but since the total installed capacity is nearly    GW and     of that is regulable  it can be expanded significantly              
Some forms of storage that produce electricity include pumped storage hydroelectric dams  rechargeable batteries  thermal storage including molten salts which can efficiently store and release very large quantities of heat energy               and compressed air energy storage  flywheels  cryogenic systems and superconducting magnetic coils 
Surplus power can also be converted into methane  Sabatier process  with stockage in the natural gas network                           
In       the Bonneville Power Administration in the northwestern United States created an experimental program to absorb excess wind and hydro power generated at night or during stormy periods that are accompanied by high winds  Under central control  home appliances absorb surplus energy by heating ceramic bricks in special space heaters to hundreds of degrees and by boosting the temperature of modified hot water heater tanks  After charging  the appliances provide home heating and hot water as needed  The experimental system was created as a result of a severe      storm that overproduced renewable energy to the extent that all conventional power sources were shut down  or in the case of a nuclear power plant  reduced to its lowest possible operating level  leaving a large area running almost completely on renewable energy                           
Another advanced method used at the former Solar Two project in the United States and the Solar Tres Power Tower in Spain uses molten salt to store thermal energy captured from the sun and then convert it and dispatch it as electrical power  The system pumps molten salt through a tower or other special conduits to be heated by the sun  Insulated tanks store the solution  Electricity is produced by turning water to steam that is fed to turbines 
Since the early   st century batteries have been applied to utility scale load leveling and frequency regulation capabilities             
In vehicle to grid storage  electric vehicles that are plugged into the energy grid can deliver stored electrical energy from their batteries into the grid when needed 

Air conditioning edit 
Main article  Ice storage air conditioning
Thermal energy storage  TES  can be used for air conditioning               It is most widely used for cooling single large buildings and or groups of smaller buildings  Commercial air conditioning systems are the biggest contributors to peak electrical loads  In       thermal storage was used in over       buildings in over    countries  It works by chilling material at night and using the chilled material for cooling during the hotter daytime periods              
The most popular technique is ice storage  which requires less space than water and is cheaper than fuel cells or flywheels  In this application  a standard chiller runs at night to produce an ice pile  Water circulates through the pile during the day to chill water that would normally be the chiller s daytime output 
A partial storage system minimizes capital investment by running the chillers nearly    hours a day  At night  they produce ice for storage and during the day they chill water  Water circulating through the melting ice augments the production of chilled water  Such a system makes ice for    to    hours a day and melts ice for six hours a day  Capital expenditures are reduced because the chillers can be just           of the size needed for a conventional  no storage design  Storage sufficient to store half a day s available heat is usually adequate 
A full storage system shuts off the chillers during peak load hours  Capital costs are higher  as such a system requires larger chillers and a larger ice storage system 
This ice is produced when electrical utility rates are lower               Off peak cooling systems can lower energy costs  The U S  Green Building Council has developed the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design  LEED  program to encourage the design of reduced environmental impact buildings  Off peak cooling may help toward LEED Certification              
Thermal storage for heating is less common than for cooling  An example of thermal storage is storing solar heat to be used for heating at night 
Latent heat can also be stored in technical phase change materials  PCMs   These can be encapsulated in wall and ceiling panels  to moderate room temperatures 

Transport edit 
Liquid hydrocarbon fuels are the most commonly used forms of energy storage for use in transportation  followed by a growing use of Battery Electric Vehicles and Hybrid Electric Vehicles  Other energy carriers such as hydrogen can be used to avoid producing greenhouse gases 
Public transport systems like trams and trolleybuses require electricity  but due to their variability in movement  a steady supply of electricity via renewable energy is challenging  Photovoltaic systems installed on the roofs of buildings can be used to power public transportation systems during periods in which there is increased demand for electricity and access to other forms of energy are not readily available               Upcoming transitions in the transportation system also include e g  ferries and airplanes  where electric power supply is investigated as an interesting alternative              

Electronics edit 
Capacitors are widely used in electronic circuits for blocking direct current while allowing alternating current to pass  In analog filter networks  they smooth the output of power supplies  In resonant circuits they tune radios to particular frequencies  In electric power transmission systems they stabilize voltage and power flow              

Use cases edit 
Main article  United States Department of Energy International Energy Storage Database
The United States Department of Energy International Energy Storage Database  IESDB   is a free access database of energy storage projects and policies funded by the United States Department of Energy Office of Electricity and Sandia National Labs              

Capacity edit 
Storage capacity is the amount of energy extracted from an energy storage device or system  usually measured in joules or kilowatt hours and their multiples  it may be given in number of hours of electricity production at power plant nameplate capacity  when storage is of primary type  i e   thermal or pumped water   output is sourced only with the power plant embedded storage system                           

Economics edit 
The economics of energy storage strictly depends on the reserve service requested  and several uncertainty factors affect the profitability of energy storage  Therefore  not every storage method is technically and economically suitable for the storage of several MWh  and the optimal size of the energy storage is market and location dependent              
Moreover  ESS are affected by several risks  e g               

Techno economic risks  which are related to the specific technology 
Market risks  which are the factors that affect the electricity supply system 
Regulation and policy risks 
Therefore  traditional techniques based on deterministic Discounted Cash Flow  DCF  for the investment appraisal are not fully adequate to evaluate these risks and uncertainties and the investor s flexibility to deal with them  Hence  the literature recommends to assess the value of risks and uncertainties through the Real Option Analysis  ROA   which is a valuable method in uncertain contexts              
The economic valuation of large scale applications  including pumped hydro storage and compressed air  considers benefits including  curtailment avoidance  grid congestion avoidance  price arbitrage and carbon free energy delivery                                         In one technical assessment by the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Centre  economic goals could be met using batteries if their capital cost was     to     per kilowatt hour              
A metric of energy efficiency of storage is energy storage on energy invested  ESOI   which is the amount of energy that can be stored by a technology  divided by the amount of energy required to build that technology  The higher the ESOI  the better the storage technology is energetically  For lithium ion batteries this is around     and for lead acid batteries it is about    Other forms of storage such as pumped hydroelectric storage generally have higher ESOI  such as                  
Pumped storage hydroelectricity is by far the largest storage technology used globally               However  the usage of conventional pumped hydro storage is limited because it requires terrain with elevation differences and also has a very high land use for relatively small power               In locations without suitable natural geography  underground pumped hydro storage could also be used               High costs and limited life still make batteries a  weak substitute  for dispatchable power sources  and are unable to cover for variable renewable power gaps lasting for days  weeks or months  In grid models with high VRE share  the excessive cost of storage tends to dominate the costs of the whole grid   for example  in California alone     share of VRE would require     TWh of storage but      would require      TWh  As of      the state only had     GWh of storage  primarily in pumped storage and a small fraction in batteries  According to another study  supplying     of US demand from VRE would require a smart grid covering the whole country or battery storage capable to supply the whole system for    hours  both at cost estimated at      trillion                            Similarly  several studies have found that relying only on VRE and energy storage would cost about        more than a comparable system that combines VRE with nuclear plants or plants with carbon capture and storage instead of energy storage                           

Research edit 
Germany edit 
In       the German government allocated     M  approximately US    M  for research  and another    M to subsidize battery storage in residential rooftop solar panels  according to a representative of the German Energy Storage Association              
Siemens AG commissioned a production research plant to open in      at the Zentrum f r Sonnenenergie und Wasserstoff  ZSW  the German Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research in the State of Baden W rttemberg   a university industry collaboration in Stuttgart  Ulm and Widderstall  staffed by approximately     scientists  researchers  engineers  and technicians  The plant develops new near production manufacturing materials and processes  NPMM amp P  using a computerized Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition  SCADA  system  It aims to enable the expansion of rechargeable battery production with increased quality and lower cost                           
From      onwards  a new project by the German Research Foundation focuses on molecular photoswitches to store solar thermal energy  The spokesperson of these so called molecular solar thermal  MOST  systems is Prof  Dr  Hermann A  Wegner              

United States edit 
In       research and test centers opened to evaluate energy storage technologies  Among them was the Advanced Systems Test Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin at Madison in Wisconsin State  which partnered with battery manufacturer Johnson Controls               The laboratory was created as part of the university s newly opened Wisconsin Energy Institute  Their goals include the evaluation of state of the art and next generation electric vehicle batteries  including their use as grid supplements              
The State of New York unveiled its New York Battery and Energy Storage Technology  NY BEST  Test and Commercialization Center at Eastman Business Park in Rochester  New York  at a cost of          million for its almost            m  laboratory  The center includes the Center for Future Energy Systems  a collaboration between Cornell University of Ithaca  New York and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy  New York  NY BEST tests  validates and independently certifies diverse forms of energy storage intended for commercial use              
On September           Senators Al Franken of Minnesota and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico introduced Advancing Grid Storage Act  AGSA   which would devote more than    billion in research  technical assistance and grants to encourage energy storage in the United States              
In grid models with high VRE share  the excessive cost of storage tends to dominate the costs of the whole grid   for example  in California alone     share of VRE would require     TWh of storage but      would require      TWh  According to another study  supplying     of US demand from VRE would require a smart grid covering the whole country or battery storage capable to supply the whole system for    hours  both at cost estimated at      trillion                           

United Kingdom edit 
In the United Kingdom  some    industry and government agencies allied with seven British universities in May      to create the SUPERGEN Energy Storage Hub in order to assist in the coordination of energy storage technology research and development
