							CAIRO  The past several years have seen a steady outflow of Cairo       s families to spacious villas in new satellite cities  and with the recent move of several major public and private sector operations to New Cairo  it is clear that the city       s suburbs are now the place to be for business as well  
Egyptian and foreign contractors have jumped in to provide ample supply for the seemingly endless demand  
With this year       s Euromoney Conference underway  the time has come to take stock of Cairo       s booming real estate business and ask the perennial question  how long can this go on  
       What we are seeing in Cairo       s real estate today is the result of the fact that demand is still higher than supply for property  and so prices for land and construction have not had the chance to peak and stabilize as they have in cities like Dubai   said Nermine El Shoukry  property consultant at SODIC  While the continuing boom  even in the face of a major world financial crisis  may be a simple product of supply and demand economics  there are plenty of other factors working both for and against the industry at present 
First  there is the question of the rising costs and inflation that have been plaguing Egypt       s economy of late  Indeed  according to the Euromoney Conference website  inflation and sustaining high growth are the major obstacles facing the Egyptian economy  real estate sector included  
According to Hala Bassiouni  managing director of Egyptian Finance Housing Company  a second phenomenon that is negatively impacting Cairo       s real estate market is the mismatch between what consumers are demanding and what contractors are building  
       Construction companies overestimated the demand for high priced villas and built too many before realizing that most of the demand nowadays for property in New Cairo is coming from middle class families looking for reasonably priced apartments or townhouses  Now they are going to have to readjust their plans so they don       t get stuck with high priced units that no one wants to buy   she said  
On the other hand  the increasing involvement of banks in the mortgage industry has allowed more Egyptians to purchase their own homes 
Investment Minister Mahmoud Mohieldin stated recently that growth of the Egyptian banking sector has directly contributed to Cairo       s real estate boom  a trend that should continue if mortgage rates remain stable  
Bassiouni  whose company has helped to pioneer Egypt       s mortgage industry  emphasized the importance of the country       s growing mortgage market  
       The development of mortgage finance is crucial  as it will allow the real estate industry to continue to flourish and also provide a viable way for people to become homeowners  
But what about the current financial crisis  
Oddly  it hasn       t seemed to impact the real estate market       s vitality  and may even be helping it thrive  In a country where many people prefer concrete investment overstock market speculation  current problems have helped to reinforce the cultural preference for fixed assets  
       It seems counterintuitive  but actually when the stock market goes down and people lose money  they are eager for a stable investment and for many people this means buying real estate  So the industry has not been negatively impacted at all  except in terms of people       s purchasing power   observed El Shoukry  
Bassiouni added that in Egypt  where people often prefer fixed assets  the potential for a market crash is much less than in the United States or Europe  In Egypt  rather than crash  markets will        hibernate  for a certain period before picking up and stabilizing when conditions improve  
While real estate speculators will be hit hard in such a situation  normal homeowners will not experience a crisis due to stagnant real estate prices during a recession  At the same time  new investors continue to enter Cairo       s market to take advantage of rising prices and stable demand  
As to the question of whether the current real estate boom is sustainable  experts agree that prices cannot keep going up indefinitely  
       Eventually prices will peak and stabilize as supply adjusts to demand  This doesn       t mean that people won       t keep buying         because they will         just that prices cannot increase forever   said Bassiouni  
Shoukry agreed  emphasizing the cyclical nature of real estate markets all over the world         Every country has its cycle and prices are constantly rising  dropping  and restabilizing  Egypt is no different   she said  
With cultural investment principles and an expanding banking sector bolstering the expansion of the real estate market in Egypt  it seems that purchasing property in New Cairo should be a good investment for many years to come  And while price increases and rampant inflation top the agenda  Cairo       s booming real estate market seems prepared to remain healthy for the foreseeable future
