Hugging Face  Inc  is a French American company based in New York City that develops computation tools for building applications using machine learning  It is most notable for its transformers library built for natural language processing applications and its platform that allows users to share machine learning models and datasets and showcase their work 


History edit 
The company was founded in      by French entrepreneurs Cl ment Delangue  Julien Chaumond  and Thomas Wolf in New York City  originally as a company that developed a chatbot app targeted at teenagers             The company was named after the U  F     x     x f     HUGGING FACE emoji             After open sourcing the model behind the chatbot  the company pivoted to focus on being a platform for machine learning 
In March       Hugging Face raised US    million in a Series B funding round            
On April           the company launched the BigScience Research Workshop in collaboration with several other research groups to release an open large language model             In       the workshop concluded with the announcement of BLOOM  a multilingual large language model with     billion parameters                       
In December       the company acquired Gradio  an open source library built for developing machine learning applications in Python            
On May          the company announced its Series C funding round led by Coatue and Sequoia             The company received a    billion valuation 
On August          the company announced the Private Hub  an enterprise version of its public Hugging Face Hub that supports SaaS or on premises deployment            
In February       the company announced partnership with Amazon Web Services  AWS  which would allow Hugging Face s products available to AWS customers to use them as the building blocks for their custom applications  The company also said the next generation of BLOOM will be run on Trainium  a proprietary machine learning chip created by AWS                                    
In August       the company announced that it raised      million in a Series D funding  at a      billion valuation  The funding was led by Salesforce   and notable participation came from Google  Amazon  Nvidia  AMD  Intel  IBM  and Qualcomm             
In June       the company announced  along with Meta and Scaleway  their launch of a new AI accelerator program for European startups  This initiative aims to help startups integrate open foundation models into their products  accelerating the EU AI ecosystem  The program  based at STATION F in Paris  will run from September      to February       Selected startups will receive mentoring  access to AI models and tools  and Scaleway s computing power             
On September           to further the International Decade of Indigenous Languages  Hugging Face teamed up with Meta and UNESCO to launch a new online language translator              built on Meta s No Language Left Behind open source AI model  enabling free text translation across     languages  including many low resource languages             
On April       Hugging Face announced that they acquired a humanoid robotics startup  Pollen Robotics  Pollen Robotics is a France based Robotics Startup founded by Matthieu Lapeyre and Pierre Rouanet in                               In an X tweet  Clement Delangue   CEO of Hugging Face  share his vision to make Artificial Intelligence robotics Open Source             

Services and technologies edit 
Transformers Library edit 
The Transformers library is a Python package that contains open source implementations of transformer models for text  image  and audio tasks  It is compatible with the PyTorch  TensorFlow and JAX deep learning libraries and includes implementations of notable models like BERT and GPT                The library was originally called  pytorch pretrained bert              which was then renamed to  pytorch transformers  and finally  transformers  
A javascript version  transformers js              has also been developed  allowing models to run directly in the browser through ONNX runtime 

Hugging Face Hub edit 
The Hugging Face Hub is a platform  centralized web service  for hosting             

Git based code repositories  including discussions and pull requests for projects 
models  also with Git based version control 
datasets  mainly in text  images  and audio 
web applications   spaces  and  widgets    intended for small scale demos of machine learning applications 
There are numerous pre trained models that support common tasks in different modalities  such as 

Natural Language Processing  text classification  named entity recognition  question answering  language modeling  summarization  translation  multiple choice  and text generation 
Computer Vision  image classification  object detection  and segmentation 
Audio  automatic speech recognition and audio classification 
Other libraries edit 
Gradio UI Example
In addition to Transformers and the Hugging Face Hub  the Hugging Face ecosystem contains libraries for other tasks  such as dataset processing   Datasets    model evaluation   Evaluate    and machine learning demos   Gradio               

Safetensors edit 
The safetensors format was developed around      to solve problems with the pickle format in python  It was designed for saving and loading tensors  Compared to pickle format  it allows lazy loading  and avoids security problems              After a security audit  it became the default format in                  
The file format 

size of the header    bytes  an unsigned little endian    bit integer 
header  JSON UTF   string  formatted as   TENSOR NAME     dtype    F      shape                  data offsets    BEGIN  END     NEXT TENSOR NAME           
file  a byte buffer containing the tensors
