							Egypt s Minister of Environment  Yasmine Fouad  has called for greater international support to help developing countries meet their climate goals  during her participation in the high level  Mission     Roadmap  ministerial dialogue  held as part of the Copenhagen Climate Ministerial in Denmark from     May 
The event  attended by ministers and climate leaders from around the world  focused on leveraging Nationally Determined Contributions  NDCs  as drivers of long term development planning  Fouad highlighted the Mission     Roadmap as a collective initiative of the COP Presidencies Troika   comprising the United Arab Emirates  COP     Azerbaijan  COP     and Brazil  COP      aimed at preserving the     C global warming threshold and accelerating climate action this decade through a new round of enhanced NDCs 
Fouad stressed that the dialogue offered a platform to share experiences and lessons in developing and implementing ambitious NDCs  which she described as critical tools for integrating climate objectives with broader development goals  She emphasized the importance of scaling up international support and aligning NDCs with both the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals  SDGs  
Warning that many developing nations remain unable to meet their climate pledges due to limited financial and technical assistance  Fouad underscored that COP   must build on the progress achieved at COP   in Dubai and the upcoming COP   in Baku  Key priorities  she said  include supporting energy transitions and expanding access to climate finance 
She called for the full activation of Article     of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and Article     of the Paris Agreement  which mandate developed nations to provide the necessary means of implementation for developing countries  The ongoing lack of adequate funding  she noted  remains a major barrier to ambitious climate action in the Global South 
Turning to Egypt s national efforts  Fouad explained that the country has integrated its climate and development strategies through policy frameworks that align NDCs with Egypt s Vision       While these frameworks are tailored to Egypt s specific socio economic and environmental challenges  she stressed that their success depends heavily on international financial support 
She estimated Egypt requires approximately     bn in conditional finance for mitigation and    bn for adaptation  Without sufficient funding  she warned  the country s ability to increase its climate ambition in the next round of NDCs will be significantly constrained 
Fouad also noted that Egypt is preparing its second generation NDCs  with a focus on three key sectors responsible for roughly half of national emissions  She cited notable progress in policy reforms aimed at achieving      mitigation targets  and said Egypt plans to introduce a sub target for clean energy   including nuclear energy  carbon capture and storage  and low carbon hydrogen production 
On adaptation  Fouad outlined current NDC goals focused on water and irrigation management  crop resilience  and coastal protection  She said Egypt is now working to expand these targets to address biodiversity  which faces increasing risks from climate change
