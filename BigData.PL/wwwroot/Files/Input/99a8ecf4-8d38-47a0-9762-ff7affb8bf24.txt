							Scientists at the University of Science and Technology of China  USTC  have developed a biomimetic hand prosthesis capable of performing complex movements  including sign language  using scissors  operating a smartphone  and combing hair 
According to China Daily  a partner of TV BRICS  the prosthesis       s key feature is its high degree of mobility  Weighing     grams  lighter than a human hand  the device possesses    active degrees of freedom  representing the range of movements the artificial limb can perform  Shape memory alloys are incorporated into its construction  enabling the hand to move in a natural manner 
The device is also equipped with    sensors for precise control and supports voice commands in    languages with high recognition accuracy 
A    year old patient mastered the prosthesis within a few hours during trials and successfully completed functional hand tests 
The scientists involved in the development said this advancement opens new possibilities in prosthetics and robotics  medicine  and industry  The device could be used in complex environments  including nuclear facility maintenance  deep sea operations  and high precision manufacturing processes
