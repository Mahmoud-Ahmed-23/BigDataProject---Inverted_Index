Irving John Good    December          April                            
was a British mathematician who worked as a cryptologist at Bletchley Park with Alan Turing  After the Second World War  Good continued to work with Turing on the design of computers and Bayesian statistics at the University of Manchester  Good moved to the United States where he was a professor at Virginia Tech 
He was born Isadore Jacob Gudak to a Polish Jewish family in London  He later anglicised his name to Irving John Good and signed his publications  I  J  Good  
An originator of the concept known as the intelligence explosion  Good served as consultant on supercomputers to Stanley Kubrick  director of the      film       A Space Odyssey            


Life edit 
Good was born Isadore Jacob Gudak to Polish Jewish parents in London  His father was a watchmaker  who later managed and owned a successful fashionable jewellery shop  and was also a notable Yiddish writer writing under the pen name of Moshe Oved  Good was educated at the Haberdashers  Aske s Boys  School  at the time in Hampstead in northwest London  where  according to Dan van der Vat  Good effortlessly outpaced the mathematics curriculum            
Good studied mathematics at Jesus College  Cambridge  graduating in      and winning the Smith s Prize in                  He did research under G  H  Hardy and Abram Besicovitch before moving to Bletchley Park in      on completing his doctorate 

Bletchley Park edit 
On    May       having just obtained his doctorate at Cambridge  Good walked into Hut    Bletchley s facility for breaking German naval ciphers  for his first shift  This was the day that Britain s Royal Navy destroyed the German battleship      Bismarck after it had sunk the Royal Navy s HMS      Hood  Bletchley had contributed to Bismarck     s destruction by discovering  through wireless traffic analysis  that the German flagship was sailing for Brest  France  rather than Wilhelmshaven  from which she had set out            
Hut   had not  however  been able to decrypt on a current basis the    German Naval Enigma messages that had been sent to Bismarck  The German Navy s Enigma cyphers were considerably more secure than those of the German Army or Air Force  which had been well penetrated by       Naval messages were taking three to seven days to decrypt  which usually made them operationally useless for the British  This was about to change  however  with Good s help            

Alan Turing    had caught Good sleeping on the floor while on duty during his first night shift  At first  Turing thought Good was ill  but he was cross when Good explained that he was just taking a short nap because he was tired  For days afterwards  Turing would not deign to speak to Good  and he left the room if Good walked in  The new recruit only won Turing s respect after he solved the bigram tables problem  During a subsequent night shift  when there was no more work to be done  it dawned on Good that there might be another chink in the German indicating system  The German telegraphists had to add dummy letters to the trigrams which they selected out of the Kenngruppenbuch    Good wondered if their choice of dummy letters was random  or whether there was a bias towards particular letters  After inspecting some messages which had been broken  he discovered that there was a tendency to use some letters more than others  That being the case  all the codebreakers had to do  was to work back from the indicators given at the beginning of each message  and apply each bigram table in turn in the same way as Joan Clarke had done before  The bigram table which produced one of the popular dummy letters was probably the correct one  When Good mentioned his discovery to Alan Turing  Turing was very embarrassed  and said   I could have sworn that I tried that   It quickly became an important part of the Banburismus procedure 
Jack Good s refusal to go on working when tired was vindicated by a subsequent incident  During another long night shift  he had been baffled by his failure to break a doubly enciphered Offizier message  This was one of the messages which was supposed to be enciphered initially with the Enigma set up in accordance with the Offizier settings  and subsequently with the general Enigma settings in place  However  while he was sleeping before returning for another shift  he dreamed that the order had been reversed  the general settings had been applied before the Offizier settings  Next day he found that the message had yet to be read  so he applied the theory which had come to him during the night  It worked  he had broken the code in his sleep            
Good served with Turing for nearly two years             Subsequently  he worked with Donald Michie in Max Newman s group on the Fish ciphers  leading to the development of the Colossus computer            
Good was a member of the Bletchley Chess Club which defeated the Oxford University Chess Club     in a twelve board team match held on   December       Good played fourth board for Bletchley Park  with Conel Hugh O Donel Alexander  Harry Golombek and James Macrae Aitken in the top three spots             He won his game against Sir Robert Robinson            

Postwar work edit 
In       Newman invited Good to join him and Turing at Manchester University  There  for three years  Good lectured in mathematics and researched computers  including the Manchester Mark              
In       Good was recruited back to the Government Communications Headquarters  GCHQ   He remained there until       while also taking up a brief associate professorship at Princeton University and a short consultancy with IBM            
From      until he moved to the US in       Good held government funded positions and from      a senior research fellowship at Trinity College  Oxford  and the Atlas Computer Laboratory  where he continued his interests in computing  statistics and chess             He later left Oxford  declaring it  a little stiff  

United States edit 
In       Good moved to the United States  where he was appointed a research professor of statistics at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University  In       he was appointed a University Distinguished Professor at Virginia Tech  and in      Emeritus University Distinguished Professor            
In       he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association             
He later said about his arrival in Virginia  from Britain  in      to start teaching at VPI  where he taught from      to      

I arrived in Blacksburg in the seventh hour of the seventh day of the seventh month of the year seven in the seventh decade  and I was put in Apartment   of Block     all by chance             
Research and publications edit 
Good s published work ran to over three million words            
He was known for his work on Bayesian statistics  Kass and Raftery             credit Good  and in turn Turing  with coining the term Bayes factor  Good published a number of books on probability theory  In       he published an early version of what later became known as the fast Fourier transform             but it did not become widely known  He played chess to county standard and helped popularise Go  an Asian boardgame  through a      article in New Scientist  he had learned the rules from Alan Turing               In       he originated the concept now known as  intelligence explosion  or the  technological singularity   which anticipates the eventual advent of superhuman intelligence 

Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever  Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities  an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines  there would then unquestionably be an  intelligence explosion   and the intelligence of man would be left far behind    Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make  provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control  It is curious that this point is made so seldom outside of science fiction  It is sometimes worthwhile to take science fiction seriously                         
Good s authorship of treatises such as his       Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine              and  Logic of Man and Machine              made him the obvious person for Stanley Kubrick to consult when filming       A Space Odyssey         one of whose principal characters was the paranoid HAL      supercomputer             In       Good was elected a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences             Graphcore s proposed foundation model     m computer  that uses Human Centered Artificial Intelligence  which will have the potential capacity of running programs with    trn parameters  was named to honor Good s intellectual heritage                  Notes                    According to The Economist  Graphcore aims to take the  first step  towards creating I  J  Good s imagined  Ultraintelligent Machine              
According to his assistant  Leslie Pendleton  in      Good wrote in an unpublished autobiographical statement that he suspected an ultraintelligent machine would lead to the extinction of man             

Personality edit 
Good published a paper under the names IJ Good and  K Caj Doog  the latter  his own nickname spelled backwards  In a      paper              he introduced its subject by saying   Many people have contributed to this topic but I shall mainly review the writings of I  J  Good because I have read them all carefully   In Virginia he chose  as his vanity licence plate      IJG   in subtle reference to his Second World War intelligence work            
Good never married              After going through ten assistants in his first thirteen years at Virginia Tech  he hired Leslie Pendleton  who proved up to the task of managing his quirks  He wanted to marry her  but she refused  Although there was speculation  they were never more than friends  but she was his assistant  companion  and friend for the rest of his life             

Death edit 
Good died on   April      of natural causes in Radford  Virginia  aged
