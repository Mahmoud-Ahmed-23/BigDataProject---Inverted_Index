							Does Religion Freeze the Mind  May be 
Avoiding metaphorical interpretation of religious texts  whenever possible  has a direct impact on the mindset of societies  It creates the very differences between communities that we witness today  The accumulation of intellectual rigidity over centuries leaves a strange and profound imprint on every aspect of life  Added to this is the phenomenon of mental dependence  the overwhelming desire of some to surrender their minds to other human beings to decide for them what is permitted and what is forbidden  often through a  fatwa   thus shutting down the sources of thought and creativity  And then  with innocent surprise  we ask  why does the West always outperform us in every creative or artistic field  Why do they build a great civilization while we live on its margins  struggling to integrate even when we try 
 nbsp 
Metaphor is not merely a linguistic luxury  it is a rhetorical and cognitive tool for understanding the unseen  for translating the abstract into the tangible  Linguistically  majaz  metaphor  means transgression or exceeding literal meaning  Technically  it refers to using a word to signify something other than its literal meaning  something indirectly related  It is one of the most widely used and effective rhetorical devices to convey meaning  It comes in two main types  linguistic metaphor  where a word is used beyond its original designation  as in calling a brave man a lion   and logical metaphor  where actions are attributed metaphorically  as in saying  the doctor healed the patient   though healing ultimately comes from God  
 nbsp 
Among the Hadiths  we find examples that deserve reflection  One says 
 nbsp 
 Whoever says Subhan Allah wa bihamdihi one hundred times in the morning and evening  their sins will be forgiven even if they are more than the foam of the sea  
Another Hadith promises 
 For every utterance of Subhan Allah  Alhamdulillah  La ilaha illa Allah  Allahu Akbar  a tree is planted for the person in Paradise  
 What is the purpose of trees in Paradise  Will each of us have a farm  Will we sit under their shade  Is there even a sun in Paradise  And if so  does it burn  
In another narration 
 Whoever says Subhan Allah al  Azim wa bihamdihi  a date palm is planted for him in Paradise  
Another Hadith states 
 Whoever recites Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad ten times  Allah builds for him a house in Paradise  
 So now we have a house  a palm tree  and trees  
 nbsp 
According to yet another Hadith  reciting one hundred praises can bring a thousand good deeds and erase a thousand sins  Reciting the  marketplace supplication  supposedly brings  a million good deeds   erases  a million sins   raises us  a million ranks   and even grants another house in Paradise  not the first one   Furthermore 
 nbsp 
 Whoever prays twelve voluntary rak ahs in a day and night  a house will be built for him in Paradise  
 That s a third house  
If these Hadiths are authentic  how should they be interpreted  Literally or metaphorically 
Taking them literally turns religion into a set of magical incantations for reward  interpreting them metaphorically restores meaning while shedding the cloak of superstition 
 nbsp 
Literalism makes religion feel like a mechanical equation  utter the words  receive the reward  like pressing buttons on a machine  But when we engage with these texts symbolically  they move us from speech to behavior  from remembrance to action  Then religion regains its soul  and worship reclaims its depth 
 nbsp 
In reality  all religions regard reverence for God as a path to personal salvation  In general  whenever human beings feel a deep need  both science and superstition compete to fulfill it  The one that prevails is whichever aligns with the character of the people  The real crisis occurs when the boundaries between science and sorcery  and between religion and myth  begin to blur 
 nbsp 
Creativity is the liberation of the mind from constraints that force it down predetermined paths  often driven by social forces  The first step toward freedom is escaping literal  non metaphorical thinking  Otherwise  we will forever live inside myths that obstruct thought  until we find ourselves as museum exhibits  examined by others who ask  How did they end up like this 
 nbsp 
Religion neither freezes the mind  nor empowers it  nor disables it 
The truth is  some people simply love laziness and dependency  and seek in religion a convenient excuse to hang their poor habits upon
