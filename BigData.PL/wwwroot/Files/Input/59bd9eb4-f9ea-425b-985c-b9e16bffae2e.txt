A strategy game or strategic game is a game in which the players  uncoerced  and often autonomous  decision making skills have a high significance in determining the outcome  Almost all strategy games require internal decision tree style thinking  and typically very high situational awareness 
Strategy games are also seen as a descendant of war games  and define strategy in terms of the context of war  but this is more partial  A strategy game is a game that relies primarily on strategy  and when it comes to defining what strategy is  two factors need to be taken into account  its complexity and game scale actions  such as each placement in the Total War video game series  The definition of a strategy game in its cultural context should be any game that belongs to a tradition that goes back to war games  contains more strategy than the average video game  contains certain gameplay conventions  and is represented by a particular community  Although war is dominant in strategy games  it is not the whole story            


History edit 
The history of turn based strategy games goes back to the times of ancient civilizations found in places such as Rome  Greece  Egypt  the Levant  and India  Many were played widely through their regions of origin  but only some are still played today            
According to Thierry Depaulis  oldest strategy games would be the  Greek game of polis          which appears in the literature around     BCE  and the more or less contemporary Chinese game of weiqi   go    which  under the name of yi      is mentioned in Confucius s Analects  Lunyu  compiled between ca        and     BCE             
The Royal Game of Ur from c       BCE which often been called one of the oldest board games  likely had some strategy elements as well  although it is generally seen as a luck based race game                       
One of the earliest strategy games still played is mancala             Due to claims that some artifacts from c       BCE might be old mancala boards  it has been suggested that mancala may be the oldest known strategy game  but this claim has been disputed            
Another game that has stood the test of time is chess  believed to have originated in India around the sixth century CE             The game spread to the west by trade  but chess gained social status and permanence more strongly than many other games  Chess became a game of skill and tactics often forcing the players to think two or three moves ahead of their opponent just to keep up            

Types edit 
Abstract strategy edit 
Main article  Abstract strategy game
In abstract strategy games  the game is only loosely tied to a thematic concept  if at all  The rules do not attempt to simulate reality  but rather serve the internal logic of the game 
A purist s definition of an abstract strategy game requires that it cannot have random elements or hidden information  This definition includes such games as chess and Go  However  many games are commonly classed as abstract strategy games which do not meet these criteria  games such as backgammon  Octiles  Can t Stop  Sequence and Mentalis have all been described as  abstract strategy  games despite having a chance element      citation needed      A smaller category of non perfect abstract strategy games incorporate hidden information without using any random elements  for example  Stratego 

Team strategy edit 
One of the most focused team strategy games is contract bridge  This card game consists of two teams of two players  whose offensive and defensive skills are continually in flux as the game s dynamic progresses  Some argue that the benefits of playing this team strategy card game extend to those skills and strategies used in business            and that the playing of these games helps to automate strategic awareness 

Eurogames edit 
Main article  Eurogame
Eurogames  or German style boardgames  are a relatively new genre that sit between abstract strategy games and simulation games  They generally have simple rules  short to medium playing times  indirect player interaction and abstract physical components  The games emphasize strategy  play down chance and conflict  lean towards economic rather than military themes  and usually keep all the players in the game until it ends 

Simulation edit 
This type of game is an attempt to simulate the decisions and processes inherent to some real world situation  Most of the rules are chosen to reflect what the real world consequences would be of each player s actions and decisions  
Abstract games cannot be completely divided from simulations and so games can be thought of as existing on a continuum of almost pure abstraction  like Abalone  to almost pure simulation  like Diceball  or Strat o Matic Baseball  

Wargame edit 
Main article  Wargaming
A German military wargame from     
Wargames are simulations of military battles  campaigns  or entire wars  Players will have to consider situations that are analogous to the situations faced by leaders of historical battles  As such  wargames are usually heavy on simulation elements  and while they are all  strategy games   they can also be  strategic  or  tactical  in the military jargon sense  Its creator  H  G  Wells  stated how  much better is this amiable miniature  war  than the real thing             
Traditionally  wargames have been played either with miniatures  using physical models of detailed terrain and miniature representations of people and equipment to depict the game state  or on a board  which commonly uses cardboard counters on a hex map 
Popular miniature wargames include Warhammer        or its fantasy counterpart Warhammer Fantasy  Popular strategic board wargames include Risk  Axis and Allies  Diplomacy  and Paths of Glory  Advanced Squad Leader is a successful tactical scale wargame 
It is instructive to compare the Total War series to the Civilization series  where moving troops to a specific tile is a tactic because there are no short range decisions  But in Empire  Total War         every encounter between two armies activates a real time mode in which they must fight and the same movement of troops is treated as a strategy  Throughout the game  the movement of each army is at a macro scale  because the player can control each battle at a micro scale  However  as an experience  the two types of military operations are quite similar and involve similar skills and thought processes  The concept of micro scale and macro scale can well describe the gameplay of a game  however  even very similar games can be difficult to integrate into a common vocabulary  In this definition  strategy does not explicitly describe the player s experience  it is more appropriate to describe different formal game components  The similarity of the actions taken in two different games does not affect our definition of them as strategy or tactics  we will only rely on their scale in their respective games            

Strategy video games edit 
Main article  Strategy video game
Strategy video games are categorized based on whether they offer the continuous gameplay of real time strategy  RTS   or the discrete phases of turn based strategy  TBS               Often the computer is expected to emulate a strategically thinking  side  similar to that of a human player  such as directing armies and constructing buildings   or emulate the  instinctive  actions of individual units that would be too tedious for a player to administer  such as for a peasant to run away when attacked  as opposed to standing still until otherwise ordered by the player   hence there is an emphasis on artificial intelligence
