Human brain organoid
Organoid intelligence  OI  action plan and research trajectories
Organoid intelligence  OI  is an emerging field of study in computer science and biology that develops and studies biological wetware computing using  D cultures of human brain cells  or brain organoids  and brain machine interface technologies             Such technologies may be referred to as OIs 
Oragnoid intelligent computer systems can be an example of biohybrid systems 


Differences with non organic computing edit 
As opposed to traditional non organic silicon based approaches  OI seeks to use lab grown cerebral organoids to serve as  biological hardware   Scientists hope that such organoids can provide faster  more efficient  and more powerful computing power than regular silicon based computing and AI while requiring only a fraction of the energy  However  while these structures are still far from being able to think like a regular human brain and do not yet possess strong computing capabilities  OI research currently offers the potential to improve the understanding of brain development  learning and memory  potentially finding treatments for neurological disorders such as dementia            
Thomas Hartung             a professor from Johns Hopkins University  argues that  while silicon based computers are certainly better with numbers  brains are better at learning   Furthermore  he claimed that with  superior learning and storing  capabilities than AIs  being more energy efficient  and that in the future  it might not be possible to add more transistors to a single computer chip  while brains are wired differently and have more potential for storage and computing power  OIs can potentially harness more power than current computers            
Some researchers claim that even though human brains are slower than machines at processing simple information  they are far better at processing complex information as brains can deal with fewer and more uncertain data  perform both sequential and parallel processing  being highly heterogenous  use incomplete datasets  and is said to outperform non organic machines in decision making            
Training OIs involve the process of biological learning  BL  as opposed to machine learning  ML  for AIs  BL is said to be much more energy efficient than ML            

Bioinformatics in OI edit 
OI generates complex biological data  necessitating sophisticated methods for processing and analysis             Bioinformatics provides the tools and techniques to decipher raw data  uncovering the patterns and insights  A Python interface is currently available for processing and interaction with brain organoids             

Intended functions edit 
Brain inspired computing hardware aims to emulate the structure and working principles of the brain and could be used to address current limitations in artificial intelligence technologies  However  brain inspired silicon chips are still limited in their ability to fully mimic brain function  as most examples are built on digital electronic principles  One study performed OI computation  which they termed Brainoware  by sending and receiving information from the brain organoid using a high density multielectrode array  By applying spatiotemporal electrical stimulation  nonlinear dynamics  and fading memory properties  as well as unsupervised learning from training data by reshaping the organoid functional connectivity  the study showed the potential of this technology by using it for speech recognition and nonlinear equation prediction in a reservoir computing framework            

Ethical concerns edit 
While researchers are hoping to use OI and biological computing to complement traditional silicon based computing  there are also questions about the ethics of such an approach  Examples of such ethical issues include OIs gaining consciousness and sentience as organoids and the question of the relationship between a stem cell donor  for growing the organoid  and the respective OI system            
Enforced amnesia and limits on duration of operation without memory reset have been proposed as a way to mitigate the potential risk of silent suffering in brain organoids
