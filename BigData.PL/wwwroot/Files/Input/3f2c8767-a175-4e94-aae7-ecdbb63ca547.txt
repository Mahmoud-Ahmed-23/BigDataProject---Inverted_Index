Machine learning model


A video generated using OpenAI s Sora text to video model  using the prompt  A stylish woman walks down a Tokyo street filled with warm glowing neon and animated city signage  She wears a black leather jacket  a long red dress  and black boots  and carries a black purse  She wears sunglasses and red lipstick  She walks confidently and casually  The street is damp and reflective  creating a mirror effect of the colorful lights  Many pedestrians walk about 
A text to video model is a machine learning model that uses a natural language description as input to produce a video relevant to the input text             Advancements during the     s in the generation of high quality  text conditioned videos have largely been driven by the development of video diffusion models

There are different models  including open source models  Chinese language input            CogVideo is the earliest text to video model  of     billion parameters  to be developed  with its demo version of open source codes first presented on GitHub in                  That year  Meta Platforms released a partial text to video model called  Make A Video                                    and Google s Brain  later Google DeepMind  introduced Imagen Video  a text to video model with  D U Net                                                           
In March       a research paper titled  VideoFusion  Decomposed Diffusion Models for High Quality Video Generation  was published  presenting a novel approach to video generation              The VideoFusion model decomposes the diffusion process into two components  base noise and residual noise  which are shared across frames to ensure temporal coherence  By utilizing a pre trained image diffusion model as a base generator  the model efficiently generated high quality and coherent videos  Fine tuning the pre trained model on video data addressed the domain gap between image and video data  enhancing the model s ability to produce realistic and consistent video sequences              In the same month  Adobe introduced Firefly AI as part of its features             
In January       Google announced development of a text to video model named Lumiere which is anticipated to integrate advanced video editing capabilities              Matthias Niessner and Lourdes Agapito at AI company Synthesia work on developing  D neural rendering techniques that can synthesise realistic video by using  D and  D neural representations of shape  appearances  and motion for controllable video synthesis of avatars              In June       Luma Labs launched its Dream Machine video tool                          That same month              Kuaishou extended its Kling AI text to video model to international users  In July       TikTok owner ByteDance released Jimeng AI in China  through its subsidiary  Faceu Technology              By September       the Chinese AI company MiniMax debuted its video    model  joining other established AI model companies like Zhipu AI  Baichuan  and Moonshot AI  which contribute to China s involvement in AI technology             
Alternative approaches to text to video models include             Google s Phenaki  Hour One  Colossyan             Runway s Gen   Alpha                          and OpenAI s  Sora                           Several additional text to video models  such as Plug and Play  Text LIVE  and TuneAVideo  have emerged              Google is also preparing to launch a video generation tool named Veo for YouTube Shorts in                   FLUX   developer Black Forest Labs has announced its text to video model SOTA             

Architecture and training edit 
There are several architectures that have been used to create Text to Video models  Similar to Text to Image models  these models can be trained using Recurrent Neural Networks  RNNs  such as long short term memory  LSTM  networks  which has been used for Pixel Transformation Models and Stochastic Video Generation Models  which aid in consistency and realism respectively              An alternative for these include transformer models  Generative adversarial networks  GANs   Variational autoencoders  VAEs     which can aid in the prediction of human motion               and diffusion models have also been used to develop the image generation aspects of the model             
Text video datasets used to train models include  but are not limited to  WebVid   M  HDVILA    M  CCV  ActivityNet  and Panda   M                          These datasets contain millions of original videos of interest  generated videos  captioned videos  and textual information that help train models for accuracy  Text video datasets used to train models include  but are not limited to PromptSource  DiffusionDB  and VidProM                          These datasets provide the range of text inputs needed to teach models how to interpret a variety of textual prompts  
The video generation process involves synchronizing the text inputs with video frames  ensuring alignment and consistency throughout the sequence              This predictive process is subject to decline in quality as the length of the video increases due to resource limitations             

Limitations edit 
Despite the rapid evolution of Text to Video models in their performance  a primary limitation is that they are very computationally heavy which limits its capacity to provide high quality and lengthy outputs                          Additionally  these models require a large amount of specific training data to be able to generate high quality and coherent outputs  which brings about the issue of accessibility                         
Moreover  models may misinterpret textual prompts  resulting in video outputs that deviate from the intended meaning  This can occur due to limitations in capturing semantic context embedded in text  which affects the model s ability to align generated video with the user s intended message                          Various models  including Make A Video  Imagen Video  Phenaki  CogVideo  GODIVA  and NUWA  are currently being tested and refined to enhance their alignment capabilities and overall performance in text to video generation             
Another issue with the outputs is that text or fine details in AI generated videos often appear garbled  a problem that stable diffusion models also struggle with  Examples include distorted hands and unreadable text

The deployment of Text to Video models raises ethical considerations related to content generation  These models have the potential to create inappropriate or unauthorized content  including explicit material  graphic violence  misinformation  and likenesses of real individuals without consent              Ensuring that AI generated content complies with established standards for safe and ethical usage is essential  as content generated by these models may not always be easily identified as harmful or misleading  The ability of AI to recognize and filter out NSFW or copyrighted content remains an ongoing challenge  with implications for both creators and audiences

Text to Video models offer a broad range of applications that may benefit various fields  from educational and promotional to creative industries  These models can streamline content creation for training videos  movie previews  gaming assets  and visualizations  making it easier to generate high quality  dynamic content              These features provide users with economical and personal benefits   
The feature film The Reality of Time  the world s first full length movie to fully integrate generative AI for video  was completed in       Narrated in part by John de Lancie  known for his iconic role as  Q  in Star Trek  The Next Generation   Its production utilized advanced AI tools  including Runway Gen   Alpha and Kling      as described in the book Cinematic A I  The book explores the limitations of text to video technology  the challenges of implementing it  and how image to video techniques were employed for many of the film s key shots
