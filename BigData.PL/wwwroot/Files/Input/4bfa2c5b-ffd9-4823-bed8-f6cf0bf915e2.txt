Microscopy is the technical field of using microscopes to view subjects too small to be seen with the naked eye  objects that are not within the resolution range of the normal eye              There are three well known branches of microscopy  optical  electron  and scanning probe microscopy  along with the emerging field of X ray microscopy      citation needed     
Optical microscopy and electron microscopy involve the diffraction  reflection  or refraction of electromagnetic radiation electron beams interacting with the specimen  and the collection of the scattered radiation or another signal in order to create an image  This process may be carried out by wide field irradiation of the sample  for example standard light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy  or by scanning a fine beam over the sample  for example confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy   Scanning probe microscopy involves the interaction of a scanning probe with the surface of the object of interest  The development of microscopy revolutionized biology  gave rise to the field of histology and so remains an essential technique in the life and physical sciences  X ray microscopy is three dimensional and non destructive  allowing for repeated imaging of the same sample for in situ or  D studies  and providing the ability to  see inside  the sample being studied before sacrificing it to higher resolution techniques  A  D X ray microscope uses the technique of computed tomography  microCT   rotating the sample     degrees and reconstructing the images  CT is typically carried out with a flat panel display  A  D X ray microscope employs a range of objectives  e g   from  X to   X  and can also include a flat panel 


History edit 
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek            
The field of microscopy  optical microscopy  dates back to at least the   th century  Earlier microscopes  single lens magnifying glasses with limited magnification  date at least as far back as the wide spread use of lenses in eyeglasses in the   th century            but more advanced compound microscopes first appeared in Europe around                            The earliest practitioners of microscopy include Galileo Galilei  who found in      that he could close focus his telescope to view small objects close up                       and Cornelis Drebbel  who may have invented the compound microscope around                             Antonie van Leeuwenhoek developed a very high magnification simple microscope in the     s and is often considered to be the first acknowledged microscopist and microbiologist

Stereo microscope
Optical or light microscopy involves passing visible light transmitted through or reflected from the sample through a single lens or multiple lenses to allow a magnified view of the sample              The resulting image can be detected directly by the eye  imaged on a photographic plate  or captured digitally  The single lens with its attachments  or the system of lenses and imaging equipment  along with the appropriate lighting equipment  sample stage  and support  makes up the basic light microscope  The most recent development is the digital microscope  which uses a CCD camera to focus on the exhibit of interest  The image is shown on a computer screen  so eye pieces are unnecessary             

Limitations edit 
Limitations of standard optical microscopy  bright field microscopy  lie in three areas 

The technique can only image dark or strongly refracting objects effectively 
There is a diffraction limited resolution depending on incident wavelength  in visible range  the resolution of optical microscopy is limited to approximately           micrometres  see  microscope  and the practical magnification limit to      x             
Out of focus light from points outside the focal plane reduces image clarity             
Live cells in particular generally lack sufficient contrast to be studied successfully  since the internal structures of the cell are colorless and transparent  The most common way to increase contrast is to stain the structures with selective dyes  but this often involves killing and fixing the sample              Staining may also introduce artifacts  which are apparent structural details that are caused by the processing of the specimen and are thus not features of the specimen  In general  these techniques make use of differences in the refractive index of cell structures  Bright field microscopy is comparable to looking through a glass window  one sees not the glass but merely the dirt on the glass  There is a difference  as glass is a denser material  and this creates a difference in phase of the light passing through  The human eye is not sensitive to this difference in phase  but clever optical solutions have been devised to change this difference in phase into a difference in amplitude  light intensity       citation needed     

Techniques edit 
Main article  Optical microscope
To improve specimen contrast or highlight structures in a sample  special techniques must be used  A huge selection of microscopy techniques are available to increase contrast or label a sample

			Bright field illumination  sample contrast comes from absorbance of light in the sample
		
		
			
			Cross polarized light illumination  sample contrast comes from rotation of polarized light through the sample
		
		
			
			Dark field illumination  sample contrast comes from light scattered by the sample
		
		
			
			Phase contrast illumination  sample contrast comes from interference of different path lengths of light through the sample
		

Bright field edit 
Main article  Bright field microscopy
Bright field microscopy is the simplest of all the light microscopy techniques  Sample illumination is via transmitted white light  i e  illuminated from below and observed from above  Limitations include low contrast of most biological samples and low apparent resolution due to the blur of out of focus material  The simplicity of the technique and the minimal sample preparation required are significant advantages      citation needed     

Oblique illumination edit 
The use of oblique  from the side  illumination gives the image a three dimensional appearance and can highlight otherwise invisible features  A more recent technique based on this method is Hoffmann s modulation contrast  a system found on inverted microscopes for use in cell culture  Oblique illumination enhances contrast even in clear specimens  however  because light enters off axis  the position of an object will appear to shift as the focus is changed  This limitation makes techniques like optical sectioning or accurate measurement on the z axis impossible 

Dark field edit 
Main article  Dark field microscopy
Dark field microscopy is a technique for improving the contrast of unstained  transparent specimens              Dark field illumination uses a carefully aligned light source to minimize the quantity of directly transmitted  unscattered  light entering the image plane  collecting only the light scattered by the sample  Dark field can dramatically improve image contrast   especially of transparent objects   while requiring little equipment setup or sample preparation  However  the technique suffers from low light intensity in the final image of many biological samples and continues to be affected by low apparent resolution 

A diatom under Rheinberg illumination
Rheinberg illumination is a variant of dark field illumination in which transparent  colored filters are inserted just before the condenser so that light rays at high aperture are differently colored than those at low aperture  i e   the background to the specimen may be blue while the object appears self luminous red   Other color combinations are possible  but their effectiveness is quite variable             

Dispersion staining edit 
Main article  Dispersion staining
Dispersion staining is an optical technique that results in a colored image of a colorless object  This is an optical staining technique and requires no stains or dyes to produce a color effect  There are five different microscope configurations used in the broader technique of dispersion staining  They include brightfield Becke line  oblique  darkfield  phase contrast  and objective stop dispersion staining 

Phase contrast edit

Main article  Phase contrast microscopy
In electron microscopy  Phase contrast imaging
More sophisticated techniques will show proportional differences in optical density  Phase contrast is a widely used technique that shows differences in refractive index as difference in contrast  It was developed by the Dutch physicist Frits Zernike in the     s  for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in        The nucleus in a cell for example will show up darkly against the surrounding cytoplasm  Contrast is excellent  however it is not for use with thick objects  Frequently  a halo is formed even around small objects  which obscures detail  The system consists of a circular annulus in the condenser  which produces a cone of light  This cone is superimposed on a similar sized ring within the phase objective  Every objective has a different size ring  so for every objective another condenser setting has to be chosen  The ring in the objective has special optical properties  it  first of all  reduces the direct light in intensity  but more importantly  it creates an artificial phase difference of about a quarter wavelength  As the physical properties of this direct light have changed  interference with the diffracted light occurs  resulting in the phase contrast image  One disadvantage of phase contrast microscopy is halo formation  halo light ring  

Differential interference contrast edit 
Main article  Differential interference contrast microscopy
Superior and much more expensive is the use of interference contrast  Differences in optical density will show up as differences in relief  A nucleus within a cell will actually show up as a globule in the most often used differential interference contrast system according to Georges Nomarski  However  it has to be kept in mind that this is an optical effect  and the relief does not necessarily resemble the true shape  Contrast is very good and the condenser aperture can be used fully open  thereby reducing the depth of field and maximizing resolution 
The system consists of a special prism  Nomarski prism  Wollaston prism  in the condenser that splits light in an ordinary and an extraordinary beam  The spatial difference between the two beams is minimal  less than the maximum resolution of the objective   After passage through the specimen  the beams are reunited by a similar prism in the objective 
In a homogeneous specimen  there is no difference between the two beams  and no contrast is being generated  However  near a refractive boundary  say a nucleus within the cytoplasm   the difference between the ordinary and the extraordinary beam will generate a relief in the image  Differential interference contrast requires a polarized light source to function  two polarizing filters have to be fitted in the light path  one below the condenser  the polarizer   and the other above the objective  the analyzer  
Note  In cases where the optical design of a microscope produces an appreciable lateral separation of the two beams we have the case of classical interference microscopy  which does not result in relief images  but can nevertheless be used for the quantitative determination of mass thicknesses of microscopic objects 

Interference reflection edit 
Main article  Interference reflection microscopy
An additional technique using interference is interference reflection microscopy  also known as reflected interference contrast  or RIC   It relies on cell adhesion to the slide to produce an interference signal  If there is no cell attached to the glass  there will be no interference 
Interference reflection microscopy can be obtained by using the same elements used by DIC  but without the prisms  Also  the light that is being detected is reflected and not transmitted as it is when DIC is employed 

Fluorescence edit 
Images may also contain artifacts  This is a confocal laser scanning fluorescence micrograph of thale cress anther  part of stamen   The picture shows among other things a nice red flowing collar like structure just below the anther  However  an intact thale cress stamen does not have such collar  this is a fixation artifact  the stamen has been cut below the picture frame  and epidermis  upper layer of cells  of stamen stalk has peeled off  forming a non characteristic structure  Photo  Heiti Paves from Tallinn University of Technology 
Main article  Fluorescence microscopy
When certain compounds are illuminated with high energy light  they emit light of a lower frequency  This effect is known as fluorescence  Often specimens show their characteristic autofluorescence image  based on their chemical makeup 
This method is of critical importance in the modern life sciences  as it can be extremely sensitive  allowing the detection of single molecules  Many fluorescent dyes can be used to stain structures or chemical compounds  One powerful method is the combination of antibodies coupled to a fluorophore as in immunostaining  Examples of commonly used fluorophores are fluorescein or rhodamine 
The antibodies can be tailor made for a chemical compound  For example  one strategy often in use is the artificial production of proteins  based on the genetic code  DNA   These proteins can then be used to immunize rabbits  forming antibodies which bind to the protein  The antibodies are then coupled chemically to a fluorophore and used to trace the proteins in the cells under study 
Highly efficient fluorescent proteins such as the green fluorescent protein  GFP  have been developed using the molecular biology technique of gene fusion  a process that links the expression of the fluorescent compound to that of the target protein  This combined fluorescent protein is  in general  non toxic to the organism and rarely interferes with the function of the protein under study  Genetically modified cells or organisms directly express the fluorescently tagged proteins  which enables the study of the function of the original protein in vivo 
Growth of protein crystals results in both protein and salt crystals  Both are colorless and microscopic  Recovery of the protein crystals requires imaging which can be done by the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein or by using transmission microscopy  Both methods require an ultraviolet microscope as proteins absorbs light at          nm  Protein will also fluorescence at approximately          nm when excited with          nm light             
Since fluorescence emission differs in wavelength  color  from the excitation light  an ideal fluorescent image shows only the structure of interest that was labeled with the fluorescent dye  This high specificity led to the widespread use of fluorescence light microscopy in biomedical research  Different fluorescent dyes can be used to stain different biological structures  which can then be detected simultaneously  while still being specific due to the individual color of the dye 
To block the excitation light from reaching the observer or the detector  filter sets of high quality are needed  These typically consist of an excitation filter selecting the range of excitation wavelengths  a dichroic mirror  and an emission filter blocking the excitation light  Most fluorescence microscopes are operated in the Epi illumination mode  illumination and detection from one side of the sample  to further decrease the amount of excitation light entering the detector

Confocal edit 
Main article  Confocal microscopy
Confocal laser scanning microscopy uses a focused laser beam  e g           nm  that is scanned across the sample to excite fluorescence in a point by point fashion  The emitted light is directed through a pinhole to prevent out of focus light from reaching the detector  typically a photomultiplier tube  The image is constructed in a computer  plotting the measured fluorescence intensities according to the position of the excitation laser  Compared to full sample illumination  confocal microscopy gives slightly higher lateral resolution and significantly improves optical sectioning  axial resolution   Confocal microscopy is  therefore  commonly used where  D structure is important 
A subclass of confocal microscopes are spinning disc microscopes which are able to scan multiple points simultaneously across the sample  A corresponding disc with pinholes rejects out of focus light  The light detector in a spinning disc microscope is a digital camera  typically EM CCD or sCMOS 

Two photon microscopy edit 
A two photon microscope is also a laser scanning microscope  but instead of UV  blue or green laser light  a pulsed infrared laser is used for excitation  Only in the tiny focus of the laser is the intensity high enough to generate fluorescence by two photon excitation  which means that no out of focus fluorescence is generated  and no pinhole is necessary to clean up the image              This allows imaging deep in scattering tissue  where a confocal microscope would not be able to collect photons efficiently              Two photon microscopes with wide field detection are frequently used for functional imaging  e g  calcium imaging  in brain tissue              They are marketed as Multiphoton microscopes by several companies  although the gains of using   photon instead of   photon excitation are marginal 

Single plane illumination microscopy and light sheet fluorescence microscopy edit 
Main article  Light sheet fluorescence microscopy
Using a plane of light formed by focusing light through a cylindrical lens at a narrow angle or by scanning a line of light in a plane perpendicular to the axis of objective  high resolution optical sections can be taken                                      Single plane illumination  or light sheet illumination  is also accomplished using beam shaping techniques incorporating multiple prism beam expanders                          The images are captured by CCDs  These variants allow very fast and high signal to noise ratio image capture 

Wide field multiphoton microscopy edit 
Main article  Wide field multiphoton microscopyWide field multiphoton microscopy                                                 refers to an optical non linear imaging technique in which a large area of the object is illuminated and imaged without the need for scanning  High intensities are required to induce non linear optical processes such as two photon fluorescence or second harmonic generation  In scanning multiphoton microscopes the high intensities are achieved by tightly focusing the light  and the image is obtained by beam scanning  In wide field multiphoton microscopy the high intensities are best achieved using an optically amplified pulsed laser source to attain a large field of view             m                                       The image in this case is obtained as a single frame with a CCD camera without the need of scanning  making the technique particularly useful to visualize dynamic processes simultaneously across the object of interest  With wide field multiphoton microscopy the frame rate can be increased up to a      fold compared to multiphoton scanning microscopy              In scattering tissue  however  image quality rapidly degrades with increasing depth 
Deconvolution edit 
Fluorescence microscopy is a powerful technique to show specifically labeled structures within a complex environment and to provide three dimensional information of biological structures  However  this information is blurred by the fact that  upon illumination  all fluorescently labeled structures emit light  irrespective of whether they are in focus or not  So an image of a certain structure is always blurred by the contribution of light from structures that are out of focus  This phenomenon results in a loss of contrast especially when using objectives with a high resolving power  typically oil immersion objectives with a high numerical aperture 

Mathematically modeled Point Spread Function of a pulsed THz laser imaging system             
However  blurring is not caused by random processes  such as light scattering  but can be well defined by the optical properties of the image formation in the microscope imaging system  If one considers a small fluorescent light source  essentially a bright spot   light coming from this spot spreads out further from our perspective as the spot becomes more out of focus  Under ideal conditions  this produces an  hourglass  shape of this point source in the third  axial  dimension  This shape is called the point spread function  PSF  of the microscope imaging system  Since any fluorescence image is made up of a large number of such small fluorescent light sources  the image is said to be  convolved by the point spread function   The mathematically modeled PSF of a terahertz laser pulsed imaging system is shown on the right 
The output of an imaging system can be described using the equation

Where n is the additive noise              Knowing this point spread function             means that it is possible to reverse this process to a certain extent by computer based methods commonly known as deconvolution microscopy              There are various algorithms available for  D or  D deconvolution  They can be roughly classified in nonrestorative and restorative methods  While the nonrestorative methods can improve contrast by removing out of focus light from focal planes  only the restorative methods can actually reassign light to its proper place of origin  Processing fluorescent images in this manner can be an advantage over directly acquiring images without out of focus light  such as images from confocal microscopy  because light signals otherwise eliminated become useful information  For  D deconvolution  one typically provides a series of images taken from different focal planes  called a Z stack  plus the knowledge of the PSF  which can be derived either experimentally or theoretically from knowing all contributing parameters of the microscope 

Sub diffraction techniques edit 
Main article  Super Resolution microscopy
Example of super resolution microscopy  Image of Her  and Her   target of the breast cancer drug Trastuzumab  within a cancer cell 
A multitude of super resolution microscopy techniques have been developed in recent times which circumvent the diffraction limit 
This is mostly achieved by imaging a sufficiently static sample multiple times and either modifying the excitation light or observing stochastic changes in the image  The deconvolution methods described in the previous section  which removes the PSF induced blur and assigns a mathematically  correct  origin of light  are used  albeit with slightly different understanding of what the value of a pixel mean  Assuming most of the time  one single fluorophore contributes to one single blob on one single taken image  the blobs in the images can be replaced with their calculated position  vastly improving resolution to well below the diffraction limit 
To realize such assumption  Knowledge of and chemical control over fluorophore photophysics is at the core of these techniques  by which resolutions of     nanometers are obtained                         

Serial time encoded amplified microscopy edit 
Main article  Serial time encoded amplified microscopy
Serial time encoded amplified microscopy  STEAM  is an imaging method that provides ultrafast shutter speed and frame rate  by using optical image amplification to circumvent the fundamental trade off between sensitivity and speed  and a single pixel photodetector to eliminate the need for a detector array and readout time limitations             The method is at least      times faster than the state of the art CCD and CMOS cameras  Consequently  it is potentially useful for scientific  industrial  and biomedical applications that require high image acquisition rates  including real time diagnosis and evaluation of shockwaves  microfluidics  MEMS  and laser surgery             

Extensions edit 
Most modern instruments provide simple solutions for micro photography and image recording electronically  However such capabilities are not always present and the more experienced microscopist may prefer a hand drawn image to a photograph  This is because a microscopist with knowledge of the subject can accurately convert a three dimensional image into a precise two dimensional drawing  In a photograph or other image capture system however  only one thin plane is ever in good focus      citation needed     
The creation of accurate micrographs requires a microscopical technique using a monocular eyepiece  It is essential that both eyes are open and that the eye that is not observing down the microscope is instead concentrated on a sheet of paper on the bench besides the microscope  With practice  and without moving the head or eyes  it is possible to accurately trace the observed shapes by simultaneously  seeing  the pencil point in the microscopical image      citation needed     
It is always less tiring to observe with the microscope focused so that the image is seen at infinity and with both eyes open at all times       citation needed

X ray edit 
Main article  X ray microscopy
As resolution depends on the wavelength of the light  Electron microscopy has been developed since the     s that use electron beams instead of light  Because of the much smaller wavelength of the electron beam  resolution is far higher 
Though less common  X ray microscopy has also been developed since the late     s   The resolution of X ray microscopy lies between that of light microscopy and electron microscopy 

Electron microscopy edit 
Main article  Electron microscope
Until the invention of sub diffraction microscopy  the wavelength of the light limited the resolution of traditional microscopy to around     micrometers  In order to gain higher resolution  the use of an electron beam with a far smaller wavelength is used in electron microscopes 

Transmission electron microscopy  TEM  is quite similar to the compound light microscope  by sending an electron beam through a very thin slice of the specimen  The resolution limit in      was around           dubious             discuss      nanometer and has not increased appreciably since that time 
Scanning electron microscopy  SEM  visualizes details on the surfaces of specimens and gives a very nice  D view  It gives results much like those of the stereo light microscope  The best resolution for SEM in      was     nanometer 
Electron microscopes equipped for X ray spectroscopy can provide qualitative and quantitative elemental analysis  This type of electron microscope  also known as analytical electron microscope  can be a very powerful tool for investigation of nanomaterials             

Scanning probe microscopy edit 
Main article  Scanning probe microscopy
This is a sub diffraction technique  Examples of scanning probe microscopes are the atomic force microscope  AFM   the scanning tunneling microscope  the photonic force microscope and the recurrence tracking microscope  All such methods use the physical contact of a solid probe tip to scan the surface of an object  which is supposed to be almost flat 

Ultrasonic force edit 
Ultrasonic force microscopy  UFM  has been developed in order to improve the details and image contrast on  flat  areas of interest where AFM images are limited in contrast  The combination of AFM UFM allows a near field acoustic microscopic image to be generated  The AFM tip is used to detect the ultrasonic waves and overcomes the limitation of wavelength that occurs in acoustic microscopy  By using the elastic changes under the AFM tip  an image of much greater detail than the AFM topography can be generated 
Ultrasonic force microscopy allows the local mapping of elasticity in atomic force microscopy by the application of ultrasonic vibration to the cantilever or sample  To analyze the results of ultrasonic force microscopy in a quantitative fashion  a force distance curve measurement is done with ultrasonic vibration applied to the cantilever base  and the results are compared with a model of the cantilever dynamics and tip sample interaction based on the finite difference technique 

Ultraviolet microscopy edit 
Ultraviolet microscopes have two main purposes  The first is to use the shorter wavelength of ultraviolet electromagnetic energy to improve the image resolution beyond that of the diffraction limit of standard optical microscopes  This technique is used for non destructive inspection of devices with very small features such as those found in modern semiconductors  The second application for UV microscopes is contrast enhancement where the response of individual samples is enhanced  relative to their surrounding  due to the interaction of light with the molecules within the sample itself  One example is in the growth of protein crystals  Protein crystals are formed in salt solutions  As salt and protein crystals are both formed in the growth process  and both are commonly transparent to the human eye  they cannot be differentiated with a standard optical microscope  As the tryptophan of protein absorbs light at          nm  imaging with a UV microscope with          nm bandpass filters makes it simple to differentiate between the two types of crystals  The protein crystals appear dark while the salt crystals are transparent 

Infrared microscopy edit 
The term infrared microscopy refers to microscopy performed at infrared wavelengths  In the typical instrument configuration  a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer  FTIR  is combined with an optical microscope and an infrared detector  The infrared detector can be a single point detector  a linear array or a  D focal plane array  FTIR provides the ability to perform chemical analysis via infrared spectroscopy and the microscope and point or array detector enable this chemical analysis to be spatially resolved  i e  performed at different regions of the sample  As such  the technique is also called infrared microspectroscopy                        
An alternative architecture called Laser Direct Infrared  LDIR  Imaging involves the combination of a tuneable infrared light source and single point detector on a flying objective  This technique is frequently used for infrared chemical imaging  where the image contrast is determined by the response of individual sample regions to particular IR wavelengths selected by the user  usually specific IR absorption bands and associated molecular resonances  A key limitation of conventional infrared microspectroscopy is that the spatial resolution is diffraction limited  Specifically the spatial resolution is limited to a figure related to the wavelength of the light  For practical IR microscopes  the spatial resolution is limited to    x the wavelength  depending on the specific technique and instrument used  For mid IR wavelengths  this sets a practical spatial resolution limit of        m 
IR versions of sub diffraction microscopy also exist                          These include IR Near field scanning optical microscope  NSOM               photothermal microspectroscopy and atomic force microscope based infrared spectroscopy  AFM IR   as well as scattering type Scanning Near field Optical Microscopy  s SNOM               amp  nano FTIR that provide nanoscale spatial resolution at IR wavelengths 

Digital holographic microscopy edit 
Human cells imaged by DHM phase shift  left  and phase contrast microscopy  right 
Main article  Digital holographic microscopy
In digital holographic microscopy  DHM   interfering wave fronts from a coherent  monochromatic  light source are recorded on a sensor  The image is digitally reconstructed by a computer from the recorded hologram  Besides the ordinary bright field image  a phase shift image is created 
DHM can operate both in reflection and transmission mode  In reflection mode  the phase shift image provides a relative distance measurement and thus represents a topography map of the reflecting surface  In transmission mode  the phase shift image provides a label free quantitative measurement of the optical thickness of the specimen  Phase shift images of biological cells are very similar to images of stained cells and have successfully been analyzed by high content analysis software 
A unique feature of DHM is the ability to adjust focus after the image is recorded  since all focus planes are recorded simultaneously by the hologram  This feature makes it possible to image moving particles in a volume or to rapidly scan a surface  Another attractive feature is The ability of DHM to use low cost optics by correcting optical aberrations by software 

Digital pathology  virtual microscopy  edit 
Main article  Digital pathology
Digital pathology is an image based information environment enabled by computer technology that allows for the management of information generated from a digital slide  Digital pathology is enabled in part by virtual microscopy  which is the practice of converting glass slides into digital slides that can be viewed  managed  and analyzed 

Laser microscopy edit 
Laser microscopy is a rapidly growing field that uses laser illumination sources in various forms of microscopy              For instance  laser microscopy focused on biological applications uses ultrashort pulse lasers  in a number of techniques labeled as nonlinear microscopy  saturation microscopy  and two photon excitation microscopy             
High intensity  short pulse laboratory x ray lasers have been under development for several years   When this technology comes to fruition  it will be possible to obtain magnified three dimensional images of elementary biological structures in the living state at a precisely defined instant   For optimum contrast between water and protein and for best sensitivity and resolution  the laser should be tuned near the nitrogen line at about     nanometers   Resolution will be limited mainly by the hydrodynamic expansion that occurs while the necessary number of photons is being registered              Thus  while the specimen is destroyed by the exposure  its configuration can be captured before it explodes                                                                              excessive citations     
Scientists have been working on practical designs and prototypes for x ray holographic microscopes  despite the prolonged development of the appropriate laser                                                                                                      excessive citations

Amateur microscopy edit 
Amateur Microscopy is the investigation and observation of biological and non biological specimens for recreational purposes  Collectors of minerals  insects  seashells  and plants may use microscopes as tools to uncover features that help them classify their collected items  Other amateurs may be interested in observing the life found in pond water and of other samples  Microscopes may also prove useful for the water quality assessment for people that keep a home aquarium  Photographic documentation and drawing of the microscopic images are additional pleasures  There are competitions for photomicrograph art  Participants of this pastime may use commercially prepared microscopic slides or prepare their own slides 
While microscopy is a central tool in the documentation of biological specimens  it is often insufficient to justify the description of a new species based on microscopic investigations alone  Often genetic and biochemical tests are necessary to confirm the discovery of a new species  A laboratory and access to academic literature is a necessity  There is  however  one advantage that amateurs have above professionals  time to explore their surroundings  Often  advanced amateurs team up with professionals to validate their findings and possibly describe new species 
In the late     s  amateur microscopy became a popular hobby in the United States and Europe  Several  professional amateurs  were being paid for their sampling trips and microscopic explorations by philanthropists  to keep them amused on the Sunday afternoon  e g   the diatom specialist A  Grunow  being paid by  among others  a Belgian industrialist   Professor John Phin published  Practical Hints on the Selection and Use of the Microscope  Second Edition          and was also the editor of the  American Journal of Microscopy

Application in forensic science edit 
Microscopy has applications in the forensic sciences              The microscope can detect  resolve and image the smallest items of evidence  often without any alteration or destruction  The microscope is used to identify and compare fibers  hairs  soils  and dust   etc 
In ink markings  blood stains or bullets  no specimen treatment is required and the evidence shows directly from microscopical examination  For traces of particular matter  the sample preparation must be done before microscopical examination occurs      clarification needed     
Light microscopes are the most use in forensics  using photons to form images  microscopes which are most applicable for examining forensic specimens are as follows             
   The compound microscope
   The comparison microscope
   The stereoscopic microscope
   The polarizing microscope
   The micro spectrophotometer
This diversity of the types of microscopes in forensic applications comes mainly from their magnification ranges  which are         X              X  and              X  for the optical microscopy  SEM and TEM respectively
