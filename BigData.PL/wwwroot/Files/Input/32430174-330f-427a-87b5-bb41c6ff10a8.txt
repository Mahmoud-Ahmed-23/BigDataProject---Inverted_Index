France s Vicat Group is keen to keep on investing in Egypt throughout times of prosperity and crises  according to Sinai Cement Country Manager Tamer Magdy 



These provide the strongest reasons that push the company to continue its work in the market  despite its exposure to multiple losses 



The French company has been operating in the Egyptian market for the past    years  since its acquisition of the Sinai Cement Company in       Magdy said 



Magdy also said that Egypt is very promising for investment  despite the negative impacts of the novel coronavirus  COVID     crisis on the Egyptian economy 



The main indicators remain satisfying  and global consensus remains confident with Egypt s GDP expected to reach    in       he noted 



 The nbsp economic reform decisions taken by the Egyptian Government maintains positive growth rates for the economy   he added   Moreover  there is an optimistic view of investment in the Egyptian economy  and the cement sector is one of the promising sectors that overcomes the challenges it faces to attract new foreign investments to this sector  



Magdy noted that Vicat is a long term investor  and has confidence in the Egyptian economy and the current Egyptian political system  As a result of this confidence  the French company has no current intention to exit the domestic market 



Vicat is waiting for the Egyptian Government to start its plan to develop Sinai  the company s main market 



 Regarding the problems in the cement industry  the whole sector has been suffering for over three years with the market in surplus  with the supply surpassing the demand by    million tonnes leading to deterioration in prices and losses to all the companies in the sector   he added   However  currently the Cement Producers Division is working with the  Egyptian  Government to find proposals for enhancing the sector  



He further pointed out that the Cement Producers Division has worked extensively with the Government  represented by the Ministry of Industry and Trade  the Industrial Development Authority  IDA   and the Egyptian Competition Authority  ECA  



This has aimed to find a reasonable solution for Egypt s cement industry  with the joint efforts finding a rational solution to optimise the capacity to decrease the oversupply



Losses recognised before were huge to cover  however the decision of the Egyptian Competition Authority to reduce production by at least     will save the industry 



Additionally  it will have a positive impact on the economy as a whole as all the current jobs will be preserved and all the income of all the suppliers and customers of the cement industry  Magdy disclosed 



Concerning the incentives the Egyptian government should provide to attract foreign direct investments  FDIs  to the cement industry  Magdy said that the state should provide subsidies for exports  This will allow them to compete with other markets which export cement at low and affordable prices 



He also said nbsp that there is strong export competition  as other countries acquire a great share of cement exports to neighbouring countries  which make it difficult for Egyptian companies to export 



 The export subsidy is useless to local cement companies due to there being no exports from this sector  however  providing a profitable price per tonne of cement will enable companies to compete internationally   he said 



Magdy also noted that demand for cement decreases annually  with there being a demand for    million tonnes by the end of       This figure is expected to drop to    million tonnes by the end of       reflecting a decrease of      which means more challenges facing the cement industry in Egypt
