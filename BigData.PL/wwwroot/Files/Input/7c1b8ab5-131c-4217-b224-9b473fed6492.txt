Evolutionary computation from computer science is a family of algorithms for global optimization inspired by biological evolution  and the subfield of artificial intelligence and soft computing studying these algorithms  In technical terms  they are a family of population based trial and error problem solvers with a metaheuristic or stochastic optimization character 
In evolutionary computation  an initial set of candidate solutions is generated and iteratively updated  Each new generation is produced by stochastically removing less desired solutions  and introducing small random changes as well as  depending on the method  mixing parental information  In biological terminology  a population of solutions is subjected to natural selection  or artificial selection   mutation and possibly recombination  As a result  the population will gradually evolve to increase in fitness  in this case the chosen fitness function of the algorithm 
Evolutionary computation techniques can produce highly optimized solutions in a wide range of problem settings  making them popular in computer science  Many variants and extensions exist  suited to more specific families of problems and data structures  Evolutionary computation is also sometimes used in evolutionary biology as an in silico experimental procedure to study common aspects of general evolutionary processes 


History edit 
The concept of mimicking evolutionary processes to solve problems originates before the advent of computers  such as when Alan Turing proposed a method of genetic search in                   Turing s B type u machines resemble primitive neural networks  and connections between neurons were learnt via a sort of genetic algorithm  His P type u machines resemble a method for reinforcement learning  where pleasure and pain signals direct the machine to learn certain behaviors  However  Turing s paper went unpublished until       and he died in       so this early work had little to no effect on the field of evolutionary computation that was to develop            
Evolutionary computing as a field began in earnest in the     s and     s             There were several independent attempts to use the process of evolution in computing at this time  which developed separately for roughly    years  Three branches emerged in different places to attain this goal  evolution strategies  evolutionary programming  and genetic algorithms  A fourth branch  genetic programming  eventually emerged in the early     s  These approaches differ in the method of selection  the permitted mutations  and the representation of genetic data  By the     s  the distinctions between the historic branches had begun to blur  and the term  evolutionary computing  was  coined in      to denote a field that exists over all four paradigms            
In       Lawrence J  Fogel initiated the research of Evolutionary Programming in the United States  which was considered an artificial intelligence endeavor  In this system  finite state machines are used to solve a prediction problem  these machines would be mutated  adding or deleting states  or changing the state transition rules   and the best of these mutated machines would be evolved further in future generations  The final finite state machine may be used to generate predictions when needed  The evolutionary programming method was successfully applied to prediction problems  system identification  and automatic control  It was eventually extended to handle time series data and to model the evolution of gaming strategies            
In       Ingo Rechenberg and Hans Paul Schwefel introduce the paradigm of evolution strategies in Germany             Since traditional gradient descent techniques produce results that may get stuck in local minima  Rechenberg and Schwefel proposed that random mutations  applied to all parameters of some solution vector  may be used to escape these minima  Child solutions were generated from parent solutions  and the more successful of the two was kept for future generations  This technique was first used by the two to successfully solve optimization problems in fluid dynamics             Initially  this optimization technique was performed without computers  instead relying on dice to determine random mutations  By       the calculations were performed wholly by machine            
John Henry Holland introduced genetic algorithms in the     s  and it was further developed at the University of Michigan in the     s             While the other approaches were focused on solving problems  Holland primarily aimed to use genetic algorithms to study adaptation and determine how it may be simulated  Populations of chromosomes  represented as bit strings  were transformed by an artificial selection process  selecting for specific  allele  bits in the bit string  Among other mutation methods  interactions between chromosomes were used to simulate the recombination of DNA between different organisms  While previous methods only tracked a single optimal organism at a time  having children compete with parents   Holland s genetic algorithms tracked large populations  having many organisms compete each generation  
By the     s  a new approach to evolutionary computation that came to be called genetic programming emerged  advocated for by John Koza among others             In this class of algorithms  the subject of evolution was itself a program written in a high level programming language  there had been some previous attempts as early as      to use machine code  but they met with little success   For Koza  the programs were Lisp S expressions  which can be thought of as trees of sub expressions  This representation permits programs to swap subtrees  representing a sort of genetic mixing  Programs are scored based on how well they complete a certain task  and the score is used for artificial selection  Sequence induction  pattern recognition  and planning were all successful applications of the genetic programming paradigm 
Many other figures played a role in the history of evolutionary computing  although their work did not always fit into one of the major historical branches of the field  The earliest computational simulations of evolution using evolutionary algorithms and artificial life techniques were performed by Nils Aall Barricelli in       with first results published in                  Another pioneer in the     s was Alex Fraser  who published a series of papers on simulation of artificial selection             As academic interest grew  dramatic increases in the power of computers allowed practical applications  including the automatic evolution of computer programs             Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers  and also to optimize the design of systems

Evolutionary algorithms edit 
Main article  Evolutionary algorithm
Evolutionary algorithms form a subset of evolutionary computation in that they generally only involve techniques implementing mechanisms inspired by biological evolution such as reproduction  mutation  recombination and natural selection  Candidate solutions to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population  and the cost function determines the environment within which the solutions  live   see also fitness function   Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators 
In this process  there are two main forces that form the basis of evolutionary systems   Recombination  e g  crossover  and mutation create the necessary diversity and thereby facilitate novelty  while selection acts as a force increasing quality 
Many aspects of such an evolutionary process are stochastic  Changed pieces of information due to recombination and mutation are randomly chosen  On the other hand  selection operators can be either deterministic  or stochastic  In the latter case  individuals with a higher fitness have a higher chance to be selected than individuals with a lower fitness  but typically even the weak individuals have a chance to become a parent or to survive 

Evolutionary algorithms and biology edit 
Main article  Evolutionary algorithm
Genetic algorithms deliver methods to model biological systems and systems biology that are linked to the theory of dynamical systems  since they are used to predict the future states of the system  This is just a vivid  but perhaps misleading  way of drawing attention to the orderly  well controlled and highly structured character of development in biology 
However  the use of algorithms and informatics  in particular of computational theory  beyond the analogy to dynamical systems  is also relevant to understand evolution itself 
This view has the merit of recognizing that there is no central control of development  organisms develop as a result of local interactions within and between cells  The most promising ideas about program development parallels seem to us to be ones that point to an apparently close analogy between processes within cells  and the low level operation of modern computers              Thus  biological systems are like computational machines that process input information to compute next states  such that biological systems are closer to a computation than classical dynamical system             
Furthermore  following concepts from computational theory  micro processes in biological organisms are fundamentally incomplete and undecidable  completeness  logic    implying that  there is more than a crude metaphor behind the analogy between cells and computers             
The analogy to computation extends also to the relationship between inheritance systems and biological structure  which is often thought to reveal one of the most pressing problems in explaining the origins of life 
Evolutionary automata                                      a generalization of Evolutionary Turing machines                          have been introduced in order to investigate more precisely properties of biological and evolutionary computation  In particular  they allow to obtain new results on expressiveness of evolutionary computation                          This confirms the initial result about undecidability of natural evolution and evolutionary algorithms and processes  Evolutionary finite automata  the simplest subclass of Evolutionary automata working in terminal mode can accept arbitrary languages over a given alphabet  including non recursively enumerable  e g   diagonalization language  and recursively enumerable but not recursive languages  e g   language of the universal Turing machine
