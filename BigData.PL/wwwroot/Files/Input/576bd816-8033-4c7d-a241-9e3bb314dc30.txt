Anti discrimination law or non discrimination law refers to legislation designed to prevent discrimination against particular groups of people  these groups are often referred to as protected groups or protected classes             Anti discrimination laws vary by jurisdiction with regard to the types of discrimination that are prohibited  and also the groups that are protected by that legislation                        Commonly  these types of legislation are designed to prevent discrimination in employment  housing  education  and other areas of social life  such as public accommodations  Anti discrimination law may include protections for groups based on sex  age  race  ethnicity  nationality  disability  mental illness or ability  sexual orientation  gender  gender identity expression  sex characteristics  religion  creed  or individual political opinions 
Anti discrimination laws are rooted in principles of equality  specifically  that individuals should not be treated differently due to the characteristics outlined above                        At the same time  they have often been criticised as violations of the inherent right of free association  Anti discrimination laws are designed to protect against both individual discrimination  committed by individuals  and from structural discrimination  arising from policies or procedures that disadvantage certain groups              Courts may take into account both discriminatory intent  disparate treatment and disparate impact in determining whether a particular action or policy constitutes discrimination            


International edit 
Equality and freedom from discrimination are outlines as basic human rights by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  UDHR              While the UDHR is not binding  nations make a commitment to uphold those rights through the ratification of international human rights treaties             Specific treaties relevant to anti discrimination law include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights  the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women  and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination              In addition  the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal    and Goal    also advocates for international efforts towards eliminating discriminatory laws             

History of anti discrimination legislation edit 
Australia edit 
Main article  Anti discrimination laws in Australia
The Racial Discrimination Act      was the first major anti discrimination legislation passed in Australia  aimed at prohibiting discrimination based on race  ethnicity  or national origin              Jurisdictions within Australia moved shortly after to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex  through acts including the Equal Opportunity Act      and the Anti Discrimination Act                               The Australian parliament expanded these protections with the Sex Discrimination Act       SDA  to cover all Australians and provide protections based on sex  relationship status  and pregnancy  Additionally  the SDA has been expanded to include gender identity and intersex status as protected groups              Discrimination based on disability status is also prohibited by the Disability Discrimination Act                  

Belgium edit 
The first Belgian anti discrimination law of    February      was annulled by the Belgian Constitutional Court  The Court ruled that the law was discriminative since its scope did not include discrimination on the basis of a political opinion or language and thus violated the articles       of the Belgian Constitution  instituting the principle of equality before law             
A new law came into force on the  th of June                   This law prohibits any use of direct or indirect discrimination on the basis of age  sexual preference  marital status  birth  wealth  religion or belief  political or syndical opinion  language  current or future state of health  disability  physical or genetical property or social origin             

European Union edit 
The European Union has passed several major anti discrimination directives  the Racial Equality Directive and the Employment Equality Directive  and the Equal Treatment Directive  These directives set standards for all member countries of the European Union to meet  however each member state is responsible for creating specific legislation to achieve those goals              The Court of Justice of the European Union interprets the European Union anti discrimination law as substantive equality with equality of outcome for subgroups             
All EU member states are also member states to the European Convention on Human Rights  Thus  article    of the Convention applies  which concerns a prohibition on discrimination on the ground of sex  race  colour  language  religion  political or other opinion  national or social origin  association with a national minority  property  birth or other status 

United Kingdom edit 
Laws forbidding discrimination in housing  public facilities and employment were first introduced in the     s covering race and ethnicity under the Race Relations Act      and the Race Relations Act      
In the     s  anti discrimination law was significantly expanded  The Equal Pay Act      allowed women to bring action against their employer if they could show that they were being paid less compared to a male colleague for equal work or work of the same value  The Sex Discrimination Act      forbade both direct and indirect discrimination on the basis of sex  and the Race Relations Act      expanded the scope of anti discrimination law on the basis of race and ethnicity             
In the     s  protections against discrimination on the basis of disability was added primarily through the Disability Discrimination Act                  
In the     s  the scope of employment anti discrimination laws were expanded to cover sexual orientation  with the passage of the Employment Equality  Sexual Orientation  Regulations        age  the Employment Equality  Age  Regulations        and religion belief  Employment Equality  Religion or Belief  Regulations       
In       existing anti discrimination law was combined into a single Act of Parliament  the Equality Act       The Equality Act contains provisions forbidding direct  indirect  perceptive and associative discrimination on the basis of sex  race  ethnicity  religion and belief  age  disability  sexual orientation and gender reassignment  Employment law also protects employees from worse treatment based on being part time workers  agency workers or being on fixed term contracts             

United States edit 
Main article  List of anti discrimination laws in the United States
In      after the American Civil War  the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified  including the Equal Protection Clause  It was an effort by John Bingham and other Radical Republicans to protect formerly enslaved people from discrimination  Nevertheless  the promises of this and other Reconstruction Amendments went largely unfulfilled for nearly a century thanks to the profusion of racist Jim Crow laws designed to oppress persons of color and reinforce racial segregation in the United States  The Civil Rights Act of      was the next major development in anti discrimination law in the US  though prior civil rights legislation  such as the Civil Rights Act of       addressed some forms of discrimination  the Civil Rights Act of      was much broader  providing protections for race  colour  religion  sex  or national origin in the areas of voting  education  employment  and public accommodations              This landmark legislation led the way for other federal legislation  which expanded upon the protected classes and forms of discrimination prohibited under federal legislation  such as the Fair Housing Act             or the Americans with Disabilities Act              These protections have also been expanded through the courts interpretation of these pieces of legislation  For example  the U S  Courts of Appeals for the Seventh and Second Circuits  and later the U S  Supreme Court in Bostock v  Clayton County  ruled that employment discrimination based on sexual orientation is a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act                                      In addition to federal legislation  there are numerous state and local laws that address discrimination that is not covered by these laws             

Effects edit 
United States edit 
Americans with Disabilities Act of      edit 
Employment rates for all disabled men and disabled women under    have decreased since the implementation of the ADA                          This effect is especially pronounced for those with mental disabilities and for those with lower levels of education              However  there is evidence to suggest that the decrease in employment rates is partially explained by increased participation in educational opportunities              These decreases can be attributed to increased costs for employers to remain in compliance with ADA provisions  rather than bearing increased costs  companies hire fewer workers with disabilities              While popular conception is that the ADA has created the opportunity for legal recourse for those with disabilities  less than     of ADA related cases find in favor of the plaintiff             

Prior to      edit 
David Neumark and Wendy Stock found evidence that sex discrimination equal pay laws boosted the relative earnings of black and white females and conversely reduced the relative employment of both black women and white women             

Exceptions edit 
Where anti discrimination legislation is in force  exceptions are sometimes included in the laws  particularly affecting the military and religious organizations 

Military edit 
In many nations with anti discrimination legislation  women are excluded from holding certain positions in the military  such as serving in a frontline combat capacity or aboard submarines  The reason given varies  for example  the British Royal Navy cite the reason for not allowing women to serve aboard submarines as medical and related to the safety of an unborn foetus  rather than that of combat effectiveness                         

Religious organizations edit 
Some religious organizations are exempted from legislation  For example  in Britain the Church of England  in common with other religious institutions  has historically not allowed women to hold senior positions  bishoprics  despite sex discrimination in employment generally being illegal  the prohibition was confirmed by a vote by the Church synod in                  
Selection of teachers and pupils in schools for general education but with a religious affiliation is often permitted by law to be restricted to those of the same religious affiliation even where religious discrimination is forbidden
