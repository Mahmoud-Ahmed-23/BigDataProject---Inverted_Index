							Egypt has strongly condemned recent statements by Israeli officials regarding Saudi Arabia  calling them        irresponsible and unacceptable         The Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement on Saturday denouncing the remarks  which it said incite against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and propose the establishment of a Palestinian state on Saudi territory 
The ministry asserted that these proposals directly infringe upon Saudi sovereignty and constitute a violation of international law and the United Nations Charter 
In the statement  Egypt expressed its complete rejection of what it described as        reckless remarks that undermine the security and sovereignty of the Kingdom         Egypt emphasised that the security and respect for Saudi Arabia s sovereignty are red lines that it will not allow to be crossed  adding that the stability and national security of Saudi Arabia are integral to the security and stability of Egypt and all Arab nations 
Egypt also affirmed its full solidarity with Saudi Arabia in the face of these statements and called upon the international community to condemn them 
The condemnations follow an interview given by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Israeli Channel    on Thursday  after his summit with US President Donald Trump in Washington  During the interview  Netanyahu addressed the possibility of establishing a Palestinian state 
Netanyahu said in the interview that Saudi Arabia has enough land to provide a state for the Palestinians         The Saudis can establish a Palestinian state in Saudi Arabia  they have plenty of land there         he stated 
Netanyahu also addressed the possibility of a Palestinian state as a condition for normalising relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia  He said he        will not enter into an agreement that endangers the State of Israel         When asked about a Palestinian state as a condition for normalisation  Netanyahu said he        will not enter into an agreement that endangers the State of Israel
