Hybrid intelligent system denotes a software system which employs  in parallel  a combination of methods and techniques from artificial intelligence subfields  such as 

Neuro symbolic systems
Neuro fuzzy systems
Hybrid connectionist symbolic models
Fuzzy expert systems
Connectionist expert systems
Evolutionary neural networks
Genetic fuzzy systems
Rough fuzzy hybridization
Reinforcement learning with fuzzy  neural  or evolutionary methods as well as symbolic reasoning methods 
From the cognitive science perspective  every natural intelligent system is hybrid because it performs mental operations on both the symbolic and subsymbolic levels  For the past few years  there has been an increasing discussion of the importance of A I  Systems Integration  Based on notions that there have already been created simple and specific AI systems  such as systems for computer vision  speech synthesis  etc   or software that employs some of the models mentioned above  and now is the time for integration to create broad AI systems  Proponents of this approach are researchers such as Marvin Minsky  Ron Sun  Aaron Sloman  Angelo Dalli and Michael A  Arbib 
An example hybrid is a hierarchical control system in which the lowest  reactive layers are sub symbolic  The higher layers  having relaxed time constraints  are capable of reasoning from an abstract world model and performing planning 
Intelligent systems usually rely on hybrid reasoning processes  which include induction  deduction  abduction and reasoning by analogy
