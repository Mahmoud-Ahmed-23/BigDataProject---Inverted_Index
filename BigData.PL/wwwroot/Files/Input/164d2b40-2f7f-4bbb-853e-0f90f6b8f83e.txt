							Egypt       s President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi held a meeting on Tuesday with Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly to review the comprehensive development strategy for the South Sinai Governorate

The meeting was attended by Minister of Local Development Manal Awad  South Sinai Governor Khaled Mubarak  Presidential Advisor for Urban Planning Amir Sayed Ahmed  and Commander of the Armed Forces Engineering Authority Ahmed El Azazy 
Egyptian Presidency spokesperson Ambassador Ahmed Fahmy said the meeting reviewed various aspects of the development strategy  which aims to maximise the benefits of each governorate       s unique characteristics and competitive advantages  in line with the government       s plans 
The meeting addressed the progress of priority projects in South Sinai  particularly in Sharm El Sheikh  where efforts are underway to enhance the efficiency of all vital sectors to strengthen its tourism position  Development projects in Taba  Nuweiba  Abu Rudeis  and El Tor were also reviewed 
The  Great Transfiguration  project in Saint Catherine is a national scheme comprising    plans for the development of South Sinai  It focuses on the area of Mount Sinai behind St Catherine s Monastery  the place where God appeared to Moses and gave him the Ten Commandments according to the Old Testament of the Bible 
The project has long been demanded by investors and Sinai residents to achieve the optimum use of St Catherine s natural resources and the legacy of an area full of religious sites that has been in desperate need of infrastructure and utility networks 
President Sisi followed up on the execution of all project elements ahead of its opening  ensuring it aligns with its historical and cultural significance 
The  Great Transfiguration  is being implemented by the Central Agency for Urbanisation  an affiliate of the Ministry of Housing  Utilities  and Urban Communities  with the joint cooperation of the Ministries of Tourism and Environment  It includes plans to reuse underground water and establish a road network linking the touristic destinations of South Sinai  such as Dahab and Sharm El Sheikh 
The  Great Transfiguration  project includes upgrading the existing ecolodge and constructing a new one  establishing a Peace Park  building a hotel on the mountain  opening a new visitors  centre and administrative complex  and developing the touristic area and the heritage centre in the city 
It will also focus on upgrading the residential area of the local Bedouin and building a new residential compound  developing the Valley of the Monastery  and constructing a new road and utilities network with safety measures against floods 
There will also be a spiritual sanctuary in the mountains surrounding the Holy Valley  which will become a premium destination for holistic and therapeutic tourism  in addition to being a mecca for mountain climbers  The project will make available various touristic and entertainment services for visitors  such as golf cars to transport tourists from the parking area to the St Catherine Monastery  one of the world s most ancient Christian monasteries 
Fahmy added that President Al Sisi directed the continuation and intensification of efforts to enhance the developmental and tourism performance of South Sinai  which boasts unique assets  He also stressed the need to explore and implement new mechanisms to stimulate investments in all cities of the governorate  particularly in supporting and empowering youth and their start up projects 
The president also emphasised the need for the development process to include enhancing the efficiency and development of vital sectors that affect the lives of citizens  positively impacting the level of services provided to them in various fields
