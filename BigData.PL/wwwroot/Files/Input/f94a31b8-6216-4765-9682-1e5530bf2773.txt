Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse committed with the necessary intention as defined by the law in a specific jurisdiction                                   This state of mind may  depending upon the jurisdiction  distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide  such as manslaughter   Manslaughter is killing committed in the absence of malice      note        such as in the case of voluntary manslaughter brought about by reasonable provocation  or diminished capacity  Involuntary manslaughter  where it is recognized  is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent  recklessness 
Most societies consider murder to be an extremely serious crime  and thus believe that a person convicted of murder should receive harsh punishments for the purposes of retribution  deterrence  rehabilitation  or incapacitation  In most countries  a person convicted of murder generally receives a long term prison sentence  a life sentence  or capital punishment             Some countries  states  and territories  including the United Kingdom and other countries with English derived common law  mandate life imprisonment for murder  whether it is subdivided into first degree murder or otherwise            


Etymology
The modern English word  murder  descends from the Proto Indo European  m   trom which meant  killing   a noun derived from  mer   to die             
Proto Germanic  in fact  had two nouns derived from this word  later merging into the modern English noun   mur r   death  killing  murder   directly from Proto Indo European m   trom   whence Old English mor or  secret or unlawful killing of a person  murder  mortal sin  crime  punishment  torment  misery              and  mur rij   murderer  homicide   from the verb  mur rijan   to murder    giving Old English myr ra  homicide  murder  murderer   There was a third word for  murder  in Proto Germanic  continuing Proto Indo European  mr t s  dead   compare Latin mors   giving Proto Germanic  mur    death  killing  murder  and Old English mor   death  crime  murder   compare German Mord  
The  d  first attested in Middle English mordre  mourdre  murder  murdre could have been influenced by Old French murdre  itself derived from the Germanic noun via Frankish  mur ra  compare Old High German murdreo  murdiro   though the same sound development can be seen with burden  from burthen   The alternative murther  attested up to the   th century  springs directly from the Old English forms  Middle English mordre is a verb from Anglo Saxon myr rian from Proto Germanic  mur rijan   or  according to the Oxford English Dictionary  from the noun            

Definition
The eighteenth century English jurist William Blackstone  citing Edward Coke   in his Commentaries on the Laws of England set out the common law definition of murder  which by this definition occurs

when a person  of sound memory and discretion  unlawfully kills any reasonable creature in being and under the king s peace  with malice aforethought  either express or implied             At common law  murder was normally punishable by death             
The elements of common law murder are             

unlawful        This distinguishes murder from killings that are done within the boundaries of law  such as capital punishment  justified self defense  or the killing of enemy combatants by lawful combatants as well as causing collateral damage to non combatants during a war             
killing        At common law life ended with cardiopulmonary arrest               the total and irreversible cessation of blood circulation and respiration              With advances in medical technology courts have adopted irreversible cessation of all brain function as marking the end of life             
through criminal act or omission        Killing can be committed by an act or an omission             
of a human        This element presents the issue of when life begins  At common law  a fetus was not a human being              Life began when the fetus passed through the vagina and took its first breath             
by another human        In early common law  suicide was considered murder              The requirement that the person killed be someone other than the perpetrator excluded suicide from the definition of murder 
with malice aforethought  Originally malice aforethought carried its everyday meaning   a deliberate and premeditated  prior intent  killing of another motivated by ill will  Murder necessarily required that an appreciable time pass between the formation and execution of the intent to kill  The courts broadened the scope of murder by eliminating the requirement of actual premeditation and deliberation as well as true malice  All that was required for malice aforethought to exist is that the perpetrator act with one of the four states of mind that constitutes  malice  
In contrast with manslaughter  murder requires the mental element known as malice aforethought  Mitigating factors that weigh against a finding of intent to kill  such as  loss of control  or  diminished responsibility   may result in the reduction of a murder charge to voluntary manslaughter             
The four states of mind recognized as constituting  malice  are             

Intent to kill Intent to inflict grievous bodily harm short of death Reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life  sometimes described as an  abandoned and malignant heart    orIntent to commit a dangerous felony  the  felony murder  doctrine  
Under state of mind  i   intent to kill  the deadly weapon rule applies  Thus  if the defendant intentionally uses a deadly weapon or instrument against the victim  such use authorizes a permissive inference of intent to kill   Examples of deadly weapons and instruments include but are not limited to guns  knives  deadly toxins or chemicals or gases and even vehicles when intentionally used to harm one or more victims 
Under state of mind  iii   an  abandoned and malignant heart   the killing must result from the defendant s conduct involving a reckless indifference to human life and a conscious disregard of an unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily injury  In Australian jurisdictions  the unreasonable risk must amount to a foreseen probability of death  or grievous bodily harm in most states   as opposed to possibility             
Under state of mind  iv   the felony murder doctrine  the felony committed must be an inherently dangerous felony  such as burglary  arson  rape  robbery or kidnapping  Importantly  the underlying felony cannot be a lesser included offense such as assault  otherwise all criminal homicides would be murder as all are felonies 
In Spanish criminal law              asesinato  literally  assassination    takes place when any of these requirements concur  Treachery  the use of means to avoid risk for the aggressor or to ensure that the crime goes unpunished   price or reward  financial gain  or viciousness  deliberately increasing the pain of the victim   After the last reform of the Spanish Criminal Code  in force since July          another circumstance that turns homicide  homicidio  into assassination is the desire to facilitate the commission of another crime or to prevent it from being discovered             
As with most legal terms  the precise definition of murder varies between jurisdictions and is usually codified in some form of legislation  Even when the legal distinction between murder and manslaughter is clear  it is not unknown for a jury to find a murder defendant guilty of the lesser offense  The jury might sympathize with the defendant  e g  in a crime of passion  or in the case of a bullied victim who kills their tormentor   and the jury may wish to protect the defendant from a sentence of life imprisonment or execution 

Degrees 
 Murder in the second degree  and  Premeditated murder  redirect here  For the album  see Murder in the Second Degree  For the film  see Premeditated Murder 
Some jurisdictions divide murder by degrees  The distinction between first  and second degree murder exists  for example  in Canadian murder law and U S  murder law  Some US states maintain the offense of capital murder 
The most common division is between first  and second degree murder  Generally  second degree murder is common law murder  and first degree is an aggravated form  The aggravating factors of first degree murder depend on the jurisdiction  but may include a specific intent to kill  premeditation  or deliberation  In some  murders committed by acts such as strangulation  poisoning  or lying in wait are also treated as first degree murder              A few states in the U S  further distinguish third degree murder  but they differ significantly in which kinds of murders they classify as second degree versus third degree  For example  Minnesota defines third degree murder as depraved heart murder  whereas Florida defines third degree murder as felony murder  except when the underlying felony is specifically listed in the definition of first degree murder                          
Some jurisdictions also distinguish premeditated murder  This is the crime of wrongfully and intentionally causing the death of another human being  also known as murder  after rationally considering the timing or method of doing so  in order to either increase the likelihood of success  or to evade detection or apprehension              State laws in the United States vary as to definitions of  premeditation   In some states  premeditation may be construed as taking place mere seconds before the murder  Premeditated murder is one of the most serious forms of homicide  and is punished more severely than manslaughter or other types of homicide  often with a life sentence without the possibility of parole  or in some countries  the death penalty  In the U S   federal law     U S C                   a   criminalizes premeditated murder  felony murder and second degree murder committed under situations where federal jurisdiction applies              In Canada  the criminal code classifies murder as either first  or second degree  The former type of murder is often called premeditated murder  although premeditation is not the only way murder can be classified as first degree  In the Netherlands  the traditional strict distinction between premeditated intentional killing  classed as murder  moord  and non premeditated intentional killing  manslaughter  doodslag  is maintained  when differentiating between murder and manslaughter  the only relevant factor is the existence or not of premeditation  rather than the existence or not of mitigating or aggravated factors   Manslaughter  non premeditated intentional killing  with aggravating factors is punished more severely  but it is not classified as murder  because murder is an offense which always requires premeditation             

Common law
According to Blackstone  English common law identified murder as a public wrong              According to common law  murder is considered to be malum in se  that is  an act which is evil within itself  An act such as murder is wrong or evil by its very nature  and it is the very nature of the act which does not require any specific detailing or definition in the law to consider murder a crime             
Some jurisdictions still take a common law view of murder  In such jurisdictions  what is considered to be murder is defined by precedent case law or previous decisions of the courts of law  However  although the common law is by nature flexible and adaptable  in the interests both of certainty and of securing convictions  most common law jurisdictions have codified their criminal law and now have statutory definitions of murder 

Exclusions
General
Although laws vary by country  there are circumstances of exclusion that are common in many legal systems 

The killing of enemy combatants who have not surrendered  when committed by lawful combatants in accordance with lawful orders in war  is generally not considered murder   Illicit killings within a war may constitute murder or homicidal war crimes  see Laws of war 
Self defense  acting in self defense or in defense of another person is generally accepted as legal justification for killing a person in situations that would otherwise have been murder  However  a self defense killing might be considered manslaughter if the killer established control of the situation before the killing took place  such as imperfect self defense  In the case of self defense  it is called a  justifiable homicide              
Unlawful killings without malice or intent are considered manslaughter 
In many common law countries  provocation is a partial defense to a charge of murder which acts by converting what would otherwise have been murder into manslaughter  this is voluntary manslaughter  which is more severe than involuntary manslaughter  
Accidental killings are considered homicides  Depending on the circumstances  these may or may not be considered criminal offenses  they are often considered manslaughter 
Suicide does not constitute murder in most societies  Assisting a suicide  however  may be considered murder in some circumstances 
Specific to certain countries
Capital punishment  some countries practice the death penalty  Capital punishment may be ordered by a legitimate court of law as the result of a conviction in a criminal trial with due process for a serious crime  All member states of the Council of Europe are prohibited from using the death penalty 
Euthanasia  doctor assisted suicide  the administration of lethal drugs by a doctor to a terminally ill patient  if the intention is solely to alleviate pain  in many jurisdictions it is seen as a special case  see the doctrine of double effect and the case of Dr John Bodkin Adams              
Killing to prevent the theft of one s property may be legal under certain circumstances  depending on the jurisdiction                          In       a jury in south Texas acquitted a man who killed a sex worker who attempted to run away with his money             
Killing an intruder who is found by an owner to be in the owner s home  having entered unlawfully   legal in most US states  see Castle doctrine              
Killing to prevent specific forms of aggravated rape or sexual assault   killing of attacker by the potential victim or by witnesses to the scene  legal in parts of the US and in various other countries             
In some countries  the killing for what are considered reasons connected to family honor  usually involving killing due to sexual  religious or caste reasons  known as honor killing   committed frequently by a husband  father or male relative of the victim  is not considered murder  it may not be considered a criminal act or it may be considered a criminal offense other than murder                          International law  including the Istanbul Convention  the first legally binding convention against domestic violence and violence against women  prohibits these types of killings  see Article      Unacceptable justifications for crimes  including crimes committed in the name of so called honor              
In the United States  in most states and in federal jurisdiction  a killing by a police officer is excluded from prosecution if the officer reasonably believes they are being threatened with deadly force by the victim  This may include such actions by the victim as reaching into a glove compartment or pocket for license and registration  if the officer reasonably believes that the victim might be reaching for a gun             
Victim
All jurisdictions require that the victim be a natural person  that is  a human being who was still alive before being murdered  In other words  under the law one cannot murder a corpse  a corporation  a non human animal  or any other non human organism such as a plant or bacterium 
California s murder statute  penal code section      expressly mentioned a fetus as being capable of being killed  and was interpreted by the Supreme Court of California in      as not requiring any proof of the viability of the fetus as a prerequisite to a murder conviction              This holding has two implications  Firstly  a defendant in California can be convicted of murder for killing a fetus which the mother herself could have terminated without committing a crime              And secondly  as stated by Justice Stanley Mosk in his dissent  because women carrying nonviable fetuses may not be visibly pregnant  it may be possible for a defendant to be convicted of intentionally murdering a person they did not know existed             

Mitigating circumstances
Some countries allow conditions that  affect the balance of the mind  to be regarded as mitigating circumstances  This means that a person may be found guilty of  manslaughter  on the basis of  diminished responsibility  rather than being found guilty of murder  if it can be proved that the killer was suffering from a condition that affected their judgment at the time  Depression  post traumatic stress disorder and medication side effects are examples of conditions that may be taken into account when assessing responsibility 

Insanity
Main articles  Insanity defense and M Naghten rules
Mental disorder may apply to a wide range of disorders including psychosis caused by schizophrenia and dementia  and excuse the person from the need to undergo the stress of a trial as to liability  Usually  sociopathy and other personality disorders are not legally considered insanity  In some jurisdictions  following the pre trial hearing to determine the extent of the disorder  the defense of  not guilty by reason of insanity  may be used to get a not guilty verdict              This defense has two elements 

That the defendant had a serious mental illness  disease  or defect
That the defendant s mental condition  at the time of the killing  rendered the perpetrator unable to determine right from wrong  or that what they were doing was wrong
Aaron Alexis holding a shotgun during his rampage
Under New York law  for example 

        Mental disease or defect  In any prosecution for an offense  it is an affirmative defence that when the defendant engaged in the proscribed conduct  he lacked criminal responsibility by reason of mental disease or defect  Such lack of criminal responsibility means that at the time of such conduct  as a result of mental disease or defect  he lacked substantial capacity to know or appreciate either     The nature and consequences of such conduct  or    That such conduct was wrong         N Y  Penal Law                     
Under the French Penal Code 

Article      
A person is not criminally liable who  when the act was committed  was suffering from a psychological or neuropsychological disorder which destroyed his discernment or his ability to control his actions 
A person who  at the time he acted  was suffering from a psychological or neuropsychological disorder which reduced his discernment or impeded his ability to control his actions  remains punishable  however  the court shall take this into account when it decides the penalty and determines its regime          Penal Code        found at Legifrance web site
Those who successfully argue a defense based on a mental disorder are usually referred to mandatory clinical treatment until they are certified safe to be released back into the community  rather than prison             

Postpartum depression
Postpartum depression  also known as post natal depression  is recognized in some countries as a mitigating factor in cases of infanticide  According to  Susan Friedman   Two dozen nations have infanticide laws that decrease the penalty for mothers who kill their children of up to one year of age  The United States does not have such a law  but mentally ill mothers may plead not guilty by reason of insanity               In the law of the Republic of Ireland  infanticide was made a separate crime from murder in       applicable for the mother of a baby under one year old where  the balance of her mind was disturbed by reason of her not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child or by reason of the effect of lactation consequent upon the birth of the child               Since independence  death sentences for murder in such cases had always been commuted              the new act was intended  to eliminate all the terrible ritual of the black cap and the solemn words of the judge pronouncing sentence of death in those cases     where it is clear to the Court and to everybody  except perhaps the unfortunate accused  that the sentence will never be carried out               In Russia  murder of a newborn child by the mother has been a separate crime since                  

Unintentional
For a killing to be considered murder in nine out of fifty states in the US  there normally needs to be an element of intent  A defendant may argue that they took precautions not to kill  that the death could not have been anticipated  or was unavoidable  As a general rule  manslaughter             constitutes reckless killing  but manslaughter also includes criminally negligent  i e  grossly negligent  homicide               Unintentional killing that results from an involuntary action generally cannot constitute murder              After examining the evidence  a judge or jury  depending on the jurisdiction  would determine whether the killing was intentional or unintentional 

Diminished capacity
In jurisdictions using the Uniform Penal Code  such as California  diminished capacity may be a defense  For example  Dan White used this defense             to obtain a manslaughter conviction  instead of murder  in the assassination of Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk  Afterward  California amended its penal code to provide  As a matter of public policy there shall be no defense of diminished capacity  diminished responsibility  or irresistible impulse in a criminal action                 

Aggravating circumstances
Murder with specified aggravating circumstances is often punished more harshly  Depending on the jurisdiction  such circumstances may include 

Premeditation
Poisoning
Lying in wait
Murder of a child
Murder committed during sexual assault
Murder committed during kidnapping            
Multiple murders committed within one criminal transaction or in different transactions as part of one broader scheme
Murder of a police officer                          judge  firefighter or witness to a crime            
Murder of a pregnant woman            
Crime committed for pay or other reward  such as contract killing            
Exceptional brutality or cruelty  such as that employed in torture murder
The use of excessive or gratuitous violence beyond that which is necessary to kill  overkill            
Murder committed by an offender previously convicted of murder
Methods which are dangerous to the public             e g  explosion  arson  shooting in a crowd etc             
Murder for a political cause                        
Murder committed in order to conceal another crime or facilitate its commission             
Murder committed in order to obtain material gain  for example to obtain an inheritance            
Hate crimes  which occur when a perpetrator targets a victim because of their perceived membership in a certain social group 
Treachery  e g  Heimt cke in German law 
In the United States and Canada  these murders are referred to as first degree or aggravated murders              Under English criminal law  murder always carries a mandatory life sentence  but is not classified into degrees  Penalties for murder committed under aggravating circumstances are often higher under English law than the    year minimum non parole period that otherwise serves as a starting point for a murder committed by an adult 

Felony murder rule
Main article  Felony murder rule
A legal doctrine in some common law jurisdictions  broadens the crime of murder  when an offender kills in the commission of a dangerous crime   regardless of intent   he or she is guilty of murder  The felony murder rule is often justified by its supporters as a means of preventing dangerous felonies              but the case of Ryan Holle             shows it can be used very widely 
The felony murder reflects the versari in re illicita  the offender is objectively responsible for the event of the unintentional crime               in fact the figure of the civil law systems corresponding to felony murder is the preterintentional homicide  art        French penal code                                      art      Italian penal code              art      German penal code             etc     Felony murder contrasts with the principle of guilt  for which in England it was  at least formally  abolished in       in Canada it was quashed by the Supreme Court  while in the USA it continues to survive                                     

Year and a day rule
Main article  Year and a day rule
In some common law jurisdictions  a defendant accused of murder is not guilty if the victim survives for longer than one year and one day after the attack              This reflects the likelihood that if the victim dies  other factors will have contributed to the cause of death  breaking the chain of causation  and also means that the responsible person does not have a charge of murder  hanging over their head indefinitely               Subject to any statute of limitations  the accused could still be charged with an offense reflecting the seriousness of the initial assault 
With advances in modern medicine  most countries have abandoned a fixed time period and test causation on the facts of the case  This is known as  delayed death  and cases where this was applied or was attempted to be applied go back to at least                  
In England and Wales  the  year and a day rule  was abolished by the Law Reform  Year and a Day Rule  Act       However  if death occurs three years or more after the original attack then prosecution can take place only with the attorney general s approval 
In the United States  many jurisdictions have abolished the rule as well                          Abolition of the rule has been accomplished by enactment of statutory criminal codes  which had the effect of displacing the common law definitions of crimes and corresponding defenses  In      the Supreme Court of the United States held that retroactive application of a state supreme court decision abolishing the year and a day rule did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of Article I of the United States Constitution             
The potential effect of fully abolishing the rule can be seen in the case of    year old William Barnes  charged with the murder of a Philadelphia police officer Walter T  Barclay Jr   who he had shot nearly    years previously  Barnes had served    years in prison for attempting to murder Barkley  but when the policeman died on    August       this was alleged to be from complications of the wounds suffered from the shooting   and Barnes was charged with his murder  He was acquitted on May                      

Contributing factors
According to Peter Morrall  the motivations for murder fit into the following four categories             

Lust  The murderer seeks to kill rivals to obtain objects of their sexual desire
Love  The murderer seeks to  mercy kill  a loved one with a major deformity or an incurable illness 
Loathing  The murderer seeks to kill a loathed person  such as an abusive parent  or members of a loathed group or culture 
Loot  The murderer seeks some form of financial gain 
Morall takes a biological view of offending when he insists the risk factors that may increase the chance that somebody will commit a murder include             

Testosterone  the primary male sex hormone  is correlated with competitive and assertive behaviour 
Reduction in serotonin increases likelihood of impulsive hostile behaviour 
Alteration in the breakdown of glucose appears to affect mood and behaviour 
Hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia can both lead to aggression 
Consumption of alcohol can lead to reduced self control 
Environmental pollutants circulating in the body are linked to heightened aggression 
Malnutrition from eating too much junk food can provoke aggressive behaviour and even murder 
Certain personality disorders are associated with an increased homicide rate  most notably narcissistic  anti social  and histrionic personality disorders and those associated with psychopathology             
Several studies have shown that there is a correlation between murder rates and poverty                                                  A      study showed that regions of the state of S o Paulo in Brazil with lower income also had higher rates of murder

In the Abrahamic religions  the first ever murder was committed by Cain against his brother Abel out of jealousy              In the past  certain types of homicide were lawful and justified  Georg Oesterdiekhoff wrote 

Evans Pritchard says about the Nuer from Sudan   Homicide is not forbidden  and Nuer do not think it wrong to kill a man in fair fight  On the contrary  a man who slays another in combat is admired for his courage and skill    Evans Pritchard            This statement is true for most African tribes  for pre modern Europeans  for Indigenous Australians  and for Native Americans  according to ethnographic reports from all over the world      Homicides rise to incredible numbers among headhunter cultures such as the Papua  When a boy is born  the father has to kill a man  He needs a name for his child and can receive it only by a man  he himself has murdered  When a man wants to marry  he must kill a man  When a man dies  his family again has to kill a man             
In many such societies the redress was not via a legal system  but by blood revenge  although there might also be a form of payment that could be made instead such as the weregild which in early Germanic society could be paid to the victim s family in lieu of their right of revenge 
One of the oldest known prohibitions against murder appears in the Sumerian Code of Ur Nammu written sometime between      and      BC  The code states   If a man commits a murder  that man must be killed  

Judaism and Christianity
The prohibition against murder is one of the Ten Commandments given by God to Moses in Exodus         and Deuteronomy         which are part of the scripture for both Jews and Christians 

In Islam
In Islam according to the Qur an  one of the greatest sins is to kill a human being who has committed no fault             
 Do not take a  human  life made sacred by Allah except with  legal  right    Quran       
 That is why We ordained for the Children of Israel that whoever takes a life unless as a punishment for murder or mischief in the land it will be as if they killed all of humanity  and whoever saves a life  it will be as if they saved all of humanity    Quran      
  They are  those who do not invoke any other god besides Allah  nor take a  human  life made sacred by Allah except with  legal  right   nor commit fornication  And whoever does  any of  this will face the penalty    Quran       

Historical attitudes
The term assassin derives from Hashshashin              a militant Ismaili Shi ite sect  active from the  th to   th centuries  This mystic secret society killed members of the Abbasid  Fatimid  Seljuq and Crusader elite for political and religious reasons              The Thuggee cult that plagued India was devoted to Kali  the goddess of death and destruction                          According to some estimates the Thuggees murdered one million people between      and                   The Aztecs believed that without regular offerings of blood the sun god Huitzilopochtli would withdraw his support for them and destroy the world as they knew it              According to Ross Hassig  author of Aztec Warfare   between        and        persons  were sacrificed in the      re consecration of the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan                          Japanese samurai had the right to strike with their sword at anyone of a lower class who compromised their honour              

Slavery
Southern slave codes did make willful killing of a slave illegal in most cases               For example  the      Mississippi case of Oliver v  State charged the defendant with murdering his own slave               In       the wealthy white planter Arthur Hodge was hanged for murdering several of his slaves on his plantation in the Virgin Islands              

Honor killings in Corsica
In Corsica  vendetta was a social code that required Corsicans to kill anyone who wronged their family honor  Between      and       no fewer than       murders were perpetrated in Corsica              

Abortion
Opponents of abortion consider abortion a form of murder  treating the foetus as a person                            In some countries  a foetus is a legal person who can be murdered      note        and killing someone who is pregnant is considered a double homicide

The World Health Organization reported in October      that a person is murdered every    seconds               An estimated         people were murdered in      around the globe  Another study estimated the worldwide murder rate at         in      with a     increase since                    Two fifths of them were young people between the ages of    and    who were killed by other young people               Because murder is the least likely crime to go unreported  statistics of murder are seen as a bellwether of overall crime rates              

Historical variation
Intentional homicide rate per         inhabitants      
According to scholar Pieter Spierenburg homicide rates per         in Europe have fallen over the centuries  from    per         in medieval times  to    in           AD  five in       to below two per         in                   
In the United States  murder rates have been higher and have fluctuated  They fell below   per         by       rose during the first half of the century  dropped in the years following World War II  and bottomed out at     in      before rising again               The rate stayed in   to    range most of the period from      to       before falling to   in present times               The increase since      would have been even greater if not for the significant improvements in medical techniques and emergency response times  which mean that more and more attempted homicide victims survive  According to one estimate  if the lethality levels of criminal assaults of      still applied in       the country would have seen the murder rate of around    per          almost triple the actually observed rate of     per                      

The historical homicide rate in Stockholm since           AD  The murder rate was very high in the Middle Ages  The rate has declined greatly  from            to a low of     in the     s  The last decades have seen the homicide rate rise slowly 
A similar  but less pronounced pattern has been seen in major European countries as well  The murder rate in the United Kingdom fell to   per         by the beginning of the   th century and as low as      per         in       and was at      per         as of          update       The murder rate in France  excluding Corsica  bottomed out after World War II at less than     per          quadrupling to     per         since then              
The specific factors driving these dynamics in murder rates are complex and not universally agreed upon  Much of the raise in the U S  murder rate during the first half of the   th century is generally thought to be attributed to gang violence associated with Prohibition  Since most murders are committed by young males  the near simultaneous low in the murder rates of major developed countries circa      can be attributed to low birth rates during the Great Depression and World War II  Causes of further moves are more controversial  Some of the more exotic factors claimed to affect murder rates include the availability of abortion              and the likelihood of chronic exposure to lead during childhood  due to the use of leaded paint in houses and tetraethyllead as a gasoline additive in internal combustion engines               


Rates by country
Murder rates vary greatly among countries and societies around the world  In the Western world  murder rates in most countries have declined significantly during the   th century and are now between   and   cases per         people per year  Latin America and the Caribbean  the region with the highest murder rate in the world               experienced more than     million murders between      and                   

UNODC  Per         population       
Murder rates in jurisdictions such as Japan  Singapore  Hong Kong  Iceland  Switzerland  Italy  Spain and Germany are among the lowest in the world  around       cases per         people per year  the rate of the United States is among the highest of developed countries  around     in                    with rates in larger cities sometimes over    per                       The top ten highest murder rates are in Honduras       per           El Salvador  Ivory Coast  Venezuela  Belize  Jamaica  U S  Virgin Islands  Guatemala  Saint Kitts and Nevis and Zambia   UNODC         full table here  
The following absolute murder counts per country are not comparable because they are not adjusted by each country s total population  Nonetheless  they are included here for reference  with      used as the base year  they may or may not include justifiable homicide  depending on the jurisdiction   There were        murders in Brazil  consecutively elevating the record set in                    Over half a million people were shot to death in Brazil between      and                           murder cases were registered across India               approximately        murders in Colombia  the murder rate was    per         people  in      murders went down to                       approximately        murders in South Africa               approximately        murders in the United States               approximately        murders in Mexico               about       murders committed in Russia               approximately        murders in Venezuela               approximately       murders in El Salvador               approximately       murders in Jamaica               approximately     murders in Canada              and approximately     murders in Trinidad and Tobago               Pakistan reported        murders              

United States
The Lake Bodom murders in Espoo  Finland is the most famous unsolved homicide case in Finnish criminal history               The tent is investigated immediately after the murders in      
The scene of a murder in Rio de Janeiro  More than         people were murdered in Brazil between      and                   
In the United States          people were killed between      and                    Approximately     of murders in the US are committed by males               Between      and             of all murder victims and       of victims murdered by intimate partners were female               For women in the US  homicide is the leading cause of death in the workplace              
In the US  murder is the leading cause of death for African American males aged    to     Between      and       African Americans were victims of         homicides                            In       the Federal Bureau of Investigation s Supplementary Homicide Report indicated that nearly half of the        murder victims that year were black                      In the year       there were       black victims and       white victims of non negligent homicides  While       of the black victims were killed by a black offender        of the white victims were killed by white offenders  There were     white victims of black offenders and     black victims of white offenders               The  white  category in the Uniform Crime Reports  UCR  includes non black Hispanics               
Murder demographics are affected by the improvement of trauma care  which has resulted in reduced lethality of violent assaults   thus the murder rate may not necessarily indicate the overall level of social violence              
Workplace homicide  which tripled during the     s  is the fastest growing category of murder in America                                        
Development of murder rates over time in different countries is often used by both supporters and opponents of capital punishment and gun control  Using properly filtered data  it is possible to make the case for or against either of these issues  For example  one could look at murder rates in the United States from      to                    and notice that those rates went up sharply shortly after a moratorium on death sentences was effectively imposed in the late     s  This fact has been used to argue that capital punishment serves as a deterrent and  as such  it is morally justified  Capital punishment opponents frequently counter that the United States has much higher murder rates than Canada and most European Union countries  although all those countries have abolished the death penalty  Overall  the global pattern is too complex  and on average  the influence of both these factors may not be significant and could be more social  economic  and cultural 
Despite the immense improvements in forensics in the past few decades  the fraction of murders solved has decreased in the United States  from     in      to     in                    Solved murder rates in major U S  cities varied in      from     in Boston  Massachusetts to     in San Jose  California               Major factors affecting the arrest rate include witness cooperation              and the number of people assigned to investigate the case              

Investigation
The success rate of criminal investigations into murders  the clearance rate  tends to be relatively high for murder compared to other crimes  due to its seriousness  In the United States  the clearance rate was       in           citation needed

Notes


  This is  malice  in a technical legal sense  not the more usual English sense denoting an emotional state   See malice  law  

  For example  in the United States  the Unborn Victims of Violence Act of      recognizes a foetus as a legal victim if injured or killed during the commission of certain federal crimes  This law applies to federal jurisdictions and certain crimes but excludes legal abortions and medical treatments
