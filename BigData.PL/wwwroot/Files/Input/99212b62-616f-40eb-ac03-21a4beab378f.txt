Linguistics is the scientific study of language                                   The areas of linguistic analysis are syntax  rules governing the structure of sentences   semantics  meaning   morphology  structure of words   phonetics  speech sounds and equivalent gestures in sign languages   phonology  the abstract sound system of a particular language  and analogous systems of sign languages   and pragmatics  how the context of use contributes to meaning              Subdisciplines such as biolinguistics  the study of the biological variables and evolution of language  and psycholinguistics  the study of psychological factors in human language  bridge many of these divisions            
Linguistics encompasses many branches and subfields that span both theoretical and practical applications             Theoretical linguistics is concerned with understanding the universal and fundamental nature of language and developing a general theoretical framework for describing it  Applied linguistics seeks to utilize the scientific findings of the study of language for practical purposes  such as developing methods of improving language education and literacy 
Linguistic features may be studied through a variety of perspectives  synchronically  by describing the structure of a language at a specific point in time  or diachronically  through the historical development of a language over a period of time   in monolinguals or in multilinguals  among children or among adults  in terms of how it is being learnt or how it was acquired  as abstract objects or as cognitive structures  through written texts or through oral elicitation  and finally through mechanical data collection or practical fieldwork            
Linguistics emerged from the field of philology   of which some branches are more qualitative and holistic in approach             Today  philology and linguistics are variably described as related fields  subdisciplines  or separate fields of language study but  by and large  linguistics can be seen as an umbrella term             Linguistics is also related to the philosophy of language  stylistics  rhetoric  semiotics  lexicography  and translation 


Major subdisciplines edit 
Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure is regarded as the creator of semiotics
Historical linguistics edit 
Main article  Historical linguistics
Historical linguistics is the study of how language changes over history  particularly with regard to a specific language or a group of languages  Western trends in historical linguistics date back to roughly the late   th century  when the discipline grew out of philology  the study of ancient texts and oral traditions             
Historical linguistics emerged as one of the first few sub disciplines in the field  and was most widely practised during the late   th century              Despite a shift in focus in the   th century towards formalism and generative grammar  which studies the universal properties of language  historical research today still remains a significant field of linguistic inquiry  Subfields of the discipline include language change and grammaticalization 
Historical linguistics studies language change either diachronically  through a comparison of different time periods in the past and present  or in a synchronic manner  by observing developments between different variations that exist within the current linguistic stage of a language              
At first  historical linguistics was the cornerstone of comparative linguistics  which involves a study of the relationship between different languages              At that time  scholars of historical linguistics were only concerned with creating different categories of language families  and reconstructing prehistoric proto languages by using both the comparative method and the method of internal reconstruction  Internal reconstruction is the method by which an element that contains a certain meaning is re used in different contexts or environments where there is a variation in either sound or analogy                  better      source      needed     
The reason for this had been to describe well known Indo European languages  many of which had detailed documentation and long written histories  Scholars of historical linguistics also studied Uralic languages  another European language family for which very little written material existed back then  After that  there also followed significant work on the corpora of other languages  such as the Austronesian languages and the Native American language families 
In historical work  the uniformitarian principle is generally the underlying working hypothesis  occasionally also clearly expressed              The principle was expressed early by William Dwight Whitney  who considered it imperative  a  must   of historical linguistics to  look to find the same principle operative also in the very outset of that  language  history              
The above approach of comparativism in linguistics is now  however  only a small part of the much broader discipline called historical linguistics  The comparative study of specific Indo European languages is considered a highly specialized field today  while comparative research is carried out over the subsequent internal developments in a language  in particular  over the development of modern standard varieties of languages  and over the development of a language from its standardized form to its varieties      citation needed     
For instance  some scholars also tried to establish super families  linking  for example  Indo European  Uralic  and other language families to a hypothetical Nostratic language group              While these attempts are still not widely accepted as credible methods  they provide necessary information to establish relatedness in language change  This is generally hard to find for events long ago  due to the occurrence of chance word resemblances and variations between language groups  A limit of around        years is often assumed for the functional purpose of conducting research              It is also hard to date various proto languages  Even though several methods are available  these languages can be dated only approximately             
In modern historical linguistics  we examine how languages change over time  focusing on the relationships between dialects within a specific period  This includes studying morphological  syntactical  and phonetic shifts  Connections between dialects in the past and present are also explored             

Syntax edit 
Main article  Syntax
Syntax is the study of how words and morphemes combine to form larger units such as phrases and sentences  Central concerns of syntax include word order  grammatical relations  constituency              agreement  the nature of crosslinguistic variation  and the relationship between form and meaning  There are numerous approaches to syntax that differ in their central assumptions and goals 

Morphology edit 
Main article  Morphology  linguistics 
Morphology is the study of words  including the principles by which they are formed  and how they relate to one another within a language                          Most approaches to morphology investigate the structure of words in terms of morphemes  which are the smallest units in a language with some independent meaning  Morphemes include roots that can exist as words by themselves  but also categories such as affixes that can only appear as part of a larger word  For example  in English the root catch and the suffix  ing are both morphemes  catch may appear as its own word  or it may be combined with  ing to form the new word catching  Morphology also analyzes how words behave as parts of speech  and how they may be inflected to express grammatical categories including number  tense  and aspect  Concepts such as productivity are concerned with how speakers create words in specific contexts  which evolves over the history of a language 
The discipline that deals specifically with the sound changes occurring within morphemes is morphophonology 

Semantics and pragmatics edit 
Main articles  Semantics and Pragmatics
Semantics and pragmatics are branches of linguistics concerned with meaning  These subfields have traditionally been divided according to aspects of meaning   semantics  refers to grammatical and lexical meanings  while  pragmatics  is concerned with meaning in context  Within linguistics  the subfield of formal semantics studies the denotations of sentences and how they are composed from the meanings of their constituent expressions  Formal semantics draws heavily on philosophy of language and uses formal tools from logic and computer science  On the other hand  cognitive semantics explains linguistic meaning via aspects of general cognition  drawing on ideas from cognitive science such as prototype theory 
Pragmatics focuses on phenomena such as speech acts  implicature  and talk in interaction              Unlike semantics  which examines meaning that is conventional or  coded  in a given language  pragmatics studies how the transmission of meaning depends not only on the structural and linguistic knowledge  grammar  lexicon  etc   of the speaker and listener  but also on the context of the utterance              any pre existing knowledge about those involved  the inferred intent of the speaker  and other factors             

Phonetics and phonology edit 
Main articles  Phonetics and Phonology
Phonetics and phonology are branches of linguistics concerned with sounds  or the equivalent aspects of sign languages   Phonetics is largely concerned with the physical aspects of sounds such as their articulation  acoustics  production  and perception  Phonology is concerned with the linguistic abstractions and categorizations of sounds  and it tells us what sounds are in a language  how they do and can combine into words  and explains why certain phonetic features are important to identifying a word             

Typology edit 
This paragraph is an excerpt from Linguistic typology  edit 
Linguistic typology  or language typology  is a field of linguistics that studies and classifies languages according to their structural features to allow their comparison  Its aim is to describe and explain the structural diversity and the common properties of the world s languages              Its subdisciplines include  but are not limited to phonological typology  which deals with sound features  syntactic typology  which deals with word order and form  lexical typology  which deals with language vocabulary  and theoretical typology  which aims to explain the universal tendencies             
Structures edit

Linguistic structures are pairings of meaning and form  Any particular pairing of meaning and form is a Saussurean linguistic sign  For instance  the meaning  cat  is represented worldwide with a wide variety of different sound patterns  in oral languages   movements of the hands and face  in sign languages   and written symbols  in written languages   Linguistic patterns have proven their importance for the knowledge engineering field especially with the ever increasing amount of available data 
Linguists focusing on structure attempt to understand the rules regarding language use that native speakers know  not always consciously   All linguistic structures can be broken down into component parts that are combined according to  sub conscious rules  over multiple levels of analysis  For instance  consider the structure of the word  tenth  on two different levels of analysis  On the level of internal word structure  known as morphology   the word  tenth  is made up of one linguistic form indicating a number and another form indicating ordinality  The rule governing the combination of these forms ensures that the ordinality marker  th  follows the number  ten   On the level of sound structure  known as phonology   structural analysis shows that the  n  sound in  tenth  is made differently from the  n  sound in  ten  spoken alone  Although most speakers of English are consciously aware of the rules governing internal structure of the word pieces of  tenth   they are less often aware of the rule governing its sound structure  Linguists focused on structure find and analyze rules such as these  which govern how native speakers use language 

Grammar edit 
Grammar is a system of rules which governs the production and use of utterances in a given language  These rules apply to sound             as well as meaning  and include componential subsets of rules  such as those pertaining to phonology  the organization of phonetic sound systems   morphology  the formation and composition of words   and syntax  the formation and composition of phrases and sentences              Modern frameworks that deal with the principles of grammar include structural and functional linguistics  and generative linguistics             
Sub fields that focus on a grammatical study of language include the following 

Phonetics  the study of the physical properties of speech sound production and perception  and delves into their acoustic and articulatory properties
Phonology  the study of sounds as abstract elements in the speaker s mind that distinguish meaning  phonemes 
Morphology  the study of morphemes  or the internal structures of words and how they can be modified
Syntax  the study of how words combine to form grammatical phrases and sentences
Semantics  the study of lexical and grammatical aspects of meaning            
Pragmatics  the study of how utterances are used in communicative acts  and the role played by situational context and non linguistic knowledge in the transmission of meaning            
Discourse analysis  the analysis of language use in texts  spoken  written  or signed 
Stylistics  the study of linguistic factors  rhetoric  diction  stress  that place a discourse in context
Semiotics  the study of signs and sign processes  semiosis   indication  designation  likeness  analogy  metaphor  symbolism  signification  and communication
Discourse edit 
Discourse is language as social practice  Baynham        and is a multilayered concept  As a social practice  discourse embodies different ideologies through written and spoken texts  Discourse analysis can examine or expose these ideologies  Discourse not only influences genre  which is selected based on specific contexts but also  at a micro level  shapes language as text  spoken or written  down to the phonological and lexico grammatical levels  Grammar and discourse are linked as parts of a system              A particular discourse becomes a language variety when it is used in this way for a particular purpose  and is referred to as a register              There may be certain lexical additions  new words  that are brought into play because of the expertise of the community of people within a certain domain of specialization  Thus  registers and discourses distinguish themselves not only through specialized vocabulary but also  in some cases  through distinct stylistic choices  People in the medical fraternity  for example  may use some medical terminology in their communication that is specialized to the field of medicine  This is often referred to as being part of the  medical discourse   and so on 

Lexicon edit 
The lexicon is a catalogue of words and terms that are stored in a speaker s mind  The lexicon consists of words and bound morphemes  which are parts of words that can not stand alone  like affixes  In some analyses  compound words and certain classes of idiomatic expressions and other collocations are also considered to be part of the lexicon  Dictionaries represent attempts at listing  in alphabetical order  the lexicon of a given language  usually  however  bound morphemes are not included  Lexicography  closely linked with the domain of semantics  is the science of mapping the words into an encyclopedia or a dictionary  The creation and addition of new words  into the lexicon  is called coining or neologization              and the new words are called neologisms 
It is often believed that a speaker s capacity for language lies in the quantity of words stored in the lexicon  However  this is often considered a myth by linguists  The capacity for the use of language is considered by many linguists to lie primarily in the domain of grammar  and to be linked with competence  rather than with the growth of vocabulary  Even a very small lexicon is theoretically capable of producing an infinite number of sentences 
Vocabulary size is relevant as a measure of comprehension  There is general consensus that reading comprehension of a written text in English requires     coverage  meaning that the person understands     of the words in the text              The question of how much vocabulary is needed is therefore related to which texts or conversations need to be understood  A common estimate is         word families to understand a wide range of conversations and         word families to be able to read a wide range of written texts             

Style edit 
Stylistics also involves the study of written  signed  or spoken discourse through varying speech communities  genres  and editorial or narrative formats in the mass media              It involves the study and interpretation of texts for aspects of their linguistic and tonal style  Stylistic analysis entails the analysis of description of particular dialects and registers used by speech communities  Stylistic features include rhetoric              diction  stress  satire  irony  dialogue  and other forms of phonetic variations  Stylistic analysis can also include the study of language in canonical works of literature  popular fiction  news  advertisements  and other forms of communication in popular culture as well  It is usually seen as a variation in communication that changes from speaker to speaker and community to community  In short  Stylistics is the interpretation of text 
In the     s  Jacques Derrida  for instance  further distinguished between speech and writing  by proposing that written language be studied as a linguistic medium of communication in itself              Palaeography is therefore the discipline that studies the evolution of written scripts  as signs and symbols  in language              The formal study of language also led to the growth of fields like psycholinguistics  which explores the representation and function of language in the mind  neurolinguistics  which studies language processing in the brain  biolinguistics  which studies the biology and evolution of language  and language acquisition  which investigates how children and adults acquire the knowledge of one or more languages 

Approaches edit

Humanistic edit 
The fundamental principle of humanistic linguistics  especially rational and logical grammar  is that language is an invention created by people  A semiotic tradition of linguistic research considers language a sign system which arises from the interaction of meaning and form              The organization of linguistic levels is considered computational              Linguistics is essentially seen as relating to social and cultural studies because different languages are shaped in social interaction by the speech community              Frameworks representing the humanistic view of language include structural linguistics  among others             
Structural analysis means dissecting each linguistic level  phonetic  morphological  syntactic  and discourse  to the smallest units  These are collected into inventories  e g  phoneme  morpheme  lexical classes  phrase types  to study their interconnectedness within a hierarchy of structures and layers              Functional analysis adds to structural analysis the assignment of semantic and other functional roles that each unit may have  For example  a noun phrase may function as the subject or object of the sentence  or the agent or patient             
Functional linguistics  or functional grammar  is a branch of structural linguistics  In the humanistic reference  the terms structuralism and functionalism are related to their meaning in other human sciences  The difference between formal and functional structuralism lies in the way that the two approaches explain why languages have the properties they have  Functional explanation entails the idea that language is a tool for communication  or that communication is the primary function of language  Linguistic forms are consequently explained by an appeal to their functional value  or usefulness  Other structuralist approaches take the perspective that form follows from the inner mechanisms of the bilateral and multilayered language system             

Biological edit 
Further information  Biolinguistics and Biosemiotics
Approaches such as cognitive linguistics and generative grammar study linguistic cognition with a view towards uncovering the biological underpinnings of language  In Generative Grammar  these underpinning are understood as including innate domain specific grammatical knowledge  Thus  one of the central concerns of the approach is to discover what aspects of linguistic knowledge are innate and which are not                         
Cognitive linguistics  in contrast  rejects the notion of innate grammar  and studies how the human mind creates linguistic constructions from event schemas              and the impact of cognitive constraints and biases on human language              In cognitive linguistics  language is approached via the senses                         
A closely related approach is evolutionary linguistics             which includes the study of linguistic units as cultural replicators                          It is possible to study how language replicates and adapts to the mind of the individual or the speech community                          Construction grammar is a framework which applies the meme concept to the study of syntax                                                 
The generative versus evolutionary approach are sometimes called formalism and functionalism  respectively              This reference is however different from the use of the terms in human sciences             

Methodology edit 
This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources     in this section  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed    February        Learn how and when to remove this message 
Modern linguistics is primarily descriptive              Linguists describe and explain features of language without making subjective judgments on whether a particular feature or usage is  good  or  bad   This is analogous to practice in other sciences  a zoologist studies the animal kingdom without making subjective judgments on whether a particular species is  better  or  worse  than another 
Prescription  on the other hand  is an attempt to promote particular linguistic usages over others  often favoring a particular dialect or  acrolect   This may have the aim of establishing a linguistic standard  which can aid communication over large geographical areas  It may also  however  be an attempt by speakers of one language or dialect to exert influence over speakers of other languages or dialects  see Linguistic imperialism   An extreme version of prescriptivism can be found among censors  who attempt to eradicate words and structures that they consider to be destructive to society  Prescription  however  may be practised appropriately in language instruction  like in ELT  where certain fundamental grammatical rules and lexical items need to be introduced to a second language speaker who is attempting to acquire the language      citation needed     

Sources edit 
Most contemporary linguists work under the assumption that spoken data and signed data are more fundamental than written data  This is because

Speech appears to be universal to all human beings capable of producing and perceiving it  while there have been many cultures and speech communities that lack written communication 
Features appear in speech which are not always recorded in writing  including phonological rules  sound changes  and speech errors 
All natural writing systems reflect a spoken language  or potentially a signed one   even with pictographic scripts like Dongba writing Naxi homophones with the same pictogram  and text in writing systems used for two languages changing to fit the spoken language being recorded 
Speech evolved before human beings invented writing 
Individuals learn to speak and process spoken language more easily and earlier than they do with writing 
Nonetheless  linguists agree that the study of written language can be worthwhile and valuable  For research that relies on corpus linguistics and computational linguistics  written language is often much more convenient for processing large amounts of linguistic data  Large corpora of spoken language are difficult to create and hard to find  and are typically transcribed and written  In addition  linguists have turned to text based discourse occurring in various formats of computer mediated communication as a viable site for linguistic inquiry 
The study of writing systems themselves  graphemics  is  in any case  considered a branch of linguistics 

Analysis edit 
Before the   th century  linguists analysed language on a diachronic plane  which was historical in focus  This meant that they would compare linguistic features and try to analyse language from the point of view of how it had changed between then and later  However  with the rise of Saussurean linguistics in the   th century  the focus shifted to a more synchronic approach  where the study was geared towards analysis and comparison between different language variations  which existed at the same given point of time 
At another level  the syntagmatic plane of linguistic analysis entails the comparison between the way words are sequenced  within the syntax of a sentence  For example  the article  the  is followed by a noun  because of the syntagmatic relation between the words  The paradigmatic plane  on the other hand  focuses on an analysis that is based on the paradigms or concepts that are embedded in a given text  In this case  words of the same type or class may be replaced in the text with each other to achieve the same conceptual understanding 

History edit 
Main article  History of linguistics
The earliest activities in the description of language have been attributed to the  th century BC Indian grammarian P  ini                         who wrote a formal description of the Sanskrit language in his A   dhy y                           Today  modern day theories on grammar employ many of the principles that were laid down then             

Nomenclature edit 
Before the   th century  the term philology  first attested in                   was commonly used to refer to the study of language  which was then predominantly historical in focus                          Since Ferdinand de Saussure s insistence on the importance of synchronic analysis  however  this focus has shifted             and the term philology is now generally used for the  study of a language s grammar  history  and literary tradition   especially in the United States              where philology has never been very popularly considered as the  science of language               
Although the term linguist in the sense of  a student of language  dates from                   the term linguistics is first attested in                   It is now the usual term in English for the scientific study of language                          though linguistic science is sometimes used 
Linguistics is a multi disciplinary field of research that combines tools from natural sciences  social sciences  formal sciences  and the humanities                                                  Many linguists  such as David Crystal  conceptualize the field as being primarily scientific              The term linguist applies to someone who studies language or is a researcher within the field  or to someone who uses the tools of the discipline to describe and analyse specific languages             

Early grammarians edit 
Further information  Philology and Grammarian  Greco Roman 
An early formal study of language was in India with P  ini  the  th century BC grammarian who formulated       rules of Sanskrit morphology  P  ini s systematic classification of the sounds of Sanskrit into consonants and vowels  and word classes  such as nouns and verbs  was the first known instance of its kind  In the Middle East  Sibawayh  a Persian  made a detailed description of Arabic in AD     in his monumental work  Al kitab fii an na w                   The Book on Grammar   the first known author to distinguish between sounds and phonemes  sounds as units of a linguistic system   Western interest in the study of languages began somewhat later than in the East              but the grammarians of the classical languages did not use the same methods or reach the same conclusions as their contemporaries in the Indic world  Early interest in language in the West was a part of philosophy  not of grammatical description  The first insights into semantic theory were made by Plato in his Cratylus dialogue  where he argues that words denote concepts that are eternal and exist in the world of ideas  This work is the first to use the word etymology to describe the history of a word s meaning  Around     BC  one of Alexander the Great s successors founded a university  see Musaeum  in Alexandria  where a school of philologists studied the ancient texts in Greek  and taught Greek to speakers of other languages  While this school was the first to use the word  grammar  in its modern sense  Plato had used the word in its original meaning as  t chn  grammatik                       the  art of writing   which is also the title of one of the most important works of the Alexandrine school by Dionysius Thrax              Throughout the Middle Ages  the study of language was subsumed under the topic of philology  the study of ancient languages and texts  practised by such educators as Roger Ascham  Wolfgang Ratke  and John Amos Comenius             

Comparative philology edit 
In the   th century  the first use of the comparative method by William Jones sparked the rise of comparative linguistics              Bloomfield attributes  the first great scientific linguistic work of the world  to Jacob Grimm  who wrote Deutsche Grammatik              It was soon followed by other authors writing similar comparative studies on other language groups of Europe  The study of language was broadened from Indo European to language in general by Wilhelm von Humboldt  of whom Bloomfield asserts             

This study received its foundation at the hands of the Prussian statesman and scholar Wilhelm von Humboldt              especially in the first volume of his work on Kavi  the literary language of Java  entitled  ber die Verschiedenheit des menschlichen Sprachbaues und ihren Einflu  auf die geistige Entwickelung des Menschengeschlechts  On the Variety of the Structure of Human Language and its Influence upon the Mental Development of the Human Race  
  th century developments edit 
There was a shift of focus from historical and comparative linguistics to synchronic analysis in early   th century  Structural analysis was improved by Leonard Bloomfield  Louis Hjelmslev  and Zellig Harris who also developed methods of discourse analysis  Functional analysis was developed by the Prague linguistic circle and Andr  Martinet  As sound recording devices became commonplace in the     s  dialectal recordings were made and archived  and the audio lingual method provided a technological solution to foreign language learning  The     s also saw a new rise of comparative linguistics  the study of language universals in linguistic typology  Towards the end of the century the field of linguistics became divided into further areas of interest with the advent of language technology and digitalized corpora

Sociolinguistics edit 
Main article  Sociolinguistics
Sociolinguistics is the study of how language is shaped by social factors  This sub discipline focuses on the synchronic approach of linguistics  and looks at how a language in general  or a set of languages  display variation and varieties at a given point in time  The study of language variation and the different varieties of language through dialects  registers  and idiolects can be tackled through a study of style  as well as through analysis of discourse  Sociolinguists research both style and discourse in language  as well as the theoretical factors that are at play between language and society 

Developmental linguistics edit 
Main article  Developmental linguistics
Developmental linguistics is the study of the development of linguistic ability in individuals  particularly the acquisition of language in childhood  Some of the questions that developmental linguistics looks into are how children acquire different languages  how adults can acquire a second language  and what the process of language acquisition is             

Neurolinguistics edit 
Main article  Neurolinguistics
Neurolinguistics is the study of the structures in the human brain that underlie grammar and communication  Researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds  bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives  Much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in psycholinguistics and theoretical linguistics  and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language  Neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language  and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories  using aphasiology  brain imaging  electrophysiology  and computer modelling  Amongst the structures of the brain involved in the mechanisms of neurolinguistics  the cerebellum which contains the highest numbers of neurons has a major role in terms of predictions required to produce language

Linguists are largely concerned with finding and describing the generalities and varieties both within particular languages and among all languages  Applied linguistics takes the results of those findings and  applies  them to other areas  Linguistic research is commonly applied to areas such as language education  lexicography  translation  language planning  which involves governmental policy implementation related to language use  and natural language processing   Applied linguistics  has been argued to be something of a misnomer              Applied linguists actually focus on making sense of and engineering solutions for real world linguistic problems  and not literally  applying  existing technical knowledge from linguistics  Moreover  they commonly apply technical knowledge from multiple sources  such as sociology  e g   conversation analysis  and anthropology   Constructed language fits under Applied linguistics  
Today  computers are widely used in many areas of applied linguistics  Speech synthesis and speech recognition use phonetic and phonemic knowledge to provide voice interfaces to computers  Applications of computational linguistics in machine translation  computer assisted translation  and natural language processing are areas of applied linguistics that have come to the forefront  Their influence has had an effect on theories of syntax and semantics  as modelling syntactic and semantic theories on computers constraints 
Linguistic analysis is a sub discipline of applied linguistics used by many governments to verify the claimed nationality of people seeking asylum who do not hold the necessary documentation to prove their claim              This often takes the form of an interview by personnel in an immigration department  Depending on the country  this interview is conducted either in the asylum seeker s native language through an interpreter or in an international lingua franca like English              Australia uses the former method  while Germany employs the latter  the Netherlands uses either method depending on the languages involved              Tape recordings of the interview then undergo language analysis  which can be done either by private contractors or within a department of the government  In this analysis  linguistic features of the asylum seeker are used by analysts to make a determination about the speaker s nationality  The reported findings of the linguistic analysis can play a critical role in the government s decision on the refugee status of the asylum seeker             

Language documentation edit 
Language documentation combines anthropological inquiry  into the history and culture of language  with linguistic inquiry  in order to describe languages and their grammars  Lexicography involves the documentation of words that form a vocabulary  Such a documentation of a linguistic vocabulary from a particular language is usually compiled in a dictionary  Computational linguistics is concerned with the statistical or rule based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective  Specific knowledge of language is applied by speakers during the act of translation and interpretation  as well as in language education   the teaching of a second or foreign language  Policy makers work with governments to implement new plans in education and teaching which are based on linguistic research 
Since the inception of the discipline of linguistics  linguists have been concerned with describing and analysing previously undocumented languages  Starting with Franz Boas in the early     s  this became the main focus of American linguistics until the rise of formal linguistics in the mid   th century  This focus on language documentation was partly motivated by a concern to document the rapidly disappearing languages of indigenous peoples  The ethnographic dimension of the Boasian approach to language description played a role in the development of disciplines such as sociolinguistics  anthropological linguistics  and linguistic anthropology  which investigate the relations between language  culture  and society 
The emphasis on linguistic description and documentation has also gained prominence outside North America  with the documentation of rapidly dying indigenous languages becoming a focus in some university programs in linguistics  Language description is a work intensive endeavour  usually requiring years of field work in the language concerned  so as to equip the linguist to write a sufficiently accurate reference grammar  Further  the task of documentation requires the linguist to collect a substantial corpus in the language in question  consisting of texts and recordings  both sound and video  which can be stored in an accessible format within open repositories  and used for further research             

Translation edit 
Main articles  Translation and Translation studies
The sub field of translation includes the translation of written and spoken texts across media  from digital to print and spoken  To translate literally means to transmute the meaning from one language into another  Translators are often employed by organizations such as travel agencies and governmental embassies to facilitate communication between two speakers who do not know each other s language  Translators are also employed to work within computational linguistics setups like Google Translate  which is an automated program to translate words and phrases between any two or more given languages  Translation is also conducted by publishing houses  which convert works of writing from one language to another in order to reach varied audiences  Cross national and cross cultural survey research studies employ translation to collect comparable data among multilingual populations                          Academic translators specialize in or are familiar with various other disciplines such as technology  science  law  economics  etc 

Clinical linguistics edit 
Main article  Clinical linguistics
Clinical linguistics is the application of linguistic theory to the field of speech language pathology  Speech language pathologists work on corrective measures to treat communication and swallowing disorders 

Computational linguistics edit 
Main article  Computational linguistics
Computational linguistics is the study of linguistic issues in a way that is  computationally responsible   i e   taking careful note of computational consideration of algorithmic specification and computational complexity  so that the linguistic theories devised can be shown to exhibit certain desirable computational properties and their implementations  Computational linguists also work on computer language and software development 

Evolutionary linguistics edit 
Main article  Evolutionary linguistics
Evolutionary linguistics is a sociobiological approach to analyzing the emergence of the language faculty through human evolution  and also the application of evolutionary theory to the study of cultural evolution among different languages  It is also a study of the dispersal of various languages across the globe  through movements among ancient communities             

Forensic linguistics edit 
Main article  Forensic linguistics
Forensic linguistics is the application of linguistic analysis to forensics  Forensic analysis investigates the style  language  lexical use  and other linguistic and grammatical features used in the legal context to provide evidence in courts of law  Forensic linguists have also used their expertise in the framework of criminal cases
