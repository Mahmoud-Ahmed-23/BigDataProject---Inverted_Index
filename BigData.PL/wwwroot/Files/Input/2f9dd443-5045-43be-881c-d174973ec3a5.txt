Uncertainty or incertitude refers to situations involving imperfect or unknown information  It applies to predictions of future events  to physical measurements that are already made  or to the unknown  and is particularly relevant for decision making  Uncertainty arises in partially observable or stochastic environments  as well as due to ignorance  indolence  or both             It arises in any number of fields  including insurance  philosophy  physics  statistics  economics  finance  medicine  psychology  sociology  engineering  metrology  meteorology  ecology and information science 


Concepts edit 
Although the terms are used in various ways among the general public  many specialists in decision theory  statistics and other quantitative fields have defined uncertainty  risk  and their measurement as 

Uncertainty edit 
The lack of certainty  a state of limited knowledge where it is impossible to exactly describe the existing state  a future outcome  or more than one possible outcome             

Measurement edit 
Uncertainty can be measured through a set of possible states or outcomes where probabilities are assigned to each possible state or outcome   this also includes the application of a probability density function to continuous variables            

Second order uncertainty edit 
In statistics and economics  second order uncertainty is represented in probability density functions over  first order  probabilities                       
Opinions in subjective logic            carry this type of uncertainty 

Risk edit 
Risk is a state of uncertainty  where some possible outcomes have an undesired effect or significant loss  Measurement of risk includes a set of measured uncertainties  where some possible outcomes are losses  and the magnitudes of those losses  This also includes loss functions over continuous variables                                              

Uncertainty versus variability edit 
There is a difference between uncertainty and variability  Uncertainty is quantified by a probability distribution which depends upon knowledge about the likelihood of what the single  true value of the uncertain quantity is  Variability is quantified by a distribution of frequencies of multiple instances of the quantity  derived from observed data             

Knightian uncertainty edit 
In economics  in      Frank Knight distinguished uncertainty from risk with uncertainty being lack of knowledge which is immeasurable and impossible to calculate  Because of the absence of clearly defined statistics in most economic decisions where people face uncertainty  he believed that we cannot measure probabilities in such cases  this is now referred to as Knightian uncertainty             

Uncertainty must be taken in a sense radically distinct from the familiar notion of risk  from which it has never been properly separated     The essential fact is that  risk  means in some cases a quantity susceptible of measurement  while at other times it is something distinctly not of this character  and there are far reaching and crucial differences in the bearings of the phenomena depending on which of the two is really present and operating     It will appear that a measurable uncertainty  or  risk  proper  as we shall use the term  is so far different from an unmeasurable one that it is not in effect an uncertainty at all         Frank Knight              Risk  Uncertainty  and Profit         University of Chicago             
There is a fundamental distinction between the reward for taking a known risk and that for assuming a risk whose value itself is not known  It is so fundamental  indeed  that   a known risk will not lead to any reward or special payment at all         Frank Knight
Knight pointed out that the unfavorable outcome of known risks can be insured during the decision making process because it has a clearly defined expected probability distribution  Unknown risks have no known expected probability distribution  which can lead to extremely risky company decisions 
Other taxonomies of uncertainties and decisions include a broader sense of uncertainty and how it should be approached from an ethics perspective             

A taxonomy of uncertainty



There are some things that you know to be true  and others that you know to be false  yet  despite this extensive knowledge that you have  there remain many things whose truth or falsity is not known to you  We say that you are uncertain about them  You are uncertain  to varying degrees  about everything in the future  much of the past is hidden from you  and there is a lot of the present about which you do not have full information  Uncertainty is everywhere and you cannot escape from it 


Dennis Lindley  Understanding Uncertainty       

Risk and uncertainty edit 
For example  if it is unknown whether or not it will rain tomorrow  then there is a state of uncertainty  If probabilities are applied to the possible outcomes using weather forecasts or even just a calibrated probability assessment  the uncertainty has been quantified  Suppose it is quantified as a     chance of sunshine  If there is a major  costly  outdoor event planned for tomorrow then there is a risk since there is a     chance of rain  and rain would be undesirable  Furthermore  if this is a business event and          would be lost if it rains  then the risk has been quantified  a     chance of losing            These situations can be made even more realistic by quantifying light rain vs  heavy rain  the cost of delays vs  outright cancellation  etc 
Some may represent the risk in this example as the  expected opportunity loss   EOL  or the chance of the loss multiplied by the amount of the loss                             That is useful if the organizer of the event is  risk neutral   which most people are not  Most would be willing to pay a premium to avoid the loss  An insurance company  for example  would compute an EOL as a minimum for any insurance coverage  then add onto that other operating costs and profit  Since many people are willing to buy insurance for many reasons  then clearly the EOL alone is not the perceived value of avoiding the risk 
Quantitative uses of the terms uncertainty and risk are fairly consistent among fields such as probability theory  actuarial science  and information theory  Some also create new terms without substantially changing the definitions of uncertainty or risk  For example  surprisal is a variation on uncertainty sometimes used in information theory  But outside of the more mathematical uses of the term  usage may vary widely  In cognitive psychology  uncertainty can be real  or just a matter of perception  such as expectations  threats  etc 
Vagueness is a form of uncertainty where the analyst is unable to clearly differentiate between two different classes  such as  person of average height  and  tall person   This form of vagueness can be modelled by some variation on Zadeh s fuzzy logic or subjective logic             
Ambiguity is a form of uncertainty where even the possible outcomes have unclear meanings and interpretations  The statement  He returns from the bank  is ambiguous because its interpretation depends on whether the word  bank  is meant as  the side of a river  or  a financial institution   Ambiguity typically arises in situations where multiple analysts or observers have different interpretations of the same statements             
At the subatomic level  uncertainty may be a fundamental and unavoidable property of the universe  In quantum mechanics  the Heisenberg uncertainty principle puts limits on how much an observer can ever know about the position and velocity of a particle  This may not just be ignorance of potentially obtainable facts but that there is no fact to be found  There is some controversy in physics as to whether such uncertainty is an irreducible property of nature or if there are  hidden variables  that would describe the state of a particle even more exactly than Heisenberg s uncertainty principle allows             

Radical uncertainty edit 
The term  radical uncertainty  was popularised by John Kay and Mervyn King in their book Radical Uncertainty  Decision Making for an Unknowable Future  published in March       It is distinct from Knightian uncertainty  by whether or not it is  resolvable   If uncertainty arises from a lack of knowledge  and that lack of knowledge is resolvable by acquiring knowledge  such as by primary or secondary research  then it is not radical uncertainty  Only when there are no means available to acquire the knowledge which would resolve the uncertainty  is it considered  radical                          

In measurements edit 
Main article  Measurement uncertainty
See also  Uncertainty quantification and Uncertainty propagation
The most commonly used procedure for calculating measurement uncertainty is described in the  Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement   GUM  published by ISO  A derived work is for example the National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST  Technical Note        Guidelines for Evaluating and Expressing the Uncertainty of NIST Measurement Results   and the Eurachem Citac publication  Quantifying Uncertainty in Analytical Measurement   The uncertainty of the result of a measurement generally consists of several components  The components are regarded as random variables  and may be grouped into two categories according to the method used to estimate their numerical values 

Type A  those evaluated by statistical methods
Type B  those evaluated by other means  e g   by assigning a probability distribution
By propagating the variances of the components through a function relating the components to the measurement result  the combined measurement uncertainty is given as the square root of the resulting variance  The simplest form is the standard deviation of a repeated observation 
In metrology  physics  and engineering  the uncertainty or margin of error of a measurement  when explicitly stated  is given by a range of values likely to enclose the true value  This may be denoted by error bars on a graph  or by the following notations      citation needed     

measured value   uncertainty
measured value  uncertainty uncertainty
measured value  uncertainty 
 
In the last notation  parentheses are the concise notation for the   notation  For example  applying              meters in a scientific or engineering application  it could be written           m or            m  by convention meaning accurate to within one tenth of a meter  or one hundredth  The precision is symmetric around the last digit  In this case it s half a tenth up and half a tenth down  so      means between       and        Thus it is understood that      means            and       means              also written          and           respectively   But if the accuracy is within two tenths  the uncertainty is   one tenth  and it is required to be explicit           and            or         and             The numbers in parentheses apply to the numeral left of themselves  and are not part of that number  but part of a notation of uncertainty  They apply to the least significant digits  For instance             stands for                  while             stands for                              This concise notation is used for example by IUPAC in stating the atomic mass of elements 
The middle notation is used when the error is not symmetrical about the value   for example              This can occur when using a logarithmic scale  for example 
Uncertainty of a measurement can be determined by repeating a measurement to arrive at an estimate of the standard deviation of the values  Then  any single value has an uncertainty equal to the standard deviation  However  if the values are averaged  then the mean measurement value has a much smaller uncertainty  equal to the standard error of the mean  which is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of measurements  This procedure neglects systematic errors  however      citation needed     
When the uncertainty represents the standard error of the measurement  then about       of the time  the true value of the measured quantity falls within the stated uncertainty range  For example  it is likely that for       of the atomic mass values given on the list of elements by atomic mass  the true value lies outside of the stated range  If the width of the interval is doubled  then probably only      of the true values lie outside the doubled interval  and if the width is tripled  probably only      lie outside  These values follow from the properties of the normal distribution  and they apply only if the measurement process produces normally distributed errors  In that case  the quoted standard errors are easily converted to         one sigma            two sigma    or         three sigma   confidence intervals      citation needed     
In this context  uncertainty depends on both the accuracy and precision of the measurement instrument  The lower the accuracy and precision of an instrument  the larger the measurement uncertainty is  Precision is often determined as the standard deviation of the repeated measures of a given value  namely using the same method described above to assess measurement uncertainty  However  this method is correct only when the instrument is accurate  When it is inaccurate  the uncertainty is larger than the standard deviation of the repeated measures  and it appears evident that the uncertainty does not depend only on instrumental precision 

In the media edit 
Uncertainty in science  and science in general  may be interpreted differently in the public sphere than in the scientific community               This is due in part to the diversity of the public audience  and the tendency for scientists to misunderstand lay audiences and therefore not communicate ideas clearly and effectively              One example is explained by the information deficit model  Also  in the public realm  there are often many scientific voices giving input on a single topic              For example  depending on how an issue is reported in the public sphere  discrepancies between outcomes of multiple scientific studies due to methodological differences could be interpreted by the public as a lack of consensus in a situation where a consensus does in fact exist              This interpretation may have even been intentionally promoted  as scientific uncertainty may be managed to reach certain goals   For example  climate change deniers took the advice of Frank Luntz to frame global warming as an issue of scientific uncertainty  which was a precursor to the conflict frame used by journalists when reporting the issue             
 Indeterminacy can be loosely said to apply to situations in which not all the parameters of the system and their interactions are fully known  whereas ignorance refers to situations in which it is not known what is not known               These unknowns  indeterminacy and ignorance  that exist in science are often  transformed  into uncertainty when reported to the public in order to make issues more manageable  since scientific indeterminacy and ignorance are difficult concepts for scientists to convey without losing credibility              Conversely  uncertainty is often interpreted by the public as ignorance              The transformation of indeterminacy and ignorance into uncertainty may be related to the public s misinterpretation of uncertainty as ignorance 
Journalists may inflate uncertainty  making the science seem more uncertain than it really is  or downplay uncertainty  making the science seem more certain than it really is               One way that journalists inflate uncertainty is by describing new research that contradicts past research without providing context for the change              Journalists may give scientists with minority views equal weight as scientists with majority views  without adequately describing or explaining the state of scientific consensus on the issue              In the same vein  journalists may give non scientists the same amount of attention and importance as scientists             
Journalists may downplay uncertainty by eliminating  scientists  carefully chosen tentative wording  and by losing these caveats the information is skewed and presented as more certain and conclusive than it really is               Also  stories with a single source or without any context of previous research mean that the subject at hand is presented as more definitive and certain than it is in reality              There is often a  product over process  approach to science journalism that aids  too  in the downplaying of uncertainty              Finally  and most notably for this investigation  when science is framed by journalists as a triumphant quest  uncertainty is erroneously framed as  reducible and resolvable              
Some media routines and organizational factors affect the overstatement of uncertainty  other media routines and organizational factors help inflate the certainty of an issue  Because the general public  in the United States  generally trusts scientists  when science stories are covered without alarm raising cues from special interest organizations  religious groups  environmental organizations  political factions  etc   they are often covered in a business related sense  in an economic development frame or a social progress frame              The nature of these frames is to downplay or eliminate uncertainty  so when economic and scientific promise are focused on early in the issue cycle  as has happened with coverage of plant biotechnology and nanotechnology in the United States  the matter in question seems more definitive and certain             
Sometimes  stockholders  owners  or advertising will pressure a media organization to promote the business aspects of a scientific issue  and therefore any uncertainty claims which may compromise the business interests are downplayed or eliminated             

Applications edit 
Uncertainty is designed into games  most notably in gambling  where chance is central to play 
In scientific modelling  in which the prediction of future events should be understood to have a range of expected values 
In computer science  and in particular data management  uncertain data is commonplace and can be modeled and stored within an uncertain database 
In optimization  uncertainty permits one to describe situations where the user does not have full control on the outcome of the optimization procedure  see scenario optimization and stochastic optimization 
In weather forecasting  it is now commonplace to include data on the degree of uncertainty in a weather forecast 
Uncertainty or error is used in science and engineering notation  Numerical values should only have to be expressed in those digits that are physically meaningful  which are referred to as significant figures  Uncertainty is involved in every measurement  such as measuring a distance  a temperature  etc   the degree depending upon the instrument or technique used to make the measurement  Similarly  uncertainty is propagated through calculations so that the calculated value has some degree of uncertainty depending upon the uncertainties of the measured values and the equation used in the calculation             
In physics  the Heisenberg uncertainty principle forms the basis of modern quantum mechanics             
In metrology  measurement uncertainty is a central concept quantifying the dispersion one may reasonably attribute to a measurement result  Such an uncertainty can also be referred to as a measurement error 
In daily life  measurement uncertainty is often implicit   He is   feet tall  give or take a few inches   while for any serious use an explicit statement of the measurement uncertainty is necessary  The expected measurement uncertainty of many measuring instruments  scales  oscilloscopes  force gages  rulers  thermometers  etc   is often stated in the manufacturers  specifications 
In engineering  uncertainty can be used in the context of validation and verification of material modeling             
Uncertainty has been a common theme in art  both as a thematic device  see  for example  the indecision of Hamlet   and as a quandary for the artist  such as Martin Creed s difficulty with deciding what artworks to make  
Uncertainty is an important factor in economics  According to economist Frank Knight  it is different from risk  where there is a specific probability assigned to each outcome  as when flipping a fair coin   Knightian uncertainty involves a situation that has unknown probabilities             
Investing in financial markets such as the stock market involves Knightian uncertainty when the probability of a rare but catastrophic event is unknown             
Philosophy edit 
Main article  Philosophical skepticism
In Western philosophy the first philosopher to embrace uncertainty was Pyrrho             resulting in the Hellenistic philosophies of Pyrrhonism and Academic Skepticism  the first schools of philosophical skepticism  Aporia and acatalepsy represent key concepts in ancient Greek philosophy regarding uncertainty 
William MacAskill  a philosopher at Oxford University  has also discussed the concept of Moral Uncertainty              Moral Uncertainty is  uncertainty about how to act given lack of certainty in any one moral theory  as well as the study of how we ought to act given this uncertainty              

Artificial intelligence edit 
This section is an excerpt from Reasoning system   Reasoning under uncertainty  edit 
Many reasoning systems provide capabilities for reasoning under uncertainty  This is important when building situated reasoning agents which must deal with uncertain representations of the world   There are several common approaches to handling uncertainty   These include the use of certainty factors  probabilistic methods such as Bayesian inference or Dempster Shafer theory  multi valued   fuzzy   logic and various connectionist approaches
