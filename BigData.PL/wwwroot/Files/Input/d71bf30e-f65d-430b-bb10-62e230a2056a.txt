Instances of subjective experience
This article is about the philosophical concept  For other uses  see Qualia  disambiguation  
The  redness  of red is a commonly used example of a quale 
In philosophy of mind  qualia    kw  li    kwe     singular  quale   li   le    are defined as instances of subjective  conscious experience  The term qualia derives from the Latin neuter plural form  qualia  of the Latin adjective qu lis  Latin pronunciation        k a l s       meaning  of what sort  or  of what kind  in relation to a specific instance  such as  what it is like to taste a specific apple               this particular apple now  
Examples of qualia include the perceived sensation of pain of a headache  the taste of wine  and the redness of an evening sky  As qualitative characteristics of sensations  qualia stand in contrast to propositional attitudes             where the focus is on beliefs about experience rather than what it is directly like to be experiencing 
In      C  I  Lewis was the first to use the term  qualia  in its generally agreed upon modern sense  Frank Jackson later defined qualia as     certain features of the bodily sensations especially  but also of certain perceptual experiences  which no amount of purely physical information includes   Philosopher and cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett suggested that qualia was  an unfamiliar term for something that could not be more familiar to each of us  the ways things seem to us  
The nature and existence of qualia under various definitions remain controversial  Much of the debate over the importance of qualia hinges on the definition of the term  and various philosophers emphasize or deny the existence of certain features of qualia  Some philosophers of mind  like Daniel Dennett  argue that qualia do not exist  Other philosophers  as well as neuroscientists and neurologists  believe qualia exist and that the desire by some philosophers to disregard qualia is based on an erroneous interpretation of what constitutes science             Within the framework of mind  or nondualism  qualia may be considered comparable and analogous to the concepts of j  na found in Eastern philosophy and traditions 


Definitions edit 
Many definitions of qualia have been proposed  One of the simpler  broader definitions is   The  what it is like  character of mental states  The way it feels to have mental states such as pain  seeing red  smelling a rose  etc             
In      C I  Lewis was the first to use the term  qualia  in its generally agreed upon modern sense            

There are recognizable qualitative characters of the given  which may be repeated in different experiences  and are thus a sort of universals  I call these  qualia   But although such qualia are universals  in the sense of being recognized from one to another experience  they must be distinguished from the properties of objects  Confusion of these two is characteristic of many historical conceptions  as well as of current essence theories  The quale is directly intuited  given  and is not the subject of any possible error because it is purely subjective                                  
Frank Jackson later defined qualia as           certain features of the bodily sensations especially  but also of certain perceptual experiences  which no amount of purely physical information includes                                   
Daniel Dennett suggested that qualia was  an unfamiliar term for something that could not be more familiar to each of us  the ways things seem to us              He identifies four properties that are commonly ascribed to qualia             According to these  qualia are 

ineffable        they cannot be communicated  or apprehended by any means other than direct experience 
intrinsic        they are non relational properties  which do not change depending on the experience s relation to other things 
private        all interpersonal comparisons of qualia are systematically impossible 
directly or immediately apprehensible by consciousness        to experience a quale is to know one experiences a quale  and to know all there is to know about that quale 
If qualia of this sort exist  then a normally sighted person who sees red would be unable to describe the experience of this perception in such a way that a listener who has never experienced color will be able to know everything there is to know about that experience  Though it is possible to make an analogy  such as  red looks hot   or to provide a description of the conditions under which the experience occurs  such as  it s the color you see when light of     nm wavelength is directed at you   supporters of this definition of qualia contend that such descriptions cannot provide a complete description of the experience                                  
Another way of defining qualia is as  raw feels   A raw feel is a perception in and of itself  considered entirely in isolation from any effect it might have on behavior and behavioral disposition             In contrast  a cooked feel is that perception seen in terms of its effects  For example  the perception of the taste of wine is an ineffable  raw feel  while the behavioral reaction one has to the warmth or bitterness caused by that taste of wine would be a cooked feel  Cooked feels are not qualia            
Arguably  the idea of hedonistic utilitarianism  where the ethical value of things is determined from the amount of subjective pleasure or pain they cause  is dependent on the existence of qualia                              improper synthesis      

Arguments regarding the existence of qualia edit 
Since  by definition  qualia cannot be fully conveyed verbally  they also cannot be demonstrated directly in an argument        a more nuanced approach is needed  Arguments for qualia generally come in the form of thought experiments designed to lead one to the conclusion that qualia exist             

Modern philosophy edit 
Inverted spectrum argument edit 
Main article  Inverted spectrum
Inverted qualia
The inverted spectrum thought experiment  originally developed by John Locke               invites us to imagine two individuals who perceive colors differently  where one person sees red  the other sees green  and vice versa  Despite this difference in their subjective experiences  they behave and communicate as if their perceptions are the same  and no physical or behavioral test can reveal the inversion  Critics of functionalism  and of physicalism more broadly  argue that if we can imagine this happening without contradiction  it follows that we are imagining a change in a property that determines the way things look to us  but that has no physical basis                          In more detail      citation needed     

Metaphysical identity requires necessity      note       
By definition  if something is possibly false  it is not necessary 
It is conceivable that different qualia could be produced by the same physical brain state      note       
If it is conceivable  then it is possible      note       
Since it is possible that different qualia could be produced by the same physical brain state  they cannot be identical to physical brain states  per    
Therefore  qualia are non physical 
The argument thus claims that if we find the inverted spectrum plausible  we must admit that qualia exist  and are non physical   Some philosophers     who       find it absurd that armchair theorizing can prove something to exist  and the detailed argument does involve a lot of assumptions about conceivability and possibility  which are open to criticism      citation needed     
The idea that an inverted spectrum would be undetectable in practice is also open to criticism on more scientific grounds  by C  L  Hardin  among others                          As Alex Byrne puts it 

   there are more perceptually distinguishable shades between red and blue than there are between green and yellow  which would make red green inversion behaviorally detectable  And there are yet further asymmetries  Dark yellow is brown  qualitatively different from yellow   whereas dark blue is blue      Similarly  desaturated bluish red is pink  qualitatively different from saturated bluish red   whereas desaturated greenish yellow is similar to saturated greenish yellow  Again  red is a  warm  color  whereas blue is  cool  and perhaps this is not a matter of learned associations with temperature             
According to David Chalmers  all  functionally isomorphic  systems  those with the same  fine grained functional organization   i e   the same information processing  will have qualitatively identical conscious experiences  He calls this the principle of organizational invariance  For example  it implies that a silicon chip that is functionally isomorphic to a brain will have the same perception of the color red  given the same sensory inputs  He proposed the thought experiment of the  dancing qualia  to demonstrate it  It is a reductio ad absurdum argument that starts by supposing that two such systems can have different qualia in the same situation  It involves a switch that enables to connect the main part of the brain with any of these two subsystems  For example  one subsystem can be a chunk of brain that causes to see an object as red  and the other one a silicon chip that causes to see an object as blue  Since both perform the same function within the brain  the subject would be unable to notice any change during the switch  Chalmers argues that this would be highly implausible if the qualia were truly switching between red and blue  hence the contradiction  Therefore  he concludes that the dancing qualia is impossible in practice  and the functionally isomorphic digital system would not only experience qualia  but it would have conscious experiences that are qualitatively identical to those of the biological system  e g   seeing the same color   He also proposed a similar thought experiment  named the fading qualia  that argues that it is not possible for the qualia to fade when each biological neuron is replaced by a functional equivalent                         
There is an actual experiment        albeit somewhat obscure        that parallels the inverted spectrum argument  George M  Stratton  professor of psychology at the University of California  Berkeley  performed an experiment in which he wore special prism glasses that caused the external world to appear upside down  After a few days of continually wearing the glasses  he adapted and the external world appeared upright to him  When he removed the glasses  his perception of the external world again returned to the  normal  perceptual state              If this argument provides evidence that qualia exist  it does not necessarily follow that they must be non physical  because that distinction should be considered a separate epistemological issue       failed verification     

Analytic philosophy edit 
 What s it like to be   argument edit 
Main article  Subjective character of experience
Thomas Nagel argues that while a human might be able to imagine what it is like to be a bat by taking  the bat s point of view   it would still be impossible  to know what it is like for a bat to be a bat    Townsend s big eared bat pictured  
American philosopher Thomas Nagel s paper What Is it Like to Be a Bat              is often cited in debates about qualia  though it does not use the word  qualia   Nagel argues that consciousness has an essentially subjective character  a what it is like aspect  He states that  an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism        something it is like for the organism               Nagel suggests that this subjective aspect may never be sufficiently accounted for by the objective methods of reductionistic science  He claims that  if we acknowledge that a physical theory of mind must account for the subjective character of experience  we must admit that no presently available conception gives us a clue about how this could be done                                     Furthermore   it seems unlikely that any physical theory of mind can be contemplated until more thought has been given to the general problem of subjective and objective                                    

Zombie argument edit 
Main article  Philosophical zombie
Saul Kripke argues that one key consequence of the claim that such things as raw feels  or qualia  can be meaningfully discussed is that it leads to the logical possibility of two entities exhibiting identical behavior in all ways despite one of them entirely lacking qualia              While few claim that such an entity  called a philosophical zombie  actually exists  the possibility is raised as a refutation of physicalism              and in defense of the hard problem of consciousness  the problem of accounting for  in physical terms  subjective  intrinsic  first person experiences              
The argument holds that it is conceivable for a person to have a duplicate  identical in every physical way  but lacking consciousness  called a  philosophical zombie   It would appear exactly the same as the original person  in both behavior and speech  just without subjective phenomenology  For these zombies to exist  qualia must not arise from any specific part or parts of the brain  for if it did there would be no difference between  normal humans  and philosophical zombies  The zombie normal human distinction can only be valid if subjective consciousness is separate from the physical brain             
According to Chalmers  the simplest form of the argument goes as follows 

It is conceivable that there be zombies
If it is conceivable that there be zombies  it is metaphysically possible that there be zombies 
If it is metaphysically possible that there be zombies  then consciousness is non physical 
Consciousness is nonphysical                                   
Former AI researcher Marvin Minsky sees the argument as circular  He says the proposition of something physically identical to a human but without subjective experience assumes that the physical characteristics of humans cannot produce consciousness  which is exactly what the argument claims to prove  In other words  it tries to prove consciousness is nonphysical by assuming consciousness is nonphysical                                 

Explanatory gap argument edit 
Main article  Explanatory gap
Joseph Levine s paper Conceivability  Identity  and the Explanatory Gap takes up where the criticisms of conceivability arguments  such as the inverted spectrum argument and the zombie argument  leave off  Levine agrees that conceivability is a flawed means of establishing metaphysical realities  but points out that even if we come to the metaphysical conclusion that qualia are physical  there is still an explanatory problem 

While I think this materialist response is right in the end  it does not suffice to put the mind body problem to rest  Even if conceivability considerations do not establish that the mind is in fact distinct from the body  or that mental properties are metaphysically irreducible to physical properties  still they do demonstrate that we lack an explanation of the mental in terms of the physical             
However  such an epistemological or explanatory problem might indicate an underlying metaphysical issue  as even if not proven by conceivability arguments  the non physicality of qualia is far from ruled out 

In the end  we are right back where we started  The explanatory gap argument doesn t demonstrate a gap in nature  but a gap in our understanding of nature  Of course a plausible explanation for there being a gap in our understanding of nature is that there is a genuine gap in nature  But so long as we have countervailing reasons for doubting the latter  we have to look elsewhere for an explanation of the former             
Knowledge argument edit 
Main article  Knowledge argument
Did Mary learn something new 
In       F  C  Jackson offered what he calls the  knowledge argument  for qualia  It goes as follows 

Mary is a brilliant scientist who is  for whatever reason  forced to investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and white television monitor  She specializes in the neurophysiology of vision and acquires all the physical information there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes or the sky and use terms like  red    blue   and so on  She discovers  for example  just which wavelength combinations from the sky stimulate the retina  and exactly how this produces via the central nervous system the contraction of the vocal cords and expulsion of air from the lungs that results in the uttering of the sentence  The sky is blue   What happens when Mary is released from her black and white room or is given a color television monitor  Does she learn anything new or not 
Jackson claimed that she does                                  
This thought experiment has two purposes  First  it is intended to show that qualia exist  If we accept the thought experiment  we believe that upon leaving the room Mary gains something  the knowledge of a particular thing that she did not possess before  That knowledge  Jackson argues  is knowledge of the quale that corresponds to the experience of seeing red  and it must thus be conceded that qualia are real properties  since there is a difference between a person who has access to a particular quale and one who does not                                  
The second purpose of this argument is to refute the physicalist account of the mind  Specifically  the knowledge argument is an attack on the physicalist claim about the completeness of physical truths  The challenge posed to physicalism by the knowledge argument runs as follows 

While in the room  Mary has acquired all the physical facts there are about color sensations  including the sensation of seeing red 
When Mary exits the room and sees a ripe red tomato  she learns a new fact about the sensation of seeing red  namely its subjective character 
Therefore  there are non physical facts about color sensations   From      
If there are non physical facts about color sensations  then color sensations are non physical events 
Therefore  color sensations are non physical events   From      
If color sensations are non physical events  then physicalism is false 
Therefore  physicalism is false   From                  
Some critics argue that Mary s confinement to a monochromatic environment wouldn t prevent her from forming color experiences or that she might deduce what colors look like from her complete physical knowledge  Others suggest that the thought experiment s conceivability might conflict with current or future scientific understanding of vision  but defenders maintain that its purpose is to challenge materialism conceptually  not scientifically             
Early in his career Jackson argued that qualia are epiphenomenal  meaning they have no causal influence on the physical world             The issue with this view is that if qualia are non physical  it becomes unclear how they can have any effect on the brain or behavior  Jackson later rejected epiphenomenalism  arguing that knowledge about qualia is impossible if they are epiphenomenal  He concluded that there must be an issue with the knowledge argument  eventually embracing a representationalist account  arguing that sensory experiences can be understood in physical terms             

Proponents of qualia edit 
Analytic philosophy edit 
David Chalmers edit 
David Chalmers formulated the hard problem of consciousness  which raised the issue of qualia to a new level of importance and acceptance in the field of the philosophy of mind              In      Chalmers argued for what he called  the principle of organizational invariance   if a system such as one of appropriately configured computer hardware reproduces the functional organization of the brain  it will also reproduce the qualia associated with the brain             

E  J  Lowe edit 
E       J  Lowe denies that indirect realism  wherein which we have access only to sensory features internal to the brain  necessarily implies a Cartesian dualism  He agrees with Bertrand Russell that the way images are received by our retinas  our  retinal images   are connected to  patterns of neural activity in the cortex               He defends a version of the causal theory of perception in which a causal path can be traced between the external object and the perception of it  He is careful to deny that we do any inferring from the sensory field  he believes this allows us to build an access to knowledge on that causal connection  In a later work he moves closer to the non epistemic argument in that he postulates  a wholly non conceptual component of perceptual experience              

J  B  Maund edit 
John Barry Maund  an Australian philosopher of perception  argues that qualia can be described on two levels  a fact that he refers to as  dual coding              
Maund extended his argument with reference to color              Color he sees as a dispositional property  not an objective one  Colors are  virtual properties   which means they are as if things possessed them  Although the na ve view attributes them to objects  they are intrinsic  non relational  inner experiences  This allows for the different perceptions between person and person  and also leaves aside the claim that external objects are colored 

Moreland Perkins edit 
In his book Sensing the World              Moreland Perkins argues that qualia need not be identified as their objective sources  a smell  for instance  bears no direct resemblance to the molecular shape that gives rise to it  nor is a toothache actually in the tooth  Like Hobbes he views the process of sensing as complete in itself  as he puts it  it is not like  kicking a football  where an external object is required        it is more like  kicking a kick   This explanation evades the Homunculus Objection  as adhered to by Gilbert Ryle  among others  Ryle was unable to entertain this possibility  protesting that  in effect it explained the having of sensations as the not having of sensations               However  A  J  Ayer called this objection  very weak  as it betrayed an inability to detach the notion of eyes  or indeed any sensory organ  from the neural sensory experience             

Howard Robinson and William Robinson edit 
Philosopher Howard Robinson argued against reducing sensory experiences to physical explanations  He defended the theory of sense data  maintaining that sensory experiences involve qualia  As a dualist  Robinson held that mind and matter have distinct metaphysical natures  He maintained that the knowledge argument shows that physicalism fails to account for the qualitative nature of qualia             
Similarly  William Robinson  in Understanding Phenomenal Consciousness              advocates for dualism and rejects the idea of reducing phenomenal experience to neural processes  His theory of Qualitative Event Realism proposes that phenomenal consciousness consists of immaterial events caused by brain activity but not reducible to it  He seeks to conciliate dualism with scientific methodology  aiming for a future unified theory that respects both phenomenal qualities and scientific explanations             

Neuroscience edit 
Gerald Edelman edit 
In his book Bright Air  Brilliant Fire  neuroscientist and Nobel laureate in Physiology   Medicine Gerald Edelman says  that  it  definitely does not seem feasible       to ignore completely the reality of qualia   As he sees it  it is impossible to explain color  sensations  and similar experiences  to a  qualia free  observer  by description alone  Edelman argues that proposing such a theory of consciousness is proposing  a theory based on a kind of God s eye view of consciousness  and that any scientific theory requires the assumption  that observers have sensation as well as perception   He concludes by stating that assuming a theory that requires neither could exist  is to indulge the errors of theories that attempt syntactical formulations mapped onto objectivist interpretations        theories that ignore embodiment as a source of meaning  There is no qualia free scientific observer                                    

Antonio Damasio edit 
Neurologist Antonio Damasio  in his book The Feeling Of What Happens  defines qualia as  the simple sensory qualities to be found in the blueness of the sky or the tone of sound produced by a cello  and the fundamental components of the images in the movie metaphor are thus made of qualia                                    
Damasio points out that  in all likelihood  I will never know your thoughts unless you tell me  and you will never know mine until I tell you   The reason he gives for this is that  the mind and its consciousness are first and foremost private phenomena  that are personal  private experiences that should be investigated as such  While he believes that trying to study these experiences  by the study of their behavioral correlates is wrong   he does think they can be studied as  the idea that subjective experiences are not scientifically accessible is nonsense   In his view the way to do this is for  enough observers  to  undertake rigorous observations according to the same experimental design  and       that those observations be checked for consistency across observers and that they yield some form of measurement   He also thinks that  subjective observations       can inspire objective experiments  and  be explained in terms of the available scientific knowledge                                        
In his mind 

The resistance found in some scientific quarters to the use of subjective observations is a revisitation of an old argument between behaviorists  who believed that only behaviors  not mental experiences  could be studied objectively  and cognitivists  who believed that studying only behavior did not do justice to human complexity                                   
Rodolfo Llin s edit 
Neurologist Rodolfo Llin s states in his book I of the Vortex that qualia  from a neurological perspective  are essential for an organism s survival and played a key role in the evolution of nervous systems  including in simple creatures like ants or cockroaches                                       
Llin s contends that qualia are a product of neuronal oscillation and cites anesthesia experiments  showing that qualia can be  turned off  by altering brain oscillations while other connections remain intact                                       

Vilayanur Ramachandran edit 
Vilayanur S  Ramachandran
Vilayanur S  Ramachandran and William Hirstein             proposed three laws of qualia  with a fourth later added   which are  functional criteria that need to be fulfilled in order for certain neural events to be associated with qualia  by philosophers of the mind 


Qualia are irrevocable and indubitable  You don t say  maybe it is red but I can visualize it as green if I want to   An explicit neural representation of red is created that invariably and automatically  reports  this to higher brain centres 
Once the representation is created  what can be done with it is open ended  You have the luxury of choice  e g   if you have the percept of an apple you can use it to tempt Adam  to keep the doctor away  bake a pie  or just to eat  Even though the representation at the input level is immutable and automatic  the output is potentially infinite  This isn t true for  say  a spinal reflex arc where the output is also inevitable and automatic  Indeed  a paraplegic can even have an erection and ejaculate without an orgasm 
Short term memory  The input invariably creates a representation that persists in short term memory        long enough to allow time for choice of output  Without this component  again  you get just a reflex arc 
Attention  Qualia and attention are closely linked  You need attention to fulfill criterion number two  to choose  A study of circuits involved in attention  therefore  will shed much light on the riddle of qualia             
These authors approach qualia from an empirical perspective and not as a logical or philosophical problem  They wonder how qualia evolved  and in doing so consider a skeptical point of view in which  since the objective scientific description of the world is complete without qualia  it is nonsense to ask why they evolved or what they are for  However they decide against this skeptical view 
Based on the parsimony principle of Occam s razor  one could accept epiphenomenalism and deny qualia  since they are not necessary for a description of the functioning of the brain  However  they argue that Occam s razor is not useful for scientific discovery              For example  the discovery of relativity in physics was not the product of accepting Occam s razor but rather of rejecting it and asking the question of whether a deeper generalization  not required by the currently available data  was true and would allow for unexpected predictions  Most scientific discoveries arise  these authors argue  from ontologically promiscuous conjectures     clarification needed      that do not come from current data 
The authors then point out that skepticism might be justified in the philosophical field  but that science is the wrong place for skepticism  such as asking if  your red is not my green  or if we can be logically certain that we are not dreaming  Science  these authors assert  deals with what is probably true  beyond reasonable doubt  not with what can be known with complete and absolute certainty  The authors say that most neuroscientists and even most psychologists dispute the very existence of the problem of qualia             

Critics of qualia edit 
Daniel Dennett edit 
Daniel Dennett
In Consciousness Explained             and Quining Qualia              Daniel Dennett argues against qualia by claiming that the  knowledge argument  breaks down if one tries to apply it practically  In a series of thought experiments  which he calls intuition pumps  he brings qualia into the world of neurosurgery  clinical psychology  and psychological experimentation  He argues that  once the concept of qualia is so imported  we can either make no use of it  or the questions introduced by it are unanswerable precisely because of the special properties defining qualia                                       
In Dennett s updated version of the inverted spectrum thought experiment  which he calls alternative neurosurgery  you again awake to find that your qualia have been inverted        grass appears red  the sky appears orange  etc  According to the original account  you should be immediately aware that something has gone horribly wrong  Dennett argues  however  that it is impossible to know whether the diabolical neurosurgeons have indeed inverted your qualia  e g  by tampering with your optic nerve   or have simply inverted your connection to memories of past qualia  Since both operations would produce the same result  you would have no means on your own to tell which operation has actually been conducted  and you are thus in the odd position of not knowing whether there has been a change in your  immediately apprehensible  qualia             
Dennett argues that for qualia to be taken seriously as a component of experience        for them to make sense as a discrete concept        it must be possible to show that 

it is possible to know that a change in qualia has occurred  as opposed to a change in something else                           or thatthere is a difference between having a change in qualia and not having one 
Dennett attempts to show that we cannot satisfy  a  either through introspection or through observation  and that qualia s very definition undermines its chances of satisfying  b              
Supporters of qualia point out that in order for you to notice a change in qualia  you must compare your current qualia with your memories of past qualia  Arguably  such a comparison would involve immediate assessment of your current qualia and your memories of past qualia  but not of the past qualia themselves  Furthermore  modern functional brain imaging has increasingly suggested that the memory of an experience is processed in similar ways  and in similar zones of the brain  as the original perception             
This may mean that there would be asymmetric outcomes between altering the mechanism of perception of qualia and altering the memory of that qualia  If the diabolical neurosurgery altered the immediate perception of qualia  the inversion might not be noticed directly  since the brain zones which re process the memories would invert the remembered qualia  On the other hand  alteration of the qualia memories themselves would be processed without inversion  and thus you would perceive them as an inversion  Thus  you might know immediately if memory of your qualia had been altered  but might not know if immediate qualia were inverted or whether the diabolical neurosurgeons had done a sham procedure             
Dennett responds to the Mary the color scientist thought experiment by arguing that Mary would not  in fact  learn something new if she stepped out of her black and white room to see the color red  Dennett asserts that if she already truly knew  everything about color   that knowledge would include a deep understanding of why and how human neurology causes us to sense the quale of color  Mary would therefore already know exactly what to expect upon seeing red  before ever leaving the room                                  
Dennett argues that the misleading aspect of the story is that Mary is supposed to not merely be knowledgeable about color but to actually know all the physical facts about it  which would be a knowledge so deep that it exceeds what can be imagined  and twists our intuitions  If Mary really does know everything physical there is to know about the experience of color  then this effectively grants her almost omniscient powers of knowledge  Using this  she will be able to deduce her own reaction  and figure out exactly what the experience of seeing red will feel like                                     
Dennett finds that many people find it difficult to see this  so he uses the case of RoboMary to further illustrate what it would be like for Mary to possess such a vast knowledge of the physical workings of the human brain and color vision  RoboMary is an intelligent robot who  instead of having color cameras as eyes  has a software lock such that they are only able to perceive black and white and shades in between                                     
RoboMary can examine the computer brain of similar non color locked robots when they see red  and see exactly how they react and what kinds of impulses occur  RoboMary can also construct a simulation of her own brain  unlock the simulation s color lock and  with reference to the other robots  simulate exactly how this simulation of herself reacts to seeing red  RoboMary naturally has control over all of her internal states except for the color lock  With the knowledge of her simulation s internal states upon seeing red  RoboMary can put her own internal states directly into the states they would be in upon seeing red  In this way  without ever actually seeing red through her cameras  she will know exactly what it is like to see red                                  
Dennett uses this example as an attempt to show us that Mary s all encompassing physical knowledge makes her own internal states as transparent as those of a robot or computer  and it is as straightforward for her to figure out exactly how it feels to see red                                     
Perhaps Mary s failure to learn exactly what seeing red feels like is simply a failure of language  or a failure of our ability to describe experiences  An alien race with a different method of communication or description might be perfectly able to teach their version of Mary exactly how seeing the color red would feel  Perhaps it is simply a uniquely human failing to communicate first person experiences from a third person perspective  Dennett suggests that the description might even be possible using English  He uses a simpler version of the Mary thought experiment to show how this might work  What if Mary was in a room without triangles and was prevented from seeing or making any triangles  An English language description of just a few words would be sufficient for her to imagine what it is like to see a triangle        she can simply and directly visualize a triangle in her mind  Similarly  Dennett proposes  it is perfectly  logically  possible that the quale of what it is like to see red could eventually be described in an English language description of millions or billions of words             
In Are we explaining consciousness yet               Dennett approves of an account of qualia defined as the deep  rich collection of individual neural responses that are too fine grained for language to capture  For instance  a person might have an alarming reaction to yellow because of a yellow car that hit her previously  and someone else might have a nostalgic reaction to a comfort food  These effects are too individual specific to be captured by English words   If one dubs this inevitable residue qualia  then qualia are guaranteed to exist  but they are just more of the same  dispositional properties that have not yet been entered in the catalog              

Paul Churchland edit 
According to Paul Churchland  Mary might be considered akin to a feral child who suffered extreme isolation during childhood  Technically when Mary leaves the room  she would not have the ability to see or know what the color red is  as a brain has to learn and develop how to see colors  Patterns need to form in the V  section of the visual cortex  which occurs via exposure to wavelengths of light  This exposure needs to occur during the early stages of brain development  In Mary s case  the identifications and categorizations of color will only be in respect to representations of black and white             

Gary Drescher edit 
In his book Good and Real              Gary Drescher compares qualia with  gensyms   generated symbols  in Common Lisp  These are objects that Lisp treats as having no properties or components  which can only be identified as equal or not equal to other objects  Drescher explains   we have no introspective access to whatever internal properties make the red gensym recognizably distinct from the green       even though we know the sensation when we experience it               Under this interpretation of qualia  Drescher responds to the Mary thought experiment by noting that  knowing about red related cognitive structures and the dispositions they engender        even if that knowledge were implausibly detailed and exhaustive        would not necessarily give someone who lacks prior color experience the slightest clue whether the card now being shown is of the color called red   However  this does not imply that our experience of red is non mechanical  as  gensyms are a routine feature of computer programming languages                                   

David Lewis edit 
David K  Lewis introduced a hypothesis about types of knowledge and their transmission in qualia cases  Lewis agrees that Mary cannot learn what red looks like through her monochrome physicalist studies  but he proposes that this does not matter  Learning transmits information  but experiencing qualia does not transmit information  it communicates abilities  When Mary sees red  she does not acquire any new information  she instead gains new abilities  Now she can remember what red looks like  imagine what other red things might look like and recognize further instances of redness 
Lewis states that Jackson s thought experiment uses the phenomenal information hypothesis        that is  that the new knowledge that Mary gains upon seeing red is phenomenal information  Lewis then proposes a different ability hypothesis that differentiates between two types of knowledge  knowledge  that   information  and knowledge  how   abilities   Normally the two are entangled  ordinary learning is also an experience of the subject concerned  and people learn both information  for instance  that Freud was a psychologist  and gain ability  to recognize images of Freud   However  in the thought experiment  Mary can use ordinary learning only to gain  that  knowledge  She is prevented from using experience to gain the  how  knowledge that would allow her to remember  imagine and recognize the color red 
We have the intuition that Mary has been deprived of some vital data to do with the experience of redness  It is also uncontroversial that some things cannot be learned inside the room  for example  Mary cannot learn how to ski within the room  Lewis has articulated that information and ability are potentially different things  In this way  physicalism is still compatible with the conclusion that Mary gains new knowledge  It is also useful for considering other instances of qualia         being a bat  is an ability  so it is  how  knowledge             

Marvin Minsky edit 
Marvin Minsky
Artificial intelligence researcher Marvin Minsky thinks the problems posed by qualia are essentially issues of complexity  or rather of mistaking complexity for simplicity 

Now  a philosophical dualist might then complain   You ve described how hurting affects your mind        but you still can t express how hurting feels   This  I maintain  is a huge mistake        that attempt to reify  feeling  as an independent entity  with an essence that s indescribable  As I see it  feelings are not strange alien things  It is precisely those cognitive changes themselves that constitute what  hurting  is        and this also includes all those clumsy attempts to represent and summarize those changes  The big mistake comes from looking for some single  simple   essence  of hurting  rather than recognizing that this is the word we use for complex rearrangement of our disposition of resources             
Michael Tye edit 
Michael Tye
Michael Tye believes there are no qualia  no  veils of perception  between us and the referents of our thought  He describes our experience of an object in the world as  transparent   meaning that no matter what private understandings and or misunderstandings we may have of something  it is still there before us in reality  The idea that qualia intervene between ourselves and their origins he regards as a  massive error  That is just not credible  It seems totally implausible       that visual experience is systematically misleading in this way   He continues   the only objects of which you are aware are the external ones making up the scene before your eyes                                      
From this he concludes  that there are no such qualities of experiences  They are qualities of external surfaces  and volumes and films   if they are qualities of anything   Thus he believes we can take our experiences at face value since there is no fear of losing contact with the realness of physical objects                                  
In Tye s thought there is no question of qualia without information being contained within them  it is always  an awareness that  and always  representational   He characterizes the perception of children as a misperception of referents that are undoubtedly as present for them as they are for grown ups  As he puts it  they may not know that  the house is dilapidated   but there is no doubt about their seeing the house  After images are dismissed as presenting no problem for the transparency theory because  as he puts it  after images being illusory  there is nothing that one sees                                     
Tye proposes that phenomenal experience has five basic elements  for which he has coined the acronym PANIC        Poised  Abstract  Nonconceptual  Intentional Content                                  

 Poised    the phenomenal experience is always present to the understanding  whether or not the agent is able to apply a concept to it 
 Abstract    it is unclear whether you are in touch with a concrete object  for example  someone may feel a pain in an amputated limb  
 Nonconceptual    phenomenon can exist although one does not have the concept by which to recognize it 
 Intentional  Content     it represents something  whether or not the observer is taking advantage of that fact 
Tye adds that the experience is like a map in that  in most cases  it goes beyond the shapes  edges  volumes  etc  in the world        you may not be reading the a map but  as with an actual map there is a reliable match with what it is mapping  This is why Tye calls his theory representationalism  makes it plain that Tye believes that he has retained a direct contact with what produces the phenomena and is therefore not hampered by any trace of a  veil of perception              

Roger Scruton edit 
Roger Scruton  while skeptical that neurobiology can tell us much about consciousness  believes qualia is an incoherent concept  and that Wittgenstein s private language argument effectively disproves it  Scruton writes 

The belief that these essentially private features of mental states exist  and that they form the introspectible essence of whatever possesses them  is grounded in a confusion  one that Wittgenstein tried to sweep away in his arguments against the possibility of a private language  When you judge that I am in pain  it is on the basis of my circumstances and behavior  and you could be wrong  When I ascribe a pain to myself  I don t use any such evidence  I don t find out that I am in pain by observation  nor can I be wrong  But that is not because there is some other fact about my pain  accessible only to me  which I consult in order to establish what I am feeling  For if there were this inner private quality  I could misperceive it  I could get it wrong  and I would have to find out whether I am in pain  To describe my inner state  I would also have to invent a language  intelligible only to me        and that  Wittgenstein plausibly argues  is impossible  The conclusion to draw is that I ascribe pain to myself not on the basis of some inner quale but on no basis at all             
In his book On Human Nature              Scruton poses a potential line of criticism to this  which is that while Wittgenstein s private language argument does disprove the concept of reference to qualia  or the idea that we can talk  even to ourselves  of their nature  it does not disprove their existence altogether  Scruton believes that this is a valid criticism  and this is why he stops short of actually saying that qualia do not exist  and instead merely suggests that we should abandon the concept  However  he quotes Wittgenstein in response   Whereof one cannot speak  thereof one must be silent              

History edit 
Main article  Leibniz s gap
Leibniz s passage in Monadology describing the explanatory gap goes as follows It must be confessed  moreover  that perception  and that which depends on it  are inexplicable by mechanical causes  that is  by figures and motions  And  supposing that there were a mechanism so constructed as to think  feel and have perception  we might enter it as into a mill  And this granted  we should only find on visiting it  pieces which push one against another  but never anything by which to explain a perception  This must be sought  therefore  in the simple substance  and not in the composite or in the machine
