ACM Conference on Fairness  Accountability  and Transparency  ACM FAccT  formerly known as ACM FAT   is a peer reviewed academic conference series about ethics and computing systems             Sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery  this conference focuses on issues such as algorithmic transparency  fairness in machine learning  bias  and ethics from a multi disciplinary perspective             The conference community includes computer scientists  statisticians  social scientists  scholars of law  and others            
The conference is sponsored by Big Tech companies such as Facebook  Twitter  and Google  and large foundations such as the Rockefeller Foundation  Ford Foundation  MacArthur Foundation  and Luminate             Sponsors contribute to a general fund  no  earmarked  contributions are allowed  and have no say in the selection  substance  or structure of the conference            


FATE Overview edit 
The acronym FATE refers to Fairness  Accountability  Transparency  and Ethics in sociotechnical systems        FATE is a topic of rising interest as the societal and ethical implications of complex systems such as artificial intelligence  AI   machine learning  ML   and natural language processing  NLP  are increasing  The topic provides an interdisciplinary challenge of bridging the gap of transparency between technical and non technical academics and policy makers to ensure the safety and equity of algorithmic systems as they advance at a rapid rate                   Some solutions and techniques that have been discovered include Explainable artificial intelligence  XAI  
Recent adoptions of AI in both the public and private sector include the predictive recidivism algorithm  otherwise known as COMPAS  which was deployed in the US Court  as well as Amazon s AI Powered recruitment tool  later proven to favor male over female applicants        Further  AI based decision support  ADS  powered by machine learning techniques is more commonly being integrated across fields including criminal justice  education  and benefits provision                   FATE functions as a means to look further into algorithms to raise awareness and work towards a solution        Companies such as Microsoft have created research teams specifically devoted to the topic            

Key Research Areas and Emerging Trends in FATE edit 
The FAccT Conference      is looking for articles specifically within the following areas  Audits and Evaluation Practices  System Development and Deployment  Experiences and Interactions  Critical Studies  Law and Policy  and Philosophy 

Impact and Influence edit 
The research from the ACM FAccT conference has greatly influenced both public rules and how companies operate  Governments and organizations have used ideas from the conference to create guidelines and policies  For example  studies on bias in algorithms have helped change hiring methods at big tech companies  making them fairer  Additionally  laws about how artificial intelligence  AI  should be managed have been shaped by this research  The conference has also helped guide global discussions about ethical AI  contributing to important guidelines like the European Union s AI Act and the AI Principles from the OECD 

Criticisms and Controversies edit 
Although the ACM FAccT conference is well regarded  it has received some criticism  Some people say that the ideas shared at the conference are often too focused on theory and may not work well for real world issues  Others have noticed that even though the conference talks about fairness and transparency in AI  the companies that sponsor it don t always create technology that follows these values  There is also debate about whether the conference can stay truly independent while receiving money from big tech companies
