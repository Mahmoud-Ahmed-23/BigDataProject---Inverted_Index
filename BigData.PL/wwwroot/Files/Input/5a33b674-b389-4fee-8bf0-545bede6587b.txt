OpenCVis a huge open source library for computer vision  machine learning  and image processing  OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages like Python  C    Java  etc  It can process images and videos to identify objects  faces  or even the handwriting of a human  When it is integrated with various libraries  such as 
Numpy
which is a highly optimized library for numerical operations  then the number of weapons increases in your Arsenal i e  whatever operations one can do in Numpy can be combined with OpenCV    This OpenCV tutorial will help you learn Image processing from Basics to advanced  like operations on Images and videos using a huge set of Programs and projects
