							India       s Chandrayaan   mission has revealed the Earth s geomagnetic tail has a significant impact on the Moon       s ionosphere  challenging prior assumptions about plasma behaviour in the lunar environment  The findings were reported by Trinity Mirror  a partner of TV BRICS 
The mission uncovered unexpectedly high electron densities in the Moon       s ionosphere when it passes through the Earth       s geomagnetic tail  The study suggests that lunar crustal magnetic fields may play a greater role in shaping plasma dynamics than previously understood 
Researchers used an innovative two way radio occultation experiment  analysing S band telemetry and telecommand signals transmitted by the Chandrayaan   orbiter  The signals revealed electron densities reaching approximately        electrons per cubic centimetre  nearly     times higher than those observed on the Moon s sunlit side 
The new findings suggest remnant lunar crustal magnetic fields could be trapping plasma  preventing its dissipation  and leading to localised electron density enhancements 
These insights are crucial for future robotic and crewed missions to the Moon  as high plasma densities can affect radio communications  surface charging  and lunar dust interactions
