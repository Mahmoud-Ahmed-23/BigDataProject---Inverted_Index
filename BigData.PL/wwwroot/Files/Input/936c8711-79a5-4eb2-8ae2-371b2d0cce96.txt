In       Goldman Sachs was founded by Marcus Goldman in New York City in a one room basement office next to a coal chute                                   In       Goldman s son in law Samuel Sachs joined the firm                         In       Goldman s son  Henry Goldman  and his son in law  Ludwig Dreyfuss  joined the business and the firm adopted its present name  Goldman Sachs  amp  Co              The company pioneered the use of commercial paper for entrepreneurs and joined the New York Stock Exchange  NYSE  in                   By       the firm s capital stood at           million              It opened offices in Boston and Chicago in       San Francisco in       and Philadelphia and St  Louis in                  
Goldman entered the initial public offering market in      when it took Sears  Roebuck and Company public              The deal was facilitated by Henry Goldman s personal friendship with Julius Rosenwald  an owner of Sears              Other underwriting work for initial public offerings followed  including those of General Cigar Company also in       F  W  Woolworth Company in       and Continental Can                          The firm was an innovator at establishing the price earnings ratio  instead of book value  as a method for valuing companies  and was therefore able to raise funds for retailers and companies with few hard assets             
In       Henry S  Bowers became the first non member of the founding family to become a partner of the company and share in its profits              In       under growing pressure from the other partners in the firm due to his pro German stance  Henry Goldman resigned              The Sachs family gained full control of the firm until Waddill Catchings joined the company in                   By       Catchings was the Goldman partner with the single largest stake in the firm              In       the company acquired a major interest in Merck  amp  Co  and in       it acquired a major interest in General Foods              On December          the firm launched the Goldman Sachs Trading Corp Ad  a closed end fund              The fund failed during the Wall Street Crash of       amid accusations that Goldman had engaged in share price manipulation and insider trading             

          edit 
In       during the Great Depression  the firm ousted Catchings  and Sidney Weinberg assumed the role of senior partner  Weinberg shifted Goldman s focus away from trading and toward investment banking              His actions helped to restore some of Goldman s tarnished reputation  Under Weinberg s leadership  Goldman was the lead advisor on the           million initial public offering of Ford Motor Company in       a major victory at the time  as well as the           million debenture offering by Sears Roebuck in                   Under Weinberg s leadership  the firm started an investment research division and a municipal bond department  and it became an early innovator in risk arbitrage             
In the     s  Gus Levy joined the firm as a securities trader  where two powers fought for supremacy  one from investment banking and one from securities trading  Levy was a pioneer in block trading and the firm established this trend under his guidance  Due to Weinberg s heavy influence  the firm formed an investment banking division in      in an attempt to shift focus off Weinberg              In       the company s headquarters were relocated to    Broad Street  New York City             
In       Levy took over Weinberg s role as Senior Partner and built Goldman s trading franchise once again              Levy is credited with Goldman s famous philosophy of being  long term greedy   which implied that as long as money is made over the long term  short term losses are bearable  At the same time  partners reinvested nearly all of their earnings in the firm              Weinberg remained a senior partner of the firm and died in July of that year

Controversies and legal issues edit 
Main article  Goldman Sachs controversies
This section may be too long and excessively detailed  Please consider summarizing the material    March      
The company has been criticized for lack of ethical standards               working with dictatorial regimes               close relationships with the U S  federal government via a  revolving door  of former employees               and driving up prices of commodities through futures speculation               It has also been criticized by its employees for     hour work weeks  high levels of employee dissatisfaction among first year analysts  abusive treatment by superiors  a lack of mental health resources  and extremely high levels of stress in the workplace leading to physical discomfort                           

Role in the      financial crisis edit 
Goldman was criticized for allegedly misleading its investors and profiting from the collapse of the mortgage market during the      financial crisis  This led to investigations from the United States Congress  the United States Department of Justice  and a lawsuit from the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission              that resulted in Goldman paying a           million settlement in July                    Goldman Sachs denied wrongdoing and stated that its customers were aware of its bets against the mortgage related security products it was selling to them  and that it only used those bets to hedge against losses                           
Goldman Sachs was  excoriated by the press and the public  according to journalists Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera               This was despite the non retail nature of its business that would normally have kept it out of the public eye               In a story in Rolling Stone published in July       Matt Taibbi characterized Goldman Sachs as a  great vampire squid  sucking money instead of blood  allegedly engineering  every major market manipulation since the Great Depression     from tech stocks to high gas prices                                                      
While all the investment banks were scolded by congressional investigations  Goldman Sachs was subject to  a solo hearing in front of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  and a critical report                            In       a Senate panel released a report accusing Goldman Sachs of misleading clients and engaging in conflicts of interest              

Bonuses paid to employees in      despite financial crisis edit 
In June       after the firm repaid the TARP investment from the U S  Treasury  Goldman made some of the largest bonus payments in its history due to its strong financial performance  setting aside a record            billion for bonus payments                                                                   Andrew Cuomo  then New York Attorney General  questioned Goldman s decision to pay     employees bonuses of at least         million each after it received TARP funds in                    That same period  however  CEO Lloyd Blankfein and   other senior executives opted to forgo bonuses  stating they believed it was the right thing to do because they were part of the industry that caused economic distress              

Benefits from the government bailout of AIG edit 
American International Group received           billion in government loans during the financial crisis  much of which was used to pay counterparties under credit default swaps purchased from AIG  Goldman Sachs received            billion  However  due to the size and nature of the payouts  there was considerable controversy in the media and among some politicians as to whether banks  including Goldman Sachs  should have been forced to take greater losses and should not have been paid in full via government loans to AIG                                                                                If the government let AIG default  according to money manager Michael Lewitt   its collapse would be as close to an extinction level event as the financial markets have seen since the Great Depression               

Firm s response to criticism of AIG payments edit 
Goldman Sachs maintained that its net exposure to AIG was  not material   and that the firm was protected by hedges  in the form of CDSs with other counterparties  and           billion of collateral  which would have protected the bank from incurring an economic loss in the event of an AIG bankruptcy or failure                            The firm stated the cost of these hedges to be over           million               CFO David Viniar stated that profits related to AIG in the first quarter of       rounded to zero   and profits in December were not significant and that he was  mystified  by the interest the government and investors have shown in the bank s trading relationship with AIG               Speculation remains that Goldman s hedges against its AIG exposure would not have paid out if AIG was allowed to fail  According to a report by the United States Office of the Inspector General of TARP  if AIG had collapsed  it would have made it difficult for Goldman to liquidate its trading positions with AIG  even at discounts  and it also would have put pressure on other counterparties that  might have made it difficult for Goldman Sachs to collect on the credit protection it had purchased against an AIG default   Finally  the report said  an AIG default would have forced Goldman Sachs to bear the risk of declines in the value of billions of dollars in collateral debt obligations               Goldman argued that CDSs are marked to market  i e  valued at their current market price  and their positions netted between counterparties daily  Thus  as the cost of insuring AIG s obligations against default rose substantially in the lead up to its bailout  the sellers of the CDS contracts had to post more collateral to Goldman Sachs  The firm claims this meant its hedges were effective and the firm would have been protected against an AIG bankruptcy and the risk of knock on defaults  had AIG been allowed to fail               However  in practice  the collateral would not protect fully against losses both because protection sellers would not be required to post collateral that covered the complete loss during a bankruptcy and because the value of the collateral would be highly uncertain following the repercussions of an AIG bankruptcy              

Possible benefits from attendance at September           meetings at the New York Federal Reserve edit 
Although many have said there is no evidence to support the claim               some have argued that Goldman Sachs received preferential treatment from the government by participating in the crucial September meetings at the New York Fed  which decided AIG s fate  Much of this has stemmed from an inaccurate but often quoted article published in The New York Times               The article was later corrected to state that Blankfein  CEO of Goldman Sachs  was  one of the Wall Street chief executives at the meeting   Representatives from other firms were indeed present at the September AIG meetings  Furthermore  Goldman Sachs CFO David Viniar stated that CEO Blankfein had never  met  with US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to discuss AIG               however  they had frequent phone calls               Paulson was not present at the September meetings at the New York Fed  Morgan Stanley was hired by the Federal Reserve to advise on the AIG bailout               According to The New York Times  Paulson spoke with the CEO of Goldman Sachs two dozen times during the week of the bailout  though he obtained an ethics waiver before doing so               While it is common for regulators to be in contact with market participants to gather valuable industry intelligence  particularly in a crisis  Paulson spoke with Goldman s Blankfein more frequently than with other large banks  Federal officials say that although Paulson was involved in decisions to rescue A I G  it was the Federal Reserve that played the lead role in shaping and financing the A I G  bailout              

Stock price manipulation edit 
Goldman Sachs was charged for repeatedly issuing research reports with extremely inflated financial projections for Exodus Communications and Goldman Sachs was accused of giving Exodus its highest stock rating even though Goldman knew Exodus did not deserve such a rating               On July           Goldman Sachs  Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley were sued for artificially inflating the stock price of RSL Communications by issuing untrue or materially misleading statements in research analyst reports  and paid                         million in       for settlement              
Goldman Sachs was accused of asking for kickback bribes from institutional clients who made large profits flipping stocks which Goldman had intentionally undervalued in initial public offerings it was underwriting during the dot com bubble  Documents under seal in a decade long lawsuit concerning eToys com s initial public offering  IPO  in      but released accidentally to The New York Times show that IPOs managed by Goldman were purposely underpriced to generate profits for clients of Goldman and that these clients were asked by Goldman to return some of the profits via increased business  The clients willingly complied with these demands because they understood it was necessary to participate in further such undervalued IPOs               Companies selling undervalued stock and their initial consumer stockholders were both defrauded by this practice              

Use of offshore tax havens edit 
A      report by Public Interest Research Group stated that  Goldman Sachs reports having     subsidiaries in offshore tax havens      of which are in the Cayman Islands  despite not operating a single legitimate office in that country  according to its own website  The group officially holds       billion offshore   The report also noted several other major U S  banks and companies use the same tax avoidance tactics              
In       Goldman Sachs had an effective tax rate of only       down from     the year before  and its tax liability decreased to          million in       compared to         billion in                    Critics have argued that the reduction in Goldman Sachs s tax rate was achieved by shifting its earnings to subsidiaries in low or no tax nations  such as the Cayman Islands              

Involvement in the European sovereign debt crisis edit 
Former Prime Minister of Greece Lucas Papademos
Goldman was criticized for its involvement in the      European debt crisis  In       to avoid non compliance with the Maastricht Treaty  Goldman arranged a secret loan of           billion for Greece disguised as an off the books  cross currency swap   hiding    of Greece s national debt  Goldman received a fee of           million for the complicated transaction                            In September       Goldman Sachs  among others  created a special credit default swap  CDS  index to cover the high risk of Greece s national debt               The interest rates of Greek national bonds soared  leading the Greek economy very close to bankruptcy in      and                   
Many European leaders with roles in the crisis had ties to Goldman Sachs               Lucas Papademos  Greece s former prime minister  ran the Central Bank of Greece at the time of the controversial derivatives deals with Goldman Sachs that enabled Greece to hide the size of its debt               Petros Christodoulou  general manager of the Greek Public Debt Management Agency was a former employee of Goldman Sachs               Mario Monti  Italy s former prime minister and finance minister  who headed the new government that took over after Berlusconi s resignation  was an international adviser to Goldman Sachs               Otmar Issing  former board member of the Bundesbank and the executive board of the European Bank also advised Goldman Sachs               Mario Draghi  then head of the European Central Bank  was the former managing director of Goldman Sachs International               Ant nio Borges  Head of the European Department of the International Monetary Fund in           and responsible for most of enterprise privatizations in Portugal since       was the former vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International               Carlos Moedas  a former Goldman Sachs employee  was the Secretary of State to the Prime Minister of Portugal and Director of ESAME  the agency created to monitor and control the implementation of the structural reforms agreed by the government of Portugal and the troika composed of the European Commission  the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund  Peter Sutherland  former Attorney General of Ireland was a non executive director of Goldman Sachs International              

Employees  views edit 
Although the allegations against Goldman were later discovered to be lacking evidence  in March       Greg Smith  then head of Goldman Sachs U S  equity derivatives sales business in Europe  the Middle East and Africa  EMEA   resigned his position via an op ed in The New York Times criticizing the company and its executives and wrote a book titled Why I left Goldman Sachs                                                                   Almost all the claims made by Smith turned out to be lacking in evidence and Smith was alleged to be a con artist by The Observer  However  The New York Times never issued a retraction or admitted to any error in judgment in initially publishing Smith s op ed

Work culture edit

Gender bias lawsuit edit 
In       two former female employees filed a lawsuit against Goldman Sachs for gender discrimination  Cristina Chen Oster and Shanna Orlich claimed that the firm fostered an  uncorrected culture of sexual harassment and assault  causing women to either be  sexualized or ignored   The suit cited both cultural and pay discrimination including frequent client trips to strip clubs  client golf outings that excluded female employees  and the fact that female vice presidents made     less than their male counterparts               In March       the judge ruled that the female employees may pursue their claims as a group in a class action lawsuit against Goldman on gender bias  but the class action excludes their claim on sexual harassment              
In May       Goldman Sachs agreed to pay           million              million  to resolve claims made by nearly      female staff  This settlement was made over accusations of the company s discriminatory practices  allegedly providing women with lower salaries and lesser opportunities  Government records have revealed that female employees at Goldman Sachs earned     less than their male counterparts  which is significantly higher than the      national gender pay gap  The settlement was reached a month before the scheduled trial of the class action lawsuit

On November           the Los Angeles Times reported that Goldman Sachs had both earned          million from underwriting California bonds  and advised other clients to short those bonds               While some journalists criticized the contradictory actions               others pointed out that the opposite investment decisions undertaken by the underwriting side and the trading side of the bank were normal and in line with regulations regarding Chinese walls  and in fact critics had demanded increased independence between underwriting and trading

Abacus synthetic CDOs and SEC lawsuit edit 


See also  Merrill Lynch        CDO controversies  and Magnetar Capital
Unlike many investors and investment bankers  Goldman Sachs anticipated the subprime mortgage crisis               Some of its traders became  bearish  on the housing boom beginning in      and developed mortgage related securities  originally intended to protect Goldman from investment losses in the housing market  In late       Goldman management changed the firm s overall stance on the mortgage market from positive to negative  As the market began its downturn  Goldman  created even more of these securities   no longer just hedging or satisfying investor orders but  according to business journalist Gretchen Morgenson   enabling it to pocket huge profits  from the mortgage defaults and that Goldman  used the C D O  s to place unusually large negative bets that were not mainly for hedging purposes                Authors Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera stated that  the firm s later insistence that it was merely a  market maker  in these transactions   implying that it had no stake in the economic performance of the securities it was selling to clients   became less true over time               
The investments were called synthetic CDOs because unlike regular collateralized debt obligations  the principal and interest they paid out came not from mortgages or other loans  but from premiums to pay for insurance against mortgage defaults   the insurance known as  credit default swaps   Goldman and some other hedge funds held a  short  position in the securities  paying the premiums  while the investors  insurance companies  pension funds  etc   receiving the premiums were the  long  position  The longs were responsible for paying the insurance  claim  to Goldman and any other shorts if the mortgages or other loans defaulted  Through April       Goldman issued over    CDOs in its  Abacus  series worth a total of            billion              billion in                     All together Goldman packaged  sold  and shorted a total of    synthetic CDOs  with an aggregate face value of          billion between July          and May                       
But while Goldman was praised for its foresight  some argued its bets against the securities it created gave it a vested interest in their failure  These securities performed very poorly for the long investors and by April       at least US        billion              billion in       worth of the securities either carried  junk  ratings or had defaulted               One CDO examined by critics which Goldman bet against but also sold to investors  was the           million              billion in       Hudson Mezzanine CDO issued in       In the Senate Permanent Subcommittee hearings  Goldman executives stated that the company was trying to remove subprime securities from its books  Unable to sell them directly  it included them in the underlying securities of the CDO and took the short side  but critics McLean and Nocera complained the CDO prospectus did not explain this but described its contents as   assets sourced from the Street   making it sound as though Goldman randomly selected the securities  instead of specifically creating a hedge for its own book                The CDO did not perform well  and by March        just    months after its issue   so many borrowers had defaulted that holders of the security paid out  about US     million to Goldman and others who had bet against it                Goldman s head of European fixed income sales lamented in an e mail made public by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  the  real bad feeling across European sales about some of the trades we did with clients  who had invested in the CDO   The damage this has done to our franchise is very significant               

     SEC civil fraud lawsuit edit 
In April       the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  charged Goldman Sachs and one of its vice presidents  Fabrice Tourre  with securities fraud  The SEC alleged that Goldman had told buyers of a synthetic CDO  a type of investment  that the underlying assets in the investment had been picked by an independent CDO manager  ACA Management  In fact  Paulson  amp  Co  a hedge fund that wanted to bet against the investment had played a  significant role  in the selection               and the package of securities turned out to become  one of the worst performing mortgage deals of the housing crisis  because  less than a year after the deal was completed       of the bonds selected for Abacus had been downgraded               
The particular synthetic CDO that the SEC s      fraud suit charged Goldman with misleading investors with was called Abacus      AC   Unlike many of the Abacus securities       AC  did not have Goldman Sachs as a short seller  in fact  Goldman Sachs lost money on the deal               That position was taken by the customer  John Paulson  who hired Goldman to issue the security  according to the SEC s complaint   Paulson and his employees selected    BBB rated mortgage bonds                           that they believed were most likely to lose value and so the best bet to buy insurance for               Paulson and the manager of the CDO  ACA Management  worked on the portfolio of    bonds to be insured  ACA allegedly unaware of Paulson s short position   coming to an agreement in late February                    Paulson paid Goldman approximately US         million for its work in the deal               Paulson ultimately made a US   billion profit from the short investments  the profits coming from the losses of the investors and their insurers  These were primarily IKB Deutsche Industriebank  US     million loss   and the investors and insurers of another US     million   ACA Financial Guaranty Corp               ABN AMRO  and the Royal Bank of Scotland                           
The SEC alleged that Goldman  materially misstated and omitted facts in disclosure documents  about the financial security               including the fact that it had  permitted a client that was betting against the mortgage market  the hedge fund manager Paulson  amp  Co   to heavily influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio  while telling other investors that the securities were selected by an independent  objective third party   ACA Management                            The SEC further alleged that  Tourre also misled ACA into believing     that Paulson s interests in the collateral section  sic  process were aligned with ACA s  when  in reality  Paulson s interests were sharply conflicting               
In reply  Goldman issued a statement saying the SEC s charges were  unfounded in law and fact   and in later statements maintained that it had not structured the portfolio to lose money               that it had provided extensive disclosure to the long investors in the CDO  that it had lost          million  that ACA selected the portfolio without Goldman suggesting Paulson was to be a long investor  that it did not disclose the identities of a buyer to a seller  and vice versa  as it was not normal business practice for a market maker               and that ACA was itself the largest purchaser of the Abacus pool  investing US          million  Goldman also stated that any investor losses resulted from the overall negative performance of the entire sector  rather than from a particular security in the CDO                            While some journalists and analysts have called these statements misleading               others believed Goldman s defense was strong and the SEC s case was weak                                        
Some experts on securities law such as Duke University law professor James Cox  believed the suit had merit because Goldman was aware of the relevance of Paulson s involvement and took steps to downplay it  Others  including Wayne State University Law School law professor Peter Henning  noted that the major purchasers were sophisticated investors capable of accurately assessing the risks involved  even without knowledge of the part played by Paulson              
Critics of Goldman Sachs point out that Paulson went to Goldman Sachs after being turned down for ethical reasons by another investment bank  Bear Stearns who he had asked to build a CDO  Ira Wagner  the head of Bear Stearns s CDO Group in       told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that having the short investors select the referenced collateral as a serious conflict of interest and the structure of the deal Paulson was proposing encouraged Paulson to pick the worst assets                            Describing Bear Stearns s reasoning  one author compared the deal to  a bettor asking a football owner to bench a star quarterback to improve the odds of his wager against the team                Goldman claimed it lost          million  critics maintain it was simply unable  not due to a lack of trying  to shed its position before the underlying securities defaulted              
Critics also question whether the deal was ethical  even if it was legal                            Goldman had considerable advantages over its long customers  According to McLean and Nocera  there were dozens of securities being insured in the CDO   for example  another ABACUS                had     credits from several different mortgage originators  commercial mortgage backed securities  debt from Sallie Mae  credit cards  etc  Goldman bought mortgages to create securities  which made it  far more likely than its clients to have early knowledge  that the housing bubble was deflating and the mortgage originators like New Century had begun to falsify documentation and sell mortgages to customers unable to pay the mortgage holders back                which is why the fine print on at least one ABACUS prospectus warned long investors that the  Protection Buyer   Goldman   may have information  including material  non public information  which it was not providing to the long investors              
According to an article in the Houston Chronicle  critics also worried that Abacus might undermine the position of the United States  as a safe harbor for the world s investors  and that  The involvement of European interests as losers in this allegedly fixed game has attracted the attention of that region s political leaders  most notably British Prime Minister Gordon Brown  who has accused Goldman of  moral bankruptcy   This is  in short  a big global story     Is what Goldman Sachs did with its Abacus investment vehicle illegal  That will be for the courts to decide      But it doesn t take a judge and jury to conclude that  legalities aside  this was just wrong               
On July           Goldman settled out of court  agreeing to pay the SEC and investors US          million  including           million to the U S  government and           million to investors  one of the largest penalties ever paid by a Wall Street firm               The company did not admit or deny wrongdoing  but did admit that its marketing materials for the investment  contained incomplete information   and agreed to change some of its business practices regarding mortgage investments              

Charges against Fabrice Tourre edit 
The settlement in July      did not cover charges against Goldman vice president and salesman for Abacus  Fabrice Tourre                            Tourre unsuccessfully sought a dismissal of the suit                            which went to trial in                    On August    a federal jury found Tourre liable on six of seven counts  including that he misled investors about the mortgage deal  He was found not liable on the most specific charge  that he  deliberately made an untrue or misleading statement                            Tourre was not subject to criminal charges or jail time               He was fined          and forced to return a          bonus               Tourre then pursued a career in academia              

Alleged commodity price manipulation edit

A provision of the      financial deregulation law  the Gramm Leach Bliley Act  allows commercial banks to enter into any business activity that is  complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally                Since the passing of the laws  Goldman Sachs and other investment banks such as Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase have branched out into ownership of a wide variety of enterprises including raw materials  such as food products  zinc  copper  tin  nickel and  aluminum 
Some critics  such as Matt Taibbi  believe that allowing a company to both  control the supply of crucial physical commodities  and also trade in the financial products that might be related to those markets   is  akin to letting casino owners who take book on NFL games during the week also coach all the teams on Sundays               

Goldman Sachs Commodity Index and the           Food Bubble edit 
Frederick Kaufman  a contributing editor of Harper s Magazine  argued in a      article that Goldman s creation of the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index  now the S amp P GSCI  helped passive investors such as pension funds  mutual funds and others engage in food price speculation by betting on financial products based on the commodity index  These financial products disturbed the normal relationship between supply and demand  making prices more volatile and defeating the price stabilization mechanism of the futures exchange                                        
A June      article in The Economist defended commodity investors and oil index tracking funds  citing a report by the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development that found that commodities without futures markets and ignored by index tracking funds also saw price rises during the period              

Alleged manipulation of aluminum price and supply edit 
Main article  Aluminium price fixing conspiracy
Although it was described by others as just a conspiracy theory                            in a July      article  David Kocieniewski  a journalist with The New York Times  accused Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms of  capitalizing on loosened federal regulations  to manipulate  a variety of commodities markets   particularly aluminum  citing  financial records  regulatory documents  and interviews with people involved in the activities                After Goldman Sachs purchased aluminum warehousing company Metro International in       the wait of warehouse customers for delivery of aluminum supplies to their factories   to make beer cans  home siding  and other products   went from an average of   weeks to more than    months                            The premium on all aluminum sold in the spot market doubled  with industry analysts blaming the lengthy delays at Metro International  costing American consumers more than         billion from      to                    Goldman s ownership of a quarter of the national supply of aluminum   a million and a half tons   in a network of    Metro International warehouses in Detroit  Michigan  was blamed                            To avoid hoarding and price manipulation  the London Metal Exchange requires that  at least       tons of that metal must be moved out each day   According to the article  Goldman dealt with this requirement by moving the aluminum   not to factories  but  from one warehouse to another               
In August       Goldman Sachs was subpoenaed by the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission as part of an investigation into complaints that Goldman owned metals warehouses had  intentionally created delays and inflated the price of aluminum               
According to Lydia DePillis of Wonkblog  when Goldman bought the warehouses it  started paying traders extra to bring their metal  to Goldman s warehouses  rather than anywhere else  The longer it stays  the more rent Goldman can charge  which is then passed on to the buyer in the form of a premium                The effect is  amplified  by another company  Glencore  which is  doing the same thing in its warehouse in Vlissingen               
Columnist Matt Levine  writing for Bloomberg News  described the conspiracy theory as  pretty silly   but said that it was a rational outcome of an irrational and inefficient system which Goldman Sachs may not have properly understood              
In December       Goldman Sachs sold its aluminum warehousing business to Ruben Brothers                                        
In March       the legal case against Goldman Sachs  JPMorgan Chase  Glencore  the two investment banks  warehousing businesses  and the London Metal Exchange in various combinations   of violating U S  anti trust laws  was dismissed by United States District Court for the Southern District of New York Judge Katherine B  Forrest in Manhattan for lack of evidence and other reasons               The lawsuit was revived in      after the  nd U S  Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said the previous decision was in error  That case was dismissed by judge Paul A  Engelmayer in      although Reynolds Consumer Products and two other plaintiffs that had directly transacted with the defendants were allowed to pursue the case               Those purchasers settled with Goldman and JPMorgan Chase in                   

Oil futures speculation edit 
Investment banks  including Goldman  have also been accused of driving up the price of gasoline by speculating on the oil futures exchange  In August        confidential documents  were leaked  detailing the positions               in the oil futures market of several investment banks  including Goldman Sachs  Morgan Stanley  JPMorgan Chase  Deutsche Bank  and Barclays  just before the peak in gasoline prices in the summer of       The presence of positions by investment banks on the market was significant for the fact that the banks have deep pockets  and so the means to significantly sway prices  and unlike traditional market participants  neither produced oil nor ever took physical possession of actual barrels of oil they bought and sold  Journalist Kate Sheppard of Mother Jones called it  a development that many say is artificially raising the price of crude                However  another source stated that   Just before crude oil hit its record high in mid          of the world s largest banks were betting that prices would fall  according to private trading data                 
In April       a couple of observers   Brad Johnson of the blog Climate Progress               founded by Joseph J  Romm  and Alain Sherter of CBS MoneyWatch                noted that Goldman Sachs was warning investors of a dangerous spike in the price of oil  Climate Progress quoted Goldman as warning  that the price of oil has grown out of control due to excessive speculation  in petroleum futures  and that  net speculative positions are four times as high as in June        when the price of oil peaked              
It stated that   Goldman Sachs told its clients that it believed speculators like itself had artificially driven the price of oil at least     higher than supply and demand dictate                Sherter noted that Goldman s concern over speculation did not prevent it  along with other speculators  from lobbying against regulations by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to establish  position limits   which would cap the number of futures contracts a trader can hold  and thus prevent speculation              

According to Joseph P  Kennedy II  by       prices on the oil commodity market had become influenced by  hedge funds and bankers  pumping  billions of purely speculative dollars into commodity exchanges  chasing a limited number of barrels and driving up the price                The problem started  according to Kennedy  in       when just a few years after oil futures began trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange  Goldman Sachs made an argument to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that Wall Street dealers who put down big bets on oil should be considered legitimate hedgers and granted an exemption from regulatory limits on their trades 
The commission granted an exemption that ultimately allowed Goldman Sachs to process billions of dollars in speculative oil trades  Other exemptions followed               and  by       eight investment banks accounted for     of the total oil futures market               
Improper securities lending practices edit 
In January       Goldman Sachs agreed to pay          million after it was found that a team of Goldman employees  between      and        granted locates  by arranging to borrow securities to settle short sales without adequate review  However  U S  regulation for short selling requires brokerages to enter an agreement to borrow securities on behalf of customers or to have  reasonable grounds  for believing that it can borrow the security before entering contracts to complete the sale  Additionally  Goldman Sachs gave  incomplete and unclear  responses to information requests from SEC compliance examiners in      about the firm s securities lending practices              

Conspiring to allow         billion in bribes to obtain business from  MDB Malaysian sovereign wealth fund             edit 
Main article   Malaysia Development Berhad scandal
In July       Prime Minister of Malaysia Najib Razak set up a sovereign wealth fund   Malaysia Development Berhad   MDB                                         
In       U S  prosecutors began examining the role of Goldman in helping  MDB raise more than         billion              billion in        The  MDB bond deals were said to generate  above average  commissions and fees for Goldman amounting close to           million or more than    of the proceeds              
Beginning in       Goldman was investigated for a         billion              billion in       bond created by the bank for  MDB  U S  Prosecutors investigated whether the bank failed to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act  which requires financial institutions to report suspicious transactions to regulators               In November       Goldman s former chairman of Southeast Asia  Tim Leissner  admitted that more than US          million             million in       in proceeds from  MDB bonds went into the accounts controlled by him and a relative  bypassing the company s compliance rules                            Leissner and another former Goldman banker  Roger Ng  together with Malaysian financier Jho Low were charged with money laundering               Goldman chief executive David Solomon felt  horrible  about the ex staff breaking the law by going around the policies                           and apologized to Malaysians for Leissner s role in the  MDB scandal                                        
On December           Malaysia filed criminal charges against subsidiaries of Goldman and their former employees Leissner and Ng  alleging their commission of misleading statements to dishonestly misappropriate US          billion from the proceeds of  MDB bonds arranged and underwritten by Goldman in      and                                
On July           it was announced that the Malaysian government would receive US          billion in cash from Goldman Sachs               and a guarantee from the bank they would also return US          billion in assets linked to  MDB bonds               Put together this was substantially less than the US          billion that had been previously demanded by the Malaysian finance minister  At the same time  the Malaysian government agreed to drop all criminal charges against the bank and that it would cease legal proceedings against    current and former Goldman directors  Some commentators argued that Goldman secured a very favorable deal               Despite the settlement  Malaysian prime minister called it unfair to the country as the settled amount was not sufficient in September                    and Goldman had in the following month sued Malaysia in a London arbitration court over the settlement reached by both parties              
In October       the Malaysian subsidiary of Goldman Sachs admitted to mistakes in auditing its subsidiary and agreed to pay more than           billion              billion in       in fines                                                     

Financing of Venezuela despite human rights violations        edit 
In May       Goldman Sachs purchased           billion              billion in       of PDVSA      bonds from the Central Bank of Venezuela during the      Venezuelan protests               when the country was suffering from malnutrition and hyperinflation                            Venezuelan politicians and protesters in New York opposed to President of Venezuela Nicol s Maduro accused Goldman of being of complicit of human rights abuses under the government and declared that the financing would fuel hunger in Venezuela by depriving the government of foreign exchange to import food  leading the securities to be dubbed  hunger bonds                The opposition led National Assembly voted to ask the United States Congress to investigate the deal  which they called  immoral  opaque  and hypocritical given the socialist government s anti Wall Street rhetoric                National Assembly president Julio Borges said that the funds would  strengthen the brutal repression  used against the protestors               Sheila Patel  CEO of Goldman Sachs Asset Management s international division  said that the incident was a learning experience that taught the bank to focus on environmental  social  and corporate governance issues              

Relations with Russia edit 
Goldman Sachs established its presence in Russia in       focusing on investment banking services rather than retail operations  This early entry helped the firm navigate complex sanctions later               Notably  Kirill Dmitriev  who later led the Russian Direct Investment Fund  worked at Goldman Sachs in New York in the late     s  gaining experience in Western finance                            After Russia s      invasion of Ukraine  Goldman Sachs announced plans to exit Russia  finalizing the sale of its business to Armenian firm Balchug Capital in April                    following a decree by President Vladimir Putin               Despite the official exit  Goldman Sachs resumed offering clients non deliverable forwards  NDFs  linked to the Russian ruble in February                    Additionally  Putin authorized the transfer of Goldman Sachs  shares in major Russian companies  such as Gazprom and Rosneft  to Balchug Capital                           
After working at Goldman Sachs  Kirill Dmitriev became CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund in      and  in February       was appointed Special Representative of the Russian President for Investment and Economic Cooperation               His background links him closely to Western finance  aiding his role in navigating sanctions  Dmitriev maintained informal ties with the Trump administration  notably meeting Steve Witkoff  earning him the nickname  Putin s Trump whisperer                 His past at Goldman Sachs likely provided lasting networks valuable for influencing financial discussions                                                 
The term  Government Sachs  emerged during Donald Trump s presidency to describe the significant influence of Goldman Sachs alumni  including Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn  within his administration               Their presence raised concerns about potential regulatory capture and Wall Street s broader influence on US policy  including sanctions                     While there is no direct evidence that Goldman Sachs lobbied for easing sanctions against Russia  the possibility of indirect influence through personal connections and shared perspectives cannot be dismissed       Kirill Dmitriev  a Goldman Sachs alumnus and key intermediary between the Trump administration and the Kremlin               further complicated the picture  Dmitriev s reported discussions with Trump associate Steve Witkoff              referred to as the  Witkoff Dmitriev pact  suggest informal channels that could have aligned with Goldman Sachs  interests in maintaining ties to the Russian market              
Goldman Sachs  cautious moves to re engage with Russia  such as resuming ruble derivative trading and negotiating asset sales with Kremlin approval  can be seen within the broader context of shifting political and economic dynamics                Even though official US policy toward Russia is still tough  a mix of leftover business interests  signs during the Trump years that sanctions might be eased  and new openings left by European companies pulling out of Russia suggests that Goldman Sachs   and possibly others   are quietly setting themselves up for a future return to the Russian market
