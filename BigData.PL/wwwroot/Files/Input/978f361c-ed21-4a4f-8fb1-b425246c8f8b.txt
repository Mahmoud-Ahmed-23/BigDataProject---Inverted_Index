  natural intelligence

  Definition of AI as the study of intelligent agents  drawn from the leading AI textbooks 
 Poole  Mackworth   Goebel       p      which provides the version that is used in this article  These authors use the term  computational intelligence  as a synonym for artificial intelligence 
 Russell   Norvig               who prefer the term  rational agent   and write  The whole agent view is now widely accepted in the field  
 Nilsson      
 Legg   Hutter      


  Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig characterize this definition as  thinking humanly  and reject it in favor of  acting rationally             

  This list of intelligent traits is based on the topics covered by the major AI textbooks  including   Russell   Norvig         Luger   Stubblefield         Poole  Mackworth   Goebel       and  Nilsson      

  This statement comes from the proposal for the Dartmouth workshop of       which reads   Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it
