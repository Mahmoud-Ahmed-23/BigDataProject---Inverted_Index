							Pocket Cinema is a student business that is determined to produce high quality short films Photo from Pocket Cinema Facebook page 
 In       Christopher Nolan made a film called  Following  that was about    minutes and was shot using an ultra low budget  The film went on to become a success because of a very good script   said AUC engineering senior Zeyad Qassem 
Qassem and two other friends  Marawan Morsi and Abdel Rahman Azzam  started Pocket Cinema with the hope of jumpstarting filmmakers  careers and producing high quality cinema with a low budget  much like Nolan did 
Pocket Cinema is a short film production company that focuses on short low budget films and is officially launching sometime this year  but for now  Qassem and his friends are competing in the business plan competition at the American University in Cairo  hoping to win its first prize of EGP        
Qassem sees cinema as a tool for telling a good story   You do not need fancy gadgets and expensive cameras  you need talent and a good idea  
The target for Pocket Cinema will beÂ       minute short films that they aim to spread through use of social media   I see shorter films of this format as the new form of entertainment  with the presence of the internet and the decline in attention spans   said Qassem 
What Qassem wants to offer filmmakers is the technical know how and his marketing efforts   Through social media and cultural venues  you can easily reach thousands of people  We also have a production team that includes a filmmaker who is experienced with shorts  an editor  a cinematographer and a composer  With a good idea  a filmmaker has all he needs to produce a film that will get his name out there  
Qassem said they are looking for filmmakers who are talented and creative  but also disciplined and have good work ethic   We work on a very tight budget  a couple of thousand pounds at the most  and so we need someone with a vision that can put these resources into good use but  who  also understands the limitations  
The basic idea is that no matter who you are  if you make something good  you will get noticed  Pocket Cinema is ideal for film students  or recent graduates who want to get noticed in wider circles  As with Nolan  initiatives like Pocket Cinema show that with a little creativity  filmmakers can stretch their resources and their imagination to make something that truly stands out  And given that Nolan went on to make longer and hugely successful features like Memento and the Dark Knight Trilogy  we would say you should take your chances
