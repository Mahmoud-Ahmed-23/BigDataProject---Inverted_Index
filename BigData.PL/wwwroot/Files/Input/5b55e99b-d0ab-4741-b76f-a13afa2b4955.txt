development  This article will act as tutorial to help you understand the concept of design patterns  Developers can create more robust  maintainable  and scalable software systems by understanding and applying these patterns Table of ContentWhat are Design Patterns Why Learn Design Patterns Types of Software Design Patterns Creational Design Patterns Structural Design Patterns Behavioral Design Patterns Design Patterns in Different Languages Interview Questions on Software Design Patterns What are Design Patterns Reusable solutions for typical software design challenges are known as design patterns  Expert object oriented software engineers use these best practices to write more structured  manageable  and scalable code  Design patterns provide a standard terminology and are specific to particular scenarios and problems  Design patterns are not finished code but templates or blueprints only Key Characteristics of Design PatternsReusability  Patterns can be applied to different projects and problems  saving time and effort in solving similar issues Standardization  They provide a shared language and understanding among developers  helping in communication and collaboration Efficiency  By using these popular patterns  developers can avoid finding the solution to same recurring problems  which leads to faster development Flexibility  Patterns are abstract solutions templates that can be adapted to fit various scenarios and requirements Why Learn Design Patterns There are multiple reasons to learn design patterns Code that is simpler to comprehend  update  and expand is produced with the help of design patterns   They offer solutions that have been tried and tested as well as best practices Learning this enables them to quickly and effectively address similar challenges in various projects Developers can produce reusable components that can be utilized in a variety of applications by implementing design patterns This reduces redundancy and saves development time Types of Software Design Patterns  There are three types of Design Patterns   Creational Design Pattern  Structural Design Pattern  Behavioral Design Pattern     Creational Design Patterns Creational Design Patterns focus on the process of object creation or problems related to object creation  They help in making a system independent of how its objects are created  composed and represented Types of Creational Design Patterns  Factory Method Design Pattern This pattern is typically helpful when it s necessary to separate the construction of an object from its implementation With the use of this design pattern  objects can be produced without having to define the exact class of object to be created Abstract Factory Method Design Pattern Abstract Factory pattern is almost similar to Factory Pattern and is considered as another layer of abstraction over factory pattern  Abstract Factory patterns work around a super factory which creates other factories  Singleton Method Design Pattern Of all  the Singleton Design pattern is the most straightforward to understand It guarantees that a class has just one instance and offers a way to access it globally  Prototype Method Design Pattern Prototype allows us to hide the complexity of making new instances from the client The concept is to copy an existing object rather than creating a new instance from scratch  something that may include costly operations  Builder Method Design Pattern  To  Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations   Builder pattern is usedIt helps in constructing a complex object step by step and the final step will return the object      Structural Design Patterns Structural Design Patterns solves problems related to how classes and objects are composed assembled to form larger structures which are efficient and flexible in nature  Structural class patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations  Types of Structural Design Patterns  Adapter Method Design Pattern The adapter pattern convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect Adapter lets classes work together that couldn t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces  Bridge Method Design Pattern The bridge pattern allows the Abstraction and the Implementation to be developed independently The client code can access only the Abstraction part without being concerned about the Implementation part Composite Method Design Pattern As a partitioning design pattern  the composite pattern characterizes a collection of items that are handled the same way as a single instance of the same type of object The intent of a composite is to  compose  objects into tree structures to represent part whole hierarchies Decorator Method Design Pattern It allows us to dynamically add functionality and behavior to an object without affecting the behavior of other existing objects within the same class  nbsp We use inheritance to extend the behavior of the class  This takes place at compile time  and all the instances of that class get the extended behavior  Facade Method Design Pattern Facade Method Design Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem Facade defines a high level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use Flyweight Method Design Pattern This pattern provides ways to decrease object count thus improving application required objects structure Flyweight pattern is used when we need to create a large number of similar objects  Proxy Method Design Pattern Proxy means  in place of   representing  or  in place of  or  on behalf of  are literal meanings of proxy and that directly explains Proxy Design Pattern  Proxies are also called surrogates  handles  and wrappers  They are closely related in structure  but not purpose  to Adapters and Decorators     Behavioral Design Patterns Behavioral Patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects  Behavioral patterns describe not just patterns of objects or classes but also the patterns of communication between them  These patterns characterize complex control flow that s difficult to follow at run time   Types of Behavioral Design Patterns Chain Of Responsibility Method Design Pattern Chain of responsibility pattern is used to achieve loose coupling in software design where a request from the client is passed to a chain of objects to process them  nbsp Later  the object in the chain will decide themselves who will be processing the request and whether the request is required to be sent to the next object in the chain or not  Command Method Design Pattern A behavioral design pattern called the Command Pattern transforms a request into an independent object with all of the information s request This object can be passed around  stored  and executed at a later time Interpreter Method Design Pattern Interpreter pattern is used to defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar  Mediator Method Design Pattern It enables decoupling of objects by introducing a layer in between so that the interaction between objects happen via the layer  Memento Method Design Patterns It is used to return an object s state to its initial state  You might wish to create checkpoints in your application and return to them at a later time when it develops Observer Method Design Pattern It establishes a one to many dependency between objects  meaning that all of the dependents  observers  of the subject are immediately updated and notified when the subject changes  State Method Design Pattern When an object modifies its behavior according to its internal state  the state design pattern is applied  If we have to change the behavior of an object based on its state  we can have a state variable in the Object and use the if else condition block to perform different actions based on the state  Strategy Method Design Pattern It is possible to select an object s behavior at runtime by utilizing the Strategy Design Pattern  Encapsulating a family of algorithms into distinct classes that each implement a common interface is the foundation of the Strategy pattern Template Method Design Pattern The template method design pattern defines an algorithm as a collection of skeleton operations  with the child classes handling the implementation of the specifics  The parent class maintains the overall structure and flow of the algorithm Visitor Method Design Pattern It is used when we have to perform an operation on a group of similar kind of Objects  With the help of visitor pattern  we can move the operational logic from the objects to another class  Design Patterns in Different Languages  Design Patterns  C    Java  JavaScript  Python  Factory Method Design Pattern  Link  Link  Link  Link
