							As part of its commitment to enhancing women       s access to formal financial services  the Central Bank of Egypt  CBE  has launched the annual  Women s Financial Inclusion Event   The event  which runs from March   coinciding with International Women s Day until the end of the month  aims to expand financial inclusion opportunities for women across Egypt 
Since its inception in       the initiative has significantly contributed to the availability of financial products for women  By March       approximately     million financial products were provided  including         bank accounts          e wallets  and         prepaid cards  These efforts align with the CBE s broader mission to promote financial inclusion  resulting in a remarkable increase in the financial inclusion rate for women  which reached       by the end of December      representing a      growth compared to       As a result       million women aged    and above now have access to financial services and own transaction accounts  out of a total of      million in this demographic 
The progress achieved stems from the CBE s Financial Inclusion Strategy            which focuses on integrating all societal segments into the financial system  with women at the forefront  This strategy is built on key pillars  including developing a supportive legal and regulatory environment  launching initiatives in partnership with government entities and international organizations  and encouraging banks to introduce financial products tailored to women s needs  Financial literacy is also a cornerstone of the strategy  as raising awareness is essential to empowering women with the knowledge needed to make informed financial decisions 
To facilitate women s access to banking services  the CBE has introduced new regulatory measures that simplify due diligence procedures  Notably  these guidelines allow women to open personal or business accounts using only their National ID  without requiring additional documentation  This measure is particularly beneficial for housewives  micro entrepreneurs  and craftspeople  Additionally  the policy enables mothers especially divorced or widowed women to open accounts for their minor children  addressing long standing barriers that have restricted women s engagement with the banking sector 
The CBE has also taken concrete steps to enhance women s economic empowerment by equipping bank employees with specialized training  In collaboration with international organizations such as the OECD and Women s World Banking  the CBE has provided training for employees in customer segmentation and retail banking to help them better understand women s financial needs  As a result  banks have begun issuing and developing tailored financial packages designed to meet the specific requirements of female customers 
Recognizing the transformative role of financial technology  FinTech  in advancing women s financial inclusion  especially in underserved areas  the CBE has supported the Digital Saving and Lending Groups Project   Tahwisha   This initiative encourages women in rural communities to save and apply for loans to launch small and micro enterprises  By December       approximately         women were actively using the Tahwisha electronic application  while         women within savings groups and         outside these groups benefited from financial literacy and awareness campaigns 
As part of Egypt s digital transformation drive  the CBE has also introduced the  Digitization of International Remittances Project   aimed at integrating women into the formal financial system  This initiative supports Egyptian expatriates and their families by offering banking products to remittance recipients     million of whom are women  representing     of the total beneficiaries 
Additionally  the CBE plays an active role in the Women s Economic and Social Empowerment Program  WESEP   implemented in collaboration with the United States Agency for International Development  USAID  and executed by Pathfinder  This program further strengthens efforts to provide women with financial tools that enhance their economic participation and financial independence 
Through these strategic initiatives  the CBE continues to make significant strides in fostering women s financial inclusion  driving economic growth  and ensuring greater financial accessibility for millions of women across Egypt
