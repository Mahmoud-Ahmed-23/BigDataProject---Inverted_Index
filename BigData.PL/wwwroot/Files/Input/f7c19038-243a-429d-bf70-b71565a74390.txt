							Ayman Okeil  GM of Maat for Peace  Development and Human Rights
Maat for Peace  Development and Human Right has been working in Egypt since      and officially registered as an NGO in       Surviving and growing in an environment that has been rather restrictive on civil society  Maat is also working in partnership with the Global Network for Rights and Development  GNRD  based in Norway  and the International Institute for Peace  Justice and Human Rights  IIPJHR  based in Switzerland  They had planned the biggest observation mission for the expected parliamentary elections  made upof over       local and     international observers from    states 
Daily News Egypt spoke to Ayman Okeil  General Manager of Maat  on the current political and human rights situation  in addition to the discussion about the parliament and the work of civil society in Egypt 
As a regular participant in international events  what is the situation of human rights in Egypt and how is it viewed abroad  for example in the UN Human Rights Council       s sessions in Geneva  
Let       s admit that there are human rights        violations from      until now in Egypt  but we also have to take into consideration the factors affecting this period  such as the number of protests  road obstruction incidents  attacks  explosions  etc  With all of this happening  surely there are violations  Amid clashes between people on the streets and police forces  as hard as it is to tell which party is to blame  It is undeniable that there are victims  killings and tortures in police stations  But again  I cannot hold one party fully responsible because it is a process of wrong actions and reactions  Both sides might be convinced they are right 
How is the performance of Egyptian speakers on the situation of human rights 
As a civil society activist  I cannot discuss human rights        issues from one perspective only  I must admit that there is a crisis that has to be solved  In Geneva  there was an opposition voice against the abuse of the military regime  but their speech ignored the other side 
My point is if we are aligned on the fact that what happened in    June      was a military coup d        tat  or that the Protest Law must be abolished  we must ensure the proper means to counter those violations  or else we are just wasting our rights  In other words  the police has more weapons than citizens  so is protesting the best way to reject the Protest Law  or will it lead to more damage than advantages  Looking at the numbers of killings and imprisonments  this strategy has obviously not worked 
Another problem for human rights        advocates is the political speech they use  which does not serve their cause  using words like        political detainees        and playing more the role of opposition political activists than civil society 
Did their reports get attention in Geneva  On the contrary  Egypt        passed the test        in the Universal Periodic Review  This was thanks to Egyptian diplomacy  Why  Because the UN Human Rights        Council is not an institution that can implement punishment  They can only produce recommendations  Egypt played it smart by accepting some recommendations  discussing and negotiating  and the result was that its final official report was approved  In comparison  other human rights        reports were not recognised or influential  Even when they talked about the killing of Shaimaa Al Sabbagh  the response was that        legal measures have been undertaken by the Prosecutor General         Thus  getting back a right is a skill and conferring the issue must be properly done 
Do we have a problem with our civil society organisations 
Yes  because some of them undertake a political pressuring role against the government  which makes it impossible to work together towards progress  We also exchange accusations when one of us works with the government  But I tell them  yes  sometimes I have to negotiate with the other party to get results  unlike some who were unable to achieve anything for the citizens  now either live in fear and oppression or outside the country  uselessly 
Isn       t the state oppressing NGOs  especially those working in human rights 
It is a circle  As I told you  it depends on how you approach the state and tackle issues  For instance  the difference between my approach and somebody else       s would be how we discuss the same problem  I will try to make my point  for instance  by stating and proving a torture case  The government will deny it  The other organisations would not even sit with the government  and speak of systematic torture of prisoners  attack the state in their speeches  They reach a dead end and the state does not want them to work anymore  exchanging accusations of foreign conspiracy agendas  On the other hand  the state must amend the NGOs law 
Indeed  how do you view this new draft law regulating NGOs and other independent entities  Some claimed it is going be yet another form of subordination to direct state monitoring  financial and security control 
I don t agree  I think that one of the positive points of the law is that there will be a defined specialised committee approving or rejecting my projects  giving me a chance to appeal their decision before court  It also stipulates that an NGO is established with prior notification to the Ministry of Solidarity  which eases bureaucratic procedures  As for the part where we have to submit to monitoring  I don t see a problem as long as I have nothing to hide  I mean  before that NGOs were oppressed and denied authorisations without knowing        who        was behind it  and we knew it was National Security  Now things will be on the table  with clearly stated reasons for the rejection 
How about bringing NGO workers to questioning and trials  as in the infamous case of      
Maat was investigated during that event then released  The state is entitled to know where the money I am receiving from foreign sources is going  But let me tell you something else  it is sometimes us         civil society workers         who work against each other  file reports about each other  because it s a highly competitive environment and we know each other       s        dirty business         We pretend we are transparent but we       re not always so  We accuse the state of corruption  but we don       t look at ourselves 
Meanwhile  how would you assess the situation regarding parliamentary elections  the political environment  and the security condition in the country 
Parliamentary elections are late  even when first announced to take place last March  because the Supreme Electoral Commission  SEC  also delayed the announcement of the candidates        registration  Obviously  the decision making seemed troubled  Also  the laws organising parliamentary elections were controversial  and were debated for a long time  Many political factions rejected them  and the surprise was when the Supreme Constitutional Court  SCC  decided the non constitutionality of the law regarding the division of electoral districts  less than a month before elections were due to start  What happened was a serious mistake  Now we are        indefinitely        waiting for legal amendments 
President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi gave the committee in charge of drafting a new law one month  but here we are without progress yet  And I believe once the law comes out  there will be new appeals against it  We are in front of a very long process where the structure of the upcoming parliament depends on new candidates who will run this time  Political parties are divided between those who claim they were not considered for social dialogue and those who participated  despite that most of their suggestions were not used by the committee 
From January to April  and despite the halt of the elections  we   as a civil society organisation working with the International Observatory Mission   chose to observe political and social  economic and security changes in Egypt  which like parliamentary elections  are all components of the transitional period  We are focused on events related to violence and terrorism and their influence on the electoral process  We observed that over time  armed groups  increased attacks on civilians and public facilities  especially as we got closer to the Economic Summit held in mid March  We believe in a strong correlation between our variables  on the hypothesis that if citizens feel unsafe on the streets  they are not likely to put their lives in danger in order to vote for parliament 
In your opinion  why are we unable to get it right concerning parliamentary laws 
All the legislators are constitutional experts and sometimes there is no one right way  but rather various opinions which could be correct as well  However  we are in difficult political times and many factions aspire to political power and are in conflict with each other  Each party is watching the other  catching their mistakes  and that is why any issued law will remain at risk of non constitutionality  The SCC       s work under pressure results in flawed decisions 
Amid those political conflicts and disagreements among parties  some claimed the state directly interfered with electoral coalitions 
So they claim  but I think that is not the issue here  The real problem we need to address is what do citizens need  The basic citizen       s need is to survive  So security and bread are the most important things  and dignity is on many occasions irrelevant  Start speaking to them about democracy  freedoms and those concepts  they will not show the slightest interest  But tell them you       re a dictator and at the same time give them a satisfying monthly amount of money  they will be happy  These people       s top wishes are to be able to feed their families  They don t have any higher ambitions 
The public has become a guinea pig for different political regimes  yet did not see changes  Anybody who is going to speak in the name of democracy is not going to be appealing anymore to citizens  who only want to hear about economic growth and social development  Try to compare the limited or conditioned attendance of people to an educational seminar  and on the other hand their arrival hours early to an event which involves the distribution of free or very cheap products  such as school books  If a president wants the people to call his name  he should focus on social and economic rights  rather than political and civil rights 
Do you not think that in order to improve economic and social rights  there needs to be a democratic environment where corruption is not widespread  as well as guarantees that those rights are delivered on one hand  and accountability for failures on the other 
These two files are the main ones the agendas of civil society organisations  Some  and I was among them  claim that political and civil rights are more important than economic and social  We argued that in a democratic nation  transfer of power and a parliament representative of people       s will is the key to success  The other opinion places economic and social rights at the centre  A decent life  a satisfying income  health  education and so on  should pave the way for a democratic environment 
I personally tried to find a balance in between  which is based on a human rights approach  meaning that the two issues should progress in parallel  none of them should be less important than the other 
I believe that the neglect of economic and social rights is a weapon used by those in power to keep people       s ambitions at the lowest possible point  If people become economically and socially happy  they are going to seek more political rights  But when you have to work all day to earn a minimum living  you do not have time to think about powers  torture  freedom and so on  If the regime wants a democratic transition  it will care more about people       s rights to a decent economic and social status  Bear in mind that if any uprisings are on the rise  it is not going to be a revolution  but war 
Maat       s relationship with the state is to share interests  not oppose them to the well being of the citizen  As so we don       t start by pressuring the government  but looking to help them  If they reject this help  we will turn it into pressure for them to execute 
You have had international experience over time in elections        observations  especially in the Arab world  What are the differences and similarities with Egypt 
Indeed  I was in Sudan  Tunisia  Jordan  Iraq and Morocco  Each country has its situation  In Jordan  for example  the voters        database is nearly four million people in comparison to Egypt with over    million  But at a time when we still depended on paper  Jordan was much more advanced in technological use during elections  such as digital voters        registration  Egypt started realising many of the things that kept it behind other countries  such as establishing a permanent independent electoral commissioner in charge of the elections  in Jordan called the Independent High Electoral Commission
