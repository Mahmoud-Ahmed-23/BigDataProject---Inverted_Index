Hasse diagram of logical connectives 
In logic  a logical connective  also called a logical operator  sentential connective  or sentential operator  is a logical constant  Connectives can be used to connect logical formulas  For instance in the syntax of propositional logic  the binary connective 
  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  lor  
  
 can be used to join the two atomic formulas 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 and 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle Q 
  
  rendering the complex formula 
  
    
      
        P
          x     
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle P lor Q 
  
 
Common connectives include negation  disjunction  conjunction  implication  and equivalence  In standard systems of classical logic  these connectives are interpreted as truth functions  though they receive a variety of alternative interpretations in nonclassical logics  Their classical interpretations are similar to the meanings of natural language expressions such as English  not    or    and   and  if   but not identical  Discrepancies between natural language connectives and those of classical logic have motivated nonclassical approaches to natural language meaning as well as approaches which pair a classical compositional semantics with a robust pragmatics 


Overview edit 
In formal languages  truth functions are represented by unambiguous symbols  This allows logical statements to not be understood in an ambiguous way  These symbols are called logical connectives  logical operators  propositional operators  or  in classical logic  truth functional connectives  For the rules which allow new well formed formulas to be constructed by joining other well formed formulas using truth functional connectives  see well formed formula 
Logical connectives can be used to link zero or more statements  so one can speak about n ary logical connectives  The boolean constants True and False can be thought of as zero ary operators  Negation is a unary connective  and so on

Redundancy edit 
Such a logical connective as converse implication  
  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  leftarrow  
  
  is actually the same as material conditional with swapped arguments  thus  the symbol for converse implication is redundant  In some logical calculi  notably  in classical logic   certain essentially different compound statements are logically equivalent  A less trivial example of a redundancy is the classical equivalence between 
  
    
      
          xac 
        p
          x     
        q
      
    
      displaystyle  neg p vee q 
  
 and 
  
    
      
        p
          x     
        q
      
    
      displaystyle p to q 
  
  Therefore  a classical based logical system does not need the conditional operator

There are sixteen Boolean functions associating the input truth values 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
      displaystyle p 
  
 and 
  
    
      
        q
      
    
      displaystyle q 
  
 with four digit binary outputs              These correspond to possible choices of binary logical connectives for classical logic  Different implementations of classical logic can choose different functionally complete subsets of connectives 
One approach is to choose a minimal set  and define other connectives by some logical form  as in the example with the material conditional above 
The following are the minimal functionally complete sets of operators in classical logic whose arities do not exceed

Another approach is to use with equal rights connectives of a certain convenient and functionally complete  but not minimal set  This approach requires more propositional axioms  and each equivalence between logical forms must be either an axiom or provable as a theorem 
The situation  however  is more complicated in intuitionistic logic  Of its five connectives                   only negation     can be reduced to other connectives  see False  logic         False  negation and contradiction for more   Neither conjunction  disjunction  nor material conditional has an equivalent form constructed from the other four logical connectives 

Natural language edit 
The standard logical connectives of classical logic have rough equivalents in the grammars of natural languages  In English  as in many languages  such expressions are typically grammatical conjunctions  However  they can also take the form of complementizers  verb suffixes  and particles  The denotations of natural language connectives is a major topic of research in formal semantics  a field that studies the logical structure of natural languages 
The meanings of natural language connectives are not precisely identical to their nearest equivalents in classical logic  In particular  disjunction can receive an exclusive interpretation in many languages  Some researchers have taken this fact as evidence that natural language semantics is nonclassical  However  others maintain classical semantics by positing pragmatic accounts of exclusivity which create the illusion of nonclassicality  In such accounts  exclusivity is typically treated as a scalar implicature  Related puzzles involving disjunction include free choice inferences  Hurford s Constraint  and the contribution of disjunction in alternative questions 
Other apparent discrepancies between natural language and classical logic include the paradoxes of material implication  donkey anaphora and the problem of counterfactual conditionals  These phenomena have been taken as motivation for identifying the denotations of natural language conditionals with logical operators including the strict conditional  the variably strict conditional  as well as various dynamic operators 
The following table shows the standard classically definable approximations for the English connectives

Properties edit 
Some logical connectives possess properties that may be expressed in the theorems containing the connective  Some of those properties that a logical connective may have are 

Associativity
Within an expression containing two or more of the same associative connectives in a row  the order of the operations does not matter as long as the sequence of the operands is not changed 
Commutativity
The operands of the connective may be swapped  preserving logical equivalence to the original expression 
Distributivity
A connective denoted by   distributes over another connective denoted by    if a    b   c     a   b     a   c  for all operands a  b  c 
Idempotence
Whenever the operands of the operation are the same  the compound is logically equivalent to the operand 
Absorption
A pair of connectives                  satisfies the absorption law if 
  
    
      
        a
          x     
         
        a
          x     
        b
         
         
        a
      
    
      displaystyle a land  a lor b  a 
  
 for all operands a  b 
Monotonicity
If f a        an    f b        bn  for all a        an  b        bn         such that a    b   a    b        an   bn  E g                          
Affinity
Each variable always makes a difference in the truth value of the operation or it never makes a difference  E g               
  
    
      
          x  ae 
      
    
      displaystyle  nleftrightarrow  
  
       
Duality
To read the truth value assignments for the operation from top to bottom on its truth table is the same as taking the complement of reading the table of the same or another connective from bottom to top  Without resorting to truth tables it may be formulated as g        a         an     g a        an   E g          
Truth preserving
The compound all those arguments are tautologies is a tautology itself  E g                                 see validity  
Falsehood preserving
The compound all those argument are contradictions is a contradiction itself  E g                     
  
    
      
          x  ae 
      
    
      displaystyle  nleftrightarrow  
  
           see validity  
Involutivity  for unary connectives 
f f a     a  E g  negation in classical logic 
For classical and intuitionistic logic  the     symbol means that corresponding implications           and           for logical compounds can be both proved as theorems  and the     symbol means that           for logical compounds is a consequence of corresponding           connectives for propositional variables  Some many valued logics may have incompatible definitions of equivalence and order  entailment  
Both conjunction and disjunction are associative  commutative and idempotent in classical logic  most varieties of many valued logic and intuitionistic logic  The same is true about distributivity of conjunction over disjunction and disjunction over conjunction  as well as for the absorption law 
In classical logic and some varieties of many valued logic  conjunction and disjunction are dual  and negation is self dual  the latter is also self dual in intuitionistic logic

Order of precedence edit 
As a way of reducing the number of necessary parentheses  one may introduce precedence rules         has higher precedence than                  higher than          and         higher than    So for example  
  
    
      
        P
          x     
        Q
          x     
        
            xac 
          R
        
          x     
        S
      
    
      displaystyle P vee Q land   neg R  rightarrow S 
  
 is short for 
  
    
      
         
        P
          x     
         
        Q
          x     
         
          xac 
        R
         
         
         
          x     
        S
      
    
      displaystyle  P vee  Q land   neg R    rightarrow S 
  
 
Here is a table that shows a commonly used precedence of logical operators

          xac 
      
    
      displaystyle  neg  
  

 



  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  land  
  

 



  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  vee  
  

 



  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  rightarrow  
  

 



  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  leftrightarrow  
  

 

However  not all compilers use the same order  for instance  an ordering in which disjunction is lower precedence than implication or bi implication has also been used              Sometimes precedence between conjunction and disjunction is unspecified requiring to provide it explicitly in given formula with parentheses  The order of precedence determines which connective is the  main connective  when interpreting a non atomic formula 

Table and Hasse diagram edit 
The    logical connectives can be partially ordered to produce the following Hasse diagram  
The partial order is defined by declaring that 
  
    
      
        x
          x     
        y
      
    
      displaystyle x leq y 
  
 if and only if whenever 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
      displaystyle x 
  
 holds then so does 
  
    
      
        y
         
      
    
      displaystyle y  
  
 













              


Applications edit 
Logical connectives are used in computer science and in set theory 

Computer science edit 
Main article  Logic gate
A truth functional approach to logical operators is implemented as logic gates in digital circuits  Practically all digital circuits  the major exception is DRAM  are built up from NAND  NOR  NOT  and transmission gates  see more details in Truth function in computer science  Logical operators over bit vectors  corresponding to finite Boolean algebras  are bitwise operations 
But not every usage of a logical connective in computer programming has a Boolean semantic  For example  lazy evaluation is sometimes implemented for P   Q and P   Q  so these connectives are not commutative if either or both of the expressions P  Q have side effects  Also  a conditional  which in some sense corresponds to the material conditional connective  is essentially non Boolean because for if  P  then Q   the consequent      Q is not executed if the antecedent      P is false  although a compound as a whole is successful    true  in such case   This is closer to intuitionist and constructivist views on the material conditional  rather than to classical logic s views 

Set theory edit 
Main articles  Set theory and Axiomatic set theory
Logical connectives are used to define the fundamental operations of set theory              as follows
