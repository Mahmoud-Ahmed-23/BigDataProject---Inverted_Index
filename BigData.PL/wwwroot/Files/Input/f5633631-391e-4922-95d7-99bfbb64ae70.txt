							Egypt has reaffirmed its unwavering support for the Palestinian people       s right of return  self determination  and the establishment of an independent state  asserting that these rights are essential for achieving lasting peace and stability in the Middle East 
In a Monday statement  the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said that amidst the critical and pivotal phase the Middle East is currently undergoing  Egypt emphasises that the only way to confront the dangers and threats to regional and international peace and security resulting from the Israeli occupation  and the recent Israeli aggression against Gaza and its repercussions  is for the international community to adopt an approach that respects the rights of all peoples of the region without discrimination  including the Palestinian people  who are suffering from unprecedented injustice to their fundamental rights  including their right to live in peace on their land and in their homeland 
Egypt calls upon the international community  with its various international and regional components  to unite behind a political vision for resolving the Palestinian issue  founded on the necessity of ending the historical injustice to which the Palestinian people have been and continue to be subjected  and restoring to these honourable people their legitimate and inalienable rights 
In this context  Egypt maintains its rejection of any infringement of these rights  including the right to self determination  the right to remain on their land  and the right to independence  
It also upholds the right of return for Palestinian refugees who were forced to leave their homeland  in a manner consistent with human values and the principles of international law and international humanitarian law  including United Nations resolutions  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and the Fourth Geneva Convention 
The Egypt stresses that ignoring international legitimacy in dealing with the region       s crises threatens to undermine the foundations of peace that have been painstakingly preserved and enshrined over decades  It affirms its intention to continue cooperating with all regional and international partners to achieve a comprehensive and just peace in the region  and to establish an independent State of Palestine on its land in accordance with international law on the lines of June          with East Jerusalem as its capital
