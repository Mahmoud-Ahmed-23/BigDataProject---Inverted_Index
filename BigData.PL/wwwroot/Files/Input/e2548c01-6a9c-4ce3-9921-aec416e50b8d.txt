Neuroscience is the scientific study of the nervous system  the brain  spinal cord  and peripheral nervous system   its functions  and its disorders                                   It is a multidisciplinary science that combines physiology  anatomy  molecular biology  developmental biology  cytology  psychology  physics  computer science  chemistry  medicine  statistics  and mathematical modeling to understand the fundamental and emergent properties of neurons  glia and neural circuits                                                         The understanding of the biological basis of learning  memory  behavior  perception  and consciousness has been described by Eric Kandel as the  epic challenge  of the biological sciences            
The scope of neuroscience has broadened over time to include different approaches used to study the nervous system at different scales  The techniques used by neuroscientists have expanded enormously  from molecular and cellular studies of individual neurons to imaging of sensory  motor and cognitive tasks in the brain 


History edit 
Main article  History of neuroscience
Illustration from Gray s Anatomy        of a lateral view of the human brain  featuring the hippocampus among other neuroanatomical features
The earliest study of the nervous system dates to ancient Egypt  Trepanation  the surgical practice of either drilling or scraping a hole into the skull for the purpose of curing head injuries or mental disorders  or relieving cranial pressure  was first recorded during the Neolithic period  Manuscripts dating to           BC indicate that the Egyptians had some knowledge about symptoms of brain damage             
Early views on the function of the brain regarded it to be a  cranial stuffing  of sorts  In Egypt  from the late Middle Kingdom onwards  the brain was regularly removed in preparation for mummification  It was believed at the time that the heart was the seat of intelligence  According to Herodotus  the first step of mummification was to  take a crooked piece of iron  and with it draw out the brain through the nostrils  thus getting rid of a portion  while the skull is cleared of the rest by rinsing with drugs              
The view that the heart was the source of consciousness was not challenged until the time of the Greek physician Hippocrates  He believed that the brain was not only involved with sensation since most specialized organs  e g        eyes  ears  tongue  are located in the head near the brain but was also the seat of intelligence              Plato also speculated that the brain was the seat of the rational part of the soul              Aristotle  however  believed the heart was the center of intelligence and that the brain regulated the amount of heat from the heart              This view was generally accepted until the Roman physician Galen  a follower of Hippocrates and physician to Roman gladiators  observed that his patients lost their mental faculties when they had sustained damage to their brains             
Abulcasis  Averroes  Avicenna  Avenzoar  and Maimonides  active in the Medieval Muslim world  described a number of medical problems related to the brain  In Renaissance Europe  Vesalius              Ren  Descartes              Thomas Willis             and Jan Swammerdam             also made several contributions to neuroscience 

The Golgi stain first allowed for the visualization of individual neurons 
Luigi Galvani s pioneering work in the late     s set the stage for studying the electrical excitability of muscles and neurons  In      Emil du Bois Reymond demonstrated the electrical nature of the nerve signal              whose speed Hermann von Helmholtz proceeded to measure              and in      Richard Caton found electrical phenomena in the cerebral hemispheres of rabbits and monkeys              Adolf Beck published in      similar observations of spontaneous electrical activity of the brain of rabbits and dogs              Studies of the brain became more sophisticated after the invention of the microscope and the development of a staining procedure by Camillo Golgi during the late     s  The procedure used a silver chromate salt to reveal the intricate structures of individual neurons  His technique was used by Santiago Ram n y Cajal and led to the formation of the neuron doctrine  the hypothesis that the functional unit of the brain is the neuron              Golgi and Ram n y Cajal shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in      for their extensive observations  descriptions  and categorizations of neurons throughout the brain 
In parallel with this research  in      Jean Pierre Flourens induced localized lesions of the brain in living animals to observe their effects on motricity  sensibility and behavior  Work with brain damaged patients by Marc Dax in      and Paul Broca in      suggested that certain regions of the brain were responsible for certain functions  At the time  these findings were seen as a confirmation of Franz Joseph Gall s theory that language was localized and that certain psychological functions were localized in specific areas of the cerebral cortex                          The localization of function hypothesis was supported by observations of epileptic patients conducted by John Hughlings Jackson  who correctly inferred the organization of the motor cortex by watching the progression of seizures through the body  Carl Wernicke further developed the theory of the specialization of specific brain structures in language comprehension and production  Modern research through neuroimaging techniques  still uses the Brodmann cerebral cytoarchitectonic map  referring to the study of cell structure  anatomical definitions from this era in continuing to show that distinct areas of the cortex are activated in the execution of specific tasks             
During the   th century  neuroscience began to be recognized as a distinct academic discipline in its own right  rather than as studies of the nervous system within other disciplines  Eric Kandel and collaborators have cited David Rioch  Francis O  Schmitt  and Stephen Kuffler as having played critical roles in establishing the field              Rioch originated the integration of basic anatomical and physiological research with clinical psychiatry at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research  starting in the     s  During the same period  Schmitt established a neuroscience research program within the Biology Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  bringing together biology  chemistry  physics  and mathematics  The first freestanding neuroscience department  then called Psychobiology  was founded in      at the University of California  Irvine by James L  McGaugh              This was followed by the Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School  which was founded in      by Stephen Kuffler             

  D sensory and motor homunculus models at the Natural History Museum  London
In the process of treating epilepsy  Wilder Penfield produced maps of the location of various functions  motor  sensory  memory  vision  in the brain                          He summarized his findings in a      book called The Cerebral Cortex of Man              Wilder Penfield and his co investigators Edwin Boldrey and Theodore Rasmussen are considered to be the originators of the cortical homunculus             
The understanding of neurons and of nervous system function became increasingly precise and molecular during the   th century  For example  in       Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley presented a mathematical model for the transmission of electrical signals in neurons of the giant axon of a squid  which they called  action potentials   and how they are initiated and propagated  known as the Hodgkin Huxley model  In            Richard FitzHugh and J  Nagumo simplified Hodgkin Huxley  in what is called the FitzHugh Nagumo model  In       Bernard Katz modeled neurotransmission across the space between neurons known as synapses  Beginning in       Eric Kandel and collaborators examined biochemical changes in neurons associated with learning and memory storage in Aplysia  In      Catherine Morris and Harold Lecar combined these models in the Morris Lecar model  Such increasingly quantitative work gave rise to numerous biological neuron models and models of neural computation 
As a result of the increasing interest about the nervous system  several prominent neuroscience organizations have been formed to provide a forum to all neuroscientists during the   th century  For example  the International Brain Research Organization was founded in                   the International Society for Neurochemistry in                   the European Brain and Behaviour Society in                   and the Society for Neuroscience in                   Recently  the application of neuroscience research results has also given rise to applied disciplines as neuroeconomics              neuroeducation              neuroethics              and neurolaw             
Over time  brain research has gone through philosophical  experimental  and theoretical phases  with work on neural implants and brain simulation predicted to be important in the future             

Modern neuroscience edit 
Main article  Outline of neuroscience
Human nervous system
The scientific study of the nervous system increased significantly during the second half of the twentieth century  principally due to advances in molecular biology  electrophysiology  and computational neuroscience  This has allowed neuroscientists to study the nervous system in all its aspects  how it is structured  how it works  how it develops  how it malfunctions  and how it can be changed 
For example  it has become possible to understand  in much detail  the complex processes occurring within a single neuron  Neurons are cells specialized for communication  They are able to communicate with neurons and other cell types through specialized junctions called synapses  at which electrical or electrochemical signals can be transmitted from one cell to another  Many neurons extrude a long thin filament of axoplasm called an axon  which may extend to distant parts of the body and are capable of rapidly carrying electrical signals  influencing the activity of other neurons  muscles  or glands at their termination points  A nervous system emerges from the assemblage of neurons that are connected to each other in neural circuits  and networks 
The vertebrate nervous system can be split into two parts  the central nervous system  defined as the brain and spinal cord   and the peripheral nervous system  In many species including all vertebrates the nervous system is the most complex organ system in the body  with most of the complexity residing in the brain  The human brain alone contains around one hundred billion neurons and one hundred trillion synapses  it consists of thousands of distinguishable substructures  connected to each other in synaptic networks whose intricacies have only begun to be unraveled  At least one out of three of the approximately        genes belonging to the human genome is expressed mainly in the brain             
Due to the high degree of plasticity of the human brain  the structure of its synapses and their resulting functions change throughout life             
Making sense of the nervous system s dynamic complexity is a formidable research challenge  Ultimately  neuroscientists would like to understand every aspect of the nervous system  including how it works  how it develops  how it malfunctions  and how it can be altered or repaired  Analysis of the nervous system is therefore performed at multiple levels  ranging from the molecular and cellular levels to the systems and cognitive levels  The specific topics that form the main focus of research change over time  driven by an ever expanding base of knowledge and the availability of increasingly sophisticated technical methods  Improvements in technology have been the primary drivers of progress  Developments in electron microscopy  computer science  electronics  functional neuroimaging  and genetics and genomics have all been major drivers of progress 
Advances in the classification of brain cells have been enabled by electrophysiological recording  single cell genetic sequencing  and high quality microscopy  which have combined into a single method pipeline called patch sequencing in which all three methods are simultaneously applied using miniature tools              The efficiency of this method and the large amounts of data that is generated has allowed researchers to make some general conclusions about cell types  for example that the human and mouse brain have different versions of fundamentally the same cell types             

Molecular and cellular neuroscience edit 
Main articles  Molecular neuroscience and Cellular neurosciencePhotograph of a stained neuron in a chicken embryo
Basic questions addressed in molecular neuroscience include the mechanisms by which neurons express and respond to molecular signals and how axons form complex connectivity patterns  At this level  tools from molecular biology and genetics are used to understand how neurons develop and how genetic changes affect biological functions              The morphology  molecular identity  and physiological characteristics of neurons and how they relate to different types of behavior are also of considerable interest             
Questions addressed in cellular neuroscience include the mechanisms of how neurons process signals physiologically and electrochemically  These questions include how signals are processed by neurites and somas and how neurotransmitters and electrical signals are used to process information in a neuron  Neurites are thin extensions from a neuronal cell body  consisting of dendrites  specialized to receive synaptic inputs from other neurons  and axons  specialized to conduct nerve impulses called action potentials   Somas are the cell bodies of the neurons and contain the nucleus             
Another major area of cellular neuroscience is the investigation of the development of the nervous system              Questions include the patterning and regionalization of the nervous system  axonal and dendritic development  trophic interactions  synapse formation and the implication of fractones in neural stem cells                          differentiation of neurons and glia  neurogenesis and gliogenesis   and neuronal migration             
Computational neurogenetic modeling is concerned with the development of dynamic neuronal models for modeling brain functions with respect to genes and dynamic interactions between genes  on the cellular level  Computational Neurogenetic Modeling  CNGM  can also be used to model neural systems              

Neural circuits and systems edit 
Main articles  Neural circuit and Systems neuroscienceProposed organization of motor semantic neural circuits for action language comprehension  Adapted from Shebani et al         
Systems neuroscience research centers on the structural and functional architecture of the developing human brain  and the functions of large scale brain networks  or functionally connected systems within e brain  Alongside brain development  systems neuroscience also focuses on how the structure and function of the brain enables or restricts the processing of sensory information  using learned mental models of the world  to motivate behavior 
Questions in systems neuroscience include how neural circuits are formed and used anatomically and physiologically to produce functions such as reflexes  multisensory integration  motor coordination  circadian rhythms  emotional responses  learning  and memory              In other words  this area of research studies how connections are made and morphed in the brain  and the effect it has on human sensation  movement  attention  inhibitory control  decision making  reasoning  memory formation  reward  and emotion regulation             
Specific areas of interest for the field include observations of how the structure of neural circuits effect skill acquisition  how specialized regions of the brain develop and change  neuroplasticity   and the development of brain atlases  or wiring diagrams of individual developing brains             
The related fields of neuroethology and neuropsychology address the question of how neural substrates underlie specific animal and human behaviors              Neuroendocrinology and psychoneuroimmunology examine interactions between the nervous system and the endocrine and immune systems  respectively              Despite many advancements  the way that networks of neurons perform complex cognitive processes and behaviors is still poorly understood             

Cognitive and behavioral neuroscience edit 
Main articles  Behavioral neuroscience and Cognitive neuroscience
Cognitive neuroscience addresses the questions of how psychological functions are produced by neural circuitry  The emergence of powerful new measurement techniques such as neuroimaging  e g   fMRI  PET  SPECT   EEG  MEG  electrophysiology  optogenetics and human genetic analysis combined with sophisticated experimental techniques from cognitive psychology allows neuroscientists and psychologists to address abstract questions such as how cognition and emotion are mapped to specific neural substrates  Although many studies hold a reductionist stance looking for the neurobiological basis of cognitive phenomena  recent research shows that there is an interplay between neuroscientific findings and conceptual research  soliciting and integrating both perspectives  For example  neuroscience research on empathy solicited an interdisciplinary debate involving philosophy  psychology and psychopathology              Moreover  the neuroscientific identification of multiple memory systems related to different brain areas has challenged the idea of memory as a literal reproduction of the past  supporting a view of memory as a generative  constructive and dynamic process             
Neuroscience is also allied with the social and behavioral sciences  as well as with nascent interdisciplinary fields  Examples of such alliances include neuroeconomics  decision theory  social neuroscience  and neuromarketing to address complex questions about interactions of the brain with its environment  A study into consumer responses for example uses EEG to investigate neural correlates associated with narrative transportation into stories about energy efficiency             

Computational neuroscience edit 
Main article  Computational neuroscience
Questions in computational neuroscience can span a wide range of levels of traditional analysis  such as development  structure  and cognitive functions of the brain  Research in this field utilizes mathematical models  theoretical analysis  and computer simulation to describe and verify biologically plausible neurons and nervous systems  For example  biological neuron models are mathematical descriptions of spiking neurons which can be used to describe both the behavior of single neurons as well as the dynamics of neural networks  Computational neuroscience is often referred to as theoretical neuroscience 

Neuroscience and medicine edit 
Clinical neuroscience edit 
Main article  Neurotherapy
Further information  Clinical neuroscience
Neurology  psychiatry  neurosurgery  psychosurgery  anesthesiology and pain medicine  neuropathology  neuroradiology  ophthalmology  otolaryngology  clinical neurophysiology  addiction medicine  and sleep medicine are some medical specialties that specifically address the diseases of the nervous system  These terms also refer to clinical disciplines involving diagnosis and treatment of these diseases             
Neurology works with diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems  such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  ALS  and stroke  and their medical treatment  Psychiatry focuses on affective  behavioral  cognitive  and perceptual disorders  Anesthesiology focuses on perception of pain  and pharmacologic alteration of consciousness  Neuropathology focuses upon the classification and underlying pathogenic mechanisms of central and peripheral nervous system and muscle diseases  with an emphasis on morphologic  microscopic  and chemically observable alterations  Neurosurgery and psychosurgery work primarily with surgical treatment of diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems             
Neuroscience underlies the development of various neurotherapy methods to treat diseases of the nervous system                                     

Translational research edit 
Further information  Translational research and Translational neuroscience

Recently  the boundaries between various specialties have blurred  as they are all influenced by basic research in neuroscience  For example  brain imaging enables objective biological insight into mental illnesses  which can lead to faster diagnosis  more accurate prognosis  and improved monitoring of patient progress over time             
Integrative neuroscience describes the effort to combine models and information from multiple levels of research to develop a coherent model of the nervous system  For example  brain imaging coupled with physiological numerical models and theories of fundamental mechanisms may shed light on psychiatric disorders             
Another important area of translational research is brain computer interfaces  BCIs   or machines that are able to communicate and influence the brain  They are currently being researched for their potential to repair neural systems and restore certain cognitive functions              However  some ethical considerations have to be dealt with before they are accepted                         

Major branches edit 
Modern neuroscience education and research activities can be very roughly categorized into the following major branches  based on the subject and scale of the system in examination as well as distinct experimental or curricular approaches  Individual neuroscientists  however  often work on questions that span several distinct subfields

Engineering applications of neuroscience edit 
Neuromorphic computer chips edit 
Neuromorphic engineering is a branch of neuroscience that deals with creating functional physical models of neurons for the purposes of useful computation  The emergent computational properties of neuromorphic computers are fundamentally different from conventional computers in the sense that they are complex systems  and that the computational components are interrelated with no central processor              
One example of such a computer is the SpiNNaker supercomputer              
Sensors can also be made smart with neuromorphic technology  An example of this is the Event Camera s BrainScaleS  brain inspired Multiscale Computation in Neuromorphic Hybrid Systems   a hybrid analog neuromorphic supercomputer located at Heidelberg University in Germany  It was developed as part of the Human Brain Project s neuromorphic computing platform and is the complement to the SpiNNaker supercomputer  which is based on digital technology  The architecture used in BrainScaleS mimics biological neurons and their connections on a physical level  additionally  since the components are made of silicon  these model neurons operate on average     times     hours of real time is     seconds in the machine simulation  that of their biological counterparts              
Recent advances in neuromorphic microchip technology have led a group of scientists to create an artificial neuron that can replace real neurons in diseases
