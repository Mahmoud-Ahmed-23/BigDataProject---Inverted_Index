Collective behavior of decentralized  self organized systems
A flock of starlings reacting to a predator
Swarm intelligence  SI  is the collective behavior of decentralized  self organized systems  natural or artificial  The concept is employed in work on artificial intelligence  The expression was introduced by Gerardo Beni and Jing Wang in       in the context of cellular robotic systems                       
Swarm intelligence systems consist typically of a population of simple agents or boids interacting locally with one another and with their environment             The inspiration often comes from nature  especially biological systems             The agents follow very simple rules  and although there is no centralized control structure dictating how individual agents should behave  local  and to a certain degree random  interactions between such agents lead to the emergence of  intelligent  global behavior  unknown to the individual agents             Examples of swarm intelligence in natural systems include ant colonies  bee colonies  bird flocking  hawks hunting  animal herding  bacterial growth  fish schooling and microbial intelligence 
The application of swarm principles to robots is called swarm robotics while swarm intelligence refers to the more general set of algorithms  Swarm prediction has been used in the context of forecasting problems  Similar approaches to those proposed for swarm robotics are considered for genetically modified organisms in synthetic collective intelligence

Boids  Reynolds       edit 
Main article  Boids
Boids is an artificial life program  developed by Craig Reynolds in       which simulates flocking  It was published in      in the proceedings of the ACM SIGGRAPH conference            
The name  boid  corresponds to a shortened version of  bird oid object   which refers to a bird like object            
As with most artificial life simulations  Boids is an example of emergent behavior  that is  the complexity of Boids arises from the interaction of individual agents  the boids  in this case  adhering to a set of simple rules   The rules applied in the simplest Boids world are as follows 

separation  steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
alignment  steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
cohesion  steer to move toward the average position  center of mass  of local flockmates
More complex rules can be added  such as obstacle avoidance and goal seeking 

Self propelled particles  Vicsek et al         edit 
Main article  Self propelled particles
Self propelled particles  SPP   also referred to as the Vicsek model  was introduced in      by Vicsek et al             as a special case of the boids model introduced in      by Reynolds             A swarm is modelled in SPP by a collection of particles that move with a constant speed but respond to a random perturbation by adopting at each time increment the average direction of motion of the other particles in their local neighbourhood              SPP models predict that swarming animals share certain properties at the group level  regardless of the type of animals in the swarm              Swarming systems give rise to emergent behaviours which occur at many different scales  some of which are turning out to be both universal and robust  It has become a challenge in theoretical physics to find minimal statistical models that capture these behaviours                                     

Metaheuristics edit 
See also  List of metaphor based metaheuristics
Evolutionary algorithms  EA   particle swarm optimization  PSO   differential evolution  DE   ant colony optimization  ACO  and their variants dominate the field of nature inspired metaheuristics              This list includes algorithms published up to circa the year       A large number of more recent metaphor inspired metaheuristics have started to attract criticism in the research community for hiding their lack of novelty behind an elaborate metaphor                                      For algorithms published since that time  see List of metaphor based metaheuristics 
Metaheuristics lack a confidence in a solution              When appropriate parameters are determined  and when sufficient convergence stage is achieved  they often find a solution that is optimal  or near close to optimum   nevertheless  if one does not know optimal solution in advance  a quality of a solution is not known              In spite of this obvious drawback it has been shown that these types of algorithms work well in practice  and have been extensively researched  and developed                                                               On the other hand  it is possible to avoid this drawback by calculating solution quality for a special case where such calculation is possible  and after such run it is known that every solution that is at least as good as the solution a special case had  has at least a solution confidence a special case had  One such instance is Ant inspired Monte Carlo algorithm for Minimum Feedback Arc Set where this has been achieved probabilistically via hybridization of Monte Carlo algorithm with Ant Colony Optimization technique             

Ant colony optimization  Dorigo       edit 
Main article  Ant colony optimization
Ant colony optimization  ACO   introduced by Dorigo in his doctoral dissertation  is a class of optimization algorithms modeled on the actions of an ant colony  ACO is a probabilistic technique useful in problems that deal with finding better paths through graphs  Artificial  ants  simulation agents locate optimal solutions by moving through a parameter space representing all possible solutions  Natural ants lay down pheromones directing each other to resources while exploring their environment  The simulated  ants  similarly record their positions and the quality of their solutions  so that in later simulation iterations more ants locate for better solutions             

Particle swarm optimization  Kennedy  Eberhart  amp  Shi       edit 
Main article  Particle swarm optimization
Particle swarm optimization  PSO  is a global optimization algorithm for dealing with problems in which a best solution can be represented as a point or surface in an n dimensional space   Hypotheses are plotted in this space and seeded with an initial velocity  as well as a communication channel between the particles                           Particles then move through the solution space  and are evaluated according to some fitness criterion after each timestep  Over time  particles are accelerated towards those particles within their communication grouping which have better fitness values  The main advantage of such an approach over other global minimization strategies such as simulated annealing is that the large number of members that make up the particle swarm make the technique impressively resilient to the problem of local minima 

Artificial bee colony algorithm  Karaboga       edit 
Main article  Artificial bee colony algorithm
Karaboga introduced ABC metaheuristic in      as an answer to optimize numerical problems  Inspired by honey bee foraging behavior  Karaboga s model had three components  The employed  onlooker  and scout  In practice  the artificial scout bee would expose all food source positions  solutions  good or bad  The employed bee would search for the shortest route to each position to extract the food amount  quality  of the source  If the food was depleted from the source  the employed bee would become a scout and randomly search for other food sources  Each source that became abandoned created negative feedback meaning  the answers found were poor solutions  The onlooker bees wait for employed bees to either abandon a source or give information that the source has a large quantity of food and is worth sending additional resources to  The more an onlooker bee is recruited  the more positive the feedback is meaning that the answer is likely a good solution 

Artificial Swarm Intelligence        edit 
Artificial Swarm Intelligence  ASI  is method of amplifying the collective intelligence of networked human groups using control algorithms modeled after natural swarms  Sometimes referred to as Human Swarming or Swarm AI  the technology connects groups of human participants into real time systems that deliberate and converge on solutions as dynamic swarms when simultaneously presented with a question                                      ASI has been used for a wide range of applications  from enabling business teams to generate highly accurate financial forecasts             to enabling sports fans to outperform Vegas betting markets              ASI has also been used to enable groups of doctors to generate diagnoses with significantly higher accuracy than traditional methods                          ASI has been used by the Food and Agriculture Organization  FAO  of the United Nations to help forecast famines in hotspots around the world                  better      source      needed     

Applications edit 
Swarm Intelligence based techniques can be used in a number of applications   The U S  military is investigating swarm techniques for controlling unmanned vehicles  The European Space Agency is thinking about an orbital swarm for self assembly and interferometry  NASA is investigating the use of swarm technology for planetary mapping   A      paper by M  Anthony Lewis and George A  Bekey discusses the possibility of using swarm intelligence to control nanobots within the body for the purpose of killing cancer tumors              Conversely al Rifaie and Aber have used stochastic diffusion search to help locate tumours                          Swarm intelligence  SI  is increasingly applied in Internet of Things  IoT                          systems  and by association to Intent Based Networking  IBN               due to its ability to handle complex  distributed tasks through decentralized  self organizing algorithms  Swarm intelligence has also been applied for data mining             and cluster analysis              Ant based models are further subject of modern management theory             

Ant based routing edit 
The use of swarm intelligence in telecommunication networks has also been researched  in the form of ant based routing  This was pioneered separately by Dorigo et al  and Hewlett Packard in the mid     s  with a number of variants existing  Basically  this uses a probabilistic routing table rewarding reinforcing the route successfully traversed by each  ant   a small control packet  which flood the network  Reinforcement of the route in the forwards  reverse direction and both simultaneously have been researched  backwards reinforcement requires a symmetric network and couples the two directions together  forwards reinforcement rewards a route before the outcome is known  but then one would pay for the cinema before one knows how good the film is   As the system behaves stochastically and is therefore lacking repeatability  there are large hurdles to commercial deployment  Mobile media and new technologies have the potential to change the threshold for collective action due to swarm intelligence  Rheingold        P     
The location of transmission infrastructure for wireless communication networks is an important engineering problem involving competing objectives  A minimal selection of locations  or sites  are required subject to providing adequate area coverage for users  A very different  ant inspired swarm intelligence algorithm  stochastic diffusion search  SDS   has been successfully used to provide a general model for this problem  related to circle packing and set covering  It has been shown that the SDS can be applied to identify suitable solutions even for large problem instances             
Airlines have also used ant based routing in assigning aircraft arrivals to airport gates  At Southwest Airlines a software program uses swarm theory  or swarm intelligence the idea that a colony of ants works better than one alone  Each pilot acts like an ant searching for the best airport gate   The pilot learns from his experience what s the best for him  and it turns out that that s the best solution for the airline   Douglas A  Lawson explains  As a result  the  colony  of pilots always go to gates they can arrive at and depart from quickly  The program can even alert a pilot of plane back ups before they happen   We can anticipate that it s going to happen  so we ll have a gate available   Lawson says

Instances edit 
The Lord of the Rings film trilogy made use of similar technology  known as Massive  software   during battle scenes  Swarm technology is particularly attractive because it is cheap  robust  and simple

Tim Burton s Batman Returns also made use of swarm technology for showing the movements of a group of bats 
            
Airlines have used swarm theory to simulate passengers boarding a plane  Southwest Airlines researcher Douglas A  Lawson used an ant based computer simulation employing only six interaction rules to evaluate boarding times using various boarding methods  Miller        xii xviii              

Human swarming edit 
Networks of distributed users can be organized into  human swarms  through the implementation of real time closed loop control systems                          Developed by Louis Rosenberg in            human swarming  also called artificial swarm intelligence  allows the collective intelligence of interconnected groups of people online to be harnessed                          The collective intelligence of the group often exceeds the abilities of any one member of the group              
Stanford University School of Medicine published in      a study showing that groups of human doctors  when connected together by real time swarming algorithms  could diagnose medical conditions with substantially higher accuracy than individual doctors or groups of doctors working together using traditional crowd sourcing methods   In one such study  swarms of human radiologists connected together were tasked with diagnosing chest x rays and demonstrated a     reduction in diagnostic errors as compared to the traditional human methods  and a     improvement over traditional machine learning                                                  
The University of California San Francisco  UCSF  School of Medicine released a preprint in      about the diagnosis of MRI images by small groups of collaborating doctors  The study showed a     increase in diagnostic accuracy when using Artificial Swarm Intelligence  ASI  technology compared to majority voting                         

Swarm grammars edit 
Swarm grammars are swarms of stochastic grammars that can be evolved to describe complex properties such as found in art and architecture              These grammars interact as agents behaving according to rules of swarm intelligence  Such behavior can also suggest deep learning algorithms  in particular when mapping of such swarms to neural circuits is considered             

Swarmic art edit 
In a series of works  al Rifaie et al              have successfully used two swarm intelligence algorithms one mimicking the behaviour of one species of ants  Leptothorax acervorum  foraging  stochastic diffusion search  SDS  and the other algorithm mimicking the behaviour of birds flocking  particle swarm optimization  PSO  to describe a novel integration strategy exploiting the local search properties of the PSO with global SDS behaviour  The resulting hybrid algorithm is used to sketch novel drawings of an input image  exploiting an artistic tension between the local behaviour of the  birds flocking  as they seek to follow the input sketch and the global behaviour of the  ants foraging  as they seek to encourage the flock to explore novel regions of the canvas  The  creativity  of this hybrid swarm system has been analysed under the philosophical light of the  rhizome  in the context of Deleuze s  Orchid and Wasp  metaphor             
A more recent work of al Rifaie et al    Swarmic Sketches and Attention Mechanism               introduces a novel approach deploying the mechanism of  attention  by adapting SDS to selectively attend to detailed areas of a digital canvas  Once the attention of the swarm is drawn to a certain line within the canvas  the capability of PSO is used to produce a  swarmic sketch  of the attended line  The swarms move throughout the digital canvas in an attempt to satisfy their dynamic roles attention to areas with more details associated with them via their fitness function  Having associated the rendering process with the concepts of attention  the performance of the participating swarms creates a unique  non identical sketch each time the  artist  swarms embark on interpreting the input line drawings  In other works  while PSO is responsible for the sketching process  SDS controls the attention of the swarm 
In a similar work   Swarmic Paintings and Colour Attention               non photorealistic images are produced using SDS algorithm which  in the context of this work  is responsible for colour attention 
The  computational creativity  of the above mentioned systems are discussed in                                     through the two prerequisites of creativity  i e  freedom and constraints  within the swarm intelligence s two infamous phases of exploration and exploitation 
Michael Theodore and Nikolaus Correll use swarm intelligent art installation to explore what it takes to have engineered systems to appear lifelike
