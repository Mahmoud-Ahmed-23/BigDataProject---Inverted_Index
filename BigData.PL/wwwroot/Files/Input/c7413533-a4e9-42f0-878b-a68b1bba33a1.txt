Welcome to the Wikibook about Artificial Intelligence  

Book Contents edit   edit source 
The following is a first proposal for a basic layout  This is not yet complete  ideas are welcome  Discuss on the talk page or just add them here 
The book is laid out into   sections  with increasing detail and complexity  Each section contains a number of chapters  In addition to regular chapters  there are case study chapters that investigate full and complex AI systems using several techniques from the regular chapters  as well as perhaps some new ones

Basic AI topics edit   edit source 
Planning  Decision making and Problem Solving  Expanding on the search chapter to show how simple agents and simple intelligent behavior can be created  Examples are solving a puzzle  navigating a small maze  with pits and monsters  or planning a trip to the supermarket 
Uncertainty  Introduction to reasoning  planning and decision making with uncertainty 
Case Study   Building a  relatively  strong game AI  Building a strong AI for some game  to be chosen  that combines techniques from the planning and uncertainty chapters  This should go deeper than the simplified algorithms that most books describe and actually produce a strong playing AI 
Inference in Logic  Backward and Forward chaining  Resolution and Logic Programming 
Knowledge Engineering  Ways to describe and store complicated knowledge  Databases  OO concepts  knowledge bases  representing space and time  inference from large datasets  diagnosis system etc 
Natural Language  Stuff like Markov models  POS taggers and CFG s 
Machine Learning  ML   The basic idea of Machine Learning is to study pattern recognition  make predictions  improve predictions based on examples or data  Example of Machine Learning concepts such as supervised learning  unsupervised learning  semi supervised learning  reinforcement learning and deep learning 
Case Study   Deep Learning  Describes the use of deep architecture  i e  Deep Belief Networks  Convolutional Neural Networks  in handwritten character recognition 
Case Study   Artificial Life  Describes an environment with several evolving agents and some different techniques to construct agents  This should be able to draw on and compare pretty much all the chapters from section    including the natural language chapter  
Philosophical Issues for Artificial Intelligence  Discusses AI problems typically dealt with by philosophers  such as what is theoretically possible to achieve with AI  whether programs can be conscious  or feel pain  intentionality  and symbol grounding 
More advanced topics and techniques in AI edit   edit source 
Bayesian Decision Theory
 Neural Networks and related models
Natural Neural Networks and modeling of the Brain
Distributed Processing and other advanced Networks
Advanced Expert Systems  Expands on the basic expert systems explained in Knowledge Engineering in section    Includes more in depth explanation of Bayesian Networks than in the Machine Learning section 
Case Study   Data Mining  Describes mining a large dataset  perhaps some part of the wikipedia database  using machine learning algorithms  using software like Weka 
Case Study   Data Analysis  Describes manipulation of data using statistical computing tool such as R programming in K means clustering  decision tree  random forest  adaptive boosting and support vector machine   supported by R Foundation  an open source software foundation  
Advanced Natural Language  A description of the various techniques for dealing with tenses  sentence focus  presuppositions  etc  in NLP and NLG  This focuses mostly on the underlying structure of language and how to translate into some logical language  rather than statistical methods and models 
Natural Language Learning  Deals with more advanced statistical models for learning to understand language 
Case Study   Dialogue System  Building system that can communicate  intelligently  in written natural language  In a nutshell  trying to pass the Turing test  Three basic paradigms  case based reasoning  like ALICE   Logic based  translating everything to and from some extended version of predicate logic  and some machine learning based solution
