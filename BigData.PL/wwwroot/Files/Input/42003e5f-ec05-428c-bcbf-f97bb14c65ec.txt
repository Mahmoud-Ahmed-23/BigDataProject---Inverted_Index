application  code  libraries  and dependencies  You don t need to allocate any memory for the application  It can automatically generate space according to the requirements  Why learn Docker  A couple of years ago  when organizations needed to run applications  they often purchased servers without fully understanding the software s performance requirements  This led to wasted money and resources  Then  virtual machines entered the market  which enabled engineers to run multiple applications on the same hardware but as separate servers  However  each virtual machine required its own operating system  and each operating system needed its own CPU  RAM  and other resources to run  which significantly increased costs Then  the Docker model came into the picture  overcoming the drawbacks of virtual machines  It reduces resource wastage by sharing the OS  memory  and CPU  offering numerous benefits for developers and system administrators  such as consistency  portability  efficiency  security  scalability  and version control  These benefits make it easier to manage and deploy applications  Features of Docker Docker comes with powerful features that helps in application development and development  The following are key features of docker Docker reduces the size of development by providing a smaller part of the OS via containers  It is easier to work on the same project by different teams with the help of Containers  Docker containers can be deployed anywhere  on any physical  or virtual machines and on the cloud  Docker containers are lightweight so  it becomes easy to scale them  You can also do fast rebooting in docker container by quickly starting and restarting containers without rebooting the whole system Advantages of Docker Docker containers are widely used by developers for building testing and shipping applications faster across any platform  Apart from this there are so many other benefits provided by Docker  The following are the advantages of docker Your application will work same on any system whether you are using any laptop  server or any cloud AWS GCP Azure  In docker each application will run on it s own space  so it won t hamper another application work Docker containers start quickly  so your app runs in no tme You can test new features without changing your main application Docker uses less memory and power than virtual machinesYou ca easily add more containers if more people use your application Docker works well into development tools and automation setup Disadvantages of Docker As we already discuss about the advantages of docker it s time to discuss about some disadvantages of docker also  The following are some problems which you will face while using the docker  Complexity will increase due to layering   It is difficult to manage a large number of containers   For an application that needs better graphics  Docker is not suitable for it   Cross platform compatibility is not allowed  Conclusion Docker is a software development framework that allows you to package and run apps inside virtual machines on a server  It s often used to create and test applications before deploying them on a real  physical server  This allows organizations to test and deploy their applications quickly and with minimal resources  Docker also makes it easy to package and update apps on any server  regardless of its hardware configuration
