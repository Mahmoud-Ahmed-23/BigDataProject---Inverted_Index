							Egypt       s population is set to reach    million people as of Sunday evening  according to the Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and Statistics  CAPMAS  
In a press release  CAPMAS said Egypt       s population increased by   million people over the past six months  On   December  the population stood at    million people 
According to CAPMAS  the population growth rate is currently one of the most important and most dangerous challenges facing Egyptian society  The current growth rate of the population recorded      in      five times the rate in developed countries  double the rate in developing countries  eight times the growth rate in South Korea  and five times the rate in China 
CAPMAS stated that continued population growth at current rates would limit and heavily affect achieving significant progress in standards of living  despite the efforts of the state in various fields of economic development 
The agency stressed the need to balance between population growth rates and the economic potential of the state and its available resources 
Cairo Governorate is the largest province in terms of population size with      million residents         of the total population  Giza follows with      million and a rate of      of the population in Egypt  In third place is Sharqeya with     million residents who represent      of Egyptians in the country 
According to CAPMAS  the South Sinai governorate is the least populated  with only         residents          preceded by the New Valley Governorate with         and the Red Sea governorate with         residents
