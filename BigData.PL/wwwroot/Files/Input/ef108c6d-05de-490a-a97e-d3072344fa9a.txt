In information science  an ontology encompasses a representation  formal naming  and definitions of the categories  properties  and relations between the concepts  data  or entities that pertain to one  many  or all domains of discourse  More simply  an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related  by defining a set of terms and relational expressions that represent the entities in that subject area  The field which studies ontologies so conceived is sometimes referred to as applied ontology            
Every academic discipline or field  in creating its terminology  thereby lays the groundwork for an ontology  Each uses ontological assumptions to frame explicit theories  research and applications  Improved ontologies may improve problem solving within that domain  interoperability of data systems  and discoverability of data  Translating research papers within every field is a problem made easier when experts from different countries maintain a controlled vocabulary of jargon between each of their languages             For instance  the definition and ontology of economics is a primary concern in Marxist economics             but also in other subfields of economics             An example of economics relying on information science occurs in cases where a simulation or model is intended to enable economic decisions  such as determining what capital assets are at risk and by how much  see risk management  
What ontologies in both information science and philosophy have in common is the attempt to represent entities  including both objects and events  with all their interdependent properties and relations  according to a system of categories  In both fields  there is considerable work on problems of ontology engineering  e g   Quine and Kripke in philosophy  Sowa and Guarino in information science              and debates concerning to what extent normative ontology is possible  e g   foundationalism and coherentism in philosophy  BFO and Cyc in artificial intelligence  
Applied ontology is considered by some as a successor to prior work in philosophy  However many current efforts are more concerned with establishing controlled vocabularies of narrow domains than with philosophical first principles  or with questions such as the mode of existence of fixed essences or whether enduring objects  e g   perdurantism and endurantism  may be ontologically more primary than processes  Artificial intelligence has retained considerable attention regarding applied ontology in subfields like natural language processing within machine translation and knowledge representation  but ontology editors are being used often in a range of fields  including biomedical informatics             industry             Such efforts often use ontology editing tools such as Prot g             


Ontology in Philosophy edit 
Further information  Metaphysics        History
Ontology is a branch of philosophy and intersects areas such as metaphysics  epistemology  and philosophy of language  as it considers how knowledge  language  and perception relate to the nature of reality  Metaphysics deals with questions like  what exists   and  what is the nature of reality    One of five traditional branches of philosophy  metaphysics is concerned with exploring existence through properties  entities and relations such as those between particulars and universals  intrinsic and extrinsic properties  or essence and existence  Metaphysics has been an ongoing topic of discussion since recorded history 

Etymology edit 
Further information  Ontology        Etymology
The compound word ontology combines onto   from the Greek     on  gen         ontos   i e   being  that which is   which is the present participle of the verb       eim   i e   to be  I am   and          logia  i e   logical discourse   see classical compounds for this type of word formation                        
While the etymology is Greek  the oldest extant record of the word itself  the Neo Latin form ontologia  appeared in      in the work Ogdoas Scholastica by Jacob Lorhard  Lorhardus  and in      in the Lexicon philosophicum by Rudolf G ckel  Goclenius              
The first occurrence in English of ontology as recorded by the OED  Oxford English Dictionary  online edition        came in Archeologia Philosophica Nova or New Principles of Philosophy by Gideon Harvey 

Formal Ontology edit 
Main article  Formal Ontology
Further information  Artificial intelligence        History
Since the mid     s  researchers in the field of artificial intelligence  AI  have recognized that knowledge engineering is the key to building large and powerful AI systems     citation needed       AI researchers argued that they could create new ontologies as computational models that enable certain kinds of automated reasoning  which was only marginally successful  In the     s  the AI community began to use the term ontology to refer to both a theory of a modeled world and a component of knowledge based systems  In particular  David Powers introduced the word ontology to AI to refer to real world or robotic grounding                          publishing in      literature reviews emphasizing grounded ontology in association with the call for papers for a AAAI Summer Symposium Machine Learning of Natural Language and Ontology  with an expanded version published in SIGART Bulletin and included as a preface to the proceedings              Some researchers  drawing inspiration from philosophical ontologies  viewed computational ontology as a kind of applied philosophy             

In       the widely cited web page and paper  Toward Principles for the Design of Ontologies Used for Knowledge Sharing  by Tom Gruber             used ontology as a technical term in computer science closely related to earlier idea of semantic networks and taxonomies  Gruber introduced the term as a specification of a conceptualization  An ontology is a description  like a formal specification of a program  of the concepts and relationships that can formally exist for an agent or a community of agents  This definition is consistent with the usage of ontology as set of concept definitions  but more general  And it is a different sense of the word than its use in philosophy             
Attempting to distance ontologies from taxonomies and similar efforts in knowledge modeling that rely on classes and inheritance  Gruber stated         Ontologies are often equated with taxonomic hierarchies of classes  class definitions  and the subsumption relation  but ontologies need not be limited to these forms  Ontologies are also not limited to conservative definitions  that is  definitions in the traditional logic sense that only introduce terminology and do not add any knowledge about the world  Enderton         To specify a conceptualization  one needs to state axioms that do constrain the possible interpretations for the defined terms             
As refinement of Gruber s definition Feilmayr and W          stated   An ontology is a formal  explicit specification of a shared conceptualization that is characterized by high semantic expressiveness required for increased complexity              

Formal Ontology Components edit 
Main article  Ontology components
Contemporary ontologies share many structural similarities  regardless of the language in which they are expressed  Most ontologies describe individuals  instances   classes  concepts   attributes and relations 

Types edit 
Domain ontology edit 
A domain ontology  or domain specific ontology  represents concepts which belong to a realm of the world  such as biology or politics  Each domain ontology typically models domain specific definitions of terms  For example  the word card has many different meanings  An ontology about the domain of poker would model the  playing card  meaning of the word  while an ontology about the domain of computer hardware would model the  punched card  and  video card  meanings 
Since domain ontologies are written by different people  they represent concepts in very specific and unique ways  and are often incompatible within the same project  As systems that rely on domain ontologies expand  they often need to merge domain ontologies by hand tuning each entity or using a combination of software merging and hand tuning  This presents a challenge to the ontology designer  Different ontologies in the same domain arise due to different languages  different intended usage of the ontologies  and different perceptions of the domain  based on cultural background  education  ideology  etc       citation needed      
At present  merging ontologies that are not developed from a common upper ontology is a largely manual process and therefore time consuming and expensive  Domain ontologies that use the same upper ontology to provide a set of basic elements with which to specify the meanings of the domain ontology entities can be merged with less effort  There are studies on generalized techniques for merging ontologies              but this area of research is still ongoing  and it is a recent event to see the issue sidestepped by having multiple domain ontologies using the same upper ontology like the OBO Foundry 

Upper ontology edit 
Main article  Upper ontology
An upper ontology  or foundation ontology  is a model of the commonly shared relations and objects that are generally applicable across a wide range of domain ontologies  It usually employs a core glossary that overarches the terms and associated object descriptions as they are used in various relevant domain ontologies 
Standardized upper ontologies available for use include BFO  BORO method  Dublin Core  GFO  Cyc  SUMO  UMBEL  and DOLCE                          WordNet has been considered an upper ontology by some and has been used as a linguistic tool for learning domain ontologies             

Hybrid ontology edit 
The Gellish ontology is an example of a combination of an upper and a domain ontology

A survey of ontology visualization methods is presented by Katifori et al              An updated survey of ontology visualization methods and tools was published by Dud s et al              The most established ontology visualization methods  namely indented tree and graph visualization are evaluated by Fu et al              A visual language for ontologies represented in OWL is specified by the Visual Notation for OWL Ontologies  VOWL              

Engineering edit 
Main article  Ontology engineering
Ontology engineering  also called ontology building   is a set of tasks related to the development of ontologies for a particular domain              It is a subfield of knowledge engineering that studies the ontology development process  the ontology life cycle  the methods and methodologies for building ontologies  and the tools and languages that support them                         
Ontology engineering aims to make explicit the knowledge contained in software applications  and organizational procedures for a particular domain  Ontology engineering offers a direction for overcoming semantic obstacles  such as those related to the definitions of business terms and software classes  Known challenges with ontology engineering include 

Ensuring the ontology is current with domain knowledge and term use
Providing sufficient specificity and concept coverage for the domain of interest  thus minimizing the content completeness problem
Ensuring the ontology can support its use cases
Editors edit 
Ontology editors are applications designed to assist in the creation or manipulation of ontologies  It is common for ontology editors to use one or more ontology languages 
Aspects of ontology editors include  visual navigation possibilities within the knowledge model  inference engines and information extraction  support for modules  the import and export of foreign knowledge representation languages for ontology matching  and the support of meta ontologies such as OWL S  Dublin Core  etc             

Learning edit 
Main article  Ontology learning
Ontology learning is the automatic or semi automatic creation of ontologies  including extracting a domain s terms from natural language text  As building ontologies manually is extremely labor intensive and time consuming  there is great motivation to automate the process   Information extraction and text mining have been explored to automatically link ontologies to documents  for example in the context of the BioCreative challenges             

Research edit 
Further information  Epistemology
Epistemological assumptions  which in research asks  What do you know  or  How do you know it    creates the foundation researchers use when approaching a certain topic or area for potential research  As epistemology is directly linked to knowledge and how we come about accepting certain truths  individuals conducting academic research must understand what allows them to begin theory building  Simply  epistemological assumptions force researchers to question how they arrive at the knowledge they have      citation needed     

Languages edit

Libraries edit 
The development of ontologies has led to the emergence of services providing lists or directories of ontologies called ontology libraries 
The following are libraries of human selected ontologies 

COLORE             is an open repository of first order ontologies in Common Logic with formal links between ontologies in the repository 
DAML Ontology Library             maintains a legacy of ontologies in DAML 
Ontology Design Patterns portal             is a wiki repository of reusable components and practices for ontology design  and also maintains a list of exemplary ontologies 
Prot g  Ontology Library             contains a set of OWL  Frame based and other format ontologies 
SchemaWeb             is a directory of RDF schemata expressed in RDFS  OWL and DAML OIL 
The following are both directories and search engines 

OBO Foundry is a suite of interoperable reference ontologies in biology and biomedicine                         
Bioportal  ontology repository of NCBO            
Linked Open Vocabularies
OntoSelect             Ontology Library offers similar services for RDF S  DAML and OWL ontologies 
Ontaria             is a  searchable and browsable directory of semantic web data  with a focus on RDF vocabularies with OWL ontologies   NB Project  on hold  since       
Swoogle is a directory and search engine for all RDF resources available on the Web  including ontologies 
Open Ontology Repository initiative            
ROMULUS is a foundational ontology repository aimed at improving semantic interoperability  Currently there are three foundational ontologies in the repository  DOLCE  BFO and GFO             
Examples of applications edit 
In general  ontologies can be used beneficially in several fields 

Enterprise applications              A more concrete example is SAPPHIRE  Health care  or Situational Awareness and Preparedness for Public Health Incidences and Reasoning Engines which is a semantics based health information system capable of tracking and evaluating situations and occurrences that may affect public health 
Geographic information systems bring together data from different sources and benefit therefore from ontological metadata which helps to connect the semantics of the data             
Domain specific ontologies are extremely important in biomedical research  which requires named entity disambiguation of various biomedical terms and abbreviations that have the same string of characters but represent different biomedical concepts  For example  CSF can represent Colony Stimulating Factor or Cerebral Spinal Fluid  both of which are represented by the same term  CSF  in biomedical literature              This is why a large number of public ontologies are related to the life sciences  Life science data science tools that fail to implement these types of biomedical ontologies will not be able to accurately determine causal relationships between concepts
