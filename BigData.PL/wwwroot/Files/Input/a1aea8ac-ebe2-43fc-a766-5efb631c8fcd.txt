The festival aims to improve access and taste in films  and facilitate meetings between professionals  It also looks to promote the film industry in Egypt by building bridges between those working in the field of cinema that are of different cultures 
Yasser Moheb  the CFFF s Founder and President  said that the festival has cooperated with    countries to add value to the cinematic  cultural  and creative arena in Egypt  It has done so by opening new channels of discussion and cultural exchange between different experts and film schools from Egypt and Francophone countries 
He added that more than    films have been submitted since early September  indicating that a committee will decide the films to be presented at the festival  
The festival will hold two competitions  namely the International Competition for Long Feature Films produced by member countries of the International Organization of La Francophone  and the Competition for Long Feature Films in the French language  
The festival will also have many events and workshops  including the        Cairo Francophone Film Festival Evenings        which aim to show a selection of films to be projected outdoors at major Egyptian historical sites in Cairo
