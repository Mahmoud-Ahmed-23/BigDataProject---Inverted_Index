							Egypt s Foreign Ministry has stated it is following with deep concern current developments between India and Pakistan  which reportedly included an exchange of shelling and cross border strikes resulting in casualties  and has urged restraint from both sides 
In a statement  the ministry emphasised the importance of all efforts being made to achieve de escalation and to defuse the crisis  in order to prevent the region from sliding into further tension and escalation  Cairo also called on India and Pakistan to exercise the highest degree of restraint and to prioritise the language of dialogue through diplomatic channels  The statement further underscored the importance of resorting to peaceful solutions in a manner that achieves the aspirations and hopes of what it referred to as the        two friendly peoples        for calm and stability 
The call for de escalation followed reports of significant military actions  India launched early morning strikes on both Pakistan and Pakistan administered Kashmir on Wednesday  with Islamabad claiming its forces had shot down five Indian Air Force jets in  self defence   marking a significant escalation between the nuclear armed neighbours  These actions followed a massacre of tourists in Indian administered Kashmir more than two weeks prior  an attack New Delhi blamed on Islamabad  a charge Pakistan denied 
Pakistan Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif s office issued a statement on Wednesday detailing a National Security Committee  NSC  meeting convened under his chairmanship  The forum  offered Fateha for the souls of the innocent civilians martyred in India s strikes  extended its heartfelt condolences to the near ones of the martyrs and wished a speedy recovery to the injured   The NSC  deliberated upon the grave developments arising out of India s unprovoked  cowardly and unlawful act of war  
According to the NSC statement   On the night of     May       the Indian Armed Forces launched coordinated missile  air and drone strikes on multiple locations within Pakistan s sovereign territory  including Sialkot  Shakargarh  Muridke and Bahawalpur in Punjab  Kotli and Muzaffarabad in Azad Jammu and Kashmir   The statement alleged   These unprovoked and unjustified attacks deliberately targeted the civilian areas  on the false pretext of presence of imaginary terrorist camps  resulting in the martyrdom of innocent men  women  and children  and causing damage to the civilian infrastructure  including mosques  
It further claimed   India s act of aggression also caused grave danger to commercial airlines belonging to brotherly gulf countries  endangering the lives of thousands of on board passengers  Besides  the Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Project was also deliberately targeted in violation of international conventions  
The NSC  unequivocally condemned these illegal acts as blatant violations of Pakistan s sovereignty and territorial integrity  which manifestly constituted acts of war under international law   It added   The deliberate targeting of civilians  including innocent women and children  by the Indian military constitutes a heinous and shameful crime  that is in violation of all norms of human behaviour and the provisions of international law  
Pakistan stated it  has been emphatically rejecting Indian allegations claiming the presence of terrorist camps on its territory   The NSC statement recalled that  immediately after    April       Pakistan made a sincere offer for a credible  transparent and neutral investigation  which unfortunately was not accepted   It also mentioned that  international media personnel had already visited these  imaginary terrorist camps  on   May       and more visits were planned for   May       
The statement accused the Indian leadership of attacking  innocent civilians in order to satiate its delusional thoughts and short sighted political objectives   adding   India  against all sanity and rationality has once again ignited an inferno in the region  the responsibility for ensuing consequences shall lie squarely with India  
The NSC declared that  The Armed Forces of Pakistan  in line with the exercise of the right of self defense and response framework outlined in NSC statement dated    April       resolutely defended the territorial integrity of Pakistan  including Azad Jammu and Kashmir  against the Indian aggression  while also bringing down five Indian fighter aircraftsand Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in the process  
Furthermore  the committee stated   In consonance with Article    of the UN Charter  Pakistan reserves the right to respond  in self defence  at a time  place  and manner of its choosing to avenge the loss of innocent Pakistani lives and blatant violation of its sovereignty  The Armed Forces of Pakistan have duly been authorized to undertake corresponding actions in this regard   The statement noted the nation s appreciation for the armed forces and that  The nation stands galvanized and resolute in the face of any further aggression  
The NSC called upon the international community  to recognize the gravity of India s unprovoked illegal actions and to hold it accountable for its blatant violations of international norms and laws   It concluded that Pakistan  remains committed to peace  with dignity and honour  and reiterates that it shall never allow any violation of its sovereignty  territorial integrity or permit any harm to its proud people  
Earlier  Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif stated that Pakistan is giving a  befitting reply  to India s actions   The cunning enemy has carried out a cowardly attack on five places in Pakistan   Sharif said   Pakistan has every right to give a befitting reply to this act of war imposed by India and a befitting reply is being given   He added   The entire nation is with the Pakistani Armed Forces and the morale and spirit of the entire Pakistani nation is high  The Pakistani nation and the Pakistani Armed Forces know how to deal with the enemy very well  The enemy will never be allowed to succeed in his nefarious objectives  
India said its strikes were  precision strikes  on  terrorist infrastructure  at nine sites in Pakistan  describing the attacks as  focused  measured and non escalatory in nature   India s defence ministry did not specify the locations of the strikes in Pakistan but said it was  hitting terrorist infrastructure   The ministry added that  no Pakistani military facilities have been targeted   saying  India has demonstrated considerable restraint in selection of targets and method of execution  
Tensions between the two nuclear armed neighbours have been escalating since last month when New Delhi blamed Islamabad for an attack by militants in Indian administered Kashmir that killed    people  Pakistan has previously denied any involvement in that attack  Since the killings  the two countries have downgraded diplomatic relations  and India has suspended participation in a key water sharing treaty
