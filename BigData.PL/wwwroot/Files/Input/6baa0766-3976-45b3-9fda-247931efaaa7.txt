Ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others


Not to be confused with Philosophy of mind 

In psychology and philosophy  theory of mind  often abbreviated to ToM  refers to the capacity to understand other individuals by ascribing mental states to them  A theory of mind includes the understanding that others  beliefs  desires  intentions  emotions  and thoughts may be different from one s own             Possessing a functional theory of mind is crucial for success in everyday human social interactions  People utilize a theory of mind when analyzing  judging  and inferring other people s behaviors  
Theory of mind was first conceptualized by researchers evaluating the presence of theory of mind in animals                        Today  theory of mind research also investigates factors affecting theory of mind in humans  such as whether drug and alcohol consumption  language development  cognitive delays  age  and culture can affect a person s capacity to display theory of mind 
It has been proposed that deficits in theory of mind may occur in people with autism             anorexia nervosa             schizophrenia  dysphoria  addiction             and brain damage caused by alcohol s neurotoxicity                        Neuroimaging shows that the medial prefrontal cortex  mPFC   the posterior superior temporal sulcus  pSTS   the precuneus  and the amygdala are associated with theory of mind tasks  Patients with frontal lobe or temporoparietal junction lesions find some theory of mind tasks difficult  One s theory of mind develops in childhood as the prefrontal cortex develops             


Definition edit 
The  theory of mind  is described as a theory because the behavior of the other person  such as their statements and expressions  is the only thing being directly observed  no one has direct access to the mind of another  and the existence and nature of the mind must be inferred              It is typically assumed others have minds analogous to one s own  this assumption is based on three reciprocal social interactions  as observed in joint attention              the functional use of language              and the understanding of others  emotions and actions              Theory of mind allows one to attribute thoughts  desires  and intentions to others  to predict or explain their actions  and to posit their intentions  It enables one to understand that mental states can be the cause of and can be used to explain and predict the behavior of others              Being able to attribute mental states to others and understanding them as causes of behavior implies  in part  one must be able to conceive of the mind as a  generator of representations               If a person does not have a mature theory of mind  it may be a sign of cognitive or developmental impairment             
Theory of mind appears to be an innate potential ability in humans that requires social and other experience over many years for its full development  Different people may develop more or less effective theories of mind  Neo Piagetian theories of cognitive development maintain that theory of mind is a byproduct of a broader hypercognitive ability of the human mind to register  monitor  and represent its own functioning             
Empathy the recognition and understanding of the states of mind of others  including their beliefs  desires  and particularly emotions is a related concept  Empathy is often characterized as the ability to  put oneself into another s shoes   Recent neuro ethological studies of animal behavior suggest that rodents may exhibit empathetic abilities              While empathy is known as emotional perspective taking  theory of mind is defined as cognitive perspective taking             
Research on theory of mind  in humans and animals  adults and children  normally and atypically developing  has grown rapidly in the years since Premack and Guy Woodruff s      paper   Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind                The field of social neuroscience has also begun to address this debate by imaging the brains of humans while they perform tasks that require the understanding of an intention  belief  or other mental state in others 
An alternative account of theory of mind is given in operant psychology and provides empirical evidence for a functional account of both perspective taking and empathy  The most developed operant approach is founded on research on derived relational responding     jargon      and is subsumed within relational frame theory  Derived relational responding relies on the ability to identify derived relations  or relationships between stimuli that are not directly learned or reinforced  for example  if  snake  is related to  danger  and  danger  is related to  fear   people may know to fear snakes even without learning an explicit connection between snakes and fear              According to this view  empathy and perspective taking comprise a complex set of derived relational abilities based on learning to discriminate and respond verbally to ever more complex relations between self  others  place  and time  and through established relations

Discussions of theory of mind have their roots in philosophical debate from the time of Ren  Descartes  Second Meditation  which set the foundations for considering the science of the mind 
Two differing approaches in philosophy for explaining theory of mind are theory theory and simulation theory              Theory theory claims that individuals use  theories  grounded in folk psychology to reason about others  minds  According to theory theory  these folk psychology theories are developed automatically and innately by concepts and rules we have for ourselves  and then instantiated through social interactions              In contrast  simulation theory argues that individuals simulate the internal states of others to build mental models for their cognitive processes  A basic example of this is someone imagining themselves in the position of another person to infer the other person s thoughts and feelings              Theory of mind is also closely related to person perception and attribution theory from social psychology  
It is common and intuitive to assume that others have minds  People anthropomorphize non human animals  inanimate objects  and even natural phenomena  Daniel Dennett referred to this tendency as taking an  intentional stance  toward things  we assume they have intentions  to help predict their future behavior              However  there is an important distinction between taking an  intentional stance  toward something and entering a  shared world  with it  The intentional stance is a functional relationship  describing the use of a theory due to its practical utility  rather than the accuracy of its representation of the world  As such  it is something people resort to during interpersonal interactions  A shared world is directly perceived and its existence structures reality itself for the perceiver  It is not just a lens  through which the perceiver views the world  it in many ways constitutes the cognition  as both its object and the blueprint used to structure perception into understanding 
The philosophical roots of another perspective  the relational frame theory  RFT  account of theory of mind  arise from contextual psychology  which refers to the study of organisms  both human and non human  interacting in and with a historical and current situational context  It is an approach based on contextualism  a philosophy in which any event is interpreted as an ongoing act inseparable from its current and historical context and in which a radically functional approach to truth and meaning is adopted  As a variant of contextualism  RFT focuses on the construction of practical  scientific knowledge  This scientific form of contextual psychology is virtually synonymous with the philosophy of operant psychology             

Development edit 
The study of which animals are capable of attributing knowledge and mental states to others  as well as the development of this ability in human ontogeny and phylogeny  identifies several behavioral precursors to theory of mind  Understanding attention  understanding of others  intentions  and imitative experience with others are hallmarks of a theory of mind that may be observed early in the development of what later becomes a full fledged theory 
Simon Baron Cohen proposed that infants  understanding of attention in others acts as a critical precursor to the development of theory of mind              Understanding attention involves understanding that seeing can be directed selectively as attention  that the looker assesses the seen object as  of interest   and that seeing can induce beliefs  A possible illustration of theory of mind in infants is joint attention  Joint attention refers to when two people look at and attend to the same thing  Parents often use the act of pointing to prompt infants to engage in joint attention  understanding this prompt requires that infants take into account another person s mental state and understand that the person notices an object or finds it of interest  Baron Cohen speculates that the inclination to spontaneously reference an object in the world as of interest  via pointing    Proto declarative pointing   and to likewise appreciate the directed attention of another  may be the underlying motive behind all human communication             
Understanding others  intentions is another critical precursor to understanding other minds because intentionality is a fundamental feature of mental states and events  The  intentional stance  was defined by Daniel Dennett             as an understanding that others  actions are goal directed and arise from particular beliefs or desires  Both two and three year old children could discriminate when an experimenter intentionally or accidentally marked a box with stickers              Even earlier in development  Andrew N  Meltzoff found that    month old infants could perform target tasks involving the manipulation of objects that adult experimenters attempted and failed  suggesting the infants could represent the object manipulating behavior of adults as involving goals and intentions              While attribution of intention and knowledge is investigated in young humans and nonhuman animals to detect precursors to a theory of mind  Gagliardi et al  have pointed out that even adult humans do not always act in a way consistent with an attributional perspective  i e   based on attribution of knowledge to others               In their experiment  adult human subjects attempted to choose the container baited with a small object from a selection of four containers when guided by confederates who could not see which container was baited 
Research in developmental psychology suggests that an infant s ability to imitate others lies at the origins of both theory of mind and other social cognitive achievements like perspective taking and empathy              According to Meltzoff  the infant s innate understanding that others are  like me  allows them to recognize the equivalence between the physical and mental states apparent in others and those felt by the self  For example  the infant uses their own experiences  orienting their head and eyes toward an object of interest to understand the movements of others who turn toward an object  that is  they will generally attend to objects of interest or significance  Some researchers in comparative disciplines have hesitated to put too much weight on imitation as a critical precursor to advanced human social cognitive skills like mentalizing and empathizing  especially if true imitation is no longer employed by adults  A test of imitation by Alexandra Horowitz found that adult subjects imitated an experimenter demonstrating a novel task far less closely than children did  Horowitz points out that the precise psychological state underlying imitation is unclear and cannot  by itself  be used to draw conclusions about the mental states of humans             
While much research has been done on infants  theory of mind develops continuously throughout childhood and into late adolescence as the synapses in the prefrontal cortex develop  The prefrontal cortex is thought to be involved in planning and decision making              Children seem to develop theory of mind skills sequentially  The first skill to develop is the ability to recognize that others have diverse desires  Children are able to recognize that others have diverse beliefs soon after  The next skill to develop is recognizing that others have access to different knowledge bases  Finally  children are able to understand that others may have false beliefs and that others are capable of hiding emotions  While this sequence represents the general trend in skill acquisition  it seems that more emphasis is placed on some skills in certain cultures  leading to more valued skills to develop before those that are considered not as important  For example  in individualistic cultures such as the United States  a greater emphasis is placed on the ability to recognize that others have different opinions and beliefs  In a collectivistic culture  such as China  this skill may not be as important and therefore may not develop until later             

Language edit 
There is evidence that the development of theory of mind is closely intertwined with language development in humans  One meta analysis showed a moderate to strong correlation  r         between performance on theory of mind and language tasks              Both language and theory of mind begin to develop around the same time in children  between ages two and five   but many other abilities develop during this same time period as well  and they do not produce such high correlations with one another nor with theory of mind 
Pragmatic theories of communication assume that infants must possess an understanding of beliefs and mental states of others to infer the communicative content that proficient language users intend to convey              Since spoken phrases can have different meanings depending on context  theory of mind can play a crucial role in understanding the intentions of others and inferring the meaning of words  Some empirical results suggest that even    month old infants have an early capacity for communicative mind reading that enables them to infer what relevant information is transferred between communicative partners  which implies that human language relies at least partially on theory of mind skills             
Carol A  Miller posed further possible explanations for this relationship  Perhaps the extent of verbal communication and conversation involving children in a family could explain theory of mind development  Such language exposure could help introduce a child to the different mental states and perspectives of others              Empirical findings indicate that participation in family discussion predicts scores on theory of mind tasks              and that deaf children who have hearing parents and may not be able to communicate with their parents much during early years of development tend to score lower on theory of mind tasks             
Another explanation of the relationship between language and theory of mind development has to do with a child s understanding of mental state words such as  think  and  believe   Since a mental state is not something that one can observe from behavior  children must learn the meanings of words denoting mental states from verbal explanations alone  requiring knowledge of the syntactic rules  semantic systems  and pragmatics of a language              Studies have shown that understanding of these mental state words predicts theory of mind in four year olds             
A third hypothesis is that the ability to distinguish a whole sentence   Jimmy thinks the world is flat   from its embedded complement   the world is flat   and understand that one can be true while the other can be false is related to theory of mind development  Recognizing these complements as being independent of one another is a relatively complex syntactic skill and correlates with increased scores on theory of mind tasks in children             
There is also evidence that the areas of the brain responsible for language and theory of mind are closely connected  The temporoparietal junction  TPJ  is involved in the ability to acquire new vocabulary  as well as to perceive and reproduce words  The TPJ also contains areas that specialize in recognizing faces  voices  and biological motion  and in theory of mind  Since all of these areas are located so closely together  it is reasonable to suspect that they work together  Studies have reported an increase in activity in the TPJ when patients are absorbing information through reading or images regarding other peoples  beliefs but not while observing information about physical control stimuli             

Theory of mind in adults edit 
Adults have theory of mind concepts that they developed as children  concepts such as belief  desire  knowledge  and intention   They use these concepts to meet the diverse demands of social life  ranging from snap decisions about how to trick an opponent in a competitive game  to keeping up with who knows what in a fast moving conversation  to judging the guilt or innocence of the accused in a court of law             
Boaz Keysar  Dale Barr  and colleagues found that adults often failed to use their theory of mind abilities to interpret a speaker s message  and acted as if unaware that the speaker lacked critical knowledge about a task  In one study  a confederate instructed adult participants to rearrange objects  some of which were not visible to the confederate  as part of a communication game  Only objects that were visible to both the confederate and the participant were part of the game  Despite knowing that the confederate could not see some of the objects  a third of the participants still tried to move those objects              Other studies show that adults are prone to egocentric biases  with which they are influenced by their own beliefs  knowledge  or preferences when judging those of other people  or that they neglect other people s perspectives entirely              There is also evidence that adults with greater memory  inhibitory capacity  and motivation are more likely to use their theory of mind abilities             
In contrast  evidence about indirect effects of thinking about other people s mental states suggests that adults may sometimes use their theory of mind automatically  Agnes Kovacs and colleagues measured the time it took adults to detect the presence of a ball as it was revealed from behind an occluder  They found that adults  speed of response was influenced by whether another person  the  agent   in the scene thought there was a ball behind the occluder  even though adults were not asked to pay attention to what the agent thought             
Dana Samson and colleagues measured the time it took adults to judge the number of dots on the wall of a room  They found that adults responded more slowly when another person standing in the room happened to see fewer dots than they did  even when they had never been asked to pay attention to what the person could see              It has been questioned whether these  altercentric biases  truly reflect automatic processing of what another person is thinking or seeing or  instead  reflect attention and memory effects cued by the other person  but not involving any representation of what they think or see             
Different theories seek to explain such results  If theory of mind is automatic  this would help explain how people keep up with the theory of mind demands of competitive games and fast moving conversations  It might also explain evidence that human infants and some non human species sometimes appear capable of theory of mind  despite their limited resources for memory and cognitive control              If theory of mind is effortful and not automatic  on the other hand  this explains why it feels effortful to decide whether a defendant is guilty or whether a negotiator is bluffing  Economy of effort would help explain why people sometimes neglect to use their theory of mind 
Ian Apperly and Stephen Butterfill suggested that people have  two systems  for theory of mind              in common with  two systems  accounts in many other areas of psychology              In this account   system    is cognitively efficient and enables theory of mind for a limited but useful set of circumstances   System    is cognitively effortful  but enables much more flexible theory of mind abilities  Philosopher Peter Carruthers disagrees  arguing that the same core theory of mind abilities can be used in both simple and complex ways              The account has been criticized by Celia Heyes who suggests that  system    theory of mind abilities do not require representation of mental states of other people  and so are better thought of as  sub mentalizing              

Aging edit 
In older age  theory of mind capacities decline  irrespective of how exactly they are tested              However  the decline in other cognitive functions is even stronger  suggesting that social cognition is better preserved  In contrast to theory of mind  empathy shows no impairments in aging                         
There are two kinds of theory of mind representations  cognitive  concerning mental states  beliefs  thoughts  and intentions  and affective  concerning the emotions of others   Cognitive theory of mind is further separated into first order  e g   I think she thinks that  and second order  e g  he thinks that she thinks that   There is evidence that cognitive and affective theory of mind processes are functionally independent from one another              In studies of Alzheimer s disease  which typically occurs in older adults  patients display impairment with second order cognitive theory of mind  but usually not with first order cognitive or affective theory of mind  However  it is difficult to discern a clear pattern of theory of mind variation due to age  There have been many discrepancies in the data collected thus far  likely due to small sample sizes and the use of different tasks that only explore one aspect of theory of mind  Many researchers suggest that theory of mind impairment is simply due to the normal decline in cognitive function             

Cultural variations edit 
Researchers propose that five key aspects of theory of mind develop sequentially for all children between the ages of three and five              diverse desires  diverse beliefs  knowledge access  false beliefs  and hidden emotions              Australian  American  and European children acquire theory of mind in this exact order              and studies with children in Canada  India  Peru  Samoa  and Thailand indicate that they all pass the false belief task at around the same time  suggesting that children develop theory of mind consistently around the world             
However  children from Iran and China develop theory of mind in a slightly different order  Although they begin the development of theory of mind around the same time  toddlers from these countries understand knowledge access before Western children but take longer to understand diverse beliefs                          Researchers believe this swap in the developmental order is related to the culture of collectivism in Iran and China  which emphasizes interdependence and shared knowledge as opposed to the culture of individualism in Western countries  which promotes individuality and accepts differing opinions  Because of these different cultural values  Iranian and Chinese children might take longer to understand that other people have different beliefs and opinions  This suggests that the development of theory of mind is not universal and solely determined by innate brain processes but also influenced by social and cultural factors

Theory of mind can help historians to more properly understand historical figures  characters  for example Thomas Jefferson  Emancipationists like Douglas L  Wilson and scholars at the Thomas Jefferson Foundation view Jefferson as an opponent of slavery all his life  noting Jefferson s attempts within the limited range of options available to him to undermine slavery  his many attempts at abolition legislation  the manner in which he provided for slaves  and his advocacy of their more humane treatment  This view contrasts with that of revisionists like Paul Finkelman  who criticizes Jefferson for racism  slavery  and hypocrisy  Emancipationist views on this hypocrisy recognize that if he tried to be true to his word  it would have alienated his fellow Virginians  In another example  Franklin D  Roosevelt did not join NAACP leaders in pushing for federal anti lynching legislation  as he believed that such legislation was unlikely to pass and that his support for it would alienate Southern congressmen  including many of Roosevelt s fellow Democrats 

Empirical investigation edit 
Whether children younger than three or four years old have a theory of mind is a topic of debate among researchers  It is a challenging question  due to the difficulty of assessing what pre linguistic children understand about others and the world  Tasks used in research into the development of theory of mind must take into account the umwelt             of the pre verbal child 

False belief task edit 
One of the most important milestones in theory of mind development is the ability to attribute false belief  in other words  to understand that other people can believe things which are not true  To do this  it is suggested  one must understand how knowledge is formed  that people s beliefs are based on their knowledge  that mental states can differ from reality  and that people s behavior can be predicted by their mental states  Numerous versions of false belief task have been developed  based on the initial task created by Wimmer and Perner                    
In the most common version of the false belief task  often called the Sally Anne test   children are told a story about Sally and Anne  Sally has a marble  which she places into her basket  and then leaves the room  While she is out of the room  Anne takes the marble from the basket and puts it into the box  The child being tested is then asked where Sally will look for the marble once she returns  The child passes the task if she answers that Sally will look in the basket  where Sally put the marble  the child fails the task if she answers that Sally will look in the box  To pass the task  the child must be able to understand that another s mental representation of the situation is different from their own  and the child must be able to predict behavior based on that understanding              Another example depicts a boy who leaves chocolate on a shelf and then leaves the room  His mother puts it in the fridge  To pass the task  the child must understand that the boy  upon returning  holds the false belief that his chocolate is still on the shelf             
The results of research using false belief tasks have been called into question  most typically developing children are able to pass the tasks from around age four              Yet early studies asserted that     of children diagnosed with autism were unable to pass this test  while children with other disabilities like Down syndrome were able to              However this assertion could not be replicated by later studies                                                  It instead was concluded that children fail these tests due to a lack of understanding of extraneous processes and a basic lack of mental processing capabilities             
Adults may also struggle with false beliefs  for instance when they show hindsight bias              In one experiment  adult subjects who were asked for an independent assessment were unable to disregard information on actual outcome  Also in experiments with complicated situations  when assessing others  thinking  adults can fail to correctly disregard certain information that they have been given             

Unexpected contents edit 
Other tasks have been developed to try to extend the false belief task  In the  unexpected contents  or  smarties  task  experimenters ask children what they believe to be the contents of a box that looks as though it holds Smarties  After the child guesses  Smarties   it is shown that the box in fact contained pencils  The experimenter then re closes the box and asks the child what she thinks another person  who has not been shown the true contents of the box  will think is inside  The child passes the task if he she responds that another person will think that  Smarties  exist in the box  but fails the task if she responds that another person will think that the box contains pencils  Gopnik  amp  Astington found that children pass this test at age four or five years              Though the use of such implicit tests has yet to reach a consensus on their validity and reproducibility of study results             

Other tasks edit 
The  false photograph  task             also measures theory of mind development  In this task  children must reason about what is represented in a photograph that differs from the current state of affairs  Within the false photograph task  either a location or identity change exists              In the location change task  the examiner puts an object in one location  e g  chocolate in an open green cupboard   whereupon the child takes a Polaroid photograph of the scene  While the photograph is developing  the examiner moves the object to a different location  e g  a blue cupboard   allowing the child to view the examiner s action  The examiner asks the child two control questions   When we first took the picture  where was the object   and  Where is the object now   The subject is also asked a  false photograph  question   Where is the object in the picture   The child passes the task if he she correctly identifies the location of the object in the picture and the actual location of the object at the time of the question  However  the last question might be misinterpreted as  Where in this room is the object that the picture depicts   and therefore some examiners use an alternative phrasing             
To make it easier for animals  young children  and individuals with classical autism to understand and perform theory of mind tasks  researchers have developed tests in which verbal communication is de emphasized  some whose administration does not involve verbal communication on the part of the examiner  some whose successful completion does not require verbal communication on the part of the subject  and some that meet both of those standards  One category of tasks uses a preferential looking paradigm  with looking time as the dependent variable  For instance  nine month old infants prefer looking at behaviors performed by a human hand over those made by an inanimate hand like object              Other paradigms look at rates of imitative behavior  the ability to replicate and complete unfinished goal directed acts              and rates of pretend play             

Early precursors edit 
Research on the early precursors of theory of mind has invented ways to observe preverbal infants  understanding of other people s mental states  including perception and beliefs  Using a variety of experimental procedures  studies show that infants from their first year of life have an implicit understanding of what other people see             and what they know                          A popular paradigm used to study infants  theory of mind is the violation of expectation procedure  which exploits infants  tendency to look longer at unexpected and surprising events compared to familiar and expected events  The amount of time they look at an event gives researchers an indication of what infants might be inferring  or their implicit understanding of events  One study using this paradigm found that    month olds tend to attribute beliefs to a person whose visual perception was previously witnessed as being  reliable   compared to someone whose visual perception was  unreliable   Specifically     month olds were trained to expect a person s excited vocalization and gaze into a container to be associated with finding a toy in the reliable looker condition or an absence of a toy in the unreliable looker condition  Following this training phase  infants witnessed  in an object search task  the same persons searching for a toy either in the correct or incorrect location after they both witnessed the location of where the toy was hidden  Infants who experienced the reliable looker were surprised and therefore looked longer when the person searched for the toy in the incorrect location compared to the correct location  In contrast  the looking time for infants who experienced the unreliable looker did not differ for either search locations  These findings suggest that    month old infants can differentially attribute beliefs about a toy s location based on the person s prior record of visual perception             

Methodological problems edit 
With the methods used to test theory of mind  it has been experimentally shown that very simple robots that only react by reflexes and are not built to have any complex cognition at all can pass the tests for having theory of mind abilities that psychology textbooks assume to be exclusive to humans older than four or five years  Whether such a robot passes the test is influenced by completely non cognitive factors such as placement of objects and the structure of the robot body influencing how the reflexes are conducted  It has therefore been suggested that theory of mind tests may not actually test cognitive abilities             
Furthermore  early research into theory of mind in autistic children             is argued to constitute epistemological violence due to implicit or explicit negative and universal conclusions about autistic individuals being drawn from empirical data that viably supports other  non universal  conclusions             

Deficits edit 
Theory of mind impairment  or mind blindness  describes a difficulty someone would have with perspective taking  Individuals with theory of mind impairment struggle to see phenomena from any other perspective than their own              Individuals who experience a theory of mind deficit have difficulty determining the intentions of others  lack understanding of how their behavior affects others  and have a difficult time with social reciprocity              Theory of mind deficits have been observed in people with autism spectrum disorders  schizophrenia  nonverbal learning disorder and along with people under the influence of alcohol and narcotics  sleep deprived people  and people who are experiencing severe emotional or physical pain  Theory of mind deficits have also been observed in deaf children who are late signers  i e  are born to hearing parents   but such a deficit is due to the delay in language learning  not any cognitive deficit  and therefore disappears once the child learns sign language             

Autism edit 
In      Simon Baron Cohen  Alan M  Leslie  and Uta Frith suggested that children with autism do not employ theory of mind and that autistic children have particular difficulties with tasks requiring the child to understand another person s beliefs              These difficulties persist when children are matched for verbal skills and they have been taken as a key feature of autism              Although in a      review  Gernsbacher and Yergeau argued that  the claim that autistic people lack a theory of mind is empirically questionable   as there have been numerous failed replications of classic ToM studies and the meta analytical effect sizes of such replications were minimal to small             
Many individuals classified as autistic have severe difficulty assigning mental states to others  and some seem to lack theory of mind capabilities              Researchers who study the relationship between autism and theory of mind attempt to explain the connection in a variety of ways  One account assumes that theory of mind plays a role in the attribution of mental states to others and in childhood pretend play              According to Leslie              theory of mind is the capacity to mentally represent thoughts  beliefs  and desires  regardless of whether the circumstances involved are real  This might explain why some autistic individuals show extreme deficits in both theory of mind and pretend play  However  Hobson proposes a social affective justification              in which deficits in theory of mind in autistic people result from a distortion in understanding and responding to emotions  He suggests that typically developing individuals  unlike autistic individuals  are born with a set of skills  such as social referencing ability  that later lets them comprehend and react to other people s feelings  Other scholars emphasize that autism involves a specific developmental delay  so that autistic children vary in their deficiencies  because they experience difficulty in different stages of growth  Very early setbacks can alter proper advancement of joint attention behaviors  which may lead to a failure to form a full theory of mind             
It has been speculated that theory of mind exists on a continuum as opposed to the traditional view of a discrete presence or absence              While some research has suggested that some autistic populations are unable to attribute mental states to others              recent evidence points to the possibility of coping mechanisms that facilitate the attribution of mental states              A binary view regarding theory of mind contributes to the stigmatization of autistic adults who do possess perspective taking capacity  as the assumption that autistic people do not have empathy can become a rationale for dehumanization             
Tine et al  report that autistic children score substantially lower on measures of social theory of mind  i e    reasoning about others      mental states   p          in comparison to children diagnosed with Asperger syndrome             
Generally  children with more advanced theory of mind abilities display more advanced social skills  greater adaptability to new situations  and greater cooperation with others  As a result  these children are typically well liked  However   children may use their mind reading abilities to manipulate  outwit  tease  or trick their peers               Individuals possessing inferior theory of mind skills  such as children with autism spectrum disorder  may be socially rejected by their peers since they are unable to communicate effectively  Social rejection has been proven to negatively impact a child s development and can put the child at greater risk of developing depressive symptoms              
Peer mediated interventions  PMI  are a school based treatment approach for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder in which peers are trained to be role models in order to promote social behavior  Laghi et al  studied whether analysis of prosocial  nice  and antisocial  nasty  theory of mind behaviors could be used  in addition to teacher recommendations  to select appropriate candidates for PMI programs  Selecting children with advanced theory of mind skills who use them in prosocial ways will theoretically make the program more effective  While the results indicated that analyzing the social uses of theory of mind of possible candidates for a PMI program may increase the program s efficacy  it may not be a good predictor of a candidate s performance as a role model             
A      Cochrane review on interventions based on theory of mind found that such a theory could be taught to individuals with autism but claimed little evidence of skill maintenance  generalization to other settings  or development effects on related skills              
Some   st century studies have shown that the results of some studies of theory of mind tests on autistic people may be misinterpreted based on the double empathy problem  which proposes that rather than autistic people specifically having trouble with theory of mind  autistic people and non autistic people have equal difficulty understanding one another due to their neurological differences               Studies have shown that autistic adults perform better in theory of mind tests when paired with other autistic adults              as well as possibly autistic close family members               Academics who acknowledge the double empathy problem also propose that it is likely autistic people understand non autistic people to a higher degree than vice versa  due to the necessity of functioning in a non autistic society              

Psychopathy edit 
Psychopathy is another deficit that is of large importance when discussing theory of mind  While psychopathic individuals show impaired emotional behavior including a lack of emotional responsiveness to others and deficient empathy  as well as impaired social behavior  there are many controversies regarding psychopathic individuals  theory of mind               Many different studies provide contradictory information on a correlation between theory of mind impairment and psychopathic individuals 
There have been some speculations made about the similarities between individuals with autism and psychopathic individuals in the theory of mind performance  In this study in       the Happ  s advanced test of theory of mind was presented to a group of    psychopaths  and    non psychopaths incarcerated  This test showed that there was not a difference in the performance of the task for the psychopaths and non psychopaths  However  they were able to see that the psychopaths were performing significantly better than the most highly able adult autistic population               This shows that there is not a similarity between individuals with autism and psychopathic individuals 
There have been repetitive suggestions regarding the possibility that a deficient or biased grasp of others  mental states  or theory of mind  could potentially contribute to antisocial behavior  aggression  and psychopathy               In one study named  Reading the Mind in the Eyes   the participants view photographs of an individual s eye and had to attribute a mental state  or emotion  to the individual  This is an interesting test because Magnetic resonance imaging studies showed that this task produced increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal and the left medial frontal cortices  the superior temporal gyrus  and the left amygdala  There is extensive literature suggesting amygdala dysfunction in psychopathy however  this test shows that both groups of psychopathic and non psychopathic adults performed equally well on the test               Thus  disregarding that there isn t Theory of Mind impairment in psychopathic individuals 
In another study using a systemic review and meta analysis  data was gathered from    different studies and found that psychopathic traits are associated with impairment in the theory of mind task performance  This relationship was not regulated by age  population  psychopathy measurement  self report versus clinical checklist  or theory of mind task type  cognitive versus affective                This study used past studies to show that there is a relationship between psychopathic individuals and theory of mind impairments 
In      a study was conducted to test whether impairment in the emotional aspects of theory of mind rather that the general theory of mind abilities may account for some of the impaired social behavior in psychopathy               This study involved criminal offenders diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder who had high psychopathy features  participants with localized lesions in the orbitofrontal cortex  participants with non frontal lesions  and healthy control subjects  Subjects were tested with a task that examines affective versus cognitive theory of mind  They found that the individuals with psychopathy and those with orbitofrontal cortex lesions were both impaired on the affective theory of mind but not in cognitive theory of mind when compared to the control group              

Schizophrenia edit 
Individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia can show deficits in theory of mind  Mirjam Sprong and colleagues investigated the impairment by examining    different studies  with a total of over      participants               This meta analysis showed significant and stable deficit of theory of mind in people with schizophrenia  They performed poorly on false belief tasks  which test the ability to understand that others can hold false beliefs about events in the world  and also on intention inference tasks  which assess the ability to infer a character s intention from reading a short story  Schizophrenia patients with negative symptoms  such as lack of emotion  motivation  or speech  have the most impairment in theory of mind and are unable to represent the mental states of themselves and of others  Paranoid schizophrenic patients also perform poorly because they have difficulty accurately interpreting others  intentions  The meta analysis additionally showed that IQ  gender  and age of the participants do not significantly affect the performance of theory of mind tasks              
Research suggests that impairment in theory of mind negatively affects clinical insight the patient s awareness of their mental illness               Insight requires theory of mind  a patient must be able to adopt a third person perspective and see the self as others do               A patient with good insight can accurately self represent  by comparing himself with others and by viewing himself from the perspective of others               Insight allows a patient to recognize and react appropriately to his symptoms  A patient who lacks insight does not realize that he has a mental illness  because of his inability to accurately self represent  Therapies that teach patients perspective taking and self reflection skills can improve abilities in reading social cues and taking the perspective of another person              
Research indicates that theory of mind deficit is a stable trait characteristic rather than a state characteristic of schizophrenia               The meta analysis conducted by Sprong et al  showed that patients in remission still had impairment in theory of mind  This indicates that the deficit is not merely a consequence of the active phase of schizophrenia              
Schizophrenic patients  deficit in theory of mind impairs their interactions with others  Theory of mind is particularly important for parents  who must understand the thoughts and behaviors of their children and react accordingly  Dysfunctional parenting is associated with deficits in the first order theory of mind  the ability to understand another person s thoughts  and in the second order theory of mind  the ability to infer what one person thinks about another person s thoughts               Compared with healthy mothers  mothers with schizophrenia are found to be more remote  quiet  self absorbed  insensitive  unresponsive  and to have fewer satisfying interactions with their children               They also tend to misinterpret their children s emotional cues  and often misunderstand neutral faces as negative               Activities such as role playing and individual or group based sessions are effective interventions that help the parents improve on perspective taking and theory of mind               There is a strong association between theory of mind deficit and parental role dysfunction 

Alcohol use disorders edit 
Impairments in theory of mind  as well as other social cognitive deficits  are commonly found in people who have alcohol use disorders  due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain  particularly the prefrontal cortex            

Depression and dysphoria edit 
Individuals in a major depressive episode  a disorder characterized by social impairment  show deficits in theory of mind decoding               Theory of mind decoding is the ability to use information available in the immediate environment  e g   facial expression  tone of voice  body posture  to accurately label the mental states of others  The opposite pattern  enhanced theory of mind  is observed in individuals vulnerable to depression  including those individuals with past major depressive disorder  MDD                dysphoric individuals               and individuals with a maternal history of MDD              

Developmental language disorder edit 
Children diagnosed with developmental language disorder  DLD  exhibit much lower scores on reading and writing sections of standardized tests  yet have a normal nonverbal IQ  These language deficits can be any specific deficits in lexical semantics  syntax  or pragmatics  or a combination of multiple problems  Such children often exhibit poorer social skills than normally developing children  and seem to have problems decoding beliefs in others  A recent meta analysis confirmed that children with DLD have substantially lower scores on theory of mind tasks compared to typically developing children               This strengthens the claim that language development is related to theory of mind 

Brain mechanisms edit 
In non autistic people edit 
Research on theory of mind in autism led to the view that mentalizing abilities are subserved by dedicated mechanisms that can in some cases be impaired while general cognitive function remains largely intact 
Neuroimaging research supports this view  demonstrating specific brain regions are consistently engaged during theory of mind tasks  Positron emission tomography  PET  research on theory of mind  using verbal and pictorial story comprehension tasks  identifies a set of brain regions including the medial prefrontal cortex  mPFC   and area around posterior superior temporal sulcus  pSTS   and sometimes precuneus and amygdala temporopolar cortex                            Research on the neural basis of theory of mind has diversified  with separate lines of research focusing on the understanding of beliefs  intentions  and more complex properties of minds such as psychological traits 
Studies from Rebecca Saxe s lab at MIT  using a false belief versus false photograph task contrast aimed at isolating the mentalizing component of the false belief task  have consistently found activation in the mPFC  precuneus  and temporoparietal junction  TPJ   right lateralized                            In particular  Saxe et al  proposed that the right TPJ  rTPJ  is selectively involved in representing the beliefs of others               Some debate exists  as the same rTPJ region is consistently activated during spatial reorienting of visual attention                            Jean Decety from the University of Chicago and Jason Mitchell from Harvard thus propose that the rTPJ subserves a more general function involved in both false belief understanding and attentional reorienting  rather than a mechanism specialized for social cognition  However  it is possible that the observation of overlapping regions for representing beliefs and attentional reorienting may simply be due to adjacent  but distinct  neuronal populations that code for each  The resolution of typical fMRI studies may not be good enough to show that distinct adjacent neuronal populations code for each of these processes  In a study following Decety and Mitchell  Saxe and colleagues used higher resolution fMRI and showed that the peak of activation for attentional reorienting is approximately           mm above the peak for representing beliefs  Further corroborating that differing populations of neurons may code for each process  they found no similarity in the patterning of fMRI response across space              
Using single cell recordings in the human dorsomedial prefrontal cortex  dmPFC   researchers at MGH identified neurons that encode information about others  beliefs  which were distinct from self beliefs  across different scenarios in a false belief task  They further showed that these neurons could provide detailed information about others  beliefs  and could accurately predict these beliefs  verity               These findings suggest a prominent role of distinct neuronal populations in the dmPFC in theory of mind complemented by the TPJ and pSTS 
Functional imaging also illuminates the detection of mental state information in animations of moving geometric shapes similar to those used in Heider and Simmel                      which typical humans automatically perceive as social interactions laden with intention and emotion  Three studies found remarkably similar patterns of activation during the perception of such animations versus a random or deterministic motion control  mPFC  pSTS  fusiform face area  FFA   and amygdala were selectively engaged during the theory of mind condition               Another study presented subjects with an animation of two dots moving with a parameterized degree of intentionality  quantifying the extent to which the dots chased each other   and found that pSTS activation correlated with this parameter              
A separate body of research implicates the posterior superior temporal sulcus in the perception of intentionality in human action  This area is also involved in perceiving biological motion  including body  eye  mouth  and point light display motion               One study found increased pSTS activation while watching a human lift his hand versus having his hand pushed up by a piston  intentional versus unintentional action                Several studies found increased pSTS activation when subjects perceive a human action that is incongruent with the action expected from the actor s context and inferred intention  Examples would be  a human performing a reach to grasp motion on empty space next to an object  versus grasping the object               a human shifting eye gaze toward empty space next to a checkerboard target versus shifting gaze toward the target               an unladen human turning on a light with his knee  versus turning on a light with his knee while carrying a pile of books               and a walking human pausing as he passes behind a bookshelf  versus walking at a constant speed               In these studies  actions in the  congruent  case have a straightforward goal  and are easy to explain in terms of the actor s intention  The incongruent actions  on the other hand  require further explanation  why would someone twist empty space next to a gear    and apparently demand more processing in the STS  This region is distinct from the temporoparietal area activated during false belief tasks               pSTS activation in most of the above studies was largely right lateralized  following the general trend in neuroimaging studies of social cognition and perception  Also right lateralized are the TPJ activation during false belief tasks  the STS response to biological motion  and the FFA response to faces 
Neuropsychological evidence supports neuroimaging results regarding the neural basis of theory of mind  Studies with patients with a lesion of the frontal lobes and the temporoparietal junction of the brain  between the temporal lobe and parietal lobe  report that they have difficulty with some theory of mind tasks               This shows that theory of mind abilities are associated with specific parts of the human brain  However  the fact that the medial prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction are necessary for theory of mind tasks does not imply that these regions are specific to that function                            TPJ and mPFC may subserve more general functions necessary for Theory of Mind 
Research by Vittorio Gallese  Luciano Fadiga  and Giacomo Rizzolatti              shows that some sensorimotor neurons  referred to as mirror neurons and first discovered in the premotor cortex of rhesus monkeys  may be involved in action understanding  Single electrode recording revealed that these neurons fired when a monkey performed an action  as well as when the monkey viewed another agent performing the same action  fMRI studies with human participants show brain regions  assumed to contain mirror neurons  that are active when one person sees another person s goal directed action               These data led some authors to suggest that mirror neurons may provide the basis for theory of mind in the brain  and to support simulation theory of mind reading              
There is also evidence against a link between mirror neurons and theory of mind  First  macaque monkeys have mirror neurons but do not seem to have a  human like  capacity to understand theory of mind and belief  Second  fMRI studies of theory of mind typically report activation in the mPFC  temporal poles  and TPJ or STS               but those brain areas are not part of the mirror neuron system  Some investigators  like developmental psychologist Andrew Meltzoff and neuroscientist Jean Decety  believe that mirror neurons merely facilitate learning through imitation and may provide a precursor to the development of theory of mind               Others  like philosopher Shaun Gallagher  suggest that mirror neuron activation  on a number of counts  fails to meet the definition of simulation as proposed by the simulation theory of mindreading                           

In autism edit 
Several neuroimaging studies have looked at the neural basis for theory of mind impairment in subjects with Asperger syndrome and high functioning autism  HFA   The first PET study of theory of mind in autism  also the first neuroimaging study using a task induced activation paradigm in autism  replicated a prior study in non autistic individuals  which employed a story comprehension task               This study found displaced and diminished mPFC activation in subjects with autism  However  because the study used only six subjects with autism  and because the spatial resolution of PET imaging is relatively poor  these results should be considered preliminary 
A subsequent fMRI study scanned normally developing adults and adults with HFA while performing a  reading the mind in the eyes  task  viewing a photo of a human s eyes and choosing which of two adjectives better describes the person s mental state  versus a gender discrimination control               The authors found activity in orbitofrontal cortex  STS  and amygdala in normal subjects  and found less amygdala activation and abnormal STS activation in subjects with autism 
A more recent PET study looked at brain activity in individuals with HFA and Asperger syndrome while viewing Heider Simmel animations  see above  versus a random motion control               In contrast to normally developing subjects  those with autism showed little STS or FFA activation  and less mPFC and amygdala activation  Activity in extrastriate regions V  and LO was identical across the two groups  suggesting intact lower level visual processing in the subjects with autism  The study also reported less functional connectivity between STS and V  in the autism group  However decreased temporal correlation between activity in STS and V  would be expected simply from the lack of an evoked response in STS to intent laden animations in subjects with autism  A more informative analysis would be to compute functional connectivity after regressing out evoked responses from all time series 
A subsequent study  using the incongruent congruent gaze shift paradigm described above  found that in high functioning adults with autism  posterior STS  pSTS  activation was undifferentiated while they watched a human shift gaze toward a target and then toward adjacent empty space               The lack of additional STS processing in the incongruent state may suggest that these subjects fail to form an expectation of what the actor should do given contextual information  or that feedback about the violation of this expectation does not reach STS  Both explanations involve an impairment or deficit in the ability to link eye gaze shifts with intentional explanations  This study also found a significant anticorrelation between STS activation in the incongruent congruent contrast and social subscale score on the Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised  but not scores on the other subscales 
An fMRI study demonstrated that the right temporoparietal junction  rTPJ  of higher functioning adults with autism was not more selectively activated for mentalizing judgments when compared to physical judgments about self and other               rTPJ selectivity for mentalizing was also related to individual variation on clinical measures of social impairment  individuals whose rTPJ was increasingly more active for mentalizing compared to physical judgments were less socially impaired  while those who showed little to no difference in response to mentalizing or physical judgments were the most socially impaired  This evidence builds on work in typical development that suggests rTPJ is critical for representing mental state information  whether it is about oneself or others  It also points to an explanation at the neural level for the pervasive mind blindness difficulties in autism that are evident throughout the lifespan              

In schizophrenia edit 
The brain regions associated with theory of mind include the superior temporal gyrus  STS   the temporoparietal junction  TPJ   the medial prefrontal cortex  mPFC   the precuneus  and the amygdala               The reduced activity in the mPFC of individuals with schizophrenia is associated with theory of mind deficit and may explain impairments in social function among people with schizophrenia               Increased neural activity in mPFC is related to better perspective taking  emotion management  and increased social functioning               Disrupted brain activities in areas related to theory of mind may increase social stress or disinterest in social interaction  and contribute to the social dysfunction associated with schizophrenia              

Practical validity edit 
Main article  Collective intelligenceGroup member average scores of theory of mind abilities  measured with the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test               RME   are possibly drivers of successful group performance               High group average scores on the RME are correlated with the collective intelligence factor c  defined as a group s ability to perform a wide range of mental tasks                            a group intelligence measure similar to the g factor for general individual intelligence  RME is a theory of mind test for adults              that shows sufficient test retest reliability              and constantly differentiates control groups from individuals with functional autism or Asperger syndrome               It is one of the most widely accepted and well validated tests for theory of mind abilities within adults              
Evolution edit 
The evolutionary origin of theory of mind remains obscure  While many theories make claims about its role in the development of human language and social cognition  few of them specify in detail any evolutionary neurophysiological precursors  One theory claims that theory of mind has its roots in two defensive reactions immobilization stress and tonic immobility which are implicated in the handling of stressful encounters and also figure prominently in mammalian childrearing practice                 Their combined effect seems capable of producing many of the hallmarks of theory of mind  such as eye contact  gaze following  inhibitory control  and intentional attributions 

Non human edit 
See also  Animal consciousness and Theory of mind in animals
An open question is whether non human animals have a genetic endowment and social environment that allows them to acquire a theory of mind like human children do              This is a contentious issue because of the difficulty of inferring from animal behavior the existence of thinking or of particular thoughts  or the existence of a concept of self or self awareness  consciousness  and qualia  One difficulty with non human studies of theory of mind is the lack of sufficient numbers of naturalistic observations  giving insight into what the evolutionary pressures might be on a species  development of theory of mind 
Non human research still has a major place in this field  It is especially useful in illuminating which nonverbal behaviors signify components of theory of mind  and in pointing to possible stepping points in the evolution of that aspect of social cognition  While it is difficult to study human like theory of mind and mental states in species of whose potential mental states we have an incomplete understanding  researchers can focus on simpler components of more complex capabilities  For example  many researchers focus on animals  understanding of intention  gaze  perspective  or knowledge  of what another being has seen   A study that looked at understanding of intention in orangutans  chimpanzees  and children showed that all three species understood the difference between accidental and intentional acts             
Individuals exhibit theory of mind by extrapolating another s internal mental states from their observable behavior  So one challenge in this line of research is to distinguish this from more run of the mill stimulus response learning  with the other s observable behavior being the stimulus 
Recently      may be outdated as of March           most non human theory of mind research has focused on monkeys and great apes  who are of most interest in the study of the evolution of human social cognition  Other studies relevant to attributions theory of mind have been conducted using plovers              and dogs               which show preliminary evidence of understanding attention one precursor of theory of mind in others 
There has been some controversy over the interpretation of evidence purporting to show theory of mind ability or inability in animals               For example  Povinelli et al               presented chimpanzees with the choice of two experimenters from whom to request food  one who had seen where food was hidden  and one who  by virtue of one of a variety of mechanisms  having a bucket or bag over his head  a blindfold over his eyes  or being turned away from the baiting  does not know  and can only guess  They found that the animals failed in most cases to differentially request food from the  knower   By contrast  Hare  Call  and Tomasello found that subordinate chimpanzees were able to use the knowledge state of dominant rival chimpanzees to determine which container of hidden food they approached              William Field and Sue Savage Rumbaugh believe that bonobos have developed theory of mind  and cite their communications with a captive bonobo  Kanzi  as evidence              
In one experiment  ravens  Corvus corax  took into account visual access of unseen conspecifics  The researchers argued that  ravens can generalize from their own perceptual experience to infer the possibility of being seen               
Evolutionary anthropologist Christopher Krupenye studied the existence of theory of mind  and particularly false beliefs  in non human primates              
Keren Haroush and Ziv Williams outlined the case for a group of neurons in primates  brains that uniquely predicted the choice selection of their interacting partner  These primates  neurons  located in the anterior cingulate cortex of rhesus monkeys  were observed using single unit recording while the monkeys played a variant of the iterative prisoner s dilemma game               By identifying cells that represent the yet unknown intentions of a game partner  Haroush  amp  Williams  study supports the idea that theory of mind may be a fundamental and generalized process  and suggests that anterior cingulate cortex neurons may act to complement the function of mirror neurons during social interchange

 I will argue that literature regarding  theory of mind  has constituted EV  Researchers  based on one experiment  with a small sample of autistic children       mean chronological age       estimated verbal ability age       argued that autistic individuals lacked  theory of mind   which is to say  they lacked the ability to infer their own and others minds  that this was a universal effect and unique to autism  Baron Cohen  Leslie   amp  Frith         Four autistic participants       passed the experiment  demonstrating theory of mind  sixteen did not  yet it was claimed to be a universal effect which was unique to autism  It was hypothesised instead that the kids who passed may not  really  be autistic  instead of theory of mind having limits in its ability to explain autism  The available evidence has never been that it was universal  autistic children who passed the test were deemed to be outliers and an exception to rule  despite making up between        of the sample completing the task  reliably  Baron Cohen  Leslie   amp  Frith        Yirmiya et al
