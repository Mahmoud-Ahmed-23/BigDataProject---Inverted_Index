Family of formal knowledge representation
Description logics  DL  are a family of formal knowledge representation languages  Many DLs are more expressive than propositional logic but less expressive than first order logic  In contrast to the latter  the core reasoning problems for DLs are  usually  decidable  and efficient decision procedures have been designed and implemented for these problems  There are general  spatial  temporal  spatiotemporal  and fuzzy description logics  and each description logic features a different balance between expressive power and reasoning complexity by supporting different sets of mathematical constructors            
DLs are used in artificial intelligence to describe and reason about the relevant concepts of an application domain  known as terminological knowledge   It is of particular importance in providing a logical formalism for ontologies and the Semantic Web  the Web Ontology Language  OWL  and its profiles are based on DLs  The most notable application of DLs and OWL is in biomedical informatics where DL assists in the codification of biomedical knowledge      citation needed     


Introduction edit 
A description logic  DL  models concepts  roles and individuals  and their relationships 
The fundamental modeling concept of a DL is the axiom a logical statement relating roles and or concepts             This is a key difference from the  frames paradigm where a frame specification declares and completely defines a class            

Nomenclature edit 
Terminology compared to FOL and OWL edit 
The description logic community uses different terminology than the first order logic  FOL  community for operationally equivalent notions  some examples are given below  The Web Ontology Language  OWL  uses again a different terminology  also given in the table below 


Synonyms

Naming convention edit 
There are many varieties of description logics and there is an informal naming convention  roughly describing the operators allowed  The expressivity is encoded in the label for a logic starting with one of the following basic logics 





  
    
      
        
          
            A

History edit 
Description logic was given its current name in the     s  Previous to this it was called  chronologically   terminological systems  and concept languages 

Knowledge representation edit 
Frames and semantic networks lack formal  logic based  semantics             DL was first introduced into knowledge representation  KR  systems to overcome this deficiency            
The first DL based KR system was KL ONE  by Ronald J  Brachman and Schmolze         During the    s other DL based systems using structural subsumption algorithms            were developed including KRYPTON         LOOM         BACK         K REP        and CLASSIC         This approach featured DL with limited expressiveness but relatively efficient  polynomial time  reasoning            
In the early    s  the introduction of a new tableau based algorithm paradigm allowed efficient reasoning on more expressive DL             DL based systems using these algorithms   such as KRIS          show acceptable reasoning performance on typical inference problems even though the worst case complexity is no longer polynomial            
From the mid    s  reasoners were created with good practical performance on very expressive DL with high worst case complexity             Examples from this period include FaCT             RACER         CEL         and KAON          
DL reasoners  such as FaCT  FaCT               RACER  DLP and Pellet             implement the method of analytic tableaux  KAON  is implemented by algorithms which reduce a SHIQ D  knowledge base to a disjunctive datalog program 

Semantic web edit

syntactic variants of DL             In particular  the formal semantics and reasoning in OIL use the

              Practical experience demonstrated that OWL DL lacked several key features necessary to model complex domains            

Modeling edit 
TBox vs Abox edit 
In DL  a distinction is drawn between the so called TBox  terminological box  and the ABox  assertional box   In general  the TBox contains sentences describing concept hierarchies  i e   relations between concepts  while the ABox contains ground sentences stating where in the hierarchy  individuals belong  i e   relations between individuals and concepts   For example  the statement 

Every employee is a person   
belongs in the TBox  while the statement 

Bob is an employee   
belongs in the ABox 
Note that the TBox ABox distinction is not significant  in the same sense that the two  kinds  of sentences are not treated differently in first order logic  which subsumes most DL   When translated into first order logic  a subsumption axiom like     is simply a conditional restriction to unary predicates  concepts  with only variables appearing in it  Clearly  a sentence of this form is not privileged or special over sentences in which only constants   grounded  values  appear like     

Motivation for having Tbox and Abox edit 
So why was the distinction introduced  The primary reason is that the separation can be useful when describing and formulating decision procedures for various DL  For example  a reasoner might process the TBox and ABox separately  in part because certain key inference problems are tied to one but not the other one   classification  is related to the TBox   instance checking  to the ABox   Another example is that the complexity of the TBox can greatly affect the performance of a given decision procedure for a certain DL  independently of the ABox  Thus  it is useful to have a way to talk about that specific part of the knowledge base 
The secondary reason is that the distinction can make sense from the knowledge base modeler s perspective  It is plausible to distinguish between our conception of terms concepts in the world  class axioms in the TBox  and particular manifestations of those terms concepts  instance assertions in the ABox   In the above example  when the hierarchy within a company is the same in every branch but the assignment to employees is different in every department  because there are other people working there   it makes sense to reuse the TBox for different branches that do not use the same ABox 
There are two features of description logic that are not shared by most other data description formalisms  DL does not make the unique name assumption  UNA  or the closed world assumption  CWA   Not having UNA means that two concepts with different names may be allowed by some inference to be shown to be equivalent  Not having CWA  or rather having the open world assumption  OWA  means that lack of knowledge of a fact does not immediately imply knowledge of the negation of a fact 

Formal description edit 
Like first order logic  FOL   a syntax defines which collections of symbols are legal expressions in a description logic  and semantics determine meaning  Unlike FOL  a DL may have several well known syntactic variants            

Syntax edit 
The syntax of a member of the description logic family is characterized by its recursive definition  in which the constructors that can be used to form concept terms are stated  Some constructors are related to logical constructors in first order logic  FOL  such as intersection or conjunction of concepts  union or disjunction of concepts  negation or complement of concepts  universal restriction and existential restriction  Other constructors have no corresponding construction in FOL including restrictions on roles for example  inverse  transitivity and functionality 

Notation edit 
Let C and D be concepts  a and b be individuals  and R be a role 
If a is R related to b  then b is called an R successor of a

Semantics edit 
The semantics of description logics are defined by interpreting concepts as sets of individuals and roles as sets of ordered pairs of individuals  Those individuals are typically assumed from a given domain  The semantics of non atomic concepts and roles is then defined in terms of atomic concepts and roles  This is done by using a recursive definition similar to the syntax

Inference edit 
Decision problems edit 
In addition to the ability to describe concepts formally  one also would like to employ the description of a set of concepts to ask questions about the concepts and instances described  The most common decision problems are basic database query like questions like instance checking  is a particular instance  member of an ABox  a member of a given concept  and relation checking  does a relation role hold between two instances  in other words does a have property b   and the more global database questions like subsumption  is a concept a subset of another concept   and concept consistency  is there no contradiction among the definitions or chain of definitions   The more operators one includes in a logic and the more complicated the TBox  having cycles  allowing non atomic concepts to include each other   usually the higher the computational complexity is for each of these problems  see Description Logic Complexity Navigator for examples  

Relationship with other logics edit 
First order logic edit 
Many DLs are decidable fragments of first order logic  FOL             and are usually fragments of two variable logic or guarded logic  In addition  some DLs have features that are not covered in FOL  this includes concrete domains  such as integer or strings  which can be used as ranges for roles such as hasAge or hasName  or an operator on roles for the transitive closure of that role            

Fuzzy description logic edit 
Fuzzy description logics combines fuzzy logic with DLs  Since many concepts that are needed for intelligent systems lack well defined boundaries  or precisely defined criteria of membership  fuzzy logic is needed to deal with notions of vagueness and imprecision  This offers a motivation for a generalization of description logic towards dealing with imprecise and vague concepts 

Modal logic edit 
Description logic is related to but developed independently of modal logic  ML              Many but not all DLs are syntactic variants of ML            
In general  an object corresponds to a possible world  a concept corresponds to a modal proposition  and a role bounded quantifier to a modal operator with that role as its accessibility relation 
Operations on roles  such as composition  inversion  etc   correspond to the modal operations used in dynamic logic

Temporal description logic edit 
Temporal description logic represents and allows reasoning about time dependent concepts and many different approaches to this problem exist              For example  a description logic might be combined with a modal temporal logic such as linear temporal logic

Reasoners edit 
There are some semantic reasoners that deal with OWL and DL  These are some of the most popular 

CEL is an open source LISP based reasoner  Apache     License  
Cerebra Engine was a commercial C   based reasoner  acquired in      by webMethods 
FaCT    is a free open source C   based reasoner 
KAON  is a free  for non commercial use  Java based reasoner  offering fast reasoning support for OWL ontologies 
MSPASS is a free open source C reasoner for numerous DL models 
Pellet is a dual licensed  AGPL and proprietary  commercial  Java based reasoner 
RacerPro of Racer Systems was a commercial  free trials and research licenses are available  lisp based reasoner  today both an open source version of RACER exists from the original developers at L beck University using the BSD   license  and also a commercialized version  still named RacerPro by Franz Inc 
Sim DL is a free open source Java based reasoner for the language ALCHQ  It also provides a similarity measurement functionality between concepts  To access this functionality a Prot g  plugin can be used 
HermiT is an open source reasoner based on the  hypertableau  calculus  It is developed by the University of Oxford 
Owlready  is a package for ontology oriented programming in Python  It can load OWL     ontologies as Python objects  modify them  save them  and perform reasoning via HermiT  included   Owlready  allows a transparent access to OWL ontologies  contrary to usual Java based API  
OWLAPY  OWLAPY is an open source Python framework for creating  manipulating  and reasoning with OWL ontologies  It includes a built in StructuralReasoner for efficient  lightweight reasoning and wrappers for well known Java based reasoners like HermiT  Pellet  JFact  and Openllet 
Editors edit 
Prot g  is a free  open source ontology editor and a knowledge base framework  which can use DL reasoners offering DIG Interface as a back end for consistency checks 
SWOOP on GitHub  an OWL browser editor that takes the standard web browser as the basic UI paradigm 
Interfaces edit 
DIG Interface on SourceForge  a standardized XML interface to DLs systems developed by the DL Implementation Group  DIG  
OWL API on SourceForge  a Java interface and implementation for the Web Ontology Language  used to represent Semantic Web ontologies
