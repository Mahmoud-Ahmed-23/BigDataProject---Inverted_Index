Image dataset

The ImageNet project is a large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research  More than    million                       images have been hand annotated by the project to indicate what objects are pictured and in at least one million of the images  bounding boxes are also provided             ImageNet contains more than        categories             with a typical category  such as  balloon  or  strawberry   consisting of several hundred images             The database of annotations of third party image URLs is freely available directly from ImageNet  though the actual images are not owned by ImageNet             Since       the ImageNet project runs an annual software contest  the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge  ILSVRC   where software programs compete to correctly classify and detect objects and scenes  The challenge uses a  trimmed  list of one thousand non overlapping classes            


History edit 
AI researcher Fei Fei Li began working on the idea for ImageNet in       At a time when most AI research focused on models and algorithms  Li wanted to expand and improve the data available to train AI algorithms             In       Li met with Princeton professor Christiane Fellbaum  one of the creators of WordNet  to discuss the project  As a result of this meeting  Li went on to build ImageNet starting from the roughly        nouns of WordNet and using many of its features             She was also inspired by a      estimate            that the average person recognizes roughly        different kinds of objects             
As an assistant professor at Princeton  Li assembled a team of researchers to work on the ImageNet project  They used Amazon Mechanical Turk to help with the classification of images  Labeling started in July      and ended in April       It took     years to complete the labeling             They had enough budget to have each of the    million images labelled three times             
The original plan called for        images per category  for        categories at     million images  each verified   times  They found that humans can classify at most   images sec  At this rate  it was estimated to take    human years of labor  without rest              
They presented their database for the first time as a poster at the      Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition  CVPR  in Florida  titled  ImageNet  A Preview of a Large scale Hierarchical      Dataset                                                  The poster was reused at Vision Sciences Society                  
In       Alex Berg suggested adding object localization as a task  Li approached PASCAL Visual Object Classes contest in      for a collaboration  It resulted in the subsequent  ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge starting in       which has      classes and object localization  as compared to PASCAL VOC which had just    classes and        images  in                             

Significance for deep learning edit 
On    September       a convolutional neural network  CNN  called AlexNet             achieved a top   error of       in the ImageNet      Challenge  more than      percentage points lower than that of the runner up  Using convolutional neural networks was feasible due to the use of graphics processing units  GPUs  during training              an essential ingredient of the deep learning revolution  According to The Economist   Suddenly people started to pay attention  not just within the AI community but across the technology industry as a whole                                     
In       AlexNet was outperformed by Microsoft s very deep CNN with over     layers  which won the ImageNet      contest             

Dataset edit 
ImageNet crowdsources its annotation process  Image level annotations indicate the presence or absence of an object class in an image  such as  there are tigers in this image  or  there are no tigers in this image   Object level annotations provide a bounding box around the  visible part of the  indicated object  ImageNet uses a variant of the broad WordNet schema to categorize objects  augmented with     categories of dog breeds to showcase fine grained classification            
In       ImageNet was the world s largest academic user of Mechanical Turk  The average worker identified    images per minute            
The original plan of the full ImageNet would have roughly   M clean  diverse and full resolution images spread over approximately   K synsets              This was not achieved 
The summary statistics given on April                      

Total number of non empty synsets       
Total number of images            
Number of images with bounding box annotations           
Number of synsets with SIFT features      
Number of images with SIFT features      million
Categories edit 
The categories of ImageNet were filtered from the WordNet concepts  Each concept  since it can contain multiple synonyms  for example   kitty  and  young cat    so each concept is called a  synonym set  or  synset   There were more than         synsets in WordNet      majority of them are nouns            The ImageNet dataset filtered these to        synsets that are countable nouns that can be visually illustrated 
Each synset in WordNet     has a  WordNet ID   wnid   which is a concatenation of part of speech and an  offset   a unique identifying number   Every wnid starts with  n  because ImageNet only includes nouns  For example  the wnid of synset  dog  domestic dog  Canis familiaris  is  n                      
The categories in ImageNet fall into   levels  from level    such as  mammal   to level    such as  German shepherd               

Image format edit 
The images were scraped from online image search  Google  Picsearch  MSN  Yahoo  Flickr  etc  using synonyms in multiple languages  For example  German shepherd  German police dog  German shepherd dog  Alsatian  ovejero alem n  pastore tedesco                    
ImageNet consists of images in RGB format with varying resolutions  For example  in ImageNet        fish  category  the resolution ranges from      x      to    x     In machine learning  these are typically preprocessed into a standard constant resolution  and whitened  before further processing by neural networks 
For example  in PyTorch  ImageNet images are by default normalized by dividing the pixel values so that they fall between   and    then subtracting by                        then dividing by                        These are the mean and standard deviations  for ImageNet  so these whitens the input data             

Labels and annotations edit 
Each image is labelled with exactly one wnid 
Dense SIFT features  raw SIFT descriptors  quantized codewords  and coordinates of each descriptor codeword  for ImageNet  K were available for download  designed for bag of visual words             
The bounding boxes of objects were available for about      popular synsets             with on average     images in each synset             
Furthermore  some images have attributes  They released    attributes for      popular synsets                         

Color  black  blue  brown  gray  green  orange  pink  red  violet  white  yellow
Pattern  spotted  striped
Shape  long  round  rectangular  square
Texture  furry  smooth  rough  shiny  metallic  vegetation  wooden  wet
ImageNet   K edit 
The full original dataset is referred to as ImageNet   K  ImageNet   k contains            images divided into        classes  Some papers round this up and name it ImageNet   k             
The full ImageNet   k was released in Fall of       as fall   whole tar  There is no official train validation test split for ImageNet   k  Some classes contain only      samples  while others contain thousands             

ImageNet  K edit 
There are various subsets of the ImageNet dataset used in various context  sometimes referred to as  versions              
One of the most highly used subsets of ImageNet is the  ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge  ILSVRC            image classification and localization dataset   This is also referred to in the research literature as ImageNet  K or ILSVRC      reflecting the original ILSVRC challenge that involved       classes  ImageNet  K contains           training images         validation images and         test images             
Each category in ImageNet  K is a leaf category  meaning that there are no child nodes below it  unlike ImageNet   K  For example  in ImageNet   K  there are some images categorized as simply  mammal   whereas in ImageNet  K  there are only images categorized as things like  German shepherd   since there are no child words below  German shepherd              

Later developments edit 
In      winter  ImageNet   k was updated        categories in the  person  subtree were filtered to prevent  problematic behaviors  in a trained model  In       ImageNet  k was updated by annotating faces appearing in the     non person categories  They found training models on the dataset with these faces blurred caused minimal loss in performance             
ImageNet C is an adversarially perturbed version of ImageNet constructed in                  
ImageNetV  was a new dataset containing three test sets with        each  constructed by the same methodology as the original ImageNet             
ImageNet   K P was a filtered and cleaned subset of ImageNet   K  with            images from        categories

History of the ImageNet challenge edit 
Error rate history on ImageNet  showing best result per team and up to    entries per year   The      entry of AlexNet is clearly visible 
The ILSVRC aims to  follow in the footsteps  of the smaller scale PASCAL VOC challenge  established in       which contained only about        images and twenty object classes             To  democratize  ImageNet  Fei Fei Li proposed to the PASCAL VOC team a collaboration  beginning in       where research teams would evaluate their algorithms on the given data set  and compete to achieve higher accuracy on several visual recognition tasks            
The resulting annual competition is now known as the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge  ILSVRC   The ILSVRC uses a  trimmed  list of only      image categories or  classes   including    of the     dog breeds classified by the full ImageNet schema            
The     s saw dramatic progress in image processing 
The first competition in      had    participating teams  The winning team was a linear support vector machine  SVM   The features are a dense grid of HoG and LBP  sparsified by local coordinate coding and pooling              It achieved       in classification accuracy and       in top   accuracy  It was trained for   days on three   core machines  dual quad core        GHz Intel Xeon CPU              
The second competition in      had fewer teams  with another SVM winning at top   error rate                  The winning team was XRCE by Florent Perronnin  Jorge Sanchez  The system was another linear SVM  running on quantized             Fisher vectors                          It achieved       in top   accuracy 
In       a deep convolutional neural net called AlexNet achieved       in top   accuracy  a great leap forward              In the next couple of years  top   accuracy grew to above      While the      breakthrough  combined pieces that were all there before   the dramatic quantitative improvement marked the start of an industry wide artificial intelligence boom            
In       most high ranking entries used convolutional neural networks  The winning entry for object localization was the OverFeat  an architecture for simultaneous object classification and localization             
By       more than fifty institutions participated in the ILSVRC             In          of    competing teams had greater than     accuracy              In      ImageNet stated it would roll out a new  much more difficult challenge in      that involves classifying  D objects using natural language  Because creating  D data is more costly than annotating a pre existing  D image  the dataset is expected to be smaller  The applications of progress in this area would range from robotic navigation to augmented reality            
By       researchers at Microsoft reported that their CNNs exceeded human ability at the narrow ILSVRC tasks                          However  as one of the challenge s organizers  Olga Russakovsky  pointed out in       the contest is over only      categories  humans can recognize a larger number of categories  and also  unlike the programs  can judge the context of an image             
In       the winning entry was CUImage  an ensemble model of   networks  Inception v   Inception v   Inception ResNet v   ResNet      Wide ResNet     and Wide ResNet                The runner up was ResNeXt  which combines the Inception module with ResNet             
In       the winning entry was the Squeeze and Excitation Network  SENet   reducing the top   error to                    

Bias in ImageNet edit 
It is estimated that over    of labels in the ImageNet  k validation set are wrong              It is also found that around     of ImageNet  k contains ambiguous or erroneous labels  and that  when presented with a model s prediction and the original ImageNet label  human annotators prefer the prediction of a state of the art model in      trained on the original ImageNet  suggesting that ImageNet  k has been saturated             
A study of the history of the multiple layers  taxonomy  object classes and labeling  of ImageNet and WordNet in      described how bias     clarification needed      is deeply embedded in most classification approaches for all sorts of images                                                  ImageNet is working to address various sources of bias             
One downside of WordNet use is the categories may be more  elevated  than would be optimal for ImageNet   Most people are more interested in Lady Gaga or the iPod Mini than in this rare kind of diplodocus       clarification needed
