Artificial intelligence art is visual artwork created or enhanced through the use of artificial intelligence  AI  programs 
Artists began to create artificial intelligence art in the mid to late   th century when the discipline was founded  Throughout its history  artificial intelligence art has raised many philosophical concerns related to the human mind  artificial beings  and what can be considered art in a human AI collaboration  Since the   th century  artists have used AI to create art  some of which has been exhibited in museums and won awards            
During the AI boom of the     s  text to image models such as Midjourney  DALL E  Stable Diffusion  and FLUX   became widely available to the public  allowing users to quickly generate imagery with little effort                        Commentary about AI art in the     s has often focused on issues related to copyright  deception  defamation  and its impact on more traditional artists  including technological unemployment  Audience reception shows bias against AI generated art  where people tend to value artworks less when they know they were created with AI             Opinions have also risen on the possible effect AI generated art might have on creativity

Early history edit 
Maillardet s automaton drawing a picture
Automated art dates back at least to the automata of ancient Greek civilization  when inventors such as Daedalus and Hero of Alexandria were described as designing machines capable of writing text  generating sounds  and playing music                        Creative automatons have flourished throughout history  such as Maillardet s automaton  created around      and capable of creating multiple drawings and poems            
Also in the   th century  Ada Lovelace  writes that  computing operations  could be used to generate music and poems  now referred to as  The Lovelace Effect   where a computer s behavior is viewed as creative             Lovelace also discusses a concept known as  The Lovelace Objection   where she argues that a machine has  no pretensions whatever to originate anything             
In       with the publication of Alan Turing s paper  Computing Machinery and Intelligence   there was a shift from defining machine intelligence in abstract terms to evaluating whether a machine can mimic human behavior and responses convincingly              Shortly after  the academic discipline of artificial intelligence was founded at a research workshop at Dartmouth College in                   Since its founding  researchers in the field have explored philosophical questions about the nature of the human mind and the consequences of creating artificial beings with human like intelligence  these issues have previously been explored by myth  fiction  and philosophy since antiquity             

Artistic history edit 
Karl Sims  Gal pagos installation allowed visitors to evolve  D animated formsSince the founding of AI in the     s  artists have used artificial intelligence to create artistic works  These works were sometimes referred to as algorithmic art              computer art  digital art  or new media art             
One of the first significant AI art systems is AARON  developed by Harold Cohen beginning in the late     s at the University of California at San Diego              AARON uses a symbolic rule based approach to generate technical images in the era of GOFAI programming  and it was developed by Cohen with the goal of being able to code the act of drawing              AARON was exhibited in      at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art              From      to       Cohen refined AARON during a residency at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Stanford University              In       the Whitney Museum of American Art exhibited AI art from throughout Cohen s career  including re created versions of his early robotic drawing machines             
Karl Sims has exhibited art created with artificial life since the     s  He received an M S  in computer graphics from the MIT Media Lab in      and was artist in residence from      to      at the supercomputer manufacturer and artificial intelligence company Thinking Machines                                      In both      and       Sims won the Golden Nica award at Prix Ars Electronica for his videos using artificial evolution                                      In       Sims created the interactive artificial evolution  installation Gal pagos for the NTT InterCommunication Center in Tokyo              Sims received an Emmy Award in      for outstanding achievement in engineering development             

Example of Electric Sheep by Scott DravesIn       Scott Draves and a team of several engineers created and released Electric Sheep as a free software screensaver              Electric Sheep is a volunteer computing project for animating and evolving fractal flames  which are distributed to networked computers which display them as a screensaver  The screensaver used AI to create an infinite animation by learning from its audience  In       Draves won the Fundacion Telef nica Life     prize for Electric Sheep                  unreliable source      
In       Stephanie Dinkins began working on Conversations with Bina                For the series  Dinkins recorded her conversations with BINA    a social robot that resembles a middle aged black woman                          In       Dinkins won the Creative Capital award for her creation of an evolving artificial intelligence based on the  interests and culture s  of people of color               

In       Sougwen Chung began Mimicry  Drawing Operations Unit  Generation     an ongoing collaboration between the artist and a robotic arm              In       Chung won the Lumen Prize for her continued performances with a robotic arm that uses AI to attempt to draw in a manner similar to Chung              Edmond de Belamy  created with a generative adversarial network in     In       an auction sale of artificial intelligence art was held at Christie s in New York where the AI artwork Edmond de Belamy sold for US          which was almost    times higher than its estimate of US               The artwork was created by Obvious  a Paris based collective                                     
In       Japanese film generAIdoscope was released  The film was co directed by Hirotaka Adachi  Takeshi Sone  and Hiroki Yamaguchi  All video  audio  and music in the film were created with artificial intelligence             
In       Japanese anime television series Twins Hinahima was released  The anime was produced and animated with AI assistance during the process of cutting and conversion of photographs into anime illustrations and later retouched by art staff  Most of the remaining parts such as characters and logos were hand drawn with various software                         

Technical history edit 
Deep learning  characterized by its multi layer structure that attempts to mimic the human brain  first came about in the     s and causing a significant shift in the world of AI art              During the deep learning era  there are mainly these types of designs for generative art  autoregressive models  diffusion models  GANs  normalizing flows 
In       Ian Goodfellow and colleagues at Universit  de Montr al developed the generative adversarial network  GAN   a type of deep neural network capable of learning to mimic the statistical distribution of input data such as images  The GAN uses a  generator  to create new images and a  discriminator  to decide which created images are considered successful              Unlike previous algorithmic art that followed hand coded rules  generative adversarial networks could learn a specific aesthetic by analyzing a dataset of example images             
In       a team at Google released DeepDream  a program that uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic pareidolia                                      The process creates deliberately over processed images with a dream like appearance reminiscent of a psychedelic experience              Later  in       a conditional GAN learned to generate      image classes of ImageNet  a large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research                          By conditioning the GAN on both random noise and a specific class label  this approach enhanced the quality of image synthesis for class conditional models             
Autoregressive models were used for image generation  such as PixelRNN         which autoregressively generates one pixel after another with a recurrent neural network              Immediately after the Transformer architecture was proposed in Attention Is All You Need         it was used for autoregressive generation of images  but without text conditioning             
The website Artbreeder  launched in       uses the models StyleGAN and BigGAN                         to allow users to generate and modify images such as faces  landscapes  and paintings              
In the     s  text to image models  which generate images based on prompts  became widely used  marking yet another shift in the creation of AI generated artworks            

Example of an image made with VQGAN CLIP  NightCafe Studio Example of an image made with Flux     Pro in Raw mode  this mode is designed to generate photorealistic images
In       using the influential large language generative pre trained transformer models that are used in GPT   and GPT    OpenAI released a series of images created with the text to image AI model DALL E                It was an autoregressive generative model with essentially the same architecture as GPT    Along with this  later in       EleutherAI released the open source VQGAN CLIP             based on OpenAI s CLIP model              Diffusion models  generative models used to create synthetic data based on existing data              were first proposed in                   but they only became better than GANs in early                   Latent diffusion model was published in December      and became the basis for the later Stable Diffusion  August                   
In       Midjourney             was released  followed by Google Brain s Imagen and Parti  which were announced in May       Microsoft s NUWA Infinity                         and the source available Stable Diffusion  which was released in August                                           DALL E         a successor to DALL E  was beta tested and released  with the further successor DALL E        being released in        Stability AI has a Stable Diffusion web interface called DreamStudio              plugins for Krita  Photoshop  Blender  and GIMP              and the Automatic     web based open source user interface                                      Stable Diffusion s main pre trained model is shared on the Hugging Face Hub             
Ideogram was released in August       this model is known for its ability to generate legible text                         
In       Flux was released  This model can generate realistic images and was integrated into Grok  the chatbot used on X  formerly Twitter   and Le Chat  the chatbot of Mistral AI                                                 Flux was developed by Black Forest Labs  founded by the researchers behind Stable Diffusion              Grok later switched to its own text to image model Aurora in December of the same year              Several companies  along with their products  have also developed an AI model integrated with an image editing service  Adobe has released and integrated the AI model Firefly into Premiere Pro  Photoshop  and Illustrator                          Microsoft has also publicly announced AI image generator features for Microsoft Paint              Along with this  some examples of text to video models of the mid     s are Runway s Gen    Google s VideoPoet  and OpenAI s Sora  which was released in December                              

Tools and processes edit 
Imagery edit 
Example of a usage of ComfyUI for Stable Diffusion XL  people can adjust variables  such as CFG  seed  and sampler  needed to generate image
There are many tools available to the artist when working with diffusion models  They can define both positive and negative prompts  but they are also afforded a choice in using  or omitting the use of  VAEs  LoRAs  hypernetworks  IP adapter  and embedding textual inversions  Artists can tweak settings like guidance scale  which balances creativity and accuracy   seed  to control randomness   and upscalers  to enhance image resolution   among others  Additional influence can be exerted during pre inference by means of noise manipulation  while traditional post processing techniques are frequently used post inference  People can also train their own models 
In addition  procedural  rule based  generation of images using mathematical patterns  algorithms that simulate brush strokes and other painted effects  and deep learning algorithms such as generative adversarial networks  GANs  and transformers have been developed  Several companies have released apps and websites that allow one to forego all the options mentioned entirely while solely focusing on the positive prompt  There also exist programs which transform photos into art like images in the style of well known sets of paintings                         
There are many options  ranging from simple consumer facing mobile apps to Jupyter notebooks and web UIs that require powerful GPUs to run effectively              Additional functionalities include  textual inversion   which refers to enabling the use of user provided concepts  like an object or a style  learned from a few images  Novel art can then be generated from the associated word s   the text that has been assigned to the learned  often abstract  concept                          and model extensions or fine tuning  such as DreamBooth  

Impact and applications edit 
AI has the potential for a societal transformation  which may include enabling the expansion of noncommercial niche genres  such as cyberpunk derivatives like solarpunk  by amateurs  novel entertainment  fast prototyping              increasing art making accessibility              and artistic output per effort or expenses or time             e g   via generating drafts  draft definitions  and image components  inpainting   Generated images are sometimes used as sketches              low cost experiments              inspiration  or illustrations of proof of concept stage ideas  Additional functionalities or improvements may also relate to post generation manual editing  i e   polishing   such as subsequent tweaking with an image editor             

Prompt engineering and sharing edit

An example of prompt usage for text to image generation  using Fooocus
Prompts for some text to image models can also include images and keywords and configurable parameters  such as artistic style  which is often used via keyphrases like  in the style of  name of an artist   in the prompt              or selection of a broad aesthetic art style                          There are platforms for sharing  trading  searching  forking refining  or collaborating on prompts for generating specific imagery from image generators                                                  Prompts are often shared along with images on image sharing websites such as Reddit and AI art dedicated websites  A prompt is not the complete input needed for the generation of an image  additional inputs that determine the generated image include the output resolution  random seed  and random sampling parameters             

Related terminology edit 
Synthetic media  which includes AI art  was described in      as a major technology driven trend that will affect business in the coming years              Harvard Kennedy School researchers voiced concerns about synthetic media serving as a vector for political misinformation soon after studying the proliferation of AI art on the X platform               Synthography is a proposed term for the practice of generating images that are similar to photographs using AI              

Impact edit 
Bias edit 
Further information  Algorithmic bias
A major concern raised about AI generated images and art is sampling bias within model training data leading towards discriminatory output from AI art models  In       University of Washington researchers found evidence of racial bias within the Stable Diffusion model  with images of a  person  corresponding most frequently with images of males from Europe or North America              
Looking more into the sampling bias found within AI training data  in       researchers at Princeton University used AI software to link over   million words  finding that European names were viewed as more  pleasant  than African Americans names  and that the words  woman  and  girl  were more likely to be associated with the arts instead of science and math   which were most likely connected to males                Generative AI models typically work based on user entered word based prompts  especially in the case of diffusion models  and this word related bias may lead to biased results 
Along with this  generative AI can perpetuate harmful stereotypes regarding women  For example  Lensa  an AI app that trended on TikTok in       was known to lighten black skin  make users thinner  and generate hypersexualized images of women               Melissa Heikkil   a senior reporter at MIT Technology Review  shared the findings of an experiment using Lensa  noting that the generated avatars did not resemble her and often depicted her in a hypersexualized manner               Experts suggest that such outcomes can result from biases in the datasets used to train AI models  which can sometimes contain imbalanced representations  including hypersexual or nude imagery                           
In       Google s chatbot Gemini s AI image generator was criticized for perceived racial bias  with claims that Gemini deliberately underrepresented white people in its results               Users reported that it generated images of white historical figures like the Founding Fathers  Nazi soldiers  and Vikings as other races  and that it refused to process prompts such as  happy white people  and  ideal nuclear family                             Google later apologized for  missing the mark  and took Gemini s image generator offline for updates               This prompted discussions about the ethical implications              of representing historical figures through a contemporary lens  leading critics to argue that these outputs could mislead audiences regarding actual historical contexts               In addition to the well documented representational issues such as racial and gender bias  some scholars have also pointed out deeper conceptual assumptions that shape how we perceive AI generated art  For instance  framing AI strictly as a passive tool overlooks how cultural and technological factors influence its outputs  Others suggest viewing AI as part of a collaborative creative process  where both human and machine contribute to the artistic result              

Copyright edit 
Further information  Artificial intelligence and copyright
Legal scholars  artists  and media corporations have considered the legal and ethical implications of artificial intelligence art since the   th century  Some artists use AI art to critique and explore the ethics of using gathered data to produce new artwork              
In       intellectual property law professor Pamela Samuelson argued that US copyright should allocate algorithmically generated artworks to the user of the computer program               A      Florida Law Review article presented three perspectives on the issue  In the first  artificial intelligence itself would become the copyright owner  to do this  Section     of the US Copyright Act would need to be amended to define  author  as a computer  In the second  following Samuelson s argument  the user  programmer  or artificial intelligence company would be the copyright owner  This would be an expansion of the  work for hire  doctrine  under which ownership of a copyright is transferred to the  employer   In the third situation  copyright assignments would never take place  and such works would be in the public domain  as copyright assignments require an act of authorship              
In       coinciding with the rising availability of consumer grade AI image generation services  popular discussion renewed over the legality and ethics of AI generated art  A particular topic is the inclusion of copyrighted artwork and images in AI training datasets  with artists objecting to commercial AI products using their works without consent  credit  or financial compensation               In September       Reema Selhi  of the Design and Artists Copyright Society  stated that  there are no safeguards for artists to be able to identify works in databases that are being used and opt out                Some have claimed that images generated with these models can bear resemblance to extant artwork  sometimes including the remains of the original artist s signature                            In December       users of the portfolio platform ArtStation staged an online protest against non consensual use of their artwork within datasets  this resulted in opt out services  such as  Have I Been Trained   increasing in profile  as well as some online art platforms promising to offer their own opt out options               According to the US Copyright Office  artificial intelligence programs are unable to hold copyright                                         a decision upheld at the Federal District level as of August      followed the reasoning from the monkey selfie copyright dispute              
OpenAI  the developer of DALL E  has its own policy on who owns generated art  They assign the right and title of a generated image to the creator  meaning the user who inputted the prompt owns the image generated  along with the right to sell  reprint  and merchandise it              
In January       three artists Sarah Andersen  Kelly McKernan  and Karla Ortiz filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Stability AI  Midjourney  and DeviantArt  claiming that it is legally required to obtain the consent of artists before training neural nets on their work and that these companies infringed on the rights of millions of artists by doing so on five billion images scraped from the web               In July       U S  District Judge William Orrick was inclined to dismiss most of the lawsuits filed by Andersen  McKernan  and Ortiz  but allowed them to file a new complaint               Also in       Stability AI was sued by Getty Images for using its images in the training data               A tool built by Simon Willison allowed people to search      of the training data for Stable Diffusion V     i e      million of the     billion instances from LAION  B  Artist Karen Hallion discovered that her copyrighted images were used as training data without their consent              
In March       Tennessee enacted the ELVIS Act  which prohibits the use of AI to mimic a musician s voice without permission               A month later in that year  Adam Schiff introduced the Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act which  if passed  would require that AI companies to submit copyrighted works in their datasets to the Register of Copyrights before releasing new generative AI systems               In November       a group of artists and activists shared early access to OpenAI s unreleased video generation model  Sora  via Huggingface  The action  accompanied by a statement  criticized the exploitative use of artists  work by major corporations                                         

Deception edit 
As with other types of photo manipulation since the early   th century  some people in the early   st century have been concerned that AI could be used to create content that is misleading and can be made to damage a person s reputation  such as deepfakes               Artist Sarah Andersen  who previously had her art copied and edited to depict Neo Nazi beliefs  stated that the spread of hate speech online can be worsened by the use of image generators               Some also generate images or videos for the purpose of catfishing 

AI systems have the ability to create deepfake content  which is often viewed as harmful and offensive  The creation of deepfakes poses a risk to individuals who have not consented to it               This mainly refers to deepfake pornography which is used as revenge porn  where sexually explicit material is disseminated to humiliate or harm another person  AI generated child pornography has been deemed a potential danger to society due to its unlawful nature

After winning the       Creative   Open competition  Sony World Photography Awards  Boris Eldagsen stated that his entry was actually created with artificial intelligence  Photographer Feroz Khan commented to the BBC that Eldagsen had  clearly shown that even experienced photographers and art experts can be fooled                Smaller contests have been affected as well  in       a contest run by author Mark Lawrence as Self Published Fantasy Blog Off was cancelled after the winning entry was allegedly exposed to be a collage of images generated with Midjourney              
In May       on social media sites such as Reddit and Twitter  attention was given to a Midjourney generated image of Pope Francis wearing a white puffer coat                            Additionally  an AI generated image of an attack on the Pentagon went viral as part of a hoax news story on Twitter                           
In the days before March      indictment of Donald Trump as part of the Stormy Daniels Donald Trump scandal  several AI generated images allegedly depicting Trump s arrest went viral online                            On March     British journalist Eliot Higgins generated various images of Donald Trump being arrested or imprisoned using Midjourney v  and posted them on Twitter  two images of Trump struggling against arresting officers went viral under the mistaken impression that they were genuine  accruing more than   million views in three days                            According to Higgins  the images were not meant to mislead  but he was banned from using Midjourney services as a result  As of April       the tweet had garnered more than     million views 
In February       the paper Cellular functions of spermatogonial stem cells in relation to JAK STAT signaling pathway was published using AI generated images  It was later retracted from Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology because the paper  does not meet the standards               
To mitigate some deceptions  OpenAI developed a tool in      to detect images that were generated by DALL E                 In testing  this tool accurately identified DALL E   generated images approximately     of the time  The tool is also fairly capable of recognizing images that have been visually modified by users post generation

As generative AI image software such as Stable Diffusion and DALL E continue to advance  the potential problems and concerns that these systems pose for creativity and artistry have risen               In       artists working in various media raised concerns about the impact that generative artificial intelligence could have on their ability to earn money  particularly if AI based images started replacing artists working in the illustration and design industries                            In August       digital artist R  J  Palmer stated that  I could easily envision a scenario where using AI  a single artist or art director could take the place of      entry level artists    I have seen a lot of self published authors and such say how great it will be that they don t have to hire an artist                Scholars Jiang et al  state that  Leaders of companies like Open AI and Stability AI have openly stated that they expect generative AI systems to replace creatives imminently                A      case study found that AI produced images created by technology like DALL E caused some traditional artists to be concerned about losing work  while others use it to their advantage and view it as a tool              
AI based images have become more commonplace in art markets and search engines because AI based text to image systems are trained from pre existing artistic images  sometimes without the original artist s consent  allowing the software to mimic specific artists  styles                            For example  Polish digital artist Greg Rutkowski has stated that it is more difficult to search for his work online because many of the images in the results are AI generated specifically to mimic his style              Furthermore  some training databases on which AI systems are based are not accessible to the public 
The ability of AI based art software to mimic or forge artistic style also raises concerns of malice or greed                                         Works of AI generated art  such as Th  tre D op ra Spatial  a text to image AI illustration that won the grand prize in the August      digital art competition at the Colorado State Fair  have begun to overwhelm art contests and other submission forums meant for small artists                                         The Netflix short film The Dog  amp  the Boy  released in January       received backlash online for its use of artificial intelligence art to create the film s background artwork               Within the same vein  Disney released Secret Invasion  a Marvel TV show with an AI generated intro  on Disney  in       causing concern and backlash regarding the idea that artists could be made obsolete by machine learning tools              

AI generated art used at the entrance of a school
AI art has sometimes been deemed to be able to replace traditional stock images               In       Shutterstock announced a beta test of an AI tool that can regenerate partial content of other Shutterstock s images  Getty Images and Nvidia have partnered with the launch of Generative AI by iStock  a model trained on Getty s library and iStock s photo library using Nvidia s Picasso model              

Power usage edit 
In this      comic  H  T  Webster humorously imagines the life of a cartoonist in       when machines powered by electricity can produce and execute ideas for cartoons 
Researchers from Hugging Face and Carnegie Mellon University reported in a      paper that generating one thousand           images using Stable Diffusion s XL     base model requires       kWh of energy and generates       grams            oz  of carbon dioxide  which is roughly equivalent to driving an average gas powered car a distance of     miles           km   Comparing    different models  the paper concluded that image generation models used on average around          kWh of energy per       inferences              

Analysis of existing art using AI edit 
In addition to the creation of original art  research methods that use AI have been generated to quantitatively analyze digital art collections  This has been made possible due to the large scale digitization of artwork in the past few decades  According to CETINIC and SHE         using artificial intelligence to analyze already existing art collections can provide new perspectives on the development of artistic styles and the identification of artistic influences                           
Two computational methods  close reading and distant viewing  are the typical approaches used to analyze digitized art               Close reading focuses on specific visual aspects of one piece  Some tasks performed by machines in close reading methods include computational artist authentication and analysis of brushstrokes or texture properties  In contrast  through distant viewing methods  the similarity across an entire collection for a specific feature can be statistically visualized  Common tasks relating to this method include automatic classification  object detection  multimodal tasks  knowledge discovery in art history  and computational aesthetics               Synthetic images can also be used to train AI algorithms for art authentication and to detect forgeries              
Researchers have also introduced models that predict emotional responses to art  One such model is ArtEmis  a large scale dataset paired with machine learning models  ArtEmis includes emotional annotations from over       participants along with textual explanations  By analyzing both visual inputs and the accompanying text descriptions from this dataset  ArtEmis enables the generation of nuanced emotional predictions                           

Other forms of art edit 
AI has also been used in arts outside of visual arts  Generative AI has been used in video game production beyond imagery  especially for level design  e g   for custom maps  and creating new content  e g   quests or dialogue  or interactive stories in video games                            AI has also been used in the literary arts               such as helping with writer s block  inspiration  or rewriting segments                                                      In the culinary arts  some prototype cooking robots can dynamically taste  which can assist chefs in analyzing the content and flavor of dishes during the cooking process
