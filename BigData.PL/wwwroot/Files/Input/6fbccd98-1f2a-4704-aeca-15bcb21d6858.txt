Kevin Warwick  born   February       is an English engineer and Deputy Vice Chancellor  Research  at Coventry University             He is known for his studies on direct interfaces between computer systems and the human nervous system  and has also done research concerning robotics                        


Biography edit 
Kevin Warwick was born in      in Keresley  Coventry  England              and was raised in the nearby village of Ryton on Dunsmore  Warwickshire  His family attended a Methodist church but soon he began doubting the existence of God              He attended Lawrence Sheriff School in Rugby  Warwickshire  where he was a contemporary of actor Arthur Bostrom  He left school at the age of    to start an apprenticeship with British Telecom  In       he was granted his first degree at Aston University  followed by a PhD degree and a research job at Imperial College London 
He took up positions at Somerville College in Oxford  Newcastle University  the University of Warwick  and the University of Reading  before relocating to Coventry University in      
Warwick is a Chartered Engineer  CEng   a Fellow of the Institution of Engineering and Technology  FIET  and a Fellow of the City and Guilds of London Institute  FCGI   He is Visiting Professor at the Czech Technical University in Prague  the University of Strathclyde  Bournemouth University  and the University of Reading  and in      he was Senior Beckman Fellow at the University of Illinois in the United States  He is also on the Advisory Boards of the Instinctive Computing Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University              and the Centre for Intermedia at the University of Exeter             
By the age of     Warwick had been awarded a DSc degree by both Imperial College London and the Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague  for his research output in two entirely unrelated areas  He has received the IET Achievement Medal  the IET Mountbatten Medal  and in      the Ellison Cliffe Medal from the Royal Society of Medicine              In       Warwick presented the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures  entitled The Rise of Robots             

Research edit 
Warwick performs research in artificial intelligence  biomedical engineering  control systems and robotics  Much of Warwick s early research was in the area of discrete time adaptive control  He introduced the first state space based self tuning controller             and unified discrete time state space representations of ARMA models              He has also contributed to mathematics              power engineering             and manufacturing production machinery             

Artificial intelligence edit 
Warwick directed a research project funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council  EPSRC   which investigated the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence  AI  techniques to suitably stimulate and translate patterns of electrical activity from living cultured neural networks to use the networks for the control of mobile robots              Hence the behaviour process for each robot was effectively provided by a biological brain 
Previously  Warwick helped to develop a genetic algorithm named Gershwyn  which was able to exhibit creativity in producing popular songs  learning what makes a hit record by listening to examples of previous successful songs              Gershwyn appeared on BBC s Tomorrow s World  having been successfully used to mix music for Manus  a group consisting of the four younger brothers of Elvis Costello 
Another of Warwick s projects involving AI was the robot head  Morgui  The head  which contained five  senses   vision  sound  infrared  ultrasound and radar   was used to investigate sensor data fusion  It was X rated by the University of Reading Research and Ethics Committee due to its image storage capabilities anyone under the age of    who wished to interact with the robot had to obtain parental approval             
Warwick has very outspoken opinions about the future  particularly with respect to AI and its effect on the human species  He argues that humanity will need to use technology to enhance itself to avoid being overtaken by machines              He states that many human limitations  such as sensorimotor abilities  can be outperformed by machines  and he has said on record that he wants to gain these abilities   There is no way I want to stay a mere human              

Bioethics edit 
Warwick directed the University of Reading team in a number of European Community projects such as  FIDIS  Future of Identity in the Information Society   researching the future of identity  and ETHICBOTS and RoboLaw  both of which considered the ethical aspects of robots and cyborgs             
Warwick s topics of interest have many ethical implications  some due to his human enhancement experiments              The ethical dilemmas of his research are used by the Institute of Physics as a case study             for schoolchildren and science teachers as a part of their formal Advanced level and GCSE studies  His work has also been discussed by the USA President s Council on Bioethics and the USA President s Panel on Forward Engagements              He is a member of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics Working Party on Novel Neurotechnologies             

Deep brain stimulation edit 
Along with Tipu Aziz and his team at John Radcliffe Hospital  Oxford  and John Stein of the University of Oxford  Warwick is helping to design the next generation of deep brain stimulation for Parkinson s disease              Instead of stimulating the brain all the time  the goal is for the device to predict when stimulation is needed and to apply the signals prior to any tremors occurring  thereby stopping tremors before they start              Recent results have also shown that it is possible to identify different types of Parkinson s Disease             

Public awareness edit 
Warwick has directed a number of projects intended to interest schoolchildren in the technology with which he is involved  In       he received the EPSRC Millennium Award for his Schools Robot League  In          school teams were involved in a project to design a humanoid robot to dance and then complete an assault course  with the final competition staged at the Science Museum  London  The project  entitled  Androids Advance  was funded by EPSRC and was presented as a news item by Chinese television             
Warwick contributes significantly to the public understanding of science by giving regular public lectures  participating with radio programmes  and through popular writing  He has appeared in numerous television documentary programmes on AI  robotics and the role of science fiction in science  such as How William Shatner Changed the World  Future Fantastic and Explorations                          He also appeared in the Ray Kurzweil inspired movie Transcendent Man along with William Shatner  Colin Powell  and Stevie Wonder  He has guested on several television talk shows  including Late Night with Conan O Brien  F rst  amp  sist  Sunday Brunch and Richard  amp  Judy              He has appeared on the cover of a number of magazines  for example the February      edition of Wired             
In       Warwick was the subject of an early day motion tabled by members of the UK Parliament  in which he was congratulated for his work in attracting students to science and for teaching  in a way that makes the subject interesting and relevant so that more students will want to develop a career in science              
In       Warwick was interviewed about his work in cybernetics for two documentary features on the DVD release of the      Doctor Who story Attack of the Cybermen              He was also an interview subject for the televised lecture The Science of Doctor Who in      
In       Warwick appeared as a guest on BBC Radio   s The Museum of Curiosity with Robert Llewellyn and Cleo Rocos              In       he appeared on BBC Radio   s Midweek with Libby Purves  Roger Bannister and Rachael Stirling             

Robotics edit 
Warwick s claims that robots can program themselves to avoid each other while operating in a group raise the issue of self organisation  In particular  the works of Francisco Varela and Humberto Maturana  once purely speculative have now become immediately relevant with respect to synthetic intelligence 
Cyborg type systems  if they are to survive  need to be not only homeostatic  meaning that they are able to preserve stable internal conditions in various environments  but also adaptive  Testing the claims of Varela and Maturana using synthetic devices is the more serious concern in the discussion about Warwick and those involved in similar research   Pulling the plug  on independent devices cannot be as simple as it appears  because if the device displays sufficient intelligence  and assumes a diagnostic and prognostic stature  we may ultimately one day be forced to decide between what it could be telling us as counterintuitive  but correct  and our impulse to disconnect because of our limited and  intuitive  perceptions 
Warwick s robots seemed to exhibit behaviour not anticipated by the research  one such robot  committing suicide  because it could not cope with its environment              In a more complex setting  it may be asked whether a  natural selection  might be possible  neural networks being the major operative 
The      edition of the Guinness Book of Records recorded that Warwick performed the first robot learning experiment using the Internet              One robot  with an artificial neural network brain at the University of Reading in the UK  learned how to move around without bumping into things  It then taught  via the Internet  another robot at SUNY Buffalo in New York State to behave in the same way              The robot in the US was therefore not taught or programmed by a human  but rather by another robot based on what it had itself learnt             
Hissing Sid was a robot cat that Warwick took on a British Council lecture tour of Russia  where he presented it in lectures at such places as Moscow State University  The robot was put together as a student project  its name came from the noise made by the pneumatic actuators used to drive its legs when walking  Hissing Sid also appeared on BBC TV s Blue Peter but became more well known when it was refused a ticket by British Airways on the grounds that they did not allow animals in the cabin             
Warwick was also responsible for a robotic  magic chair   based on the SCARA form UMI RTX arm              used on BBC TV s Jim ll Fix It  The chair provided the show s host Jimmy Savile with tea and stored Jim ll Fix It badges for him to hand out to guests              Warwick appeared on the programme himself for a Fix it involving robots             
Warwick was also involved in the development of the  Seven Dwarves  robots  a version of which was sold in kit form as  Cybot  on the cover of Real Robots magazine in       The magazine series guided its readers through the stages of building and programming Cybot  an artificially intelligent robot capable of making its own decisions and thinking for itself             

Project Cyborg edit 
Probably the most famous research undertaken by Warwick and the origin of the nickname  Captain Cyborg                                   given to him by The Register is the set of experiments known as Project Cyborg  in which an array was implanted into his arm  with the goal of him  becoming a cyborg              
The first stage of Project Cyborg  which began on    August       involved a simple RFID transmitter being implanted beneath Warwick s skin  which was used to control doors  lights  heaters  and other computer controlled devices based on his proximity              He explained that the main purpose of this experiment was to test the limits of what the body would accept  and how easy it would be to receive a meaningful signal from the microprocessor             
The second stage of the research involved a more complex neural interface  designed and built especially for the experiment by Dr  Mark Gasson and his team at the University of Reading  This device consisted of a BrainGate sensor  a silicon square about  mm wide  connected to an external  gauntlet  that housed supporting electronics  It was implanted under local anaesthetic on    March      at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford  where it was interfaced directly into Warwick s nervous system via the median nerve in his left wrist  The microelectrode array that was inserted contained     electrodes  each the width of a human hair  of which    could be accessed at any one time  whereas the nerve that was being monitored carries many times that number of signals  The experiment proved successful  and the output signals were detailed enough to enable a robot arm  developed by Warwick s colleague Dr  Peter Kyberd  to mimic the actions of Warwick s own arm                         
By means of the implant  Warwick s nervous system was connected to the Internet at Columbia University  New York  From there he was able to control the robot arm at the University of Reading and obtain feedback from sensors in the finger tips  He also successfully connected ultrasonic sensors on a baseball cap and experienced a form of extrasensory input             
In a highly publicised extension to the experiment  a simpler array was implanted into the arm of Warwick s wife  with the ultimate aim of one day creating a form of telepathy or empathy using the Internet to communicate the signal over huge distances  This experiment resulted in the first direct and purely electronic communication between the nervous systems of two humans              Finally  the effect of the implant on Warwick s hand function was measured using the University of Southampton s Hand Assessment Procedure  SHAP               There was a fear that directly interfacing with the nervous system might cause some form of damage or interference  but no measurable side effect  nor any sign of rejection  was encountered 

Implications edit 
Warwick and his colleagues claim that the Project Cyborg research could result in new medical tools for treating patients with damage to the nervous system  as well as assisting the more ambitious enhancements Warwick advocates  Some transhumanists even speculate that similar technologies could be used for technology facilitated telepathy             

Tracking device edit 
A controversy began in August       shortly after the Soham murders  when Warwick reportedly offered to implant a tracking device into an    year old girl as an anti abduction measure  The plan produced a mixed reaction  with endorsement from many worried parents but ethical concerns from children s societies              As a result  the idea did not go ahead 
Anti theft RFID chips are common in jewellery or clothing in some Latin American countries due to a high abduction rate              and the company VeriChip announced plans in      to expand its line of available medical information implants              to be GPS trackable when combined with a separate GPS device                         

Turing test edit 
Warwick in February     
Warwick in June     
Warwick participated as a Turing Interrogator on two occasions  judging machines in the      and      Loebner Prize competitions  platforms for an  imitation game  as devised by Alan Turing  The      Prize  held at the London Science Museum  featured Turing s  jury service  or one to one Turing tests and was won by A L I C E  The      contest staged  parallel paired  Turing tests at University College London and the winner was Rollo Carpenter  Warwick co organised the      Loebner Prize at the University of Reading  which also featured parallel paired Turing tests             
In       he co organised with Huma Shah a series of Turing tests held at Bletchley Park  According to Warwick  the tests strictly adhered to the statements made by Alan Turing in his papers  Warwick himself participated in the tests as a hidden human              Results of the tests were discussed in a number of academic papers                          One paper  entitled  Human Misidentification in Turing Tests   became one of the top three most downloaded papers in the Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence 
In June       Warwick helped Shah stage a series of Turing tests to mark the   th anniversary of Alan Turing s death  The event was performed at the Royal Society  London  Warwick regarded the winning chatbot   Eugene Goostman   as having  passed the Turing test for the first time  by fooling a third of the event s judges into making an incorrect identification  and termed this a  milestone               A paper containing all of the transcripts involving Eugene Goostman entitled  Can Machines Think  A Report on Turing Test Experiments at the Royal Society   has also become one of the top three most downloaded papers in the Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence             
Warwick was criticised in the context of the      Royal Society event  where he claimed that software program Eugene Goostman had passed the Turing test on the basis of its performance  The software successfully convinced over     of the judges who could not identify it as being a machine  on the basis of a five minute text chat  Critics stated that the software s claim of being a young non native English speaker weakened the spirit of the test  as any grammatical and semantic inconsistencies could be excused as a consequence of limited proficiency in the English language                                                  Some critics also claimed that the software s performance had been exceeded by other programs in the past                          However  the      tests were entirely unrestricted in terms of discussion topics  whereas the previous tests referenced by the critics had been limited to very specific subject areas  Additionally  Warwick was criticised by editor and entrepreneur Mike Masnick for exaggerating the significance of the Eugene Goostman program to the press             

Other work edit 
Warwick was a member of the      Higher Education Funding Council for England  unit     Research Assessment Exercise panel on Electrical and Electronic Engineering and was Deputy chairman for the same panel  unit     in                   In March       he was cited as being the inspiration of National Young Scientist of the Year  Peter Hatfield             

Royal Institution Christmas Lectures edit 
Warwick presented the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures in December       entitled Rise of the Robots  Although the lectures were well received by some              British computer scientist Simon Colton complained about the choice of Warwick prior to his appearance  He claimed that Warwick  is not a spokesman for our subject   Artificial Intelligence  and  allowing him influence through the Christmas lectures is a danger to the public perception of science               In response to Warwick s claims that computers could be creative  Colton  who is a Professor of Computational Creativity  also said   the AI community has done real science to reclaim words such as creativity and emotion which they claim computers will never have               Subsequent letters were generally positive  Ralph Rayner wrote   With my youngest son  I attended all of the lectures and found them balanced and thought provoking  They were not sensationalist  I applaud Warwick for his lectures              

Awards and recognition edit 
Warwick received the Future Health Technology Award in                   and was presented with the Institution of Engineering and Technology  IET  Achievement Medal in                   In       he was awarded the Mountbatten Medal              In      he received the Marcellin Champagnat award from Universidad Marista Guadalajara and the Golden Eurydice Award              In      he received the Ellison Cliffe Medal from the Royal Society of Medicine              In       he was elected to the membership of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts              In      Warwick was inducted into the International Academy for Systems and Cybernetic Sciences             and in      he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the Cybernetics Society             
He is the recipient of ten honorary doctorates  these being from Aston University              Coventry University                         Robert Gordon University              Bradford University                          University of Bedfordshire              Portsmouth University              Kingston University              Ss  Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje              Edinburgh Napier University               and Galgotias University                           

Reception edit 
Warwick has both his critics and endorsers  some of whom describe him as a  maverick                Others see his work as  not very scientific  and more like  entertainment   whereas some regard him as  an extraordinarily creative experimenter   his presentations as  awesome  and his work as  profound
