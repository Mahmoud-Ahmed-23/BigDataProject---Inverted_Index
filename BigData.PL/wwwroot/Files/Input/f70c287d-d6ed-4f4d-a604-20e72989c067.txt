The General Data Protection Regulation  Regulation  EU                        abbreviated GDPR  is a European Union regulation on information privacy in the European Union  EU  and the European Economic Area  EEA   The GDPR is an important component of EU privacy law and human rights law  in particular Article      of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union  It also governs the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA  The GDPR s goals are to enhance individuals  control and rights over their personal information and to simplify the regulations for international business              It supersedes the Data Protection Directive       EC and  among other things  simplifies the terminology 
The European Parliament and Council of the European Union adopted the GDPR on    April       to become effective on    May       As an EU regulation  instead of a directive   the GDPR has direct legal effect and does not require transposition into national law  However  it also provides flexibility for individual member states to modify  derogate from  some of its provisions 
As an example of the Brussels effect  the regulation became a model for many other laws around the world  including in Brazil  Japan  Singapore  South Africa  South Korea  Sri Lanka  and Thailand      citation needed                 After leaving the European Union the United Kingdom enacted its  UK GDPR   identical to the GDPR             The California Consumer Privacy Act  CCPA   adopted on    June       has many similarities with the GDPR            


Contents edit 
The GDPR      has eleven chapters  concerning general provisions  principles  rights of the data subject  duties of data controllers or processors  transfers of personal data to third countries  supervisory authorities  cooperation among member states  remedies  liability or penalties for breach of rights  provisions related to specific processing situations  and miscellaneous final provisions  Recital   proclaims that  processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind  

General provisions edit 
The regulation applies if the data controller  an organisation that collects information about living people  whether they are in the EU or not   or processor  an organisation that processes data on behalf of a data controller like cloud service providers   or the data subject  person  is based in the EU  Under certain circumstances             the regulation also applies to organisations based outside the EU if they collect or process personal data of individuals located inside the EU  The regulation does not apply to the processing of data by a person for a  purely personal or household activity and thus with no connection to a professional or commercial activity    Recital     
According to the European Commission   Personal data is information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual  If you cannot directly identify an individual from that information  then you need to consider whether the individual is still identifiable  You should take into account the information you are processing together with all the means reasonably likely to be used by either you or any other person to identify that individual              The precise definitions of terms such as  personal data    processing    data subject    controller   and  processor  are stated in Article                          Art          
The regulation does not purport to apply to the processing of personal data for national security activities or law enforcement of the EU  however  industry groups concerned about facing a potential conflict of laws have questioned whether Article    could be invoked to seek to prevent a data controller subject to a third country s laws from complying with a legal order from that country s law enforcement  judicial  or national security authorities to disclose to such authorities the personal data of an EU person  regardless of whether the data resides in or out of the EU  Article    states that any judgement of a court or tribunal and any decision of an administrative authority of a third country requiring a controller or processor to transfer or disclose personal data may not be recognised or enforceable in any manner unless based on an international agreement  like a mutual legal assistance treaty in force between the requesting third  non EU  country and the EU or a member state  The data protection reform package also includes a separate Data Protection Directive for the police and criminal justice sector that provides rules on personal data exchanges at State level  Union level  and international levels            
A single set of rules applies to all EU member states  Each member state establishes an independent supervisory authority  SA  to hear and investigate complaints  sanction administrative offences  etc                        Arts               SAs in each member state co operate with other SAs  providing mutual assistance and organising joint operations  If a business has multiple establishments in the EU  it must have a single SA as its  lead authority   based on the location of its  main establishment  where the main processing activities take place  The lead authority thus acts as a  one stop shop  to supervise all the processing activities of that business throughout the EU                         A European Data Protection Board  EDPB  co ordinates the SAs  EDPB thus replaces the Article    Data Protection Working Party  There are exceptions for data processed in an employment context or in national security that still might be subject to individual country regulations                        Arts       a   amp           

Principles and lawful purposes edit 
Article   sets out six principles relating to the lawfulness of processing personal data  The first of these specifies that data must be processed lawfully  fairly and in a transparent manner  Article   develops this principle by specifying that personal data may not be processed unless there is at least one legal basis for doing so  The other principles refer to   purpose limitation    data minimisation    accuracy    storage limitation   and  integrity and confidentiality  
Article   states that the lawful purposes are 

 a  If the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data 
 b  To fulfill contractual obligations with a data subject  or for tasks at the request of a data subject who is in the process of entering into a contract 
 c  To comply with a data controller s legal obligations 
 d  To protect the vital interests of a data subject or another individual 
 e  To perform a task in the public interest or in official authority 
 f  For the legitimate interests of a data controller or a third party  unless these interests are overridden by interests of the data subject or her or his rights according to the Charter of Fundamental Rights  especially in the case of children  
If informed consent                       Art               is used as the lawful basis for processing  consent must have been explicit for data collected and each purpose data is used for                        Art           Consent must be a specific  freely given  plainly worded  and unambiguous affirmation given by the data subject  an online form which has consent options structured as an opt out selected by default is a violation of the GDPR  as the consent is not unambiguously affirmed by the user  In addition  multiple types of processing may not be  bundled  together into a single affirmation prompt  as this is not specific to each use of data  and the individual permissions are not freely given   Recital     
Data subjects must be allowed to withdraw this consent at any time  and the process of doing so must not be harder than it was to opt in                        Art              A data controller may not refuse service to users who decline consent to processing that is not strictly necessary in order to use the service                        Art           Consent for children  defined in the regulation as being less than    years old  although with the option for member states to individually make it as low as    years old   must be given by the child s parent or custodian  and verifiable                         
If consent to processing was already provided under the Data Protection Directive  a data controller does not have to re obtain consent if the processing is documented and obtained in compliance with the GDPR s requirements  Recital                              

Rights of the data subject edit 
Transparency and modalities edit 
Article    requires the data controller to provide information to the  data subject in a concise  transparent  intelligible and easily accessible form  using clear and plain language  in particular for any information addressed specifically to a child  

Information and access edit 
The right of access  Article     is a data subject right              It gives people the right to access their personal data and information about how this personal data is being processed  A data controller must provide  upon request  an overview of the categories of data that are being processed                       Art        b         as well as a copy of the actual data                        Art               furthermore  the data controller has to inform the data subject on details about the processing  such as the purposes of the processing                        Art        a         with whom the data is shared                        Art        c         and how it acquired the data                        Art        g        
A data subject must be able to transfer personal data from one electronic processing system to and into another  without being prevented from doing so by the data controller  Data that has been sufficiently anonymised is excluded  but data that has been only de identified but remains possible to link to the individual in question  such as by providing the relevant identifier  is not              In practice  however  providing such identifiers can be challenging  such as in the case of Apple s Siri  where voice and transcript data is stored with a personal identifier that the manufacturer restricts access to              or in online behavioural targeting  which relies heavily on device fingerprints that can be challenging to capture  send  and verify             
Both data being  provided  by the data subject and data being  observed   such as about behaviour  are included  In addition  the data must be provided by the controller in a structured and commonly used standard electronic format  The right to data portability is provided by Article    

Rectification and erasure edit 
A right to be forgotten was replaced by a more limited right of erasure in the version of the GDPR that was adopted by the European Parliament in March                               Article    provides that the data subject has the right to request erasure of personal data related to them on any one of a number of grounds  including noncompliance with Article       lawfulness  that includes a case  f  if the legitimate interests of the controller are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject  which require protection of personal data  see also Google Spain SL  Google Inc  v Agencia Espa ola de Protecci n de Datos  Mario Costeja Gonz lez              

Right to object and automated decisions edit 
Article    of the GDPR allows an individual to object to processing personal information for marketing or non service related purposes              This means the data controller must allow an individual the right to stop or prevent controller from processing their personal data 
There are some instances where this objection does not apply  For example  if 

Legal or official authority is being carried out
 Legitimate interest   where the organisation needs to process data in order to provide the data subject with a service they signed up for
A task being carried out for public interest 
GDPR is also clear that the data controller must inform individuals of their right to object from the first communication the controller has with them  This should be clear and separate from any other information the controller is providing and give them their options for how best to object to the processing of their data 
There are instances the controller can refuse a request  in the circumstances that the objection request is  manifestly unfounded  or  excessive   so each case of objection must be looked at individually              Other countries such as Canada              are also  following the GDPR  considering legislation to regulate automated decision making under privacy laws  even though there are policy questions as to whether this is the best way to regulate AI      citation needed     

Right to compensation edit 
Article    of the GDPR stipulates that any person who has suffered material or non material damage as a result of an infringement of this Regulation shall have the right to receive compensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered 
In the judgment  sterreichische Post  C         the Court of Justice of the European Union gave an interpretation of the right to compensation               Article       GDPR requires for the award of damages  i  an infringement of the GDPR   ii   actual  damage suffered and  iii  a causal link between the infringement and the damage suffered  It is not necessary that the damage suffered reaches a certain degree of seriousness  There is no European defined concept of damage  Compensation is determined nationally in accordance with national law  The principles of equivalence and effectiveness must be taken into account

Controller and processor edit 
Data controllers must clearly disclose any data collection  declare the lawful basis and purpose for data processing  and state how long data is being retained and if it is being shared with any third parties or outside of the EEA  Firms have the obligation to protect data of employees and consumers to the degree where only the necessary data is extracted with minimum interference with data privacy from employees  consumers  or third parties  Firms should have internal controls and regulations for various departments such as audit  internal controls  and operations  Data subjects have the right to request a portable copy of the data collected by a controller in a common format  as well as the right to have their data erased under certain circumstances  Public authorities  and businesses whose core activities consist of regular or systematic processing of personal data  are required to employ a data protection officer  DPO   who is responsible for managing compliance with the GDPR  Data controllers must report data breaches to national supervisory authorities within    hours if they have an adverse effect on user privacy  In some cases  violators of the GDPR may be fined up to     million or up to    of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise  whichever is greater 
To be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR  the data controller must implement measures that meet the principles of data protection by design and by default  Article    requires data protection measures to be designed into the development of business processes for products and services  Such measures include pseudonymising personal data  by the controller  as soon as possible  Recital      It is the responsibility and the liability of the data controller to implement effective measures and be able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities even if the processing is carried out by a data processor on behalf of the controller  Recital      When data is collected  data subjects must be clearly informed about the extent of data collection  the legal basis for the processing of personal data  how long data is retained  if data is being transferred to a third party and or outside the EU  and any automated decision making that is made on a solely algorithmic basis  Data subjects must be informed of their privacy rights under the GDPR   including their right to revoke consent to data processing at any time  their right to view their personal data and access an overview of how it is being processed  their right to obtain a portable copy of the stored data  their right to erasure of their data under certain circumstances  their right to contest any automated decision making that was made on a solely algorithmic basis  and their right to file complaints with a Data Protection Authority  As such  the data subject must also be provided with contact details for the data controller and their designated data protection officer  where applicable                         
Data protection impact assessments  Article     have to be conducted when specific risks occur to the rights and freedoms of data subjects  Risk assessment and mitigation is required and prior approval of the data protection authorities is required for high risks 
Article    requires data protection to be designed into the development of business processes for products and services  Privacy settings must therefore be set at a high level by default  and technical and procedural measures shall be taken by the controller to make sure that the processing  throughout the whole processing lifecycle  complies with the regulation  Controllers shall also implement mechanisms to ensure that personal data is not processed unless necessary for each specific purpose   This is known as data minimisation 
A report             by the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security elaborates on what needs to be done to achieve privacy and data protection by default  It specifies that encryption and decryption operations must be carried out locally  not by remote service  because both keys and data must remain in the power of the data owner if any privacy is to be achieved  The report specifies that outsourced data storage on remote clouds is practical and relatively safe if only the data owner  not the cloud service  holds the decryption keys 

Pseudonymisation edit 
According to the GDPR  pseudonymisation is a required process for stored data that transforms personal data in such a way that the resulting data cannot be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information  as an alternative to the other option of complete data anonymisation               An example is encryption  which renders the original data unintelligible in a process that cannot be reversed without access to the correct decryption key  The GDPR requires for the additional information  such as the decryption key  to be kept separately from the pseudonymised data 
Another example of pseudonymisation is tokenisation  which is a non mathematical approach to protecting data at rest that replaces sensitive data with non sensitive substitutes  referred to as tokens  While the tokens have no extrinsic or exploitable meaning or value  they allow for specific data to be fully or partially visible for processing and analytics while sensitive information is kept hidden  Tokenisation does not alter the type or length of data  which means it can be processed by legacy systems such as databases that may be sensitive to data length and type  This also requires much fewer computational resources to process and less storage space in databases than traditionally encrypted data 
Pseudonymisation is a privacy enhancing technology and is recommended to reduce the risks to the concerned data subjects and also to help controllers and processors to meet their data protection obligations  Recital                 

Records of processing activities edit 
According to Article    records of processing activities have to be maintained by each organisation matching one of following criteria 

employing more than     people 
the processing it carries out is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects 
the processing is not occasional 
processing includes special categories of data as referred to in Article      or personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article    
Such requirements may be modified by each EU country  The records shall be in electronic form and the controller or the processor and  where applicable  the controller s or the processor s representative  shall make the record available to the supervisory authority on request 
Records of controller shall contain all of the following information 

the name and contact details of the controller and  where applicable  the joint controller      a      the controller s representative and the data protection officer 
the purposes of the processing 
a description of the categories of data subjects and of the categories of personal data 
the categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed including recipients in third countries or international organisations 
where applicable  transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation  including the identification of that third country or international organisation and  in the case of transfers referred to in the second subparagraph of Article        the documentation of suitable safeguards 
where possible  the envisaged time limits for erasure of the different categories of data 
where possible  a general description of the technical and organisational security measures referred to in Article       
Records of processor shall contain all of the following information 

the name and contact details of the processor or processors and of each controller on behalf of which the processor is acting  and  where applicable  of the controller s or the processor s representative  and the data protection officer 
the categories of processing carried out on behalf of each controller 
where applicable  transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation  including the identification of that third country or international organisation and  in the case of transfers referred to in the second subparagraph of Article        the
documentation of suitable safeguards 
where possible  a general description of the technical and organisational security measures referred to in Article       
Security of personal data edit 
Controllers and processors of personal data must put in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to implement the data protection principles              Business processes that handle personal data must be designed and built with consideration of the principles and provide safeguards to protect data  for example  using pseudonymization or full anonymization where appropriate               Data controllers must design information systems with privacy in mind  For instance  using the highest possible privacy settings by default  so that the datasets are not publicly available by default and cannot be used to identify a subject  No personal data may be processed unless this processing is done under one of the six lawful bases specified by the regulation  consent  contract  public task  vital interest  legitimate interest or legal requirement   When the processing is based on consent the data subject has the right to revoke it at any time             
Article    states the data controller is under a legal obligation to notify the supervisory authority without undue delay unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the individuals  There is a maximum of    hours after becoming aware of the data breach to make the report  Individuals have to be notified if a high risk of an adverse impact is determined                        Art            In addition  the data processor will have to notify the controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach                        Art            However  the notice to data subjects is not required if the data controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational protection measures that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it  such as encryption                        Art           

Data protection officer edit 
See also  European Commission Data Protection Officer
Article    requires appointment of a data protection officer  If processing is carried out by a public authority  except for courts or independent judicial authorities when acting in their judicial capacity   or if processing operations involve regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale  or if processing on a large scale of special categories of data and personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences  Articles   and Article     a data protection officer  DPO  a person with expert knowledge of data protection law and practices must be designated to assist the controller or processor in monitoring their internal compliance with the Regulation 
A designated DPO can be a current member of staff of a controller or processor  or the role can be outsourced to an external person or agency through a service contract  In any case  the processing body must make sure that there is no conflict of interest in other roles or interests that a DPO may hold  The contact details for the DPO must be published by the processing organisation  for example  in a privacy notice  and registered with the supervisory authority 
The DPO is similar to a compliance officer and is also expected to be proficient at managing IT processes  data security  including dealing with cyberattacks  and other critical business continuity issues associated with the holding and processing of personal and sensitive data  The skill set required stretches beyond understanding legal compliance with data protection laws and regulations  The DPO must maintain a living data inventory of all data collected and stored on behalf of the organization              More details on the function and the role of data protection officer were given on    December       revised   April       in a guideline document             
Organisations based outside the EU must also appoint an EU based person as a representative and point of contact for their GDPR obligations                        Art            This is a distinct role from a DPO  although there is overlap in responsibilities that suggest that this role can also be held by the designated DPO             

GDPR Certification edit 
See also  European Data Protection Seal
Article    and    of the GDPR set the legal basis for formal GDPR certifications  They set the basis for two categories of certifications             

National certification schemes  whose application is limited to a single EU EEA country 
European Data Protection Seals  which are recognized by all EU and EEA jurisdictions 
According to Art     GDPR  the purpose of this certification is to demonstrate  compliance with the GDPR of processing operations by controllers and processors               There are over    references to certification in the GDPR  encompassing various obligations such as             

Adequacy of the technical and organizational measures 
Data sharing with data processors 
Data protection by design and by default 
International data transfers 
The GDPR certification also contributes to reduce the legal and financial risks of applicants  as well as of data controllers using certified data processing services             
The adoption of the European Data Protection Seals is under the responsibility of the European Data Protection Board  EDPB  and is recognized across all EU and EEA Member States             
In October       the Europrivacy certification criteria were officially recognized by the European Data Protection Board  EDPB  to serve as European Data Protection Seal              Europrivacy was developed by the European research programme and is managed by the European Centre for Certification and Privacy  ECCP  in Luxembourg 

Remedies  liability and penalties edit 
See also  GDPR fines and notices
Besides the definitions as a criminal offence according to national law following Article    GDPR the following sanctions can be imposed 

a warning in writing in cases of first and non intentional noncompliance
regular periodic data protection audits
a fine up to          million or up to    of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise  whichever is greater  if there has been an infringement of the following provisions  Article     Paragraph    
the obligations of the controller and the processor pursuant to Articles           to     and    and   
the obligations of the certification body pursuant to Articles    and   
the obligations of the monitoring body pursuant to Article      
a fine up to          million or up to    of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise  whichever is greater  if there has been an infringement of the following provisions  Article     Paragraph    amp     
the basic principles for processing  including conditions for consent  pursuant to Articles          and  
the data subjects  rights pursuant to Articles    to   
the transfers of personal data to a recipient in a third country or an international organisation pursuant to Articles    to   
any obligations pursuant to member state law adopted under Chapter IX
noncompliance with an order or a temporary or definitive limitation on processing or the suspension of data flows by the supervisory authority pursuant to Article       or failure to provide access in violation of Article      
Exemptions edit 
These are some cases which are not addressed in the GDPR specifically  thus are treated as exemptions             

Personal or household activities
Law enforcement
National security                       Art           
Conversely  an entity or more precisely an  enterprise  has to be engaged in  economic activity  to be covered by the GDPR      b      Economic activity is defined broadly under European Union competition law             

Applicability outside of the European Union edit 
The GDPR also applies to data controllers and processors outside of the European Economic Area  EEA  if they are engaged in the  offering of goods or services   regardless of whether a payment is required  to data subjects within the EEA  or are monitoring the behaviour of data subjects within the EEA  Article        The regulation applies regardless of where the processing takes place              This has been interpreted as intentionally giving GDPR extraterritorial jurisdiction for non EU establishments if they are doing business with people located in the EU  It is questionable whether the EU or its member states will in practice be able to enforce GDPR against organisations which have no establishment in the EU             

EU Representative edit 
Under Article     non EU establishments subject to GDPR are obliged to have a designee within the European Union  an  EU Representative   to serve as a point of contact for their obligations under the regulation  The EU Representative is the Controller s or Processor s contact person vis   vis European privacy supervisors and data subjects  in all matters relating to processing  to ensure compliance with this GDPR  A natural  individual  or legal  corporation  person can play the role of an EU Representative                        Art               The non EU establishment must issue a duly signed document  letter of accreditation  designating a given individual or company as its EU Representative  The said designation can only be given in writing                        Art              
An establishment s failure to designate an EU Representative is considered ignorance of the regulation and relevant obligations  which itself is a violation of the GDPR subject to fines of up to          million or up to    of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise  whichever is greater  The intentional or negligent  willful blindness  character of the infringement  failure to designate an EU Representative  may rather constitute aggravating factors                        Arts         amp         amp      a        
An establishment does not need to name an EU Representative if they only engage in occasional processing that does not include  on a large scale  processing of special categories of data as referred to in Article      of GDPR or processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article     and such processing is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons  taking into account the nature  context  scope and purposes of the processing  Non EU public authorities and bodies are equally exempted                        Art              

Third countries edit 
Chapter V of the GDPR forbids the transfer of the personal data of EU data subjects to countries outside of the EEA   known as third countries   unless appropriate safeguards are imposed  or the third country s data protection regulations are formally considered adequate by the European Commission  Article                              Binding corporate rules  standard contractual clauses for data protection issued by a Data Processing Agreement  DPA   or a scheme of binding and enforceable commitments by the data controller or processor situated in a third country  are among examples             

United Kingdom implementation edit 
Explanation of the possible results from UK s divergence from the European GDPR             The applicability of GDPR in the United Kingdom is affected by Brexit  Although the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union on    January       it remained subject to EU law  including GDPR  until the end of the transition period on    December                   The United Kingdom granted royal assent to the Data Protection Act      on    May       which augmented the GDPR  including aspects of the regulation that are to be determined by national law  and criminal offences for knowingly or recklessly obtaining  redistributing  or retaining personal data without the consent of the data controller                         
Under the European Union  Withdrawal  Act       existing and relevant EU law was transposed into UK law upon completion of the transition  and the GDPR was amended by statutory instrument to remove certain provisions no longer needed due to the UK s non membership in the EU  Thereafter  the regulation will be referred to as  UK GDPR                                       The UK will not restrict the transfer of personal data to countries within the EEA under UK GDPR  However  the UK will become a third country under the EU GDPR  meaning that personal data may not be transferred to the country unless appropriate safeguards are imposed  or the European Commission performs an adequacy decision on the suitability of British data protection legislation  Chapter V   As part of the withdrawal agreement  the European Commission committed to perform an adequacy assessment                         
In April       the UK Information Commissioner s Office  ICO  issued a children s code of practice for social networking services when used by minors  enforceable under GDPR  which also includes restrictions on  like  and  streak  mechanisms in order to discourage social media addiction and on the use of this data for processing interests                         
In March       Secretary of State for Digital  Culture  Media and Sport Oliver Dowden stated that the UK was exploring divergence from the EU GDPR in order to   focus  more on the outcomes that we want to have and less on the burdens of the rules imposed on individual businesses              

Misconceptions edit 
Some common misconceptions about GDPR include 

All processing of personal data requires consent of the data subject
In fact  data can be processed without consent if one of the other five lawful bases for processing applies  and obtaining consent may often be inappropriate             
Individuals have an absolute right to have their data deleted  right to be forgotten 
Whilst there is an absolute right to opt out of direct marketing  data controllers can continue to process personal data where they have a lawful basis to do so  as long as the data remain necessary for the purpose for which it was originally collected             
Removing individuals  names from records takes them out of scope of GDPR
 Pseudonymous  data where an individual is identified by a number can still be personal data if the data controller is capable of tying that data back to an individual in another way             
GDPR applies to anyone processing personal data of EU citizens anywhere in the world
In fact  it applies to non EU established organizations only where they are processing data of data subjects located in the EU  irrespective of their citizenship  and then only when supplying goods or services to them  or monitoring their behaviour             
Reception edit 
As per a study conducted by Deloitte in           of companies believe they are able to comply with GDPR in their business practices in the long run             
Companies operating outside of the EU have invested heavily to align their business practices with GDPR  The area of GDPR consent has a number of implications for businesses who record calls as a matter of practice  A typical disclaimer is not considered sufficient to gain assumed consent to record calls  Additionally  when recording has commenced  should the caller withdraw their consent  then the agent receiving the call must be able to stop a previously started recording and ensure the recording does not get stored             
IT professionals expect that compliance with the GDPR will require additional investment overall  over    percent of those surveyed expected GDPR related spending to be at least US                      The concerns were echoed in a report commissioned by the law firm Baker  amp  McKenzie that found that  around    percent of respondents believe that organizations will need to invest additional budget effort to comply with the consent  data mapping and cross border data transfer requirements under the GDPR               The total cost for EU companies is estimated at      billion while for US companies the estimate is for       billion              It has been argued that smaller businesses and startup companies might not have the financial resources to adequately comply with the GDPR  unlike the larger international technology firms  such as Facebook and Google  that the regulation is ostensibly meant to target first and foremost                          A lack of knowledge and understanding of the regulations has also been a concern in the lead up to its adoption              A counter argument to this has been that companies were made aware of these changes two years prior to them coming into effect and should have had enough time to prepare             
The regulations  including whether an enterprise must have a data protection officer  have been criticized for potential administrative burden and unclear compliance requirements              Although data minimisation is a requirement  with pseudonymisation being one of the possible means  the regulation provides no guidance on how or what constitutes an effective data de identification scheme  with a grey area on what would be considered as inadequate pseudonymisation subject to Section   enforcement actions                                      There is also concern regarding the implementation of the GDPR in blockchain systems  as the transparent and fixed record of blockchain transactions contradicts the very nature of the GDPR              Many media outlets have commented on the introduction of a  right to explanation  of algorithmic decisions                          but legal scholars have since argued that the existence of such a right is highly unclear without judicial tests and is limited at best                         
The GDPR has garnered support from businesses who regard it as an opportunity to improve their data management                          Mark Zuckerberg has also called it a  very positive step for the Internet               and has called for GDPR style laws to be adopted in the US              Consumer rights groups such as The European Consumer Organisation are among the most vocal proponents of the legislation              Other supporters have attributed its passage to the whistleblower Edward Snowden              Free software advocate Richard Stallman has praised some aspects of the GDPR but called for additional safeguards to prevent technology companies from  manufacturing consent              

Impact edit 
Academic experts who participated in the formulation of the GDPR wrote that the law  is the most consequential regulatory development in information policy in a generation  The GDPR brings personal data into a complex and protective regulatory regime              
Despite having had at least two years to prepare and do so  many companies and websites changed their privacy policies and features worldwide directly prior to GDPR s implementation  and customarily provided email and other notifications discussing these changes  This was criticised for resulting in a fatiguing number of communications  while experts noted that some reminder emails incorrectly asserted that new consent for data processing had to be obtained for when the GDPR took effect  any previously obtained consent to processing is valid as long as it met the regulation s requirements   Phishing scams also emerged using falsified versions of GDPR related emails  and it was also argued that some GDPR notice emails may have actually been sent in violation of anti spam laws                          In March       a provider of compliance software found that many websites operated by EU member state governments contained embedded tracking from ad technology providers                         
The deluge of GDPR related notices also inspired memes  including those surrounding privacy policy notices being delivered by atypical means  such as a Ouija board or Star Wars opening crawl   suggesting that Santa Claus s  naughty or nice  list was a violation  and a recording of excerpts from the regulation by a former BBC Radio   Shipping Forecast announcer  A blog  GDPR Hall of Shame  was also created to showcase unusual delivery of GDPR notices  and attempts at compliance that contained egregious violations of the regulation s requirements  Its author remarked that the regulation  has a lot of nitty gritty  in the weeds details  but not a lot of information about how to comply   but also acknowledged that businesses had two years to comply  making some of its responses unjustified                                                             
Research indicates that approximately     of software vulnerabilities have GDPR implications              Since Article    emphasizes breaches  not bugs  security experts advise companies to invest in processes and capabilities to identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited  including coordinated vulnerability disclosure processes                          An investigation of Android apps  privacy policies  data access capabilities  and data access behaviour has shown that numerous apps display a somewhat privacy friendlier behaviour since the GDPR was implemented  although they still retain most of their data access privileges in their code                          An investigation of the Norwegian Consumer Council into the post GDPR data subject dashboards on social media platforms  such as Google dashboard  has concluded that large social media firms deploy deceptive tactics in order to discourage their customers from sharpening their privacy settings             
On the effective date  some websites began to block visitors from EU countries entirely  including Instapaper               Unroll me               and Tribune Publishing owned newspapers  such as the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times  or redirect them to stripped down versions of their services  in the case of National Public Radio and USA Today  with limited functionality and or no advertising so that they will not be liable                                                      Some companies  such as Klout  and several online video games  ceased operations entirely to coincide with its implementation  citing the GDPR as a burden on their continued operations  especially due to the business model of the former                                         The volume of online behavioural advertising placements in Europe fell        on    May                                
In       two years after the GDPR began its implementation  the European Commission assessed that users across the EU had increased their knowledge about their rights  stating that      of the population above the age of    in the EU have heard about the GDPR and     of people heard about their national data protection authority                             The commission also found that privacy has become a competitive quality for companies which consumers are taking into account in their decisionmaking processes              

Enforcement and inconsistency edit 
Main article  GDPR fines and notices
Facebook and subsidiaries WhatsApp and Instagram  as well as Google LLC  targeting Android   were immediately sued by Max Schrems s non profit NOYB just hours after midnight on    May       for their use of  forced consent   Schrems asserts that both companies violated Article      by not presenting opt ins for data processing consent on an individualized basis  and requiring users to consent to all data processing activities  including those not strictly necessary  or would be forbidden from using the services                                                                   On    January       Google was fined     million by the French DPA for showing insufficient control  consent  and transparency over use of personal data for behavioural advertising                            In November       following a journalistic investigation into Liviu Dragnea  the Romanian DPA  ANSPDCP  used a GDPR request to demand information on the RISE Project s sources                           
In July       the British Information Commissioner s Office issued an intention to fine British Airways a record      million       of turnover  for poor security arrangements that enabled a      web skimming attack affecting around         transactions                                                                   British Airways was ultimately fined a reduced amount of    m  with the ICO noting that they had  considered both representations from BA and the economic impact of COVID    on their business before setting a final penalty               
In December       Politico reported that Ireland and Luxembourg   two smaller EU countries that have had a reputation as a tax havens and  especially in the case of Ireland  as a base for European subsidiaries of U S  big tech companies   were facing significant backlogs in their investigations of major foreign companies under GDPR  with Ireland citing the complexity of the regulation as a factor  Critics interviewed by Politico also argued that enforcement was also being hampered by varying interpretations between member states  the prioritisation of guidance over enforcement by some authorities  and a lack of cooperation between member states              
In November       Irish Council for Civil Liberties lodged a formal complaint of the Commission that it is in breach of its obligation under EU Law to carefully monitor how Ireland applies the GDPR               Until January       the Commission published a new commitment based on the complaint of ICCL              
While companies are now subject to legal obligations  there are still various inconsistencies in the practical and technical implementation of GDPR               As an example  according to the GDPR s right to access  the companies are obliged to provide data subjects with the data they gather about them  However  in a study on loyalty cards in Germany  companies did not provide the data subjects with the exact information of the purchased articles               One might argue that such companies do not collect the information of the purchased articles  which does not conform with their business models  Therefore  data subjects tend to see that as a GDPR violation  As a result  studies have suggested for a better control through authorities              
According to the GDPR  end users  consent should be valid  freely given  specific  informed and active               However  the lack of enforceability regarding obtaining lawful consents has been a challenge  As an example  a      study  showed that the Big Tech  i e  Google  Amazon  Facebook  Apple  and Microsoft  GAFAM   use dark patterns in their consent obtaining mechanisms  which raises doubts regarding the lawfulness of the acquired consent              
In March       EU member states led by France were reported to be attempting to modify the impact of the privacy regulation in Europe by exempting national security agencies              
After around     million Euros in GDPR fines were imposed in       the figure was already over one billion Euros in                   
In      and early       GDPR enforcement actions intensified  The Irish Data Protection Commission  DPC  imposed a      million fine on TikTok for violations related to children s data privacy and insufficient safeguards for young users               In January       Meta was fined      billion for unlawful data transfers between the EU and the US  marking one of the largest GDPR fines to date              
On    February      The European Commission has abandoned proposed regulations on technology patents  AI liability  and privacy for messaging apps due to strong lobbying and a lack of consensus among EU lawmakers  with major tech firms opposing the changes              

Influence on foreign laws edit 
Mass adoption of these new privacy standards by multinational companies has been cited as an example of the  Brussels effect   a phenomenon wherein European laws and regulations are used as a  baseline due to their gravitas              
The U S  state of California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act on    June       taking effect on   January       it grants rights to transparency and control over the collection of personal information by companies in a similar means to GDPR  Critics have argued that such laws need to be implemented at the federal level to be effective  as a collection of state level laws would have varying standards that would complicate compliance                                         Two other U S  states have since enacted similar legislation  Virginia passed the Consumer Data Privacy Act on   March                    and Colorado enacted the Colorado Privacy Act on   July                   
The Republic of Turkey  a candidate for European Union membership  has adopted the Law on The Protection of Personal Data on    March      in compliance with the EU acquis              
China s      Personal Information Protection Law is the country s first comprehensive law on personal data rights and is modeled after the GDPR                                    
Switzerland will also adopt a new data protection law that largely follows EU s GDPR              
With the addition of overseas regions of the European Union joining non governmental organsational  NGO  bodies in the Caribbean region such as the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States  the GDPR rules have become necessary to consider in the lack of any current legislation found in the region concerning privacy rights and maintaining compliance of the laws of those outer regions              

Website views and revenue edit 
A      study found that GDPR reduced both EU user website page views and website revenue by

EU Digital Single Market edit 
The EU Digital Single Market strategy relates to  digital economy  activities related to businesses and people in the EU               As part of the strategy  the GDPR and the NIS Directive all apply from    May       The proposed ePrivacy Regulation was also planned to be applicable from    May       but will be delayed for several months               The eIDAS Regulation is also part of the strategy 
In an initial assessment  the European Council has stated that the GDPR should be considered  a prerequisite for the development of future digital policy initiatives
