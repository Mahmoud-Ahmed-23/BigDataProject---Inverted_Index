DeepMind Technologies Limited             trading as Google DeepMind or simply DeepMind  is a British American artificial intelligence research laboratory which serves as a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc  Founded in the UK in       it was acquired by Google in                 and merged with Google AI s Google Brain division to become Google DeepMind in April       The company is headquartered in London  with research centres in the United States  Canada             France              Germany and Switzerland 
DeepMind introduced neural Turing machines  neural networks that can access external memory like a conventional Turing machine               resulting in a computer that loosely resembles short term memory in the human brain                         
DeepMind has created neural network models to play video games and board games  It made headlines in      after its AlphaGo program beat a human professional Go player Lee Sedol  a world champion  in a five game match  which was the subject of a documentary film              A more general program  AlphaZero  beat the most powerful programs playing go  chess and shogi  Japanese chess  after a few days of play against itself using reinforcement learning             
In       DeepMind made significant advances in the problem of protein folding with AlphaFold              In July       it was announced that over     million predicted protein structures  representing virtually all known proteins  would be released on the AlphaFold database                          AlphaFold s database of predictions achieved state of the art records on benchmark tests for protein folding algorithms  although each individual prediction still requires confirmation by experimental tests  AlphaFold  was released in May       making structural predictions for the interaction of proteins with various molecules  It achieved new standards on various benchmarks  raising the state of the art accuracies from    and    percent to    and    percent 


History edit 
The start up was founded by Demis Hassabis  Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman in November                  Hassabis and Legg first met at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at University College London  UCL              
Demis Hassabis has said that the start up began working on artificial intelligence technology by teaching it how to play old games from the seventies and eighties  which are relatively primitive compared to the ones that are available today  Some of those games included Breakout  Pong  and Space Invaders  AI was introduced to one game at a time  without any prior knowledge of its rules  After spending some time on learning the game  AI would eventually become an expert in it   The cognitive processes which the AI goes through are said to be very like those of a human who had never seen the game would use to understand and attempt to master it               The goal of the founders is to create a general purpose AI that can be useful and effective for almost anything 
Major venture capital firms Horizons Ventures and Founders Fund invested in the company              as well as entrepreneurs Scott Banister              Peter Thiel              and Elon Musk              Jaan Tallinn was an early investor and an adviser to the company              On    January       Google confirmed its acquisition of DeepMind for a price reportedly ranging between      million and      million                                      and that it had agreed to take over DeepMind Technologies  The sale to Google took place after Facebook reportedly ended negotiations with DeepMind Technologies in                   The company was afterwards renamed Google DeepMind and kept that name for about two years             
In       DeepMind received the  Company of the Year  award from Cambridge Computer Laboratory

In September       DeepMind and the Royal Free NHS Trust signed their initial information sharing agreement to co develop a clinical task management app  Streams             
After Google s acquisition the company established an artificial intelligence ethics board              The ethics board for AI research remains a mystery  with both Google and DeepMind declining to reveal who sits on the board              DeepMind has opened a new unit called DeepMind Ethics and Society and focused on the ethical and societal questions raised by artificial intelligence featuring prominent philosopher Nick Bostrom as advisor              In October       DeepMind launched a new research team to investigate AI ethics                         
In December       co founder Suleyman announced he would be leaving DeepMind to join Google  working in a policy role              In March       Microsoft appointed him as the EVP and CEO of its newly created consumer AI unit  Microsoft AI             
In April       DeepMind merged with Google AI s Google Brain division to form Google DeepMind  as part of the company s continued efforts to accelerate work on AI in response to OpenAI s ChatGPT              This marked the end of a years long struggle from DeepMind executives to secure greater autonomy from Google             

Products and technologies edit 
Google Research released a paper in      regarding AI safety and avoiding undesirable behaviour during the AI learning process              In      DeepMind released GridWorld  an open source testbed for evaluating whether an algorithm learns to disable its kill switch or otherwise exhibits certain undesirable behaviours                         
In July       researchers from DeepMind trained one of its systems to play the computer game Quake III Arena             
As of       DeepMind has published over a thousand papers  including thirteen papers that were accepted by Nature or Science  DeepMind received media attention during the AlphaGo period  according to a LexisNexis search       published news stories mentioned DeepMind in       declining to      in                  

Games edit 
Unlike earlier AIs  such as IBM s Deep Blue or Watson  which were developed for a pre defined purpose and only function within that scope  DeepMind s initial algorithms were intended to be general  They used reinforcement learning  an algorithm that learns from experience using only raw pixels as data input  Their initial approach used deep Q learning with a convolutional neural network                          They tested the system on video games  notably early arcade games  such as Space Invaders or Breakout                          Without altering the code  the same AI was able to play certain games more efficiently than any human ever could             
In       DeepMind published research on an AI system that surpassed human abilities in games such as Pong  Breakout and Enduro  while surpassing state of the art performance on Seaquest  Beamrider  and Q bert                          This work reportedly led to the company s acquisition by Google              DeepMind s AI had been applied to video games made in the     s and     s  work was ongoing for more complex  D games such as Quake  which first appeared in the     s             
In       DeepMind published Agent                            an AI Agent which surpasses human level performance on all    games of the Atari      suite              In July       DeepMind announced the development of DeepNash  a model free multi agent reinforcement learning system capable of playing the board game Stratego at the level of a human expert             

AlphaGo and successors edit 
Main articles  AlphaGo  AlphaGo Zero  AlphaZero  and MuZero
In October       a computer Go program called AlphaGo  developed by DeepMind  beat the European Go champion Fan Hui  a   dan  out of   dan possible  professional  five to zero              This was the first time an artificial intelligence  AI  defeated a professional Go player              Previously  computers were only known to have played Go at  amateur  level                          Go is considered much more difficult for computers to win compared to other games like chess  due to the much larger number of possibilities  making it prohibitively difficult for traditional AI methods such as brute force                         
In March      it beat Lee Sedol  one of the highest ranked players in the world  with a score of   to   in a five game match  In the      Future of Go Summit  AlphaGo won a three game match with Ke Jie  who had been the world s highest ranked player for two years                          In       an improved version  AlphaGo Zero  defeated AlphaGo in a hundred out of a hundred games  Later that year  AlphaZero  a modified version of AlphaGo Zero  gained superhuman abilities at chess and shogi  In       DeepMind released a new model named MuZero that mastered the domains of Go  chess  shogi  and Atari      games without human data  domain knowledge  or known rules                         
AlphaGo technology was developed based on deep reinforcement learning  making it different from the AI technologies then on the market  The data fed into the AlphaGo algorithm consisted of various moves based on historical tournament data  The number of moves was increased gradually until over    million of them were processed  The aim was to have the system mimic the human player  as represented by the input data  and eventually become better  It played against itself and learned from the outcomes  thus  it learned to improve itself over the time and increased its winning rate as a result             
AlphaGo used two deep neural networks  a policy network to evaluate move probabilities and a value network to assess positions  The policy network trained via supervised learning  and was subsequently refined by policy gradient reinforcement learning  The value network learned to predict winners of games played by the policy network against itself  After training  these networks employed a lookahead Monte Carlo tree search  using the policy network to identify candidate high probability moves  while the value network  in conjunction with Monte Carlo rollouts using a fast rollout policy  evaluated tree positions             
In contrast  AlphaGo Zero was trained without being fed data of human played games  Instead it generated its own data  playing millions of games against itself  It used a single neural network  rather than separate policy and value networks  Its simplified tree search relied upon this neural network to evaluate positions and sample moves  A new reinforcement learning algorithm incorporated lookahead search inside the training loop              AlphaGo Zero employed around    people and millions in computing resources              Ultimately  it needed much less computing power than AlphaGo  running on four specialized AI processors  Google TPUs   instead of AlphaGo s                 It also required less training time  being able to beat its predecessor after just three days  compared with months required for the original AlphaGo              Similarly  AlphaZero also learned via self play 
Researchers applied MuZero to solve the real world challenge of video compression with a set number of bits with respect to Internet traffic on sites such as YouTube  Twitch  and Google Meet  The goal of MuZero is to optimally compress the video so the quality of the video is maintained with a reduction in data  The final result using MuZero was a       average reduction in bitrate                         

AlphaStar edit 
Main article  AlphaStar  software 
In       Hassabis discussed the game StarCraft as a future challenge  since it requires strategic thinking and handling imperfect information             
In January       DeepMind introduced AlphaStar  a program playing the real time strategy game StarCraft II  AlphaStar used reinforcement learning based on replays from human players  and then played against itself to enhance its skills  At the time of the presentation  AlphaStar had knowledge equivalent to     years of playing time  It won    consecutive matches against two professional players  although it had the unfair advantage of being able to see the entire field  unlike a human player who has to move the camera manually  A preliminary version in which that advantage was fixed lost a subsequent match             
In July       AlphaStar began playing against random humans on the public  v  European multiplayer ladder  Unlike the first iteration of AlphaStar  which played only Protoss v  Protoss  this one played as all of the game s races  and had earlier unfair advantages fixed                          By October       AlphaStar had reached Grandmaster level on the StarCraft II ladder on all three StarCraft races  becoming the first AI to reach the top league of a widely popular esport without any game restrictions             

Protein folding edit 
Main article  AlphaFold
In       DeepMind turned its artificial intelligence to protein folding  a long standing problem in molecular biology  In December       DeepMind s AlphaFold won the   th Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction  CASP  by successfully predicting the most accurate structure for    out of    proteins   This is a lighthouse project  our first major investment in terms of people and resources into a fundamental  very important  real world scientific problem   Hassabis said to The Guardian              In       in the   th CASP  AlphaFold s predictions achieved an accuracy score regarded as comparable with lab techniques  Dr Andriy Kryshtafovych  one of the panel of scientific adjudicators  described the achievement as  truly remarkable   and said the problem of predicting how proteins fold had been  largely solved                                      
In July       the open source RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold  were released to allow scientists to run their own versions of the tools  A week later DeepMind announced that AlphaFold had completed its prediction of nearly all human proteins as well as the entire proteomes of    other widely studied organisms              The structures were released on the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database  In July       it was announced that the predictions of over     million proteins  representing virtually all known proteins  would be released on the AlphaFold database                         
The most recent update  AlphaFold   was released in May       predicting the interactions of proteins with DNA  RNA  and various other molecules  In a particular benchmark test on the problem of DNA interactions  AlphaFold  s attained an accuracy of      significantly improving the previous state of the art of                 
In October       Hassabis and John Jumper received half of the      Nobel Prize in Chemistry jointly for protein structure prediction  citing AlphaFold  achievement

Sports edit 
DeepMind researchers have applied machine learning models to the sport of football  often referred to as soccer in North America  modelling the behaviour of football players  including the goalkeeper  defenders  and strikers during different scenarios such as penalty kicks  The researchers used heat maps and cluster analysis to organize players based on their tendency to behave a certain way during the game when confronted with a decision on how to score or prevent the other team from scoring  
The researchers mention that machine learning models could be used to democratize the football industry by automatically selecting interesting video clips of the game that serve as highlights  This can be done by searching videos for certain events  which is possible because video analysis is an established field of machine learning  This is also possible because of extensive sports analytics based on data including annotated passes or shots  sensors that capture data about the players movements many times over the course of a game  and game theory models                           

Archaeology edit 
Google has unveiled a new archaeology document program  named Ithaca after the Greek island in Homer s Odyssey               This deep neural network helps researchers restore the empty text of damaged Greek documents  and to identify their date and geographical origin               The work builds on another text analysis network that DeepMind released in       named Pythia               Ithaca achieves     accuracy in restoring damaged texts and     location accuracy  and has a dating precision of    years               The authors claimed that the use of Ithaca by  expert historians  raised the accuracy of their work from    to    percent               However  Eleanor Dickey noted that this test was actually only made of students  saying that it wasn t clear how helpful Ithaca would be to  genuinely qualified editors                
The team is working on extending the model to other ancient languages  including Demotic  Akkadian  Hebrew  and Mayan              

Materials science edit 
In November       Google DeepMind announced an Open Source Graph Network for Materials Exploration  GNoME   The tool proposes millions of materials previously unknown to chemistry  including several hundred thousand stable crystalline structures  of which     had been experimentally produced by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  at the time of the release                            However  according to Anthony Cheetham  GNoME did not make  a useful  practical contribution to the experimental materials scientists                A review article by Cheetham and Ram Seshadri were unable to identify any  strikingly novel  materials found by GNoME  with most being minor variants of already known materials                           

Mathematics edit 
AlphaTensor edit 
In October       DeepMind released AlphaTensor  which used reinforcement learning techniques similar to those in AlphaGo  to find novel algorithms for matrix multiplication                            In the special case of multiplying two     matrices with integer entries  where only the evenness or oddness of the entries is recorded  AlphaTensor found an algorithm requiring only    distinct multiplications  the previous optimum  known since       was the more general Strassen algorithm  using    multiplications               Computer scientist Josh Alman described AlphaTensor as  a proof of concept for something that could become a breakthrough   while Vassilevska Williams called it  a little overhyped               despite also acknowledging its basis in reinforcement learning as  something completely different  from previous approaches              

AlphaGeometry edit 
Main article  AlphaGeometry
AlphaGeometry is a neuro symbolic AI that was able to solve    out of    geometry problems of the International Mathematical Olympiad  a performance comparable to that of a gold medalist              
Traditional geometry programs are symbolic engines that rely exclusively on human coded rules to generate rigorous proofs  which makes them lack flexibility in unusual situations  AlphaGeometry combines such a symbolic engine with a specialized large language model trained on synthetic data of geometrical proofs  When the symbolic engine doesn t manage to find a formal and rigorous proof on its own  it solicits the large language model  which suggests a geometrical construct to move forward  However  it is unclear how applicable this method is to other domains of mathematics or reasoning  because symbolic engines rely on domain specific rules and because of the need for synthetic data              

AlphaProof edit 
AlphaProof is an AI model  which couples a pre trained language model with the AlphaZero reinforcement learning algorithm  AlphaZero has previously taught itself how to master games  The pre trained language model used in this combination is the fine tuning of a Gemini model to automatically translate natural language problem statements into formal statements  creating a large library of formal problems of varying difficulty  For this purpose  mathematical statements are defined in the formal language Lean  At the      International Mathematical Olympiad  AlphaProof together with an adapted version of AlphaGeometry have reached the same level of solving problems in the combined categories as a silver medalist in that competition for the first time

In June       Deepmind announced that AlphaDev  which searches for improved computer science algorithms using reinforcement learning  discovered a more efficient way of coding a sorting algorithm and a hashing algorithm  The new sorting algorithm was     faster for shorter sequences and      faster for sequences exceeding         elements  and the new hashing algorithm was     faster in some cases  The sorting algorithm was accepted into the C   Standard Library sorting algorithms  and was the first change to those algorithms in more than a decade and the first update to involve an algorithm discovered using AI               The hashing algorithm was released to an opensource library               Google estimates that these two algorithms are used trillions of times every day              

Chip design edit 
AlphaChip is an reinforcement learning based neural architecture that guides the task of chip placement  DeepMind claimed that the time needed to create chip layouts fell from weeks to hours  Its chip designs were used in every Tensor Processing Unit  TPU  iteration since                                

Miscellaneous contributions to Google edit 
Google has stated that DeepMind algorithms have greatly increased the efficiency of cooling its data centers by automatically balancing the cost of hardware failures against the cost of cooling               In addition  DeepMind  alongside other Alphabet AI researchers  assists Google Play s personalized app recommendations              DeepMind has also collaborated with the Android team at Google for the creation of two new features which were made available to people with devices running Android Pie  the ninth installment of Google s mobile operating system  These features  Adaptive Battery and Adaptive Brightness  use machine learning to conserve energy and make devices running the operating system easier to use  It is the first time DeepMind has used these techniques on such a small scale  with typical machine learning applications requiring orders of magnitude more computing power              

DeepMind Health edit 
In July       a collaboration between DeepMind and Moorfields Eye Hospital was announced to develop AI applications for healthcare               DeepMind would be applied to the analysis of anonymised eye scans  searching for early signs of diseases leading to blindness 
In August       a research programme with University College London Hospital was announced with the aim of developing an algorithm that can automatically differentiate between healthy and cancerous tissues in head and neck areas              
There are also projects with the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust to develop new clinical mobile apps linked to electronic patient records               Staff at the Royal Free Hospital were reported as saying in December      that access to patient data through the app had saved a  huge amount of time  and made a  phenomenal  difference to the management of patients with acute kidney injury  Test result data is sent to staff s mobile phones and alerts them to changes in the patient s condition  It also enables staff to see if someone else has responded  and to show patients their results in visual form                           
In November       DeepMind announced a research partnership with the Cancer Research UK Centre at Imperial College London with the goal of improving breast cancer detection by applying machine learning to mammography               Additionally  in February       DeepMind announced it was working with the U S  Department of Veterans Affairs in an attempt to use machine learning to predict the onset of acute kidney injury in patients  and also more broadly the general deterioration of patients during a hospital stay so that doctors and nurses can more quickly treat patients in need              
DeepMind developed an app called Streams  which sends alerts to doctors about patients at risk of acute kidney injury               On    November       DeepMind announced that its health division and the Streams app would be absorbed into Google Health               Privacy advocates said the announcement betrayed patient trust and appeared to contradict previous statements by DeepMind that patient data would not be connected to Google accounts or services                            A spokesman for DeepMind said that patient data would still be kept separate from Google services or projects              

NHS data sharing controversy edit 
In April       New Scientist obtained a copy of a data sharing agreement between DeepMind and the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust  The latter operates three London hospitals where an estimated     million patients are treated annually  The agreement shows DeepMind Health had access to admissions  discharge and transfer data  accident and emergency  pathology and radiology  and critical care at these hospitals  This included personal details such as whether patients had been diagnosed with HIV  suffered from depression or had ever undergone an abortion in order to conduct research to seek better outcomes in various health conditions                           
A complaint was filed to the Information Commissioner s Office  ICO   arguing that the data should be pseudonymised and encrypted               In May       New Scientist published a further article claiming that the project had failed to secure approval from the Confidentiality Advisory Group of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency              
In       the ICO concluded a year long investigation that focused on how the Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust tested the app  Streams  in late      and                    The ICO found that the Royal Free failed to comply with the Data Protection Act when it provided patient details to DeepMind  and found several shortcomings in how the data was handled  including that patients were not adequately informed that their data would be used as part of the test  DeepMind published its thoughts              on the investigation in July       saying  we need to do better  and highlighting several activities and initiatives they had initiated for transparency  oversight and engagement  This included developing a patient and public involvement strategy              and being transparent in its partnerships 
In May       Sky News published a leaked letter from the National Data Guardian  Dame Fiona Caldicott  revealing that in her  considered opinion  the data sharing agreement between DeepMind and the Royal Free took place on an  inappropriate legal basis                The Information Commissioner s Office ruled in July      that the Royal Free hospital failed to comply with the Data Protection Act when it handed over personal data of     million patients to DeepMind              

DeepMind Ethics and Society edit 
In October       DeepMind announced a new research unit  DeepMind Ethics  amp  Society               Their goal is to fund external research of the following themes  privacy  transparency  and fairness  economic impacts  governance and accountability  managing AI risk  AI morality and values  and how AI can address the world s challenges  As a result  the team hopes to further understand the ethical implications of AI and aid society to seeing AI can be beneficial              
This new subdivision of DeepMind is a completely separate unit from the partnership of leading companies using AI  academia  civil society organizations and nonprofits of the name Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society of which DeepMind is also a part               The DeepMind Ethics and Society board is also distinct from the mooted AI Ethics Board that Google originally agreed to form when acquiring DeepMind
