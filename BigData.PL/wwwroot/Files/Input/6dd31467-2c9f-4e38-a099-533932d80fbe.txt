Software agent which acts autonomously
For the term in intelligent design  see Intelligent designer 
Not to be confused with Embodied agent

In artificial intelligence  an intelligent agent is an entity that perceives its environment  takes actions autonomously to achieve goals  and may improve its performance through machine learning or by acquiring knowledge  Leading AI textbooks define artificial intelligence as the  study and design of intelligent agents   emphasizing that goal directed behavior is central to intelligence 
A specialized subset of intelligent agents  agentic AI  also known as an AI agent or simply agent   expands this concept by proactively pursuing goals  making decisions  and taking actions over extended periods  thereby exemplifying a novel form of digital agency            
Intelligent agents can range from simple to highly complex  A basic thermostat or control system is considered an intelligent agent  as is a human being  or any other system that meets the same criteria such as a firm  a state  or a biome            
Intelligent agents operate based on an objective function  which encapsulates their goals  They are designed to create and execute plans that maximize the expected value of this function upon completion             For example  a reinforcement learning agent has a reward function  which allows programmers to shape its desired behavior             Similarly  an evolutionary algorithm s behavior is guided by a fitness function            
Intelligent agents in artificial intelligence are closely related to agents in economics  and versions of the intelligent agent paradigm are studied in cognitive science  ethics  and the philosophy of practical reason  as well as in many interdisciplinary socio cognitive modeling and computer social simulations 
Intelligent agents are often described schematically as abstract functional systems similar to computer programs  To distinguish theoretical models from real world implementations  abstract descriptions of intelligent agents are called abstract intelligent agents  Intelligent agents are also closely related to software agents autonomous computer programs that carry out tasks on behalf of users  They are also referred to using a term borrowed from economics  a  rational agent             


Intelligent agents as the foundation of AI edit

The concept of intelligent agents provides a foundational lens through which to define and understand artificial intelligence  For instance  the influential textbook Artificial Intelligence  A Modern Approach  Russell  amp  Norvig  describes 

Agent  Anything that perceives its environment  using sensors  and acts upon it  using actuators   E g   a robot with cameras and wheels  or a software program that reads data and makes recommendations 
Rational Agent  An agent that strives to achieve the  best possible outcome  based on its knowledge and past experiences   Best  is defined by a performance measure   a way of evaluating how well the agent is doing 
Artificial Intelligence  as a field   The study and creation of these rational agents 
Other researchers and definitions build upon this foundation  Padgham  amp  Winikoff emphasize that intelligent agents should react to changes in their environment in a timely way  proactively pursue goals  and be flexible and robust  able to handle unexpected situations   Some also suggest that ideal agents should be  rational  in the economic sense  making optimal choices  and capable of complex reasoning  like having beliefs  desires  and intentions  BDI model   Kaplan and Haenlein offer a similar definition  focusing on a system s ability to understand external data  learn from that data  and use what is learned to achieve goals through flexible adaptation 
Defining AI in terms of intelligent agents offers several key advantages 

Avoids Philosophical Debates  It sidesteps arguments about whether AI is  truly  intelligent or conscious  like those raised by the Turing test or Searle s Chinese Room  It focuses on behavior and goal achievement  not on replicating human thought 
Objective Testing  It provides a clear  scientific way to evaluate AI systems  Researchers can compare different approaches by measuring how well they maximize a specific  goal function   or objective function   This allows for direct comparison and combination of techniques 
Interdisciplinary Communication  It creates a common language for AI researchers to collaborate with other fields like mathematical optimization and economics  which also use concepts like  goals  and  rational agents  
Objective function edit 
Further information  utility function  economics      and loss function  mathematics 
An objective function  or goal function  specifies the goals of an intelligent agent  An agent is deemed more intelligent if it consistently selects actions that yield outcomes better aligned with its objective function  In effect  the objective function serves as a measure of success 
The objective function may be 

Simple  For example  in a game of Go  the objective function might assign a value of   for a win and   for a loss 
Complex  It might require the agent to evaluate and learn from past actions  adapting its behavior based on patterns that have proven effective 
The objective function encapsulates all of the goals the agent is designed to achieve  For rational agents  it also incorporates the trade offs between potentially conflicting goals  For instance  a self driving car s objective function might balance factors such as safety  speed  and passenger comfort 
Different terms are used to describe this concept  depending on the context   These include 

Utility function   Often used in economics and decision theory  representing the desirability of a state 
Objective function  A general term used in optimization 
Loss function   Typically used in machine learning  where the goal is to minimize the loss  error  
Reward Function  Used in reinforcement learning 
Fitness Function  Used in evolutionary systems 
Goals  and therefore the objective function  can be 

Explicitly defined  Programmed directly into the agent 
Induced  Learned or evolved over time 
In reinforcement learning  a  reward function  provides feedback  encouraging desired behaviors and discouraging undesirable ones  The agent learns to maximize its cumulative reward 
In evolutionary systems  a  fitness function  determines which agents are more likely to reproduce  This is analogous to natural selection  where organisms evolve to maximize their chances of survival and reproduction            
Some AI systems  such as nearest neighbor  reason by analogy rather than being explicitly goal driven  However  even these systems can have goals implicitly defined within their training data             Such systems can still be benchmarked by framing the non goal system as one whose  goal  is to accomplish its narrow classification task            
Systems not traditionally considered agents  like knowledge representation systems  are sometimes included in the paradigm by framing them as agents with a goal of  for example  answering questions accurately  Here  the concept of an  action  is extended to encompass the  act  of providing an answer  As a further extension  mimicry driven systems can be framed as agents optimizing a  goal function  based on how closely the IA mimics the desired behavior             In generative adversarial networks  GANs  of the     s  an  encoder   generator  component attempts to mimic and improvise human text composition  The generator tries to maximize a function representing how well it can fool an antagonistic  predictor   discriminator  component            
While symbolic AI systems often use an explicit goal function  the paradigm also applies to neural networks and evolutionary computing  Reinforcement learning can generate intelligent agents that appear to act in ways intended to maximize a  reward function               Sometimes  instead of setting the reward function directly equal to the desired benchmark evaluation function  machine learning programmers use reward shaping to initially give the machine rewards for incremental progress              Yann LeCun stated in        Most of the learning algorithms that people have come up with essentially consist of minimizing some objective function               AlphaZero chess had a simple objective function     point for each win  and    point for each loss  A self driving car s objective function would be more complex              Evolutionary computing can evolve intelligent agents that appear to act in ways intended to maximize a  fitness function  influencing how many descendants each agent is allowed to leave            
The mathematical formalism of AIXI was proposed as a maximally intelligent agent in this paradigm              However  AIXI is uncomputable  In the real world  an IA is constrained by finite time and hardware resources  and scientists compete to produce algorithms that achieve progressively higher scores on benchmark tests with existing hardware             

Agent function edit 
An intelligent agent s behavior can be described mathematically by an agent function  This function determines what the agent does based on what it has seen 
A percept refers to the agent s sensory inputs at a single point in time  For example  a self driving car s percepts might include camera images  lidar data  GPS coordinates  and speed readings at a specific instant  The agent uses these percepts  and potentially its history of percepts  to decide on its next action  e g   accelerate  brake  turn  
The agent function  often denoted as f  maps the agent s entire history of percepts to an action             
Mathematically  this can be represented as 


  
    
      
        f
         
        
          P
          
              x     
          
        
          x     
        A
      
    
      displaystyle f P     rightarrow A 
  

Where 

P   represents the set of all possible percept sequences  the agent s entire perceptual history   The asterisk     indicates a sequence of zero or more percepts 
A represents the set of all possible actions the agent can take 
f is the agent function that maps a percept sequence to an action 
It s crucial to distinguish between the agent function  an abstract mathematical concept  and the agent program  the concrete implementation of that function  

The agent function is a theoretical description 
The agent program is the actual code that runs on the agent  The agent program takes the current percept as input and produces an action as output 
The agent function can incorporate a wide range of decision making approaches  including             

Calculating the utility  desirability  of different actions 
Using logical rules and deduction 
Employing fuzzy logic 
Other methods 
Classes of intelligent agents edit 
Russell and Norvig s classification edit 
Russell  amp  Norvig        group agents into five classes based on their degree of perceived intelligence and capability             

Simple reflex agents edit 
Simple reflex agent
Simple reflex agents act only on the basis of the current percept  ignoring the rest of the percept history  The agent function is based on the condition action rule   if condition  then action  
This agent function only succeeds when the environment is fully observable  Some reflex agents can also contain information on their current state which allows them to disregard conditions whose actuators are already triggered 
Infinite loops are often unavoidable for simple reflex agents operating in partially observable environments  If the agent can randomize its actions  it may be possible to escape from infinite loops 
A home thermostat  which turns on or off when the temperature drops below a certain point  is an example of a simple reflex agent                         

Model based reflex agents edit 
Model based reflex agent
A model based agent can handle partially observable environments  Its current state is stored inside the agent  maintaining a structure that describes the part of the world which cannot be seen  This knowledge about  how the world works  is referred to as a model of the world  hence the name  model based agent  
A model based reflex agent should maintain some sort of internal model that depends on the percept history and thereby reflects at least some of the unobserved aspects of the current state  Percept history and impact of action on the environment can be determined by using the internal model  It then chooses an action in the same way as reflex agent 
An agent may also use models to describe and predict the behaviors of other agents in the environment             

Goal based agents edit 
Model based  goal based agent
Goal based agents further expand on the capabilities of the model based agents  by using  goal  information  Goal information describes situations that are desirable  This provides the agent a way to choose among multiple possibilities  selecting the one which reaches a goal state  Search and planning are the subfields of artificial intelligence devoted to finding action sequences that achieve the agent s goals 
ChatGPT and the Roomba vacuum are examples of goal based agents             

Utility based agents edit 
Model based  utility based agent
Goal based agents only distinguish between goal states and non goal states  It is also possible to define a measure of how desirable a particular state is  This measure can be obtained through the use of a utility function which maps a state to a measure of the utility of the state  A more general performance measure should allow a comparison of different world states according to how well they satisfied the agent s goals  The term utility can be used to describe how  happy  the agent is 
A rational utility based agent chooses the action that maximizes the expected utility of the action outcomes   that is  what the agent expects to derive  on average  given the probabilities and utilities of each outcome  A utility based agent has to model and keep track of its environment  tasks that have involved a great deal of research on perception  representation  reasoning  and learning 

Learning agents edit 
A general learning agent
Learning lets agents begin in unknown environments and gradually surpass the bounds of their initial knowledge  A key distinction in such agents is the separation between a  learning element   responsible for improving performance  and a  performance element   responsible for choosing external actions 
The learning element gathers feedback from a  critic  to assess the agent s performance and decides how the performance element also called the  actor  can be adjusted to yield better outcomes  The performance element  once considered the entire agent  interprets percepts and takes actions 
The final component  the  problem generator   suggests new and informative experiences that encourage exploration and further improvement 

Weiss s classification edit 
According to Weiss         agents can be categorized into four classes 

Logic based agents  where decisions about actions are derived through logical deduction 
Reactive agents  where decisions occur through a direct mapping from situation to action 
Belief desire intention agents  where decisions depend on manipulating data structures that represent the agent s beliefs  desires  and intentions 
Layered architectures  where decision making takes place across multiple software layers  each of which reasons about the environment at a different level of abstraction 
Other edit 
In       Alexander Wissner Gross published a theory exploring the relationship between Freedom and Intelligence in intelligent agents                         

Hierarchies of agents edit 
Main article  Multi agent system
Intelligent agents can be organized hierarchically into multiple  sub agents   These sub agents handle lower level functions  and together with the main agent  they form a complete system capable of executing complex tasks and achieving challenging goals 
Typically  an agent is structured by dividing it into sensors and actuators  The perception system gathers input from the environment via the sensors and feeds this information to a central controller  which then issues commands to the actuators  Often  a multilayered hierarchy of controllers is necessary to balance the rapid responses required for low level tasks with the more deliberative reasoning needed for high level objectives             

Alternative definitions and uses edit 
 Intelligent agent  is also often used as a vague term  sometimes synonymous with  virtual personal assistant               Some   th century definitions characterize an agent as a program that aids a user or that acts on behalf of a user              These examples are known as software agents  and sometimes an  intelligent software agent   that is  a software agent with intelligence  is referred to as an  intelligent agent  
According to Nikola Kasabov  IA systems should exhibit the following characteristics             

Accommodate new problem solving rules incrementally 
Adapt online and in real time 
Are able to analyze themselves in terms of behavior  error and success 
Learn and improve through interaction with the environment  embodiment  
Learn quickly from large amounts of data 
Have memory based exemplar storage and retrieval capacities 
Have parameters to represent short  and long term memory  age  forgetting  etc 
Agentic AI edit 
In the context of generative artificial intelligence  AI agents  also referred to as compound AI systems  are a class of intelligent agents distinguished by their ability to operate autonomously in complex environments  Agentic AI tools prioritize decision making over content creation and do not require human prompts or continuous oversight             
They possess several key attributes  including complex goal structures  natural language interfaces  the capacity to act independently of user supervision  and the integration of software tools or planning systems  Their control flow is frequently driven by large language models  LLMs              
A common application of AI agents is the automation of tasks for example  booking travel plans based on a user s prompted request                          Prominent examples include Devin AI  AutoGPT  and SIMA              Further examples of agents released since      include OpenAI Operator              ChatGPT Deep Research              and Manus              Frameworks for building AI agents include LangChain              as well as tools such as CAMEL                          Microsoft AutoGen              and OpenAI Swarm             
Proposed protocols for standardizing inter agent communication include the Agent Protocol  by LangChain   the Model Context Protocol  by Anthropic   AGNTCY              Gibberlink              and the Internet of Agents             
In February       Hugging Face released Open Deep Research  an open source version of OpenAI Deep Research             
Galileo published on Hugging Face a leadership board for agents  which ranks their performance based on their underlying LLMs             
A non peer reviewed research survey of    agents released by the end of      found that the majority of agents are built by developers based in the United States  built by companies  purposed for coding or computer interaction  have code or documentation  and lack safety policies or evaluations             

Proposed benefits edit 
Proponents argue that AI agents can increase personal and economic productivity                          foster greater innovation              and liberate users from monotonous tasks                          A Bloomberg opinion piece by Parmy Olson argued that agents are best suited for narrow  repetitive tasks with low risk              Conversely  researchers argue that agents could be applied to web accessibility for people who have disabilities                          and researchers at Hugging Face propose that agents could be used for coordinating resources such as during disaster response             

Concerns edit 
Potential concerns include issues of liability                                      an increased risk of cybercrime                          ethical challenges              as well as problems related to AI safety             and AI alignment                          Other issues involve data privacy                                                                                      Additional challenges include weakened human oversight                                                                          algorithmic bias                          and compounding software errors                          as well as issues related to the explainability of agent decisions                          security vulnerabilities                                                              problems with underemployment              job displacement                          and the potential for user manipulation                          misinformation             or malinformation              They may also complicate legal frameworks  foster hallucinations  hinder countermeasures against rogue agents  and suffer from the lack of standardized evaluation methods                          They have also been criticized for being expensive                         and having a negative impact on internet traffic             and potentially the environment             
Journalists have described AI agents as part of a push by Big Tech companies to  automate everything              
Yoshua Bengio warned at the      World Economic Forum that  all of the catastrophic scenarios with AGI or superintelligence happen if we have agents              
In March       Scale AI signed a contract with the United States Department of Defense to work with them  in collaboration with Anduril Industries and Microsoft  to develop and deploy AI agents for the purpose of assisting the military with  operational decision making               Researchers have expressed concerns that agents and the large language models they are based on could be biased towards aggressive foreign policy decisions                         
Research focused agents have the risk of consensus bias and coverage bias due to collecting information available on the public Internet              NY Mag unfavorably compared the user workflow of agent based web browsers to Amazon Alexa  which was  software talking to software  not humans talking to software pretending to be humans to use software              
Agents have been linked to the Dead Internet Theory due to their ability to both publish and engage with online content             
Agents may get stuck in infinite loops
