The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  is an independent agency of the United States government that regulates the interstate transmission and wholesale sale of electricity and natural gas and regulates the prices of interstate transport of petroleum by pipeline  FERC also reviews proposals to build interstate natural gas pipelines  natural gas storage projects  and liquefied natural gas  LNG  terminals  in addition to licensing non federal hydropower projects 
FERC was created by the U S  Congress in      in the aftermath of the      oil crisis  FERC is an independent agency  despite being part of the U S  Department of Energy  It is headed by five commissioners who are nominated by the U S  president and confirmed by the U S  Senate  There may be no more than three commissioners of one political party serving on the commission at any given time            


Primary duties edit 
The responsibilities of FERC include the following 

Regulating the transmission and sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce 
Regulating the transmission of oil by pipelines in interstate commerce 
Regulating the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce 
Licensing and inspecting private  municipal  and state hydroelectric projects 
Approving the siting of and abandonment of interstate natural gas facilities  including pipelines  storage and liquefied natural gas 
Ensuring the reliability of high voltage interstate transmission system 
Monitoring and investigating energy markets 
Using civil penalties and other means against energy organizations and individuals who violate FERC rules in the energy markets 
Overseeing environmental matters related to natural gas and hydroelectricity projects and major electricity policy initiatives  and
Administering accounting and financial reporting regulations and regulating businesses of regulated companies 
Jurisdiction and authorities edit 
FERC is a large independent regulatory agency  within the United States Department of Energy  that participates in business oversight                                  The President and Congress do not generally review FERC decisions  but the decisions are reviewable by the federal courts  FERC is self funding  in that Congress sets its budget through annual and supplemental appropriations and FERC is authorized to raise revenue to reimburse the United States Treasury for its appropriations  through annual charges to the natural gas  oil  and electric industries it regulates            
FERC is independent of the Department of Energy political structure because FERC activities  shall not be subject to further view by the Secretary  of Energy  or any officer or employee of the Department              The Department of Energy can  however  participate in FERC proceedings as a third party 
FERC has promoted voluntary formation of regional transmission organizations  RTOs  and Independent System Operators  ISOs  to eliminate the potential for undue discrimination in access to the electric grid  it has made key decisions expanding its own power in regional and interregional transmission planning and cost allocation through the landmark Order Nos                    and      
FERC investigated the alleged manipulation of electricity market by Enron and other energy companies  and their role in the California electricity crisis  FERC has collected more than      billion from California electric market participants through settlements             Since passage of the Energy Policy Act of       FERC has imposed  through settlements and orders  more than    billion in civil penalties and disgorgement of unjust profits to address violations of its anti market manipulation and other rules 
FERC regulates approximately       hydroelectric projects in the U S  It is largely responsible for permitting construction of a large network of interstate natural gas pipelines  FERC also works closely with the United States Coast Guard to review the safety  security  and environmental impacts of proposed LNG terminals and associated shipping 

Commissioners edit 
FERC is composed of up to five commissioners who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate to staggered five year terms  The President appoints one of the commissioners to be the chairman of FERC  the administrative head of the agency  FERC is a bipartisan body  no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party  Commissioners may continue in office past the end of their term if a successor has not yet been confirmed  up to the end of the current session of Congress  The commissioners as of April                       update      are

History edit 
Federal Power Commission edit 
The Federal Power Commission  FPC   which preceded FERC  was established by Congress in      to allow cabinet members to coordinate federal hydropower development 
In       the FPC was transformed into an independent regulatory agency with five members nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate  The FPC was authorized to regulate both hydropower and interstate electricity 

Natural Gas Act of      edit 
In       the Natural Gas Act gave FPC jurisdiction over interstate natural gas pipelines and wholesale sales  In       this jurisdiction was expanded to cover the licensing of more natural gas facilities  In       the Supreme Court decision in Phillips Petroleum Co  v  Wisconsin extended FPC jurisdiction over all wellhead sales of natural gas in interstate commerce 

Birth of DOE  FPC Becomes FERC edit 
In response to the      oil crisis  Congress passed the Department of Energy Organization Act in       to consolidate various energy related agencies into a Department of Energy  Congress insisted that a separate independent regulatory body be retained  and the FPC was renamed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC   preserving its independent status within the department              Its most basic mandate was to  determine whether wholesale electricity prices were unjust and unreasonable and  if so  to regulate pricing and order refunds for overcharges to ratepayers              FERC was also given added responsibility to hear appeals of DOE oil price control determinations and to conduct all  on the record  hearings for DOE              As a result  DOE does not have any administrative law judges  As a further protection  when the Department of Energy proposes a rule  it must refer the proposal to FERC  and FERC can take over the proceeding if FERC determines that the rulemaking  may significantly affect  matters in its jurisdiction              The DOE Act also transferred the regulation of interstate oil pipelines from the Interstate Commerce Commission to FERC              However  the FERC lost some jurisdiction over the imports and exports of gas and electricity 
In       FERC was given additional responsibilities for harmonizing the regulation of wellhead gas sales in both the intrastate and interstate markets  FERC also administered a program to foster new cogeneration and small power production under the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act of       which was passed as part of the National Energy Act of       The National Energy Act included the Natural Gas Policy Act of       which reduced the scope of federal price regulation  to bring greater competition to both the natural gas and electric industry 
In       Congress ended federal regulation of wellhead natural gas prices  with the passage of the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of                  

Order No      edit 
In       FERC issued Order No       which spurred the creation of regional transmission organizations in the United States  This would impact existing electric power pools by rebranding themselves as independent transmission operators  Electric utilities in some regions began to spin off their generation units as separate companies that would compete in a wholesale electric market administered by the RTOs             
Once FERC had created the framework for Regional Transmission Organizations with Order No       several such RTOs were approved   The pre existing multi state power pool called PJM  Pennsylvania  Jersey  Maryland   the New York Independent System Operator  NYISO   and the Independent Sysoperator New England  ISO NE  were early adopters   California  with the backing of its state and Congressional policymakers  sought approval of a controversial scheme to set up its ISO  called California ISO  based near Sacramento  CA   FERC approved it without changes because California had warned that it would not accept any changes 
Enron charged one of its policy analysts to figure out how to make the most of the flawed rules put in place for the California electricity market   Enron had success with its fraudulent market transactions 

Energy Policy Act of      edit 
In       the George W  Bush administration sought to give the authority of eminent domain to FERC to circumvent state and local bureaucratic processes which often slowed the siting of new transmission projects  This expansion of power was most fiercely opposed by Bush s own Republican party as being an expansion of federal power   Legal battles over the issue ended with the      Energy Bill  Energy Policy Act of       which was passed with approval of Democrats and Republicans 
The Energy Policy Act of      expanded FERC s authority to protect the reliability and cybersecurity of the bulk power system through the establishment and enforcement of mandatory standards  as well as greatly expanding FERC authority to impose civil penalties on entities that manipulate the electricity and natural gas markets  The Energy Policy Act of      also gave FERC additional responsibilities and authority  Among the many provisions of the law  FERC was given what is known as  backstop  siting authority which allows FERC to overrule any denial of transmission projects by a state within established corridors of transmission congestion  to expand transmission in limited regions of the country facing transmission constraints                          

Order No       edit 
In       FERC issued Order No        which required RTOs to create regional transmission plans and identify transmission needs based on public policy  Cost allocation reforms were included  possibly to reduce barriers faced by non incumbent transmission developers             

Order No      edit 
In February       FERC issued Order No       which required wholesale markets to open up to individual storage installations  regardless of interconnection point  transmission  distribution or behind the meter                           The Order was challenged in court by the state public utility commissions via the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners  NARUC   the American Public Power Association  and others who claimed that FERC overstepped its jurisdiction by regulating how local electric distribution and behind the meter facilities are administered  i e   in not providing an opt out of wholesale market access for energy storage facilities located at the distribution level or behind the meter  A United States courts of appeals court  the D C  Circuit  issued an order in July      that upheld Order     and dismissed the petitioners  complaints                                     

Order No       edit 
FERC issued Order No       on September           enabling distributed energy resources such as batteries and demand response to participate in regional wholesale electricity markets                          Market operators submitted initial compliance plans by early                   The Supreme Court had ruled in      in FERC v  Electric Power Supply Ass n that the agency had the authority to regulate demand response transactions             

Order No       edit 
On July           the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued Order No        which regulates the interconnection process that ties renewables projects into the large scale grid  Among other provisions  the rule requires transmission planners to consolidate projects into  clusters  for regulatory approval purposes on a  first ready  first served  basis that prioritizes the most well studied and fully financed projects  spread grid upgrade costs over multiple projects  forecast advanced technologies  and allow for multiple projects to share a new single interconnection point  It also  imposes firm deadlines and penalties if transmission providers fail to complete interconnection studies on time              
On March           FERC issued Order No       A  an amendment clarifying certain provisions in the order  such as compliance filing requirements  the deadline for utilities to edit interconnect requests upon submission  the role of substation use in determining cost allocation  and the use of surety bonds in financing             

Order Nos       and      edit 
On May           FERC issued Order Nos       and       The former order requires utilities to plan    years in advance to anticipate future regional  though not interregional  transmission needs  with five year updates  and to cooperate in creating a default cost sharing plan to deliver to state regulators  It  provides for cost effective expansion of transmission that is being replaced  when needed  known as  right sizing  transmission facilities   and it allows states more opportunities to cooperate with utility companies and energy project developers  while preventing states that benefit from regional transmission projects from not paying for them                                      FERC Order No       A  an amendment to it passed unanimously the following November  allows state regulators even more opportunities to provide input on interstate grid projects  adds six months to the cost allocation negotiating process  and gives utilities more leeway to forecast additional needs scenarios                         
The latter order affirms FERC s siting authority in National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors if a state regulatory agency denies any of its own siting responsibility thereof  The order creates an Applicant Code of Conduct to encourage proper landowner outreach  and adds air quality  environmental justice and tribal engagement reports to the list of requirements for project applicants             

Criticism edit 
FERC has been subject to criticism and increasing activism by people from communities affected by its decisions approving pipeline and related projects              They contend that FERC  blithely greenlights too many pipelines  export terminals and other gas infrastructure              and that FERC s structure in which it recovers its annual operating costs directly from the entities it regulates creates bias in favor of the issuance of pipeline certificates              Some of the critics have disrupted several regular open meetings of the Commission             and staged a couple of week long blockades of FERC s headquarters in Washington  D C   to make their points               Pipelines are facing unprecedented opposition   Commissioner LaFleur remarked to the National Press Club in a      speech   We have a situation here                                      
FERC s decisions in those cases are often upheld by the courts  In a July          decision  No Gas Pipeline v  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit  D C  Circuit  said that pipeline applicants are not likely to pursue many certificates that are hopeless   The fact that they generally succeed in choosing to expend their resources on applications that serve their own financial interests does not mean that an agency which recognizes merit in such applications is biased   the court said              Others have directly disputed FERC s critics by pointing out   FERC is a creature of law  It follows a careful administrative path to regulate only a portion of natural gas such as interstate pipelines and LNG import and export terminals  That regulation includes extensive environmental review  driven by many federal laws enacted by Congress  signed by the president  and reviewed and upheld by the U S  Supreme Court  If the agency were to adopt the path  suggested by these critics   FERC s decisions would routinely be overturned by the federal courts              
The United States District Court for the District of Columbia also dismissed a case involving allegations of structural bias on the part of FERC  The plaintiffs contended that the Omnibus Budget Act of      funding mechanism requires the commission to recover its budget through proportional charges on regulated entities  therefore making FERC biased in favor of the industry from which it gets its funding  But in an order issued March           the court said the plain language of the statute indicates that FERC does not have control over its own budget   The Commission s budget cannot be increased by approving pipelines  rather   the statute  requires the Commission to make adjustments to  eliminate any overrecovery or underrecovery   If Plaintiffs are unhappy with Congress s chosen appropriations to the Commission     Plaintiffs  recourse lies with their legislative representatives              
In New Jersey  the FERC approval of the PennEast Pipeline was met with widespread criticism by environmental groups  which called the decision highly partisan   FERC has once again demonstrated its tremendous bias for  and partnership with  the pipeline industry   said Maya van Rossum  leader of the Delaware Riverkeeper Network  Doug O Malley  president of Environment New Jersey  called the FERC approval of the pipeline a  disaster   David Pringle  state campaign director of Clean Water Action and      Congressional candidate  suggested the FERC was serving a partisan interest over the interests of the people of New Jersey  suggesting  The FERC needs to remember it works for the people of the United States not PennEast              
These criticisms were unfounded as the D C  Circuit Court of Appeals on July           rejected the Delaware Riverkeeper Network and Maya Van Rossum s claim that FERC has an incentive to award pipeline certificates because it collects its operating expenses from regulated parties  Upholding a lower court ruling  the D C  Circuit also rejected the Delaware Riverkeeper Network s challenge to FERC s use of tolling orders to meet its statutory deadlines for acting on rehearing applications             
However  the D C  Circuit has provided additional guidance concerning Commission procedures  stating that in one case FERC failed to consider the cumulative environmental impact of four projects that had been separately proposed by the same pipeline  The D C  Circuit held that the projects were not financially independent and were  a single pipeline  that was  linear and physically interdependent   so the cumulative environmental impacts should have been considered concurrently              In a separate decision  the D C  Circuit later sustained the commission s conduct of separate environmental assessments when it clarified that the  critical  factor was that all of the pipeline s projects were either under construction or pending before FERC for environmental review at the same time  noting that the projects lacked temporal overlap              Furthermore  in another case  the D C  Circuit sustained the commission s use of a separate environmental assessment when it reasoned that the projects in dispute were  unrelated  and did not depend on one another for their justification              This guidance has allowed FERC to address additional claims of improper segmentation             
FERC s leaders have stressed many times since the onset of the increased activism that the proper way to oppose a proposed new infrastructure project is by participating in the related proceeding by submitting comments and participating in public comment sessions  site visits and scoping meetings  since FERC decisions can be appealed up to the Supreme Court 

Federal versus state authority edit 
There are regions of the country where the state public utility commission and the FERC regulated Regional Transmission Organization operate in identical footprints  such as in New York State   Where this occurs  state policy makers and FERC frequently clash as to the extent of federal power and influence within the state 
The planning and siting of public policy and renewable power plants and merchant transmission lines can be contentious  because the planning process must proceed through both entities  For example  in New York State  any large  more than    MW for the NYISO or   MW for the state Siting Committee  generation or merchant transmission facility must proceed through both the planning process of the NYISO  which operates on a two year cycle at minimum with an inclusive class year pool of new projects evaluated simultaneously  and the siting process of the state Board on Electric Siting and the Environment  Prior to the formation of the NYISO  the planning process was determined mostly by the state siting board  although the utilities  power pool might have had its own closed door planning session  and large generation projects were developed by the utilities themselves                          The dual planning process provides an opportunity for other market participants to drag out the process legally  not including the other state and or federal environmental  trade  if an international connection with Canada is requested   and local certification and regulation processes that need to be met 
The controversy similarly applies to various electric wholesale market issues within the RTO  when a state public utility commission asserts that its retail ratepayers  under state regulation  will be impacted by wholesale market stakeholder decisions and reforms  under federal level regulation   In contrast  prior to the formation of the NYISO in      in New York  wholesale energy prices were set within a utility s state rate case proceeding  Examples of contentious issues in New York include the NYISO s development of buyer side mitigation  price floors  in its capacity market              proxy peaking unit specifications during the demand curve reset  that helps set capacity market prices                           the state s granting of zero emissions credits to wholesale market participating nuclear power plants              and the creation of a new capacity zone amidst state and transmission owner policy initiatives
