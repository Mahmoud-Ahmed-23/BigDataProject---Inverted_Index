Mechanism design  sometimes implementation theory or institution design             is a branch of economics and game theory  It studies how to construct rules called mechanisms or institutions that produce good outcomes according to some predefined metric  even when the designer does not know the players  true preferences or what information they have  Mechanism design thus focuses on the study of solution concepts for a class of private information games  
Mechanism design has broad applications  including traditional domains of economics such as market design  but also political science  through voting theory   It is a foundational component in the operation of the internet  being used in networked systems  such as inter domain routing              e commerce  and advertisement auctions by Facebook and Google 
Because it starts with the end of the game  a particular result   then works backwards to find a game that implements it  it is sometimes described as reverse game theory             Leonid Hurwicz explains that  in a design problem  the goal function is the main given  while the mechanism is the unknown  Therefore  the design problem is the inverse of traditional economic theory  which is typically devoted to the analysis of the performance of a given mechanism             
The      Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded to Leonid Hurwicz  Eric Maskin  and Roger Myerson  for having laid the foundations of mechanism design theory              The related works of William Vickrey that established the field earned him the      Nobel prize 


Description edit 
One person  called the  principal   would like to condition his behavior on information privately known to the players of a game  For example  the principal would like to know the true quality of a used car a salesman is pitching  He cannot learn anything simply by asking the salesman  because it is in the salesman s interest to distort the truth  However  in mechanism design  the principal does have one advantage  He may design a game whose rules influence others to act the way he would like 
Without mechanism design theory  the principal s problem would be difficult to solve  He would have to consider all the possible games and choose the one that best influences other players  tactics  In addition  the principal would have to draw conclusions from agents who may lie to him  Thanks to the revelation principle  the principal only needs to consider games in which agents truthfully report their private information 

Foundations edit 
Mechanism edit 
A game of mechanism design is a game of private information in which one of the agents  called the principal  chooses the payoff structure  Following Harsanyi              the agents receive secret  messages  from nature containing information relevant to payoffs  For example  a message may contain information about their preferences or the quality of a good for sale  We call this information the agent s  type   usually noted 
  
    
      
          x b  
      
    
      displaystyle  theta  
  
 and accordingly the space of types 
  
    
      
          x    
      
    
      displaystyle  Theta  
  
   Agents then report a type to the principal  usually noted with a hat 
  
    
      
        
          
            
                x b  
                x e 
            
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle   hat   theta    
  
  that can be a strategic lie  After the report  the principal and the agents are paid according to the payoff structure the principal chose 
The timing of the game is 

The principal commits to a mechanism 
  
    
      
        y

 that grants an outcome 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
      displaystyle y 
  
 as a function of reported type
The agents report  possibly dishonestly  a type profile 
  
    
      
        
          
            
                x b  
                x e

The mechanism is executed  agents receive outcome 
  
    
      
        y
         
        
          
            
                x b  
                x e

In order to understand who gets what  it is common to divide the outcome

 into a goods allocation and a money transfer

 where 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
      displaystyle x 
  
 stands for an allocation of goods rendered or received as a function of type  and 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
      displaystyle t 
  
 stands for a monetary transfer as a function of type 
As a benchmark the designer often defines what should happen under full information  Define a social choice function 
  
    
      
        f
         
          x b  
         
      
    
      displaystyle f  theta   
  
 mapping the  true  type profile directly to the allocation of goods received or rendered 


  
    
      
        f
         
          x b

        Y

In contrast a mechanism maps the reported type profile to an outcome  again  both a goods allocation

      displaystyle x 
  
 and a money transfer

Revelation principle edit 
Main article  Revelation principle
A proposed mechanism constitutes a Bayesian game  a game of private information   and if it is well behaved the game has a Bayesian Nash equilibrium  At equilibrium agents choose their reports strategically as a function of type


  
    
      
        
          
            
                x b  
                x e 
            
          
        
         
          x b  
         
      
    
      displaystyle   hat   theta     theta   
  

It is difficult to solve for Bayesian equilibria in such a setting because it involves solving for agents  best response strategies and for the best inference from a possible strategic lie  Thanks to a sweeping result called the revelation principle  no matter the mechanism a designer can            confine attention to equilibria in which agents truthfully report type  The revelation principle states   To every Bayesian Nash equilibrium there corresponds a Bayesian game with the same equilibrium outcome but in which players truthfully report type  
This is extremely useful  The principle allows one to solve for a Bayesian equilibrium by assuming all players truthfully report type  subject to an incentive compatibility constraint   In one blow it eliminates the need to consider either strategic behavior or lying 
Its proof is quite direct  Assume a Bayesian game in which the agent s strategy and payoff are functions of its type and what others do

Simply define a mechanism that would induce agents to choose the same equilibrium  The easiest one to define is for the mechanism to commit to playing the agents  equilibrium strategies for them

Implementability edit 
Main article  Implementability  mechanism design 
The designer of a mechanism generally hopes either

to design a mechanism 
  
    
      
        y
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle y   
  
 that  implements  a social choice function
to find the mechanism 
  
    
      
        y
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle y   
  
 that maximizes some value criterion  e g  profit 
To implement a social choice function 
  
    
      
        f
         
          x b  
         
      
    
      displaystyle f  theta   
  
 is to find some transfer function 
  
    
      
        t
         
          x b  
         
      
    
      displaystyle t  theta   
  
 that motivates agents to pick 
  
    
      
        f
         
          x b  
         
      
    
      displaystyle f  theta   
  
  Formally  if the equilibrium strategy profile under the mechanism maps to the same goods allocation as a social choice function 


  
    
      
        f
         
          x b  
         
         
        x
        
           
          
            
              
                
                    x b  
                    x e 
                
              
            
             
              x b  
             
          
           
        
      
    
      displaystyle f  theta   x left   hat   theta     theta   right  
  

we say the mechanism implements the social choice function 
Thanks to the revelation principle  the designer can usually find a transfer function 
  
    
      
        t
         
          x b  
         
      
    
      displaystyle t  theta   
  
 to implement a social choice by solving an associated truthtelling game  If agents find it optimal to truthfully report type 


  
    
      
        
          
            
                x b  
                x e 
            
          
        
         
          x b  
         
         
          x b  
      
    
      displaystyle   hat   theta     theta    theta  
  

we say such a mechanism is truthfully implementable  The task is then to solve for a truthfully implementable 
  
    
      
        t
         
          x b  
         
      
    
      displaystyle t  theta   
  
 and impute this transfer function to the original game  An allocation 
  
    
      
        x
         
          x b  
         
      
    
      displaystyle x  theta   
  
 is truthfully implementable if there exists a transfer function 
  
    
      
        t
         
          x b  
         
      
    
      displaystyle t  theta

which is also called the incentive compatibility  IC  constraint 
In applications  the IC condition is the key to describing the shape of 
  
    
      
        t
         
          x b  
         
      
    
      displaystyle t  theta   
  
 in any useful way  Under certain conditions it can even isolate the transfer function analytically   Additionally  a participation  individual rationality  constraint is sometimes added if agents have the option of not playing

In short  agents will not tell the truth if the mechanism does not offer higher agent types a better deal  Otherwise  higher types facing any mechanism that punishes high types for reporting will lie and declare they are lower types  violating the truthtelling incentive compatibility constraint  The second piece is a monotonicity condition waiting to happen      clarification needed

which  to be positive  means higher types must be given more of the good 
There is potential for the two pieces to interact  If for some type range the contract offered less quantity to higher types

      displaystyle  partial x  partial  theta  lt   
  
  it is possible the mechanism could compensate by giving higher types a discount  But such a contract already exists for low type agents  so this solution is pathological  Such a solution sometimes occurs in the process of solving for a mechanism  In these cases it must be  ironed   In a multiple good environment it is also possible for the designer to reward the agent with more of one good to substitute for less of another  e g  butter for margarine   Multiple good mechanisms are an area of continuing research in mechanism design

Revenue equivalence theorem edit 
Main article  Revenue equivalence
Vickrey             gives a celebrated result that any member of a large class of auctions assures the seller of the same expected revenue and that the expected revenue is the best the seller can do  This is the case if

The buyers have identical valuation functions  which may be a function of type 
The buyers  types are independently distributed
The buyers types are drawn from a continuous distribution
The type distribution bears the monotone hazard rate property
The mechanism sells the good to the buyer with the highest valuation
The last condition is crucial to the theorem  An implication is that for the seller to achieve higher revenue he must take a chance on giving the item to an agent with a lower valuation  Usually this means he must risk not selling the item at all 

Vickrey Clarke Groves mechanisms edit 
Main article  Vickrey Clarke Groves mechanism
The Vickrey        auction model was later expanded by Clarke             and Groves to treat a public choice problem in which a public project s cost is borne by all agents  e g  whether to build a municipal bridge  The resulting  Vickrey Clarke Groves  mechanism can motivate agents to choose the socially efficient allocation of the public good even if agents have privately known valuations  In other words  it can solve the  tragedy of the commons  under certain conditions  in particular quasilinear utility or if budget balance is not required 
Consider a setting in which

The cleverness of the VCG mechanism is the way it motivates truthful revelation  It eliminates incentives to misreport by penalizing any agent by the cost of the distortion he causes  Among the reports the agent may make  the VCG mechanism permits a  null  report saying he is indifferent to the public good and cares only about the money transfer  This effectively removes the agent from the game  If an agent does choose to report a type  the VCG mechanism charges the agent a fee if his report is pivotal  that is if his report changes the optimal allocation x so as to harm other agents  The payment is calculated

Myerson     and     Satterthwaite             show there is no efficient way for two parties to trade a good when they each have secret and probabilistically varying valuations for it  without the risk of forcing one party to trade at a loss  It is among the most remarkable negative results in economics a kind of negative mirror to the fundamental theorems of welfare economics 

Shapley value edit 
Main article  Shapley value
Phillips and Marden        proved that for cost sharing games with concave cost functions  the optimal cost sharing rule that firstly optimizes the worst case inefficiencies in a game  the price of anarchy   and then secondly optimizes the best case outcomes  the price of stability   is precisely the Shapley value cost sharing rule             A symmetrical statement is similarly valid for utility sharing games with convex utility functions 

Price discrimination edit 
Mirrlees             introduces a setting in which the transfer function t   is easy to solve for  Due to its relevance and tractability it is a common setting in the literature  Consider a single good  single agent setting in which the agent has quasilinear utility with an unknown type parameter

The principal here is a monopolist trying to set a profit maximizing price scheme in which it cannot identify the type of the customer  A common example is an airline setting fares for business  leisure and student travelers  Due to the IR condition it has to give every type a good enough deal to induce participation  Due to the IC condition it has to give every type a good enough deal that the type prefers its deal to that of any other 
A trick given by Mirrlees        is to use the envelope theorem to eliminate the transfer function from the expectation to be maximized

 function exists  The IR constraint can be checked at equilibrium and the fee schedule raised or lowered accordingly  Additionally  note the presence of a hazard rate in the expression  If the type distribution bears the monotone hazard ratio property  the FOC is sufficient to solve for t    If not  then it is necessary to check whether the monotonicity constraint  see sufficiency  above  is satisfied everywhere along the allocation and fee schedules  If not  then the designer must use Myerson ironing 

Myerson ironing edit 
 It is possible to solve for a goods or price schedule that satisfies the first order conditions yet is not monotonic  If so it is necessary to  iron  the schedule by choosing some value at which to flatten the function 
In some applications the designer may solve the first order conditions for the price and allocation schedules yet find they are not monotonic  For example  in the quasilinear setting this often happens when the hazard ratio is itself not monotone  By the Spence Mirrlees condition the optimal price and allocation schedules must be monotonic  so the designer must eliminate any interval over which the schedule changes direction by flattening it 
Intuitively  what is going on is the designer finds it optimal to bunch certain types together and give them the same contract  Normally the designer motivates higher types to distinguish themselves by giving them a better deal  If there are insufficiently few higher types on the margin the designer does not find it worthwhile to grant lower types a concession  called their information rent  in order to charge higher types a type specific contract 
Consider a monopolist principal selling to agents with quasilinear utility  the example above  Suppose the allocation schedule
