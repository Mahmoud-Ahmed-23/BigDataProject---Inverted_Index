Margaret Masterman    May                April       was a British linguist and philosopher  most known for her pioneering work in the field of computational linguistics and especially machine translation  She founded the Cambridge Language Research Unit 


Biography edit 
Margaret Masterman was born in London on   May      to Charles F  G  Masterman  a British radical Liberal Party politician and head of the War Propaganda Bureau  and Lucy Blanche Lyttelton  a politician  poet and writer  In      she married Richard Bevan Braithwaite  a philosopher  They had a son  Lewis Charles  born        and a daughter  Catherine Lucy  born       
Masterman attended the lectures of Ludwig Wittgenstein at Cambridge  she was one of the few selected to take notes  her notes and the notes of others were lather compiled as The Blue Book            

Work edit 
Margaret Masterman was one of six students in Wittgenstein s course of         whose notes were compiled as The Blue Book             In      she founded and directed the Cambridge Language Research Unit  CLRU   which grew from an informal discussion group to a major research centre in computational linguistics in its time  She was a student at Newnham College  Cambridge and read modern languages and then Moral Sciences  as philosophy was then called   The Cambridge Language Research Unit was founded in a small but beautiful building called Adie s Museum which had housed far eastern art  small Buddhist sculptures were built into its walls and carved doors  For a period of twenty years starting in      it was a source of significant research in machine translation  computational linguistics  and quantum physics even though outside the official university structures in Cambridge  It was funded by grants from US agencies  AFOSR  ONR  NSF   UK Government agencies  OSTI  and later  from EU funds in Luxembourg  Its computing facilities were primitive an ancient ICL      computer   and most of its more serious computation was done either on the Cambridge university machine  in the then Mathematical Laboratory or by CLRU visitors at sites in the US  One measure of its impact  and from a staff that never exceeded ten people  was that of the Annual Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Association for Computational Linguistics in the US  three have been awarded to CLRU alumni  Martin Kay  Karen Sp rck Jones and Yorick Wilks 
Margaret Masterman was ahead of her time by some twenty years  many of her beliefs and proposals for language processing by computer have now become part of the common stock of ideas in the artificial intelligence  AI  and machine translation  MT  fields   She was never able to lay adequate claim to them because they were unacceptable when she published them  and so when they were written up later by her students or independently  discovered  by others  there was no trace back to her  especially in these fields where little or nothing over ten years old is ever reread 
The core of her beliefs about language processing was that it must reflect the coherence of language  its redundancy as a signal   This idea was a partial inheritance from the old  information theoretic  view of language  for her  it meant that processes analysing language must take into account its repetitive and redundant structures and that a writer goes on saying the same thing again and again in different ways  only if the writer does that can the ambiguities be removed from the signal   This sometimes led her to overemphasise the real and explicit redundancy she would find in rhythmical and repetitive verse and claim  implausibly  that normal English was just like that if only we could see it right 
This led in later years to the key role she assigned to rhythm  stress  breathgroupings and the boundaries they impose on text and the processes of understanding   To put it crudely  her claim was that languages are the way they are  at least in part  because they are produced by creatures that breathe at fairly regular intervals   It will be obvious why such claims could not even be entertained while Chomsky s views were preeminent in language studies  However she could never give systematic surface criteria by which the breathgroups and stress patterns were to be identified by surface cues  or could be reduced to other criteria such as syntax or morphology  nor would she become involved in the actual physics of voice patterns 
Her views on the importance of semantics in language processing  which  she continued to defend in the high years of Chomskyan syntax between      and       were much influenced by R  H  Richens  views on classification and description by means of a language of semantic primitives with its own syntax    These  along with associated claims about semantic pattern matching onto surface text  were developed in actual programs  from which it might be assumed that she was a straightforward believer in the existence of semantic primitives in some Katzian or Schankian sense   Nothing could be further from the truth  for she was far too much a Wittgensteinian sceptic about the ability of any limited sublanguage or logic to take on the role of the whole language   She always argued that semantic primitives would only make sense if there were empirical criteria for their discovery and a theory that allowed for the fact that they  too  would develop exactly the polysemy of any higher or natural language  and she always emphasised the functional role of primitives in  for example  resolving sense ambiguity and as an interlingua for MT 
She hoped that the escape from the problem of the origin of semantic primitives would lie in either empirical classification procedures operating on actual texts  in the way some now speak of deriving primitives by massive connectionist learning   or by having an adequate formal theory of the structure of thesauri  which she believed to make explicit certain underlying structures of the semantic relations in a natural language  a theory such that  primitives  would emerge naturally as the organizing classification of thesauri   For some years  she and colleagues explored lattice theory as the underlying formal structure of such thesauri 
Two other concerns that went through her intellectual life owe much to the period when Michael Halliday  as the University Lecturer in Chinese at Cambridge  was a colleague at C L R U   She got from him the idea that syntactic theory was fundamentally semantic or pragmatic  in either its categories and their fundamental definition  or in terms of the role of syntax as an organizing principle for semantic information   She was the first AI researcher to be influenced by Halliday  long before Terry Winograd  Again  she became preoccupied for a considerable period with the nature and function of Chinese ideograms  because she felt they clarified in an empirical way problems that Wittgenstein had wrestled with in his so called picture theory of truth    This led her to exaggerate the generality of ideogrammatic principles and to seem to hold that English was really rather like Chinese if only seen correctly  with its meaning atoms  highly ambiguous and virtually uninflected   It was a view that found little or no sympathy in the dominant linguistic or computational currents of the time 
Her main creation in       one which endured for twenty years  was the Cambridge Language Research Unit  which grew out of an informal discussion group with a very heterogeneous membership interested in language from philosophical and computational points of view   Subsequently  the attempt to build language processing programs which had a sound philosophical basis was a distinctive feature of the Unit s work   This approach to language processing  and the specific form it took in the use of a thesaurus as the main vehicle for semantic operations  will probably come to be seen as the Unit s major contributions to the field as a whole  and it was Margaret who was primarily responsible for them   Her vision of language processing and its possibilities was remarkable at a time when computers were very rudimentary  indeed much of the C L R U  s work had to be done on the predecessors of computers  namely Hollerith punched card machines   Equally  Margaret s determination in establishing and maintaining the Unit  with the enormous effort in fund raising that this involved  was very striking  the fact that it could continue for decades  and through periods when public support for such work was hard to come by  is a tribute to Margaret s persistence and charm   It is difficult for us now  in these days of artificial intelligence in the ordinary market place  and very powerful personal computers  to realise how hard it was to get the financial resources needed for language processing research  and the technical resources to do actual experiments 
Perhaps the best comment on Margaret s initiative in embarking on language processing research  and specifically on machine translation work  comes from a somewhat unexpected source   Machine translation  after an initial period of high hopes  and some large claims  was cast into outer darkness in      by funding agencies who saw little return for their money  Reviewing twenty five years of artificial intelligence research in his presidential address to the American Association for Artificial Intelligence in       Woody Bledsoe  one of the long standing leaders of the field  though in areas quite outside language  said of those who attempted machine translation in the fifties and sixties   They may have failed  but they were right to try  we have learned so much from their attempts to do something so difficult  
What she and C L R U  were trying to do was far ahead of its time    Efforts were made to tackle fundamental problems with the computers of the day that had the capacity of a modern digital wrist watch   Despite every kind of problem  the Unit produced numerous publications on language and related subjects  including information retrieval and automatic classification    For over ten years the Unit s presence was strongly felt in the field  always with an emphasis on basic semantic problems of language understanding    Margaret had no time for those who felt that all that needed doing was syntactic parsing  or that complete parsing was necessary before you did anything else   Now that the semantics of language are regarded as a basic part of its understanding by machine  the ideas of C L R U  seem curiously modern 
Margaret s main contribution to the life of CLRU was in the continual intellectual stimulus she gave to its research  and through this to the larger natural language processing community  she had wide ranging concerns  and lateral ideas  which led her  for example  to propose the thesaurus as a means of carrying out many distinct language processing tasks  like indexing and translation   Margaret s emphasis on algorithms  and on testing them  was vital for the development of CLRU s work on language processing  but her ideas were notable  especially for those who worked with her  not just for their Intellectual qualities  but for their sheer joyousness 
Serious research stopped at CLRU about      and Margaret tried to restart the CLRU in      with William Williams            in the hope that the new breed of micro computers could be used to develop her algorithms for natural language translation  Margaret walked the   miles from Millington Road in Cambridge to Orwell and purchased two North Star Horizon computers from Intelligent Artefacts  see ST Robotics   These were installed with the Forth programming language  written by David Sands and used by various students from the University of Cambridge who programmed Margaret s algorithms into the computers  Margaret s approach to natural language translation at this time was to split a sentence into  breath group  segments  Since each breath group had a unique meaning it could be translated into the target language and the target sentence reconstructed using the translated breath groups  This contrasted with the predominant language translation techniques of the time  notably Systran which used a dictionary and rule based system still used today  When Margaret died in      William Williams closed down CLRU and its unique library of early MT documents were dumped into a skip  even though two university bodies had offered to give it a home 
She was one of cofounders of Lucy Cavendish College and its first Vice President              She was a great niece of Lucy Cavendish after whom the college is named  She also was a founder and the major inspiration of the Epiphany Philosophers  a group which shared some membership with the CLRU and was dedicated to the study of the relationship of science and religion and the forms of religious practice 
In       Margaret Masterman read the work   The Nature of a Paradigm  at the Fourth International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science  in London             She conducted a detailed textual criticism of Thomas S  Kuhn s book  The Structure of Scientific Revolutions         characterizing the book as  at once scientifically perspicuous and philosophically obscure    Masterman praised Kuhn as  one of the outstanding philosophers of science of our time  and his concept of paradigms as  a fundamental idea and a new one in the philosophy of science    She criticised Thomas Kuhn for his vague and inconsistent use of the concept  Paradigm   noting that it is used in at least    different senses  which can be summarized in three groups   metaparadigms  sociological paradigms  and artefact or construct paradigms  Masterman proposed that Kuhn s critics in the philosophy of science dealt only with metaparadigms and explored the insights and implications of the various conceptions   This criticism was accepted by Thomas Kuhn and was crucial in the shift of the concept  Paradigm  to  Incommensurability
