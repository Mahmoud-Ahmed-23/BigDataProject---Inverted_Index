Yuval Noah Harari  Hebrew                    ju val  noa  ha  a i       born                  is an Israeli medievalist  military historian  public intellectual                                   and popular science writer  He currently serves as professor in the Department of History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem             His first bestselling book  Sapiens  A Brief History of Humankind        is based on his lectures to an undergraduate world history class  His other works include the bestsellers Homo Deus  A Brief History of Tomorrow            Lessons for the   st Century         and Nexus  A Brief History of Information Networks from the Stone Age to AI         His published work examines themes of free will  consciousness  intelligence  happiness  suffering and the role of storytelling in human evolution                                              
In Sapiens  Harari writes about a  cognitive revolution  that supposedly occurred roughly        years ago when Homo sapiens supplanted the rival Neanderthals and other species of the genus Homo  developed language skills and structured societies  and ascended as apex predators  aided by the First Agricultural Revolution and accelerated by the Scientific Revolution  which have allowed humans to approach near mastery over their environment  Furthermore  he examines the possible consequences of a futuristic biotechnological world in which intelligent biological organisms are surpassed by their own creations  he has said   Homo sapiens as we know them will disappear in a century or so              Although Harari s books have received considerable commercial success since the publication of Sapiens  his work has been more negatively received in academic circles             


Early life and education edit 
Yuval Noah Harari was born and raised in Kiryat Ata  Israel  as one of three children born to Shlomo and Pnina Harari and raised in a secular Jewish family of Bucovinian             and Polish Jewish descent  His father  Shlomo Harari  born Blajberg              was a state employed armaments engineer  and his mother  Pnina  born Luttinger  was an office administrator                                     Harari taught himself to read at age three             He studied in a class for intellectually gifted children at the Leo Baeck Education Center in Haifa from the age of eight  He deferred mandatory military service in the Israel Defense Forces to pursue university studies as part of the Atuda program but was later exempted from completing his military service following his studies due to health issues             He began studying history and international relations at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem at age                
Harari studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem from      to       where he received a BA degree and specialized in medieval history and military history  He completed his DPhil degree at the University of Oxford in      where he was a postgraduate student of Jesus College  Oxford supervised by Steven J  Gunn              From      to       he pursued postdoctoral studies in history as a Yad Hanadiv Fellow              While at Oxford  Harari first encountered the work of Jared Diamond  whom he has acknowledged as an influence on his own writing  At a Berggruen Institute salon  Harari said that Diamond s Guns  Germs  and Steel  was kind of an epiphany in my academic career  I realized that I could actually write such books                         

Career edit 
Harari has published multiple books and articles  including Special Operations in the Age of Chivalry                         The Ultimate Experience  Battlefield Revelations and the Making of Modern War Culture                         The Concept of  Decisive Battles  in World History              and Armchairs  Coffee and Authority  Eye witnesses and Flesh witnesses Speak about War                        
His book Sapiens  A Brief History of Humankind was originally published in Hebrew in      based on the    lectures of an undergraduate world history class he was teaching  It was then released in English in      and has since been translated into some    languages              The book surveys the entire length of human history  starting from the evolution of Homo sapiens in the Stone Age  Harari compares indigenous peoples to apes             in his fall of man narrative              leading up to the political and technological revolutions of the   st century  The Hebrew edition became a bestseller in Israel  and generated much interest among the general public                          Joseph Drew wrote that  Sapiens provides a wide ranging and thought provoking introduction for students of comparative civilization   considering it as a work that  highlights the importance and wide expanse of the social sciences              
Harari s follow up book  Homo Deus  A Brief History of Tomorrow  was published in      and examines the possibilities for the future of Homo sapiens              The book s premise outlines that  in the future  humanity is likely to make a significant attempt to gain happiness  immortality and God like powers              The book goes on to openly speculate various ways this ambition might be realised for Homo sapiens in the future based on the past and present  Among several possibilities for the future  Harari develops the term dataism for a philosophy or mindset that worships big data                          Writing in The New York Times Book Review  Siddhartha Mukherjee stated that although the book  fails to convince me entirely   he considers it  essential reading for those who think about the future              
Harari s book     Lessons for the   st Century  published on    August       focused more on present day concerns                                                  A review in the New Statesman commented on what it called  risible moral dictums littered throughout the text   criticised Harari s writing style and stated that he was  trafficking in pointless asides and excruciating banalities               Kirkus Reviews praised the book as a  tour de force  and described it as a  highly instructive exploration of current affairs and the immediate future of human societies              
In July       Harari was criticised for allowing several omissions and amendments in the Russian edition of his third book    Lessons for the   st Century  using a softer tone when speaking about Russian authorities                          Leonid Bershidsky in The Moscow Times called it  caution or  to call it by its proper name  cowardice               and Nettanel Slyomovics in Haaretz claimed that  he is sacrificing those same liberal ideas that he presumes to represent               In a response  Harari stated that he  was warned that due to these few examples Russian censorship will not allow distribution of a Russian translation of the book  and that he  therefore faced a dilemma   namely to  replace these few examples with other examples  and publish the book in Russia   or  change nothing  and publish nothing   and that he  preferred publishing  because Russia is a leading global power and it seemed important that the book s ideas should reach readers in Russia  especially as the book is still very critical of the Putin regime just without naming names              
In November      the first volume of his graphic adaptation of Sapiens  A Brief History of Humankind  Sapiens  A Graphic History   The Birth of Humankind  co authored with David Vandermeulen and Daniel Casanave  was published and launched at a livestream event organised by How to Academy and Penguin Books             
In       Harari s book  Unstoppable Us  How Humans Took Over the World  illustrated by Ricard Zaplana Ruiz  was published and is a  Story of Human History   for Kids               In fewer than     pages of child friendly language  Harari covers the same content as his best selling book Sapiens  A Brief History of Humankind  but  he has simplified the presentation for this younger audience without dumbing it down               This book is  the first of four planned volumes

Critical reception edit 
Harari s popular publications are considered to belong to the Big History genre  with Ian Parker writing in      in The New Yorker that  Harari did not invent Big History  but updated it with hints of self help and futurology  as well as a high altitude  almost nihilistic composure about human suffering             
His work has been more negatively received in academic circles  with Christopher Robert Hallpike stating in a      review of Sapiens that  one has often had to point out how surprisingly little he seems to have read on quite a number of essential topics  It would be fair to say that whenever his facts are broadly correct they are not new  and whenever he tries to strike out on his own he often gets things wrong  sometimes seriously   Hallpike further states that  we should not judge Sapiens as a serious contribution to knowledge but as  infotainment   a publishing event to titillate its readers by a wild intellectual ride across the landscape of history  dotted with sensational displays of speculation  and ending with blood curdling predictions about human destiny  By these criteria  it is a most successful book              
In       philosopher Mike W  Martin criticized Harari s view in a journal article  stating that   Harari  misunderstands human rights  inflates the role of science in moral matters  and fails to reconcile his moral passion with his moral skepticism              
In July       the American magazine Current Affairs published an article titled  The Dangerous Populist Science of Yuval Noah Harari  by neuroscientist Darshana Narayanan  which pointed to the lack of scientific rigor in his books   The best selling author is a gifted storyteller and popular speaker   she wrote   But he sacrifices science for sensationalism  and his work is riddled with errors              
In November       the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung called Harari a historian and a brand  It pointed out that the Yahav Harari Group  built by his partner Yahav  was a  booming product cosmos  selling comics and children s books  and soon films and documentaries  It observed an  icy deterministic touch  in his books  which made them so popular in Silicon Valley  It stated that his listeners celebrated him like a pop star  although he only had the sad message that people are  bad algorithms   soon to be redundant  to be replaced because machines could do it better             
Russian philosopher Aleksandr Dugin has singled out Harari s  inclination towards a post human existence  as evidence that the modern Western world is  the civilization of the Antichrist   which he argues that Russia and the Islamic world are justified in opposing             

Awards and recognition edit 
Harari twice won the Polonsky Prize for  Creativity and Originality   in      and       In       he won the Society for Military History s Moncado Award for outstanding articles in military history              In       he was elected to the Young Israeli Academy of Sciences             
Sapiens was in the top   of The New York Times Best Seller list for    consecutive weeks  In       Harari gave the first TED Talk as a digital avatar                         
In       Homo Deus won Handelsblatt s German Economic Book Award for the most thoughtful and influential economic book of the year             
In      and       Harari spoke at the World Economic Forum annual conference in Davos            

Personal life edit 
Harari is gay              and in      met his husband Itzik Yahav                          Yahav has also been Harari s personal manager              They married in a civil ceremony in Toronto  Canada  since Israel recognizes civil marriages  same sex or opposite sex  only if conducted abroad  and no recognized religious institution in Israel arranges same sex marriages                          He lives in a middle class suburb of Tel Aviv             
Though he is an atheist              Harari has practiced Vipassana meditation since                  and said that it  transformed  his life              As of      he practiced for two hours every day  one hour each at the start and end of his work day               every year undertook a meditation retreat of    days or longer  in silence and with no books or social media                                      and is an assistant meditation teacher              He dedicated Homo Deus to  my teacher  S  N  Goenka  who lovingly taught me important things   and said  I could not have written this book without the focus  peace and insight gained from practising Vipassana for fifteen years               He also regards meditation as a way to research             
Harari is a vegan and says this resulted from his research  including his view that the foundation of the dairy industry is breaking the bond between mother cow and calf                          As of May       Harari did not have a smartphone                          but in an interview in October       he explained that he owned a smartphone only for use in travel and emergencies             
During the COVID    pandemic  following former United States President Donald Trump s cut to WHO funding  Harari announced that he and his husband would donate         million to the WHO through Sapienship  their social impact company                         
Harari is among the critics of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  and is specifically opposed to the judicial reform plans of the thirty seventh government of Israel  In a conversation with Lex Fridman in      he said       And now the Netanyahu government is trying to neutralize  or take over  the supreme court  and they ve already prepared a long list of laws   they already talk about it   that will be passed the moment that this last check on the power is gone  they are openly trying to gain unlimited power
