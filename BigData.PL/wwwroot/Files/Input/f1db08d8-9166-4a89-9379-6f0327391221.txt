History edit 
Andrew Carnegie  founder of the Carnegie Technical Schools Andrew Mellon  co founder of the Mellon Institute 
The Carnegie Technical Schools were founded in      in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania             by the Scottish American industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie  who wrote  My heart is in the work   when he donated the funds to create the institution  Carnegie s vision was to open a vocational training school for the sons and daughters of working class Pittsburghers  many of whom worked in his mills  Carnegie was inspired for the design of his school by the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn  New York  founded by industrialist Charles Pratt in                   In       the institution changed its name to Carnegie Institute of Technology  CIT  and began offering four year degrees  During this time  CIT consisted of four constituent schools  the School of Fine and Applied Arts  the School of Apprentices and Journeymen  the School of Science and Technology  and the Margaret Morrison Carnegie School for Women 
The Mellon Institute of Industrial Research was founded in      by banker and industrialist brothers Andrew Mellon  who went on to become U S  Treasury Secretary  and Richard B  Mellon in honor of their father  Thomas Mellon  patriarch of the Mellon family  The Institute began as a research organization that performed contract work for government and industry  initially as a department within the University of Pittsburgh  In       the Mellon Institute was incorporated as an independent nonprofit  In       the Mellon Institute s iconic building was completed on Fifth Avenue             
In       with support from Paul Mellon  the Carnegie Institute of Technology merged with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research to become Carnegie Mellon University  In       Carnegie Mellon s coordinate women s college  the Margaret Morrison Carnegie College  merged its academic programs with the rest of the university              The industrial research mission of the Mellon Institute survived the merger as the Carnegie Mellon Research Institute  CMRI  and continued doing work on contract to industry and government  In       CMRI s programs were subsumed by other parts of the university or spun off into autonomous entities             

Campus edit 
Overview edit 
The main campus in Pittsburgh as seen from the   th floor of the Cathedral of Learning at the University of Pittsburgh  August     
Carnegie Mellon s       acre          ha  main campus is five miles         km  from downtown Pittsburgh  between Schenley Park and the neighborhoods of Squirrel Hill  Shadyside  and Oakland             Carnegie Mellon is bordered to the west by the campus of the University of Pittsburgh  Carnegie Mellon owns    buildings in the Oakland and Squirrel Hill neighborhoods of Pittsburgh 
For decades  the center of student life on campus was Skibo Hall  the university s student union  Built in the     s  Skibo Hall s design was typical of mid century modern architecture but was poorly equipped to deal with advances in computer and internet connectivity  The original Skibo Hall was razed in the summer of      and replaced by a new student union that is fully Wi Fi enabled  Known as the University Center  the building was dedicated in       In       Carnegie Mellon re dedicated the University Center as the Cohon University Center in recognition of the eighth president of the university  Jared Cohon             
A large grassy area known as  The Cut  forms the backbone of the campus  with a separate grassy area known as  The Mall  running perpendicular  The Cut was formed by filling in a ravine  hence the name  with soil from a nearby hill that was leveled to build the College of Fine Arts building 
The northwestern part of the campus  home to Hamburg Hall  Newell Simon Hall  Smith Hall  and Gates Hillman Complex  was acquired from the United States Bureau of Mines in the     s 
Carnegie Mellon has been purchasing      renewable energy for its electricity since                       additional citation s  needed

Campus architecture and design edit 
The campus began to take shape in the Beaux Arts architecture style of George Carnegie Palmer and Henry Hornbostel of Palmer  amp  Hornbostel  winners of the      competition to design the original institution and later the founder of the Carnegie Mellon School of Architecture             
There was little change to the campus between the first and second World War  A      master plan by Githens and Keally suggested acquisition of new land along Forbes Avenue  but the plan was not fully implemented  The period starting with the construction of the Hall of the Arts building  former home of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration  in      and ending with Wean Hall in      saw the institutional change from Carnegie Institute of Technology to Carnegie Mellon University  New facilities were needed to respond to the university s growing national reputation in artificial intelligence  business  robotics and the arts  In addition  an expanding student population demanded improved facilities for student life  athletics and libraries  The campus finally expanded to Forbes Avenue from its original land along Schenley Park 

Hamerschlag  Roberts  and Scott Halls are three of the teaching facilities of the College of Engineering
The buildings of this era reflected contemporary architectural styles  The International Style  with its rejection of historical tradition and its emphases on functionalism and expression of structure  had been in vogue in European settings since the     s  It came late to the Carnegie Mellon campus because of the hiatus in building activity and a general reluctance among American universities to abandon historical styles  By the     s  the International Style was adopted to accomplish needed expansion quickly and affordably with the swelling of student ranks in the aftermath of the GI Bill in       Each building was a unique architectural statement that may have acknowledged the existing campus in its placement  but not in its form or materials 
During the     s and     s  the tenure of president Richard Cyert             witnessed a period of growth and development  The research budget grew from roughly     million annually in the early     s to more than      million in the late     s  Researchers in new fields like robotics and software engineering helped the university to build its reputation  One example was the introduction of the  Andrew  computing network in the mid     s  This project linking all computers and workstations on campus set the standard for educational computing and established Carnegie Mellon as a technology leader in education and research  On April           cmu edu  Carnegie Mellon s Internet domain  became one of the first six  edu domain names 

Since the     s edit

In       Carnegie Mellon Trustee Jill Gansman Kraus donated the    foot          m  tall sculpture Walking to the Sky  which was placed on the lawn facing Forbes Avenue between the Cohon University Center and Warner Hall  The sculpture was controversial for its placement  the general lack of input from the campus community  and its  lack of  aesthetic appeal
