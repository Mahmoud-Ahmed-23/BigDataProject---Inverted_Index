Transhumanism is a philosophical and intellectual movement that advocates the enhancement of the human condition by developing and making widely available new and future technologies that can greatly enhance longevity  cognition  and well being                                  
Transhumanist thinkers study the potential benefits and dangers of emerging technologies that could overcome fundamental human limitations  as well as the ethics of using such technologies             Some transhumanists speculate that human beings may eventually be able to transform themselves into beings of such vastly greater abilities as to merit the label of posthuman beings            
Another topic of transhumanist research is how to protect humanity against existential risks from artificial general intelligence  asteroid impact  gray goo  high energy particle collision experiments  natural or synthetic pandemic  and nuclear warfare            
The biologist Julian Huxley popularised the term  transhumanism  in a      essay             The contemporary meaning of the term was foreshadowed by one of the first professors of futurology  a man who changed his name to FM       In the     s  he taught  new concepts of the human  at The New School when he began to identify people who adopt technologies  lifestyles  and worldviews  transitional  to posthumanity as  transhuman              The assertion laid the intellectual groundwork for the British philosopher Max More to begin articulating the principles of transhumanism as a futurist philosophy in       organizing in California a school of thought that has since grown into the worldwide transhumanist movement                                  
Influenced by seminal works of science fiction  the transhumanist vision of a transformed future humanity has attracted many supporters and detractors from a wide range of perspectives  including philosophy and religion            
In       Penn State University Press  in cooperation with philosopher Stefan Lorenz Sorgner and sociologist James Hughes  established the Journal of Posthuman Studies             as the first academic journal explicitly dedicated to the posthuman  with the goal of clarifying the notions of posthumanism and transhumanism  as well as comparing and contrasting both 


History edit 
Precursors of transhumanism edit 
According to Nick Bostrom  transcendentalist impulses have been expressed at least as far back as the quest for immortality in the Epic of Gilgamesh  as well as in historical quests for the Fountain of Youth  the Elixir of Life  and other efforts to stave off aging and death            
Transhumanists draw upon and claim continuity from intellectual and cultural traditions such as the ancient philosophy of Aristotle or the scientific tradition of Roger Bacon              In his Divine Comedy  Dante coined the word trasumanar meaning  to transcend human nature  to pass beyond human nature  in the first canto of Paradiso                                                 
The interweaving of transhumanist aspirations with the scientific imagination can be seen in the works of some precursors of Enlightenment such as Francis Bacon                          One of the early precursors to transhumanist ideas is Ren  Descartes s Discourse on Method         in which Descartes envisions a new kind of medicine that can grant both physical immortality and stronger minds             
In his first edition of Political Justice         William Godwin included arguments favoring the possibility of  earthly immortality   what would now be called physical immortality   Godwin explored the themes of life extension and immortality in his gothic novel St       Leon  which became popular  and notorious  at the time of its publication in       but is now mostly forgotten  St       Leon may have inspired his daughter Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein             
Ether Day  marking a significant milestone in human history  celebrated its    th anniversary on October           It was on this day that dentist William T  G  Morton achieved a groundbreaking feat by administering the first public ether anesthesia in Boston  This breakthrough not only allowed for the alleviation of pain with a reasonable level of risk but also helped protect people from psychological trauma by inducing unconsciousness             
There is debate about whether the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche can be considered an influence on transhumanism  despite its exaltation of the  bermensch  overhuman   due to its emphasis on self actualization rather than technological transformation                                                 The transhumanist philosophies of More and Sorgner have been influenced strongly by Nietzschean thinking              By contrast  The Transhumanist Declaration  advocates the well being of all sentience  whether in artificial intellects  humans  posthumans  or non human animals               
The late   th  to early   th century movement known as Russian cosmism  by Russian philosopher N  F  Fyodorov  is noted for anticipating transhumanist ideas              In       FM       formerly F  M  Esfandiary   a futurist who taught  new concepts of the human  at The New School  in New York City  began to identify people who adopt technologies  lifestyles and worldviews transitional to posthumanity as  transhuman              

Early transhumanist thinking edit 
Julian Huxley  the biologist who popularised the term transhumanism in an influential      essay           
Fundamental ideas of transhumanism were first advanced in      by the British geneticist J  B  S  Haldane in his essay Daedalus  Science and the Future  which predicted that great benefits would come from the application of advanced sciences to human biology and that every such advance would first appear to someone as blasphemy or perversion   indecent and unnatural               In particular  he was interested in the development of the science of eugenics  ectogenesis  creating and sustaining life in an artificial environment   and the application of genetics to improve human characteristics such as health and intelligence 
His article inspired academic and popular interest  J  D  Bernal  a crystallographer at Cambridge  wrote The World  the Flesh and the Devil in       in which he speculated on the prospects of space colonization and radical changes to human bodies and intelligence through bionic implants and cognitive enhancement              These ideas have been common transhumanist themes ever since            
The biologist Julian Huxley is generally regarded as the founder of transhumanism after using the term for the title of an influential      article             But the term derives from a      paper by the Canadian philosopher W  D  Lighthall              Huxley describes transhumanism in these terms 

Up till now human life has generally been  as Hobbes described it   nasty  brutish and short   the great majority of human beings  if they have not already died young  have been afflicted with misery  we can justifiably hold the belief that these lands of possibility exist  and that the present limitations and miserable frustrations of our existence could be in large measure surmounted  The human species can  if it wishes  transcend itself not just sporadically  an individual here in one way  an individual there in another way  but in its entirety  as humanity            
Huxley s definition differs  albeit not substantially  from the one commonly in use since the     s  The ideas raised by these thinkers were explored in the science fiction of the     s  notably in Arthur C  Clarke s       A Space Odyssey  in which an alien artifact grants transcendent power to its wielder             

Japanese Metabolist architects produced a manifesto in      which outlined goals to  encourage active metabolic development of our society              through design and technology  In the Material and Man section of the manifesto  Noboru Kawazoe suggests that After several decades  with the rapid progress of communication technology  every one will have a  brain wave receiver  in his ear  which conveys directly and exactly what other people think about him and vice versa  What I think will be known by all the people  There is no more individual consciousness  only the will of mankind as a whole             
Artificial intelligence and the technological singularity edit 
The concept of the technological singularity  or the ultra rapid advent of superhuman intelligence  was first proposed by the British cryptologist I  J  Good in      

Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever  Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities  an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines  there would then unquestionably be an  intelligence explosion   and the intelligence of man would be left far behind  Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make             
Computer scientist Marvin Minsky wrote on relationships between human and artificial intelligence beginning in the     s              Over the succeeding decades  this field continued to generate influential thinkers  such as Hans Moravec and Ray Kurzweil  who oscillated between the technical arena and futuristic speculations in the transhumanist vein                          The coalescence of an identifiable transhumanist movement began in the last decades of the   th century  In       Robert Ettinger  whose      Prospect of Immortality founded the cryonics movement              contributed to the conceptualization of  transhumanity  with his      Man into Superman              FM      published the Upwingers Manifesto in                  

Growth of transhumanism edit 
See also  List of transhumanists
The first self described transhumanists met formally in the early     s at the University of California  Los Angeles  which became the main center of transhumanist thought  Here  FM      lectured on his  Third Way  futurist ideology              At the EZTV Media venue  frequented by transhumanists and other futurists  Natasha Vita More presented Breaking Away  her      experimental film with the theme of humans breaking away from their biological limitations and the Earth s gravity as they head into space                          FM      and Vita More soon began holding gatherings for transhumanists in Los Angeles  which included students from FM      s courses and audiences from Vita More s artistic productions  In       Vita More authored the Transhumanist Arts Statement             and in      she produced the cable TV show TransCentury Update on transhumanity  a program that reached over         viewers 
In       Eric Drexler published Engines of Creation  The Coming Era of Nanotechnology              which discussed the prospects for nanotechnology and molecular assemblers  and founded the Foresight Institute  As the first nonprofit organization to research  advocate for  and perform cryonics  the Southern California offices of the Alcor Life Extension Foundation became a center for futurists  In       the first issue of Extropy Magazine was published by Max More and Tom Morrow  In       More  a strategic philosopher  created his own particular transhumanist doctrine  which took the form of the Principles of Extropy  and laid the foundation of modern transhumanism by giving it a new definition             

Transhumanism is a class of philosophies that seek to guide us towards a posthuman condition  Transhumanism shares many elements of humanism  including a respect for reason and science  a commitment to progress  and a valuing of human  or transhuman  existence in this life        Transhumanism differs from humanism in recognizing and anticipating the radical alterations in the nature and possibilities of our lives resulting from various sciences and technologies      
In       More and Morrow founded the Extropy Institute  a catalyst for networking futurists and brainstorming new memeplexes by organizing a series of conferences and  more importantly  providing a mailing list  which exposed many to transhumanist views for the first time during the rise of cyberculture and the cyberdelic counterculture  In       philosophers Nick Bostrom and David Pearce founded the World Transhumanist Association  WTA   an international non governmental organization working toward the recognition of transhumanism as a legitimate subject of scientific inquiry and public policy              In       the WTA modified and adopted The Transhumanist Declaration                                      The Transhumanist FAQ  prepared by the WTA  later Humanity    gave two formal definitions for transhumanism             


The intellectual and cultural movement that affirms the possibility and desirability of fundamentally improving the human condition through applied reason  especially by developing and making widely available technologies to eliminate aging and to greatly enhance human intellectual  physical  and psychological capacities 
The study of the ramifications  promises  and potential dangers of technologies that will enable us to overcome fundamental human limitations  and the related study of the ethical matters involved in developing and using such technologies 
In possible contrast with other transhumanist organizations  WTA officials considered that social forces could undermine their futurist visions and needed to be addressed             A particular concern is equal access to human enhancement technologies across classes and borders              In       a political struggle within the transhumanist movement between the libertarian right and the liberal left resulted in a more centre leftward positioning of the WTA under its former executive director James Hughes                          In       the board of directors of the Extropy Institute ceased operations of the organization  saying that its mission was  essentially completed               This left the World Transhumanist Association as the leading international transhumanist organization  In       as part of a rebranding effort  the WTA changed its name to  Humanity                In       the transhumanist Longevity Party had been initiated as an international union of people who promote the development of scientific and technological means to significant life extension that now has more than    national organisations throughout the world                         
The Mormon Transhumanist Association was founded in                   By       it had hundreds of members             
The first transhumanist elected member of a parliament was Giuseppe Vatinno  in Italy             

Theory edit 
It is a matter of debate whether transhumanism is a branch of posthumanism and how this philosophical movement should be conceptualised with regard to transhumanism                          Transhumanism is often referred to as a variant or activist form of posthumanism by its conservative              Christian             and progressive                         critics             
A common feature of transhumanism and philosophical posthumanism is the future vision of a new intelligent species  into which humanity will evolve and which eventually will supplement or supersede it  Transhumanism stresses the evolutionary perspective  including sometimes the creation of a highly intelligent animal species by way of cognitive enhancement  i e  biological uplift              but clings to a  posthuman future  as the final goal of participant evolution                         
Nevertheless  the idea of creating intelligent artificial beings  proposed  for example  by roboticist Hans Moravec  has influenced transhumanism              Moravec s ideas and transhumanism have also been characterised as a  complacent  or  apocalyptic  variant of posthumanism and contrasted with  cultural posthumanism  in humanities and the arts              While such a  cultural posthumanism  would offer resources for rethinking the relationships between humans and increasingly sophisticated machines  transhumanism and similar posthumanisms are  in this view  not abandoning obsolete concepts of the  autonomous liberal subject   but are expanding its  prerogatives  into the realm of the posthuman              Transhumanist self characterisations as a continuation of humanism and Enlightenment thinking correspond with this view 
Some secular humanists conceive transhumanism as an offspring of the humanist freethought movement and argue that transhumanists differ from the humanist mainstream by having a specific focus on technological approaches to resolving human concerns  i e  technocentrism  and on the issue of mortality              Other progressives have argued that posthumanism  in its philosophical or activist forms  amounts to a shift away from concerns about social justice  from the reform of human institutions and from other Enlightenment preoccupations  toward narcissistic longings to transcend the human body in quest of more exquisite ways of being             
The philosophy of transhumanism is closely related to technoself studies  an interdisciplinary domain of scholarly research dealing with all aspects of human identity in a technological society and focusing on the changing nature of relationships between humans and technology             

Aims edit 
You awake one morning to find your brain has another lobe functioning  Invisible  this auxiliary lobe answers your questions with information beyond the realm of your own memory  suggests plausible courses of action  and asks questions that help bring out relevant facts  You quickly come to rely on the new lobe so much that you stop wondering how it works  You just use it  This is the dream of artificial intelligence         Byte  April                 
 Ray Kurzweil believes that a countdown to when  human life will be irreversibly transformed  can be made through plotting major world events on a graph 
While many transhumanist theorists and advocates seek to apply reason  science and technology to reduce poverty  disease  disability  and malnutrition around the globe              transhumanism is distinctive in its particular focus on the applications of technologies to the improvement of human bodies at the individual level  Many transhumanists actively assess the potential for future technologies and innovative social systems to improve the quality of all life  while seeking to make the material reality of the human condition fulfill the promise of legal and political equality by eliminating congenital mental and physical barriers 
Transhumanist philosophers argue that there not only exists a perfectionist ethical imperative for humans to strive for progress and improvement of the human condition  but that it is possible and desirable for humanity to enter a transhuman phase of existence in which humans enhance themselves beyond what is naturally human  In such a phase  natural evolution would be replaced with deliberate participatory or directed evolution 
Some theorists such as Ray Kurzweil think that the pace of technological innovation is accelerating and that the next    years may yield not only radical technological advances  but possibly a technological singularity  which may fundamentally change the nature of human beings              Transhumanists who foresee this massive technological change generally maintain that it is desirable  but some are concerned about the dangers of extremely rapid technological change and propose options for ensuring that advanced technology is used responsibly  For example  Bostrom has written extensively on existential risks to humanity s future welfare  including ones that emerging technologies could create              In contrast  some proponents of transhumanism view it as essential to humanity s survival  For instance  Stephen Hawking points out that the  external transmission  phase of human evolution  where knowledge production and knowledge management is more important than transmission of information via evolution  may be the point at which human civilization becomes unstable and self destructs  one of Hawking s explanations for the Fermi paradox  To counter this  Hawking emphasizes either self design of the human genome or mechanical enhancement  e g   brain computer interface  to enhance human intelligence and reduce aggression  without which he implies human civilization may be too stupid collectively to survive an increasingly unstable system  resulting in societal collapse             
While many people believe that all transhumanists are striving for immortality  that is not necessarily true  Hank Pellissier  managing director of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies              surveyed transhumanists  He found that  of the     respondents        did not want immortality              Some of the reasons argued were boredom  Earth s overpopulation  and the desire  to go to an afterlife              

Empathic fallibility and conversational consent edit 
See also  Uplift  science fiction 
Certain transhumanist philosophers hold that since all assumptions about what others experience are fallible  and that therefore all attempts to help or protect beings that are incapable of correcting what others assume about them  no matter how well intentioned  are in danger of actually hurting them  all sentient beings deserve to be sapient  These thinkers argue that the ability to discuss in a falsification based way constitutes a threshold that is not arbitrary at which it becomes possible for someone to speak for themself in a way that is independent of exterior assumptions  They also argue that all beings capable of experiencing something deserve to be elevated to this threshold if they are not at it  typically saying that the underlying change that leads to the threshold is an increase in the preciseness of the brain s ability to discriminate  This includes increasing the neuron count and connectivity in animals as well as accelerating the development of connectivity to shorten or ideally skip non sapient childhood incapable of independently deciding for oneself  Transhumanists of this description stress that the genetic engineering that they advocate is general insertion into both the somatic cells of living beings and in germ cells  and not purging of people without the modifications  deeming the latter not only unethical but also unnecessary due to the possibilities of efficient genetic engineering

Transhumanists engage in interdisciplinary approaches to understand and evaluate possibilities for overcoming biological limitations by drawing on futurology and various fields of ethics      citation needed      Unlike many philosophers  social critics  and activists who morally value preservation of natural systems  transhumanists see the concept of the specifically natural as problematically nebulous at best and an obstacle to progress at worst              In keeping with this  many prominent transhumanist advocates  such as Dan Agin  call transhumanism s critics  on the political right and left jointly   bioconservatives  or  bioluddites   the latter term alluding to the   th century anti industrialisation social movement that opposed the replacement of human manual labourers by machines             
A belief of counter transhumanism is that transhumanism can cause unfair human enhancement in many areas of life  but specifically on the social plane  This can be compared to steroid use  where athletes who use steroids in sports have an advantage over those who do not  The same disparity may happen when people have certain neural implants that give them an advantage in the workplace and in education              Additionally  according to M J  McNamee and S D  Edwards  many fear that the improvements afforded by a specific  privileged section of society will lead to a division of the human species into two different species              The idea of two human species  one at a great physical and economic advantage over with the other  is troublesome at best  One may be incapable of breeding with the other  and may by consequence of lower physical health and ability  be considered of a lower moral standing than the other             
Nick Bostrom has said that transhumanism advocates for the wellbeing of all sentient beings  including non human animals  extraterrestrials  and artificial forms of life              This view is reiterated by David Pearce  who advocates the use of biotechnology to eradicate suffering in all sentient beings             

Currents edit 
There is a variety of opinions within transhumanist thought  Many of the leading transhumanist thinkers hold views that are under constant revision and development              Some distinctive currents of transhumanism are identified and listed here in alphabetical order 

Abolitionism  the concept of using biotechnology to eradicate suffering in all sentient beings             
Democratic transhumanism  a political ideology synthesizing liberal democracy  social democracy  radical democracy and transhumanism             
Equalism  a socioeconomic theory based upon the idea that emerging technologies will put an end to social stratification through even distribution of resources in the technological singularity era             
Extropianism  an early school of transhumanist thought characterized by a set of principles advocating a proactive approach to human evolution

Technogaianism  an ecological ideology based upon the belief that emerging technologies can help restore Earth s environment and that developing safe  clean  alternative technology should therefore be an important goal of environmentalists             
Spirituality edit 
Although many transhumanists are atheists  agnostics  or secular humanists  some have religious or spiritual views              Despite the prevailing secular attitude  some transhumanists pursue hopes traditionally espoused by religions  such as immortality              while several controversial new religious movements from the late   th century have explicitly embraced transhumanist goals of transforming the human condition by applying technology to alter the mind and body  such as Ra lism              But most thinkers associated with the transhumanism focus on the practical goals of using technology to help achieve longer and healthier lives  while speculating that future understanding of neurotheology and the application of neurotechnology will enable humans to gain greater control of altered states of consciousness  which were commonly interpreted as spiritual experiences  and thus achieve more profound self knowledge              Transhumanist Buddhists have sought to explore areas of agreement between various types of Buddhism and Buddhist derived meditation and mind expanding neurotechnologies              They have been criticised for appropriating mindfulness as a tool for transcending humanness             
Some transhumanists believe in the compatibility between the human mind and computer hardware  with the theoretical implication that human consciousness may someday be transferred to alternative media  a speculative technique commonly known as mind uploading               One extreme formulation of this idea that interests some transhumanists is the proposal of the Omega Point by Christian cosmologist Frank Tipler  Drawing upon ideas in digitalism  Tipler has advanced the notion that the collapse of the Universe billions of years hence could create the conditions for the perpetuation of humanity in a simulated reality within a megacomputer and thus achieve a form of  posthuman godhood   Before Tipler  the term Omega Point was used by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin  a paleontologist and Jesuit theologian who saw an evolutionary telos in the development of an encompassing noosphere  a global consciousness                                       
Viewed from the perspective of some Christian thinkers  the idea of mind uploading is asserted to represent a denigration of the human body  characteristic of gnostic manichaean belief               Transhumanism and its presumed intellectual progenitors have also been described as neo gnostic by non Christian and secular commentators                           
The first dialogue between transhumanism and faith was a one day conference at the University of Toronto in                    Religious critics alone faulted transhumanism for offering no eternal truths or relationship with the divine  They commented that a philosophy bereft of these beliefs leaves humanity adrift in a foggy sea of postmodern cynicism and anomie  Transhumanists responded that such criticisms reflect a failure to look at the actual content of transhumanist philosophy  which  far from being cynical  is rooted in optimistic  idealistic attitudes that trace back to the Enlightenment               Following this dialogue  William Sims Bainbridge  a sociologist of religion  conducted a pilot study  published in the Journal of Evolution and Technology  suggesting that religious attitudes were negatively correlated with acceptance of transhumanist ideas and indicating that people with highly religious worldviews tended to perceive transhumanism as a direct  competitive  though ultimately futile  affront to their spiritual beliefs              
Since       the Mormon Transhumanist Association sponsors conferences and lectures on the intersection of technology and religion               The Christian Transhumanist Association              was established in      
Since       the American Academy of Religion holds a  Transhumanism and Religion  consultation during its annual meeting  where scholars in the field of religious studies seek to identify and critically evaluate any implicit religious beliefs that might underlie key transhumanist claims and assumptions  consider how transhumanism challenges religious traditions to develop their own ideas of the human future  in particular the prospect of human transformation  whether by technological or other means  and provide critical and constructive assessments of an envisioned future that place greater confidence in nanotechnology  robotics and information technology to achieve virtual immortality and create a superior posthuman species              
The physicist and transhumanist thinker Giulio Prisco states that  cosmist religions based on science  might be our best protection from reckless pursuit of superintelligence and other risky technologies                He also recognizes the importance of spiritual ideas  such as those of Russian Orthodox philosopher Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov  to the origins of the transhumanism movement 

Practice edit 
While some transhumanists     who       take an abstract and theoretical approach to the perceived benefits of emerging technologies  others have offered specific proposals for modifications to the human body  including heritable ones  Transhumanists are often concerned with methods of enhancing the human nervous system  Though some  such as Kevin Warwick  propose modification of the peripheral nervous system  the brain is considered the common denominator of personhood and is thus a primary focus of transhumanist ambitions              
In fact  Warwick has gone a lot further than merely making a proposal  In      he had a     electrode array surgically implanted into the median nerves of his left arm to link his nervous system directly with a computer and thus to also connect with the internet  As a consequence  he carried out a series of experiments  He was able to directly control a robot hand using his neural signals and to feel the force applied by the hand through feedback from the fingertips  He also experienced a form of ultrasonic sensory input and conducted the first purely electronic communication between his own nervous system and that of his wife who also had electrodes implanted              
As proponents of self improvement and body modification  transhumanists tend to use existing technologies and techniques that supposedly improve cognitive and physical performance  while engaging in routines and lifestyles designed to improve health and longevity               Depending on their age  some     who       transhumanists express concern that they will not live to reap the benefits of future technologies  However  many have a great interest in life extension strategies and in funding research in cryonics to make the latter a viable option of last resort  rather than remaining an unproven method              
While most transhumanist theory focuses on future technologies and the changes they may bring  many today are already involved in the practice on a very basic level  It is not uncommon for many to receive cosmetic changes to their physical form via cosmetic surgery  even if it is not required for health reasons  Human growth hormones attempt to alter the natural development of shorter children or those who have been born with a physical deficiency  Doctors prescribe medicines such as Ritalin and Adderall to improve cognitive focus  and many people take  lifestyle  drugs such as Viagra  Propecia  and Botox to restore aspects of youthfulness that have been lost in maturity              
Other transhumanists  such as cyborg artist Neil Harbisson  use technologies and techniques to improve their senses and perception of reality  Harbisson s antenna  which is permanently implanted in his skull  allows him to sense colours beyond human perception such as infrareds and ultraviolets              

Technologies of interest edit 
Main article  Human enhancement technologies
Transhumanists support the emergence and convergence of technologies including nanotechnology  biotechnology  information technology and cognitive science  NBIC   as well as hypothetical future technologies like simulated reality  artificial intelligence  superintelligence   D bioprinting  mind uploading  chemical brain preservation and cryonics  They believe that humans can and should use these technologies to become more than human               Therefore  they support the recognition or protection of cognitive liberty  morphological freedom and procreative liberty as civil liberties  so as to guarantee individuals the choice of using human enhancement technologies on themselves and their children               Some speculate that human enhancement techniques and other emerging technologies may facilitate more radical human enhancement no later than at the midpoint of the   st century  Kurzweil s book The Singularity is Near and Michio Kaku s book Physics of the Future outline various human enhancement technologies and give insight on how these technologies may impact the human race                          
Some reports on the converging technologies and NBIC concepts have criticised their transhumanist orientation and alleged science fictional character               At the same time  research on brain and body alteration technologies has been accelerated under the sponsorship of the U S  Department of Defense  which is interested in the battlefield advantages they would provide to the supersoldiers of the United States and its allies               There has already been a brain research program to  extend the ability to manage information   while military scientists are now looking at stretching the human capacity for combat to a maximum     hours without sleep              
Neuroscientist Anders Sandberg has been practicing on the method of scanning ultra thin sections of the brain  This method is being used to help better understand the architecture of the brain  It is currently being used on mice  This is the first step towards hypothetically uploading contents of the human brain  including memories and emotions  onto a computer                           


Debate edit 
The very notion and prospect of human enhancement and related issues arouse public controversy               Criticisms of transhumanism and its proposals take two main forms  those objecting to the likelihood of transhumanist goals being achieved  practical criticisms  and those objecting to the moral principles or worldview sustaining transhumanist proposals or underlying transhumanism itself  ethical criticisms   Critics and opponents often see transhumanists  goals as posing threats to human values                           
The human enhancement debate is  for some  framed by the opposition between strong bioconservatism and transhumanism  The former opposes any form of human enhancement  whereas the latter advocates for all possible human enhancements               But many philosophers hold a more nuanced view in favour of some enhancements while rejecting the transhumanist carte blanche approach              
Transhumanists argue that parents have a moral responsibility called procreative beneficence to make use of these methods  if and when they are shown to be reasonably safe and effective  to have the healthiest children possible  They believe this responsibility is a moral judgment best left to individual conscience  rather than imposed by law  in all but extreme cases  In this context  the emphasis on freedom of choice is called procreative liberty              
Some of the best known critiques of the transhumanist program are novels and fictional films  These works  despite presenting imagined worlds rather than philosophical analyses  are touchstones for some of the more formal arguments             Various arguments have been made to the effect that a society that adopts human enhancement technologies may come to resemble the dystopia depicted in Aldous Huxley s      novel Brave New World              
Some authors consider humanity already transhuman  because recent medical advances have significantly altered our species  But this has not happened in a conscious and therefore transhumanistic way               From such a perspective  transhumanism is perpetually aspirational  as new technologies become mainstream  the adoption of still unadopted technologies becomes a new shifting goal 
Giuseppe Vattino  a member of Italy s parliament  believes transhumanism will make people  less subject to the whims of nature  such as illness or climate extremes               

Feasibility edit 
In a      book  sociologist Max Dublin pointed to many past failed predictions of technological progress and argued that modern futurist predictions would prove similarly inaccurate  He also objected to what he saw as scientism  fanaticism and nihilism by a few in advancing transhumanist causes  Dublin also said that historical parallels existed between Millenarian religions and Communist doctrines              
Although generally sympathetic to transhumanism  public health professor Gregory Stock is skeptical of the technical feasibility and mass appeal of the cyborgization of humanity predicted by Raymond Kurzweil  Hans Moravec and Kevin Warwick  He said that  throughout the   st century  many humans will be deeply integrated into systems of machines  but remain biological  Primary changes to their own form and character would arise not from cyberware  but from the direct manipulation of their genetics  metabolism and biochemistry              
In her      book Science as Salvation  philosopher Mary Midgley traces the notion of achieving immortality by transcendence of the material human body  echoed in the transhumanist tenet of mind uploading  to a group of male scientific thinkers of the early   th century  including J  B  S  Haldane and members of his circle  She characterizes these ideas as  quasi scientific dreams and prophesies  involving visions of escape from the body coupled with  self indulgent  uncontrolled power fantasies   Her argument focuses on what she perceives as the pseudoscientific speculations and irrational  fear of death driven fantasies of these thinkers  their disregard for laymen and the remoteness of their eschatological visions              
Another critique is aimed mainly at  algeny   a portmanteau of alchemy and genetics   which Jeremy Rifkin defined as  the upgrading of existing organisms and the design of wholly new ones with the intent of  perfecting  their performance                It emphasizes the issue of biocomplexity and the unpredictability of attempts to guide the development of products of biological evolution  This argument  elaborated in particular by the biologist Stuart Newman  is based on the recognition that cloning and germline genetic engineering of animals are error prone and inherently disruptive of embryonic development  Accordingly  so it is argued  it would create unacceptable risks to use such methods on human embryos  Performing experiments  particularly ones with permanent biological consequences  on developing humans would thus be in violation of accepted principles governing research on human subjects  see the      Declaration of Helsinki   Moreover  because improvements in experimental outcomes in one species are not automatically transferable to a new species without further experimentation  it is claimed that there is no ethical route to genetic manipulation of humans at early developmental stages              
As a practical matter  international protocols on human subject research may not present a legal obstacle to attempts by transhumanists and others to improve their offspring by germinal choice technology  According to legal scholar Kirsten Rabe Smolensky  existing laws protect parents who choose to enhance their child s genome from future liability arising from adverse outcomes of the procedure              
Transhumanists and other supporters of human genetic engineering do not dismiss practical concerns out of hand  insofar as there is a high degree of uncertainty about the timelines and likely outcomes of genetic modification experiments in humans  But bioethicist James Hughes suggests that one possible ethical route to the genetic manipulation of humans at early developmental stages is the building of computer models of the human genome  the proteins it specifies and the tissue engineering he argues that it also codes for  With the exponential progress in bioinformatics  Hughes believes that a virtual model of genetic expression in the human body will not be far behind and that it will soon be possible to accelerate approval of genetic modifications by simulating their effects on virtual humans             Public health professor Gregory Stock points to artificial chromosomes as a safer alternative to existing genetic engineering techniques              
Thinkers     who       who defend the likelihood of accelerating change point to a past pattern of exponential increases in humanity s technological capacities  Kurzweil developed this position in his      book The Singularity Is Near 

Intrinsic immorality edit 
Some argue that  in transhumanist thought  humans attempt to substitute themselves for God  The      Vatican statement Communion and Stewardship  Human Persons Created in the Image of God               stated that  changing the genetic identity of man as a human person through the production of an infrahuman being is radically immoral   implying  that  man has full right of disposal over his own biological nature   The statement also argues that creation of a superhuman or spiritually superior being is  unthinkable   since true improvement can come only through religious experience and  realizing more fully the image of God   Christian theologians and lay activists of several churches and denominations have expressed similar objections to transhumanism and claimed that Christians attain in the afterlife what radical transhumanism promises  such as indefinite life extension or the abolition of suffering  In this view  transhumanism is just another representative of the long line of utopian movements which seek to create  heaven on earth                             On the other hand  religious thinkers allied with transhumanist goals such as the theologians Ronald Cole Turner and Ted Peters hold that the doctrine of  co creation  provides an obligation to use genetic engineering to improve human biology                           
Other critics target what they claim to be an instrumental conception of the human body in the writings of Minsky  Moravec  and some other transhumanists              Reflecting a strain of feminist criticism of the transhumanist program  philosopher Susan Bordo points to  contemporary obsessions with slenderness  youth and physical perfection   which she sees as affecting both men and women  but in distinct ways  as  the logical  if extreme  manifestations of anxieties and fantasies fostered by our culture                Some critics question other social implications of the movement s focus on body modification  Political scientist Klaus Gerd Giesen  in particular  has asserted that transhumanism s concentration on altering the human body represents the logical yet tragic consequence of atomized individualism and body commodification within a consumer culture              
Bostrom responds that the desire to regain youth  specifically  and transcend the natural limitations of the human body  in general  is pan cultural and pan historical  not uniquely tied to the culture of the   th century  He argues that the transhumanist program is an attempt to channel that desire into a scientific project on par with the Human Genome Project and achieve humanity s oldest hope  rather than a puerile fantasy or social trend            

Loss of human identity edit 
In the U S   the Amish are a religious group most known for their avoidance of certain modern technologies  Transhumanists draw a parallel by arguing that in the near future there will probably be  humanish   people who choose to  stay human  by not adopting human enhancement technologies  They believe their choice must be respected and protected              
In his      book Enough  Staying Human in an Engineered Age  environmental ethicist Bill McKibben argued at length against many of the technologies that are postulated or supported by transhumanists  including germinal choice technology  nanomedicine and life extension strategies  He claims that it would be morally wrong for humans to tamper with fundamental aspects of themselves  or their children  in an attempt to overcome universal human limitations  such as vulnerability to aging  maximum life span and biological constraints on physical and cognitive ability  Attempts to  improve  themselves through such manipulation would remove limitations that provide a necessary context for the experience of meaningful human choice  He claims that human lives would no longer seem meaningful in a world where such limitations could be overcome technologically  Even the goal of using germinal choice technology for clearly therapeutic purposes should be relinquished  since it would inevitably produce temptations to tamper with such things as cognitive capacities  He argues that it is possible for societies to benefit from renouncing particular technologies  using as examples Ming China  Tokugawa Japan and the contemporary Amish              
Biopolitical activist Jeremy Rifkin and biologist Stuart Newman accept that biotechnology has the power to make profound changes in organismal identity  They argue against the genetic engineering of human beings because they fear the blurring of the boundary between human and artifact                            Philosopher Keekok Lee sees such developments as part of an accelerating trend in modernization in which technology has been used to transform the  natural  into the  artefactual                In the extreme  this could lead to the manufacturing and enslavement of  monsters  such as human clones  human animal chimeras  or bioroids  but even lesser dislocations of humans and non humans from social and ecological systems are seen as problematic  The film Blade Runner        and the novels The Boys From Brazil        and The Island of Doctor Moreau        depict elements of such scenarios  but Mary Shelley s      novel Frankenstein  or  The Modern Prometheus  is most often alluded to by critics who suggest that biotechnologies could create objectified and socially unmoored people as well as subhumans  Such critics propose that strict measures be implemented to prevent what they portray as dehumanizing possibilities from ever happening  usually in the form of an international ban on human genetic engineering              
Science journalist Ronald Bailey claims that McKibben s historical examples are flawed and support different conclusions when studied more closely               For example  few groups are more cautious than the Amish about embracing new technologies  but  though they shun television and use horses and buggies  some are welcoming the possibilities of gene therapy since inbreeding has afflicted them with a number of rare genetic diseases               Bailey and other supporters of technological alteration of human biology also reject the claim that life would be experienced as meaningless if some human limitations are overcome with enhancement technologies as extremely subjective 
Writing in Reason magazine  Bailey has accused opponents of research involving the modification of animals as indulging in alarmism when they speculate about the creation of subhuman creatures with human like intelligence and brains resembling those of Homo sapiens  Bailey insists that the aim of conducting research on animals is simply to produce human health care benefits              
A different response comes from transhumanist personhood theorists who object to what they characterize as the anthropomorphobia fueling some criticisms of this research  which science fiction writer Isaac Asimov termed the  Frankenstein complex   For example  Woody Evans argues that  provided they are self aware  human clones  human animal chimeras and uplifted animals would all be unique persons deserving of respect  dignity  rights  responsibilities  and citizenship               They conclude that the coming ethical issue is not the creation of so called monsters  but what they characterize as the  yuck factor  and  human racism   that would judge and treat these creations as monstrous                           In book   of his Corrupting the Image series  Douglas Hamp goes so far as to suggest that the Beast of John s Apocalypse is himself a hybrid who will induce humanity to take  the mark of the Beast   in the hopes of obtaining perfection and immortality              
At least one public interest organization  the U S  based Center for Genetics and Society  was formed  in       with the specific goal of opposing transhumanist agendas that involve transgenerational modification of human biology  such as full term human cloning and germinal choice technology  The Institute on Biotechnology and the Human Future of the Chicago Kent College of Law critically scrutinizes proposed applications of genetic and nanotechnologies to human biology in an academic setting 


Socioeconomic effects edit 
Some critics of libertarian transhumanism have focused on the likely socioeconomic consequences in societies in which divisions between rich and poor are on the rise  Bill McKibben  for example  suggests that emerging human enhancement technologies would be disproportionately available to those with greater financial resources  thereby exacerbating the gap between rich and poor and creating a  genetic divide                Even Lee M  Silver  the biologist and science writer who coined the term  reprogenetics  and supports its applications  has expressed concern that these methods could create a two tiered society of genetically engineered  haves  and  have nots  if social democratic reforms lag behind implementation of enhancement technologies               The      film Gattaca depicts a dystopian society in which one s social class depends entirely on genetic potential and is often cited by critics in support of these views            
These criticisms are also voiced by non libertarian transhumanist advocates  especially self described democratic transhumanists  who believe that the majority of current or future social and environmental issues  such as unemployment and resource depletion  must be addressed by a combination of political and technological solutions  like a guaranteed minimum income and alternative technology   Therefore  on the specific issue of an emerging genetic divide due to unequal access to human enhancement technologies  bioethicist James Hughes  in his      book Citizen Cyborg  Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future  argues that progressives or  more precisely  techno progressives  must articulate and implement public policies  i e   a universal health care voucher system that covers human enhancement technologies  to attenuate this problem as much as possible  rather than trying to ban human enhancement technologies  The latter  he argues  might actually worsen the problem by making these technologies unsafe or available only to the wealthy on the local black market or in countries where such a ban is not enforced            
Sometimes  as in the writings of Leon Kass  the fear is that various institutions and practices judged as fundamental to civilized society would be damaged or destroyed               In his      book Our Posthuman Future and in a      Foreign Policy magazine article  political economist and philosopher Francis Fukuyama designates transhumanism as the world s most dangerous idea because he believes it may undermine the egalitarian ideals of democracy  in general  and liberal democracy  in particular  through a fundamental alteration of  human nature               Social philosopher J rgen Habermas makes a similar argument in his      book The Future of Human Nature  in which he asserts that moral autonomy depends on not being subject to another s unilaterally imposed specifications  Habermas thus suggests that the human  species ethic  would be undermined by embryo stage genetic alteration               Critics such as Kass and Fukuyama hold that attempts to significantly alter human biology are not only inherently immoral  but also threaten the social order  Alternatively  they argue that implementation of such technologies would likely lead to the  naturalizing  of social hierarchies or place new means of control in the hands of totalitarian regimes  AI pioneer Joseph Weizenbaum criticizes what he sees as misanthropic tendencies in the language and ideas of some of his colleagues  in particular Minsky and Moravec  which  by devaluing the human organism per se  promotes a discourse that enables divisive and undemocratic social policies              
In a      article in the libertarian monthly Reason  science journalist Ronald Bailey contested Fukuyama s assertions by arguing that political equality has never rested on the facts of human biology  He asserts that liberalism was founded not on the proposition of effective equality of human beings  or de facto equality  but on the assertion of an equality in political rights and before the law  or de jure equality  Bailey asserts that the products of genetic engineering may well ameliorate rather than exacerbate human inequality  giving to the many what were once the privileges of the few  Moreover  he argues   the crowning achievement of the Enlightenment is the principle of tolerance   In fact  he says  political liberalism is already the solution to the issue of human and posthuman rights since in liberal societies the law is meant to apply equally to all  no matter how rich or poor  powerful or powerless  educated or ignorant  enhanced or unenhanced               Other thinkers sympathetic to transhumanist ideas  such as Russell Blackford  have also objected to the appeal to tradition and what they see as alarmism involved in Brave New World type arguments              

Cultural aesthetics edit 
In addition to the socioeconomic risks and implications of transhumanism  there are indeed implications and possible consequences in regard to cultural aesthetics  Currently  there are a number of ways in which people choose to represent themselves in society  The way in which a person dresses  hair styles  and body alteration all serve to identify the way a person presents themselves and is perceived by society  According to Foucault               society already governs and controls bodies by making them feel watched  This  surveillance  of society dictates how the majority of individuals choose to express themselves aesthetically 
One of the risks outlined in a      article by Jerold Abrams is the elimination of differences in favor of universality  This  he argues  will eliminate the ability of individuals to subvert the possibly oppressive  dominant structure of society by way of uniquely expressing themselves externally  Such control over a population would have dangerous implications of tyranny  Yet another consequence of enhancing the human form not only cognitively  but physically  will be the reinforcement of  desirable  traits which are perpetuated by the dominant social structure              

New eugenics edit 
Main article  New eugenics
The tradition of human enhancement originated with the eugenics movement that was once prominent in the biological sciences  and was later politicized in various ways  This continuity is especially clear in the case of Julian Huxley himself              
The major transhumanist organizations strongly condemn the coercion involved in such policies and reject the racist and classist assumptions on which they were based  along with the pseudoscientific notions that eugenic improvements could be accomplished in a practically meaningful time frame through selective human breeding               Instead  most transhumanist thinkers advocate a  new eugenics   a form of egalitarian liberal eugenics               In their      book From Chance to Choice  Genetics and Justice  non transhumanist bioethicists Allen Buchanan  Dan Brock  Norman Daniels and Daniel Wikler have argued that liberal societies have an obligation to encourage as wide an adoption of eugenic enhancement technologies as possible  so long as such policies do not infringe on individuals  reproductive rights or exert undue pressures on prospective parents to use these technologies  to maximize public health and minimize the inequalities that may result from both natural genetic endowments and unequal access to genetic enhancements               Most transhumanists holding similar views nonetheless distance themselves from the term  eugenics   preferring  germinal choice  or  reprogenetics                to avoid having their position confused with the discredited theories and practices of early   th century eugenic movements              
Health law professor George Annas and technology law professor Lori Andrews are prominent advocates of the position that the use of these technologies could lead to human posthuman caste warfare                           

Existential risks edit 
See also  Existential risk studies and Existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence
In his      book Our Final Hour  British Astronomer Royal Martin Rees argues that advanced science and technology bring as much risk of disaster as opportunity for progress  However  Rees does not advocate a halt to scientific activity  Instead  he calls for tighter security and perhaps an end to traditional scientific openness               Advocates of the precautionary principle  such as many in the environmental movement  also favor slow  careful progress or a halt in potentially dangerous areas  Some precautionists believe that artificial intelligence and robotics present possibilities of alternative forms of cognition that may threaten human life              
Transhumanists do not necessarily rule out specific restrictions on emerging technologies so as to lessen the prospect of existential risk  Generally  however  they counter that proposals based on the precautionary principle are often unrealistic and sometimes even counter productive as opposed to the technogaian current of transhumanism  which they claim is both realistic and productive  In his television series Connections  science historian James Burke dissects several views on technological change  including precautionism and the restriction of open inquiry  Burke questions the practicality of some of these views  but concludes that maintaining the status quo of inquiry and development poses hazards of its own  such as a disorienting rate of change and the depletion of our planet s resources  The common transhumanist position is a pragmatic one where society takes deliberate action to ensure the early arrival of the benefits of safe  clean  alternative technology  rather than fostering what it considers to be anti scientific views and technophobia 
Nick Bostrom argues that even barring the occurrence of a singular global catastrophic event  basic Malthusian and evolutionary forces facilitated by technological progress threaten to eliminate the positive aspects of human society              
One transhumanist solution proposed by Bostrom to counter existential risks is control of differential technological development  a series of attempts to influence the sequence in which technologies are developed  In this approach  planners would strive to retard the development of possibly harmful technologies and their applications  while accelerating the development of likely beneficial technologies  especially those that offer protection against the harmful effects of others             
In their      book Calamity Theory  Joshua Schuster and Derek Woods critique existential risks by arguing against Bostrom s transhumanist perspective  which emphasizes controlling and mitigating these risks through technological advancements  They contend that this approach relies too much on fringe science and speculative technologies and fails to address deeper philosophical and ethical problems about the nature of human existence and its limitations  Instead  they advocate an approach more grounded in secular existentialist philosophy  focusing on mental fortitude  community resilience  international peacebuilding  and environmental stewardship to better cope with existential risks            

Antinatalism and pronatalism edit 
Although most people focus on the scientific and technological barriers on the road to human enhancement  Robbert Zandbergen argues that contemporary transhumanists  failure to critically engage the cultural current of antinatalism is a far bigger obstacle to a posthuman future  Antinatalism is a stance seeking to discourage  restrict  or terminate human reproduction to solve existential problems  If transhumanists fail to take this threat to human continuity seriously  they run the risk of seeing the collapse of the entire edifice of radical enhancement              
Simone and Malcolm Collins  founders of Pronatalist org  are activists known primarily for their views and advocacy related to a secular and voluntaristic form of pronatalism  a stance encouraging higher birth rates to reverse demographic decline and its negative implications for the viability of modern societies and the possibility of a better future               Critical of transhumanism  they have expressed concern that life extension would worsen the problem of gerontocracy  causing toxic imbalances in power  The Collinses lament that voluntarily childfree transhumanists who  want to live forever believe they are the epitome of centuries of human cultural and biological evolution  They don t think they can make kids that are better than them               

Propagandistic use edit 
Common enemy to anti democratic movements edit 
Transhumanism has increasingly been co opted by anti democratic movements as a common enemy stereotype  These movements range from Putin sympathizers to radical anti vaxxers and Christian fundamentalists  Critics argue that nonsensical claims often stem from deliberate ignorance  and terms like  Putin sympathizer  or  conspiracy theorist  are used to defame legitimate criticism              
Political scientists like Markus Linden point out that Putin  in his speeches  argues against the so called  liberal globalist American egocentrism  and cancel culture  which parallels the agitation seen in alternative media  These discourses also occur on platforms like Nachdenkseiten  Rubikon  and Compact  where they are presented as analyses of the decline of Western democracy              
The propagandistic use of the term  transhumanism  aims to create a comprehensive counter narrative that unites right wing extremists  theocratic groups  and liberals  Transhumanism is portrayed as a threat to traditional values and human nature  These narratives can also be found among ideologues like Alexander Dugin  who condemns transhumanism as the work of the devil  and Christian fundamentalists who equate it with the denial of traditional values              
The use of the term  transhumanism  as an ideological rallying point for the Querfront is also evident in the fusion of right wing  left wing  and libertarian ideas that collectively oppose liberal democracies  This development emphasizes individual conceptions of humanity that are often incompatible with a pluralistic society  It requires a critical examination of the political implications of transhumanism and its instrumentalization by anti democratic forces
