Discontinuation of usage of nuclear power for energy production



Eight German nuclear power reactors  sBiblis A and B  Brunsb ttel  Isar    Kr mmel  Neckarwestheim    Philippsburg   and Unterweser  were permanently shut down on   August       following the Japanese Fukushima nuclear disaster            
A nuclear power phase out is the discontinuation of usage of nuclear power for energy production  Often initiated because of concerns about nuclear power  phase outs usually include shutting down nuclear power plants and looking towards fossil fuels and renewable energy  Three nuclear accidents have influenced the discontinuation of nuclear power  the      Three Mile Island partial nuclear meltdown in the United States  the      Chernobyl disaster in the USSR  now Ukraine   and the      Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan 
As of          update       only two countries have permanently closed all of their formerly functioning nuclear plants  Italy by       and Germany by       Lithuania and Kazakhstan have shut down their only nuclear plants  but plan to build new ones to replace them  while Armenia shut down its only nuclear plant but subsequently restarted it  Austria never used its first nuclear plant that was completely built  Cuba  Libya  North Korea and Poland never completed the construction of their first nuclear plants due to financial  political and technical reasons  Spain and Switzerland plan nuclear phase outs                                             
Nuclear shut downs after Fukushima have significantly set back emissions reductions goals in several countries  A      study of the impacts of the German and Japan closures concludes that by continuing to operate their nuclear plants  these two countries could have prevented        air pollution induced deaths and      Mt  CO  emissions between      and       By sharply reducing nuclear instead of coal and gas after Fukushima  both countries lost the chance to prevent very large amounts of air pollution induced deaths and CO  emissions              
Several countries formerly opposed to opening nuclear programs or planning phaseouts have reversed course in recent years due to climate concerns and energy independence including Belgium             the Philippines             Greece             Sweden             and South Korea             

Timeline of commissioned and decommissioned nuclear capacity since the     s            

Overview edit 
        people attended an anti nuclear protest in Bonn  West Germany  on    October       following the Three Mile Island accident             
A popular movement against nuclear power exists in the Western world  based on concerns about more nuclear accidents and concerns about nuclear waste  Anti nuclear critics see nuclear power as a dangerous  expensive way to boil water to generate electricity              The      Three Mile Island accident and the      Chernobyl disaster played a key role in stopping new plant construction in many countries  Major anti nuclear power groups include Friends of the Earth  Greenpeace  Institute for Energy and Environmental Research  Nuclear Information and Resource Service  and Sortir du nucl aire  France  
Several countries  especially European countries  have abandoned the construction of new nuclear power plants              Austria         Sweden        and Italy        voted in referendums to oppose or phase out nuclear power  while opposition in Ireland prevented a nuclear program there  Countries that have no nuclear plants and have restricted new plant constructions comprise Australia  Austria  Denmark  Greece  Italy  Ireland  Norway and Serbia                          Poland stopped the construction of a plant                          Belgium  Germany  Spain  and Sweden decided not to build new plants or intend to phase out nuclear power  although still mostly relying on nuclear energy                         
New reactors under construction in Finland and France  which were meant to lead a nuclear new build  have been substantially delayed and are running over budget                                      Despite these delays the Olkiluoto reactor is now online and delivering low emissions power to the grid as of    March        When Olkiluoto   reaches full output  around     of Finland s electricity generation will come from clean  low carbon electricity sources  with nuclear generation supplying around half of that               In addition  China has    units under construction             and there are also new reactors being built in Bangladesh  Belarus  Brazil  India  Japan  Pakistan  Russia  Slovakia  South Korea  Turkey  United Arab Emirates  United Kingdom and the United States of America  At least     older and smaller reactors will  most probably be closed over the next       years              
Countries that wish to shut down nuclear power plants must find alternatives for electricity generation  otherwise  they are forced to become dependent on imports  Therefore  the discussion of a future for nuclear energy is intertwined with discussions about fossil fuels or an energy transition to renewable energy

Austria edit

A nuclear power station was built during the     s at Zwentendorf  Austria  but its start up was prevented by a referendum in       On   July       the Austrian Parliament voted unanimously to maintain the country s anti nuclear policy              The built but never used reactor was converted into a museum and has also been used as a movie set and to train people involved in various aspects of nuclear power and safety  It is uniquely suitable for this purpose as it includes every aspect of an actual nuclear power plant except the radiation                         

Belgium edit 
Belgium s nuclear phase out legislation was agreed in July      by the Liberals  VLD and MR   the Socialists  SP A and PS  and the Greens party  Groen  and Ecolo   The phase out law calls for each of Belgium s seven reactors to close after    years of operation with no new reactors built subsequently  When the law was being passed  it was speculated it would be overturned again as soon as an administration without the Greens was in power             
In the federal election in May       there was an electoral threshold of    for the first time  Therefore  the Green parties  the ECOLO  got only       of the votes  so ECOLO obtained no seat in the Chamber of Representatives  In July       Guy Verhofstadt formed his second government  It was a continuation of the Verhofstadt I Government but without the Green parties  In September       the government partially overturned the previous decision  extending the phase out period for another    years  with possible further extensions 
In July       the Federal Planning Bureau published a new report  which stated that oil and other fossil fuels generate     of Belgian energy use  while nuclear power accounts for    and renewable energy for     Electricity amounts to     of total energy use  and while nuclear powered electricity amounts to    of use in Belgium  in many parts of Belgium  especially in Flanders  it makes up more than     of the electricity provided to households and businesses              This was one of the major reasons to extend the earlier phase out  since it was difficult to provide more than     of the electricity by  alternative  energy production  and a revert to the classical coal driven electricity would mean inability to adhere to the Kyoto Protocol 
In August       French GDF SUEZ offered to buy the Belgian Electrabel  which runs nuclear power stations              At the end of       Suez had some       of all Electrabel shares  Beginning in       Suez and Gaz de France announced a merger 
After the federal election in June       a political crisis began and lasted until the end of      
In the           Belgian government formation negotiations  the phase out was emphasised again  with concrete plans to shut off three of the country s seven reactors by                  
Before the Fukushima nuclear disaster  the plan of the government was for all nuclear power stations to shut down by                   Although intermediate deadlines have been missed or pushed back  on    March      the Belgian Council of Ministers confirmed the      phase out date and stated draft legislation would be brought forward later in the year             
In March       the government decided to allow Doel   and Tihange   to continue operating until      to allow the country to  strengthen its independence of fossil fuels in turbulent geopolitical times               Belgium s two newest nuclear plants are operated by French utility Engie and account for almost half of the country s electricity production              This extension should allow to strengthen our country s independence from fossil fuels in a chaotic geopolitical context   the government said             
Belgium continues to be active in nuclear research and is building MYRRHA  the world s first large scale demonstration of an accelerator driven subcritical reactor that is to be used for nuclear transmutation of high level radioactive waste

In       the First Schr der cabinet  consisting of the SPD and Alliance     The Greens  officially announced its intention to phase out the use of nuclear energy  The power plants in Stade and Obrigheim were turned off on    November       and    May       respectively  The plants  dismantling was scheduled to begin in                  
The Renewable Energy Sources Act  passed in       provided for a feed in tariff in support of renewable energy  The German government  declaring climate protection as a key policy issue  announced a carbon dioxide reduction target by the year      compared to      of                  In       the use of renewables in Germany reached          PJ of primary energy demand  which corresponded to    of the total electricity demand  By       the German government wanted to reach                  in fact      were reached                                    
Anti nuclear activists have argued the German government had been supportive of nuclear power by providing financial guarantees for energy providers  Also  there were  as yet  no plans for the final storage of nuclear waste  By tightening safety regulations and increasing taxation  a faster end to nuclear power could have been forced  A gradual closing of nuclear power plants had come along with concessions in questions of safety for the population with transport of nuclear waste throughout Germany                          This latter point has been disagreed with by the Minister of Environment  Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety             
In       critics of a phase out in Germany argued that the grid energy contribution from the nuclear power stations may not be adequately compensated in the short term  possibly causing an energy crisis  They also predicted that only coal powered plants could compensate for nuclear power in general  and that CO  emissions would increase tremendously as a result  A possible mitigating factor would be energy imported from France s lower carbon   and primarily nuclear   power facilities  Russian natural gas would be an additional  perhaps necessary option                                      Numerous factors  including progress in wind turbine technology and photovoltaics  reduced the need for conventional alternatives                  failed verification     
In       Deutsche Bank analysts concluded that  the global impact of the Fukushima accident is a fundamental shift in public perception with regard to how a nation prioritizes and values its population s health  safety  security  and natural environment when determining its current and future energy pathways   There were many anti nuclear protests and  on    May       Angela Merkel s government announced that it would close all of its nuclear power plants by December                               Following the March      Fukushima nuclear disaster  Germany has permanently shut down eight of its    reactors 
Galvanised by the Fukushima nuclear disaster  first anniversary anti nuclear demonstrations were held in Germany in March       Organisers say more than        people in six regions took part             
The German Energiewende designates a significant change in energy policy from       The term encompasses a transition by Germany to a low carbon  environmentally sound  reliable  and affordable energy supply             
On   June       following the Fukushima disaster  the government removed the use of nuclear power as a bridging technology as part of their policy             
In September       German engineering giant Siemens announced it will withdraw entirely from the nuclear industry  as a response to the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan  and said that it would no longer build nuclear power plants anywhere in the world  The company s chairman  Peter L scher  said that  Siemens was ending plans to cooperate with Rosatom  the Russian state controlled nuclear power company  in the construction of dozens of nuclear plants throughout Russia over the coming two decades                           Also in September       IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said the Japanese nuclear disaster  caused deep public anxiety throughout the world and damaged confidence in nuclear power              
A      study shows that during the nuclear phaseout  the security of electricity supply in Germany stayed at the same high level compared to other European countries and even improved in       The study was conducted near the halfway point of the phaseout         plants having been shut and a further   still in operation                         
In early October       Swedish electric power company Vattenfall began litigation against the German government for its      decision to accelerate the phase out of nuclear power  Hearings are taking place at the World Bank s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes  ICSID  in Washington  DC and Vattenfall is claiming almost           billion in damages  The German government has called the action  inadmissible and unfounded               These proceedings were ongoing in December       despite Vattenfall commencing civil litigation within Germany             
On        December       the Federal Constitutional Court  Bundesverfassungsgericht  ruled that the nuclear plant operators affected by the accelerated phase out of nuclear power following the Fukushima disaster are eligible for  adequate  compensation  The court found that the nuclear exit was essentially constitutional but that the utilities are entitled to damages for the  good faith  investments they made in       The utilities can now sue the German government under civil law  E ON  RWE  and Vattenfall are expected to seek a total of          billion under separate suits                                      Six cases were registered with courts in Germany  as of        December               update                              
A scientific paper released in      found that the German nuclear shutdown led to an increase in carbon dioxide emissions around      megatons per year  and killed      people a year through increased air pollution  As they shut down nuclear power  Germany made heavy investments in renewable energy  but those same investments could have  cut much deeper into fossil fuel energy  if the nuclear generation had still been online                         
Aligning with the end of the      COP   climate talks  the operators of Germany s six remaining nuclear power stations  utilities E ON  RWE  and EnBW  rejected calls to keep the plants in operation beyond their scheduled shutdowns at the end of                   However  in reaction to the      Russian invasion of Ukraine the debate about whether to extend the life of the three remaining reactors or whether to restart operation in the three reactors shut down at the end of       whose dismantling hasn t started yet  once more came to the forefront and operators said that it would be possible to extend the life of those reactors under certain conditions                         
In July       faced with a looming energy crisis  the German parliament voted to reactivate closed coal power plants             

The Isar Nuclear Power Plant was taken out of service on    April     
In       of the    nuclear power plants Germany had at its peak  three remained in operation  Isar    Emsland and Neckarwestheim    which were operated by German energy firms E ON  EONGn DE   RWE  RWEG DE  and EnBW  EBKG DE   respectively  According to federal legislation  these operators lost the right to operate their plants on    December       the effective end date for the stations  Germany s network regulator  part of the Economy Ministry   could decide that they are critical to the security of power supply  both electricity and nuclear transmutation  and allow them to run for longer             
The last three nuclear power plants in Germany Emsland  Isar II and Neckarwestheim II were shut down on    April                              
In April       there was a controversy related to the decommissioning of nuclear power plants in Germany                          German magazine Cicero claimed that German Economy Minister Robert Habeck had misled the public in      and ignored the advice of experts who said nuclear facilities were still safe to operate              

Italy edit 
Nuclear power phase out commenced in Italy in       one year after the Chernobyl accident  Following a referendum in that year  Italy s four nuclear power plants were closed  the last in       A moratorium on the construction of new plants  originally in effect from      until       has since been extended indefinitely             
In recent years  Italy has been an importer of nuclear generated electricity  and its largest electricity utility Enel S p A  has been investing in reactors in both France and Slovakia to provide this electricity in the future  and also in the development of the European Pressurized Reactor technology 
In October       there was a seminar sponsored by the government about the possibility of reviving Italian nuclear power              The fourth cabinet led by Silvio Berlusconi tried to implement a new nuclear plan but a referendum held in June      stopped any project

As of          update       the five operational Swiss nuclear reactors were Beznau   and    G sgen  Leibstadt  and M hleberg all located in the German speaking part of the country  Nuclear power accounted for       of the national electricity generation  while       came from hydroelectricity  The remaining      was generated by other conventional and non hydro renewable power stations             
On    May       the Federal Council decided on a slow phase out by not extending running times or building new power plants              The first power plant  M hleberg  was shut down on    December       the last will stop running in                  
In       the International Energy Agency has warned that Switzerland s phased withdrawal from nuclear power presents challenges for maintaining its electricity security  They caution that Switzerland will be increasingly relying on imports from its European neighbours to meet electricity demand  especially during the winter months when low water levels impact production from hydro plants             
There have been many Swiss referendums on the topic of nuclear energy  beginning in      with a citizens  initiative for nuclear safety  which was rejected  In       there was a vote on an initiative  for a future without further nuclear power stations  with the result being a     to     vote against  On    September       Switzerland had two more referendums about nuclear power  The initiative  stop the construction of nuclear power stations   which proposed a ten year moratorium on the construction of new nuclear power plants  was passed with       to        The initiative for a phase out was rejected with by     to        In       there was a vote on a green tax for support of solar energy  It was rejected by     to      On    May       there were two referendums   Electricity without Nuclear   asking for a decision on a nuclear power phase out  and  Moratorium Plus   for an extension of the earlier decided moratorium on the construction of new nuclear power plants  Both were turned down  The results were  Moratorium Plus        Yes        No  Electricity without Nuclear        Yes        No             
The program of the  Electricity without Nuclear  petition was to shut down all nuclear power stations by       starting with Unit   and   of Beznau nuclear power stations  M hleberg in       G sgen in       and Leibstadt in        Moratorium Plus  was for an extension of the moratorium for another ten years  and additionally a condition to stop the present reactors after    years of operation  To extend the    years by ten more years  another referendum would have to be held  at high administrative costs   The rejection of the Moratorium Plus had come as a surprise to many  as opinion polls before the referendum had showed acceptance  Reasons for the rejections in both cases were seen as the worsened economic situation             
In August       the Federal Council  led by Energy Minister Albert R sti  proposed lifting the nuclear power plant construction ban that had been in place since       Citing concerns over energy security and fossil fuel phase out  the government seeks to amend the Nuclear Energy Act  Kernenergiegesetz  to allow the construction of new nuclear plants and extend the operational life of the existing ones

In Spain a moratorium was enacted by the socialist government in                              and in      plans for a phase out of seven reactors were being discussed anew             
In Ireland  a nuclear power plant was first proposed in       It was to be built during the     s at Carnsore Point in County Wexford  The plan called for first one  then ultimately four plants to be built at the site  but it was dropped after strong opposition from environmental groups  and Ireland has remained without nuclear power since  Despite opposing nuclear power  and nuclear fuel reprocessing at Sellafield   Ireland is to open an interconnector to the mainland UK to buy electricity  which is  in some part  the product of nuclear power 
Slovenian nuclear plant in Kr ko  co owned with Croatia  is scheduled to be closed by       and there are no plans to build further nuclear plants  The debate on whether and when to close the Kr ko plant was somewhat intensified after the         winter energy crisis  In May       the Ljubljana based daily Dnevnik claimed Slovenian government officials internally proposed adding a new           MW block into Kr ko after the year

Serbia currently operates a single nuclear research reactor in the Vin a Institute  Previously  the Vin a Institute had two active reactors  RA and RB  In a      nuclear incident  six workers received a critical amount of radiation and one of them died  These workers received the first bone marrow transplants in Europe  After the Chernobyl disaster in       a moratorium on the use of nuclear energy was in established  Later  the law prohibited the use of nuclear energy  To this day  the Directorate for Nuclear and Radiation Safety  Srbatom  is strongly opposed to any kind of nuclear energy use in Serbia or neighbouring countries 

Sweden edit 
Main article  Nuclear power in Sweden
A year after the Three Mile Island accident in       the      Swedish nuclear power referendum was held  It led to the Swedish parliament deciding that no further nuclear power plants should be built  and that a nuclear power phase out should be completed by       On   February       the Government of Sweden effectively ended the phase out policy              In       Parliament approved for new reactors to replace existing ones             
The nuclear reactors at the Barseb ck Nuclear Power Plant were shut down between      and       In October       corporations running the nuclear plants decided to phase out two reactors at Oskarshamn             and two at Ringhals              reducing the number of remaining reactors from    in      to   in      
An opinion poll in April      showed that about half of Swedes want to phase out nuclear power     per cent want its use continued  and    per cent are undecided              Prior to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in        a clear majority of Swedes  had been in favour of nuclear power              In June       the opposition parties and the government reached an agreement on Swedish nuclear power              The agreement is to phase out the output tax on nuclear power  and allow ten new replacement reactors to be built at current nuclear plants             
Since then  public support of nuclear energy has grown  with a majority of people in favour of nuclear power in                   Those in favour of decommissioning nuclear has dropped to a record low of    per cent 

The Netherlands edit 
In the Netherlands  in       the Dutch parliament voted to phase out nuclear power generation after a discussion of nuclear waste management  The power station at Dodewaard was shut down in       In      the government decided to end Borssele s operating licence  at the end of       In      the shut down was postponed by the government to                               In      the decision was reversed and research in expanding nuclear power has been initiated  Reversal was preceded by the publication of the Christian Democratic Appeal s report on sustainable energy               Other coalition parties then conceded  In      the government decided that Borssele will remain open until       if it can comply with the highest safety standards  The owners  Essent and DELTA will invest     million euros in sustainable energy  together with the government  money which the government claims otherwise should have been paid to the plants owners as compensation  In December       the Fourth Rutte cabinet stated that it wants to prepare for the construction of two new nuclear power plants to reduce CO  emissions and meet the European Union goals for responding to climate change               Part of this preparation is the launch of a feasibility study  looking at the advantages and disadvantages of the use of nuclear power to respond to climate change

Anti Nuclear Power Plant Rally on    September      at Meiji Shrine complex in Tokyo  Sixty thousand people marched chanting  Sayonara nuclear power  and waving banners  calling on Japan s government to abandon nuclear power  following the Fukushima disaster                           
Once a nuclear proponent  Prime Minister Naoto Kan became increasingly anti nuclear following the Fukushima nuclear disaster  In May       he closed the ageing Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant over earthquake and tsunami fears  and said he would freeze plans to build new reactors  In July       Kan said that  Japan should reduce and eventually eliminate its dependence on nuclear energy     saying that the Fukushima accident had demonstrated the dangers of the technology                In August       the Japanese government passed a bill to subsidise electricity from renewable energy sources               A      Japanese Cabinet energy white paper says  public confidence in safety of nuclear power was greatly damaged  by the Fukushima disaster  and called for a reduction in the nation s reliance on nuclear power               As of August               update       the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant was leaking low levels of radioactivity and areas surrounding it could remain uninhabitable for decades              
By March       one year after the disaster  all but two of Japan s nuclear reactors were shut down  some were damaged by the quake and tsunami  The following year  the last two were taken off line  Authority to restart the others after scheduled maintenance throughout the year was given to local governments  and in all cases local opposition prevented restarting 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s government  reelected on a platform of restarting nuclear power  plans to have nuclear power account for    to    per cent of the country s total electricity supply by       compared with roughly    per cent before the disaster at the Fukushima complex 
In      two reactors at Sendai Nuclear Power Plant have been restarted               In      Ikata   restarted and in      Takahama   restarted  In      Mihama Nuclear Power Plant unit   was restarted              
In       Japan s Cabinet approved a policy to allow new nuclear power reactors to be constructed and operation of existing reactors to be extended from    to    years              

United States edit 
See also  Anti nuclear movement in the United States
The United States is  as of       was undergoing a practical phase out independent of stated goals and continued official support  This was not due to concerns about the source or anti nuclear groups  but due to the rapidly falling prices of natural gas and the reluctance of investors to provide funding for long term projects when short term profitability of turbine power is available 
Through the     s  a number of factors led to greatly increased interest in new nuclear reactors  including rising demand  new lower cost reactor designs  and concerns about global climate change  By       about    new reactors were planned  and a large number of existing reactors had applied for upgrades to increase their output  In total     reactors had their licences renewed  three Early Site Permits had been applied for  and three consortiums had applied for Combined Construction Operating Licences under the Nuclear Power      Program  In addition  the Energy Policy Act of      contains incentives to further expand nuclear power              
However  by      the vast majority of these plans were cancelled  and several additional cancellations followed in       Currently only three new reactors are under construction  and one  at Watts Bar  was originally planned in the     s and only under construction now  Construction of the new AP     design is underway at one location in the United States in Georgia  Plans for additional reactors in Florida were cancelled in      
Some smaller reactors operating in deregulated markets have become uneconomic to operate and maintain  due to competition from generators using low priced natural gas  and may be retired early               The     MWe Kewaunee Power Station is being closed    years before licence expiry for these economic reasons                            Duke Energy s Crystal River   Nuclear Power Plant in Florida closed  as it could not recover the costs needed to fix its containment building              
As a result of these changes  after reaching peak production in       US nuclear capacity has been undergoing constant reduction every year 
In       Indian Point Energy Center  the last remaining nuclear power plant in the New York City metropolitan area  was shut down               Environmental groups celebrated the decision to close the plant  while critics pointed to the sites generation being replaced by two gas fired power plants resulting in an increase of fossil fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions                           

South Korea edit 
In       responding to widespread public concerns after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan  the high earthquake risk in South Korea  and a      nuclear scandal involving the use of counterfeit parts  the new government of President Moon Jae in had decided to gradually phase out nuclear power in South Korea  Such decision  however  was met with widespread criticism regarding its political transparency and various doubts regarding its process  This was especially highlighted when the construction of Shin Gori units   and   were unilaterally stopped by the government  Being faced with stark criticism  the construction of Shin Gori units   and   were eventually restarted 
Later into the administrative period  the Moon Jae in government and its nuclear phase out policy is facing heavier criticism than before  from both the opposing parties as well as general public due to lack of realistic alternative  consequential increase in electricity price  negative effects on the related industries  public consensus of needs to reduce carbon footprint and the decrease of popularity due to other political and economic failures  Surveys from      show that the support for nuclear phase out has drastically reduced  although the details differ from majority support to majority disapproval depending on the survey                            President Moon reversed his government s nuclear phaseout policy just before the election in February                   
In the      election  candidate Yoon Seok Yeol promised to cancel the phase out if elected and continue running all plants as long as they safely could be operated  develop new technology and become a global export powerhouse  Yoon went on to win a close election in what was seen as a big win for the nuclear sector              

Pros and cons of nuclear power edit 
The nuclear debate edit 
Main article  Nuclear power debate
The nuclear power debate is about the controversy                                                                  which has surrounded the deployment and use of nuclear fission reactors to generate electricity from nuclear fuel for civilian purposes  The debate about nuclear power peaked during the     s and     s  when it  reached an intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies   in some countries                           
Proponents of nuclear energy argue that nuclear power is a sustainable energy source which reduces carbon emissions and can increase energy security if its use supplants a dependence on imported fuels               Proponents cite scientific studies affirming the consensus that nuclear power produces virtually no air pollution               in contrast to the chief dispatchable alternative of fossil fuel  Proponents also believe that nuclear power is the only viable course to achieve energy independence for most Western countries  They emphasise that the risks of storing spent fuel are small and can be further reduced by using the latest technology in newer reactors  fuel recycling  and long lived radioisotope burn up  For instance  spent nuclear fuel in the United States could extend nuclear power generation by hundreds of years              because more than     of spent fuel can be reprocessed               The operational safety record in the Western world is excellent when compared to the other major kinds of power plants              
Over        hospitals worldwide use radioisotopes in medicine  and about     of the procedures are for diagnosis  The radioisotope most commonly used in diagnosis is technetium     which is employed in about    million procedures per year  thereby accounting for about     of all nuclear medicine procedures and     of diagnostic scans in nuclear medicine worldwide  The main radioisotopes such as Tc   m cannot effectively be produced without reactors                            Most smoke detectors use americium      meaning every American home uses these common radioisotopes to improve their safety from fire              
Opponents say that nuclear power poses many threats to people and the environment  These threats include health risks and environmental damage from uranium mining  processing and transport  the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation or sabotage  and the problem of radioactive nuclear waste management                                         They also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong  and there have been serious nuclear accidents                            Critics do not believe that these risks can be reduced through new technology               They argue that when all the energy intensive stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered  from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning  nuclear power is not a low carbon electricity source                                         This criticism has however been partially quelled by the IPCC which indicated in      that nuclear energy was a low carbon energy production technology  comparable to wind and lower than solar in that regard              

Economics edit 
Main article  Economics of nuclear power plants
The economics of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject  since there are diverging views on the topic  and multi billion dollar investments ride on the choice of an energy source  Nuclear power plants typically have high capital costs for building the plant  but low direct fuel costs  with  however  much of the costs of fuel extraction  processing  use and long term storage externalised   Therefore  comparison with other power generation methods is strongly dependent on assumptions about construction timescales and capital financing for nuclear plants  Cost estimates also need to take into account plant decommissioning and nuclear waste storage costs  On the other hand  measures to mitigate global warming  such as a carbon tax or carbon emissions trading  may favour the economics of nuclear power versus fossil fuels 
In recent years there has been a slowdown of electricity demand growth and financing has become more difficult  which affects large projects such as nuclear reactors  with very large upfront costs and long project cycles which carry a large variety of risks               In Eastern Europe  a number of long established projects are struggling to find finance  notably Belene in Bulgaria and the additional reactors at Cernavoda in Romania  and some potential backers have pulled out               Where cheap natural gas is available and its future supply relatively secure  this also poses a major problem for nuclear projects              
Analysis of the economics of nuclear power must take into account who bears the risks of future uncertainties  To date  all operating nuclear power plants were developed by state owned or regulated utility monopolies              where many of the risks associated with construction costs  operating performance  fuel price  and other factors were borne by consumers rather than suppliers  Many countries have now liberalised the electricity market where these risks  and the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered  are borne by plant suppliers and operators rather than consumers  which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the economics of new nuclear power plants              
Following the      Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster  costs are likely to go up for currently operating and new nuclear power plants  due to increased requirements for on site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats              

Environment edit 
Main article  Environmental impact of nuclear power
Nuclear power activities involving the environment  mining  enrichment  generation and geological disposal 
The environmental impact of nuclear power results from the nuclear fuel cycle  operation  and the effects of nuclear accidents 
The greenhouse gas emissions from nuclear fission power are small relative to those associated with coal  oil  gas  and biomass  They are about equal to those associated with wind and hydroelectric              
The routine health risks from nuclear fission power are very small relative to those associated with coal  oil  gas  solar  biomass  wind and hydroelectric              
However  there is a  catastrophic risk  potential if containment fails               which in nuclear reactors can be brought about by over heated fuels melting and releasing large quantities of fission products into the environment  The public is sensitive to these risks and there has been considerable public opposition to nuclear power  Even so  in comparing the fatalities for major accidents alone in the energy sector  it is still found that the risks associated with nuclear power are extremely small relative to those associated with coal  oil  gas and hydroelectric               For the operation of a      MWe nuclear power plant  the complete nuclear fuel cycle  from mining to reactor operation to waste disposal  the radiation dose is cited as     person rem year  The dose is     person rem year for an equivalent coal fired power plant              
The      Three Mile Island accident and      Chernobyl disaster  along with high construction costs  ended the rapid growth of global nuclear power capacity               A further disastrous release of radioactive materials followed the      Japanese tsunami which damaged the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant  resulting in hydrogen gas explosions and partial meltdowns classified as a Level   event  The large scale release of radioactivity resulted in people being evacuated from a         km exclusion zone set up around the power plant  similar to the         km radius Chernobyl Exclusion Zone remains in effect  Subsequent scientific assessment of the health impacts of radiation has shown that these evacuations were more damaging than the radiation could have been  and recommend that the population be advised to remain in place in all but the most severe radiological release events              
In May       the Washington Post wrote   Had Germany kept its nuclear plants running from       it could have slashed its use of coal for electricity to    percent by now  Today s figure is    percent    Already more lives might have been lost just in Germany because of air pollution from coal power than from all of the world s nuclear accidents to date  Fukushima and Chernobyl included               

Accidents edit 
Main article  Nuclear and radiation accidents
The abandoned city of Pripyat with the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the distance
The effect of nuclear accidents has been a topic of debate practically since the first nuclear reactors were constructed  It has also been a key factor in public concern about nuclear facilities               Some technical measures to reduce the risk of accidents or to minimise the amount of radioactivity released to the environment have been adopted  Despite the use of such measures  human error remains  and  there have been many accidents with varying effects as well near misses and incidents                            
Benjamin K  Sovacool has reported that worldwide there have been    accidents at nuclear power plants               Fifty seven accidents have occurred since the Chernobyl disaster  and         out of     of all nuclear related accidents have occurred in the USA               Serious nuclear power plant accidents include the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster         Chernobyl disaster         Three Mile Island accident         and the SL   accident                      Stuart Arm states   apart from Chernobyl  no nuclear workers or members of the public have ever died as a result of exposure to radiation due to a commercial nuclear reactor incident               
The International Atomic Energy Agency maintains a website reporting recent accidents              

Safety edit 
Main article  Nuclear safety and security
Nuclear safety and security covers the actions taken to prevent nuclear and radiation accidents or to limit their consequences  This covers nuclear power plants as well as all other nuclear facilities  the transportation of nuclear materials  and the use and storage of nuclear materials for medical  power  industry  and military uses 
Although there is no way to guarantee that a reactor will always be designed  built and operated safely  the nuclear power industry has improved the safety and performance of reactors  and has proposed safer reactor designs  though many of these designs have yet to be tested at industrial or commercial scales               Mistakes do occur and the designers of reactors at Fukushima in Japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an earthquake would disable the backup systems that were supposed to stabilise the reactor after the earthquake                            According to UBS AG  the Fukushima I nuclear accidents have cast doubt on whether even an advanced economy like Japan can master nuclear energy safety               Catastrophic scenarios involving terrorist attacks are also conceivable              
An interdisciplinary team from MIT have estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from      to       at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period                            To date  there have been five serious accidents  core damage  in the world since       one at Three Mile Island in       one at Chernobyl in       and three at Fukushima Daiichi in        corresponding to the beginning of the operation of generation II reactors  This leads to on average of one serious accident happening every eight years worldwide               Despite these accidents and public opinion  the safety record of nuclear power  in terms of lives lost  ignoring nonfatal illnesses  per unit of electricity delivered  is better than every other major source of power in the world  and on par with solar and wind

Energy transition is the shift by several countries to sustainable economies by means of renewable energy  energy efficiency and sustainable development  This trend has been augmented by diversifying electricity generation and allowing homes and businesses with solar panels on their rooftops to sell electricity to the grid  In the future this could  lead to a majority of our energy coming from decentralized solar panels and wind turbines scattered across the country  rather than large power plants               The final goal of German proponents of a nuclear power phase out is the abolishment of coal and other non renewable energy sources              
Issues exist that currently prevent a shift to      renewable technologies  There is debate over the environmental impact of solar power  and the environmental impact of wind power  Some argue that the pollution produced and requirement of rare earth elements offsets many of the benefits compared to other alternative power sources such as hydroelectric  geothermal  and nuclear power
