Technological unemployment is the loss of jobs caused by technological change                                   It is a key type of structural unemployment  Technological change typically includes the introduction of labour saving  mechanical muscle  machines or more efficient  mechanical mind  processes  automation   and humans  role in these processes are minimized             Just as horses were gradually made obsolete as transport by the automobile and as labourer by the tractor  humans  jobs have also been affected throughout modern history  Historical examples include artisan weavers reduced to poverty after the introduction of mechanized looms  Thousands of man years of work was performed in a matter of hours by the  bombe codebreaking machine during World War II  A contemporary example of technological unemployment is the displacement of retail cashiers by self service tills and cashierless stores 
That technological change can cause short term job losses is widely accepted  The view that it can lead to lasting increases in unemployment has long been controversial  Participants in the technological unemployment debates can be broadly divided into optimists and pessimists  Optimists agree that innovation may be disruptive to jobs in the short term  yet hold that various compensation effects ensure there is never a long term negative impact on jobs  whereas pessimists contend that at least in some circumstances  new technologies can lead to a lasting decline in the total number of workers in employment  The phrase  technological unemployment  was popularised by John Maynard Keynes in the     s  who said it was  only a temporary phase of maladjustment              The issue of machines displacing human labour has been discussed since at least Aristotle s time                       
Prior to the   th century  both the elite and common people would generally take the pessimistic view on technological unemployment  at least in cases where the issue arose  Due to generally low unemployment in much of pre modern history  the topic was rarely a prominent concern      citation needed      In the   th century fears over the impact of machinery on jobs intensified with the growth of mass unemployment  especially in Great Britain which was then at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution  Yet some economic thinkers     who       began to argue against these fears  claiming that overall innovation would not have negative effects on jobs  These arguments were formalised in the early   th century by the classical economists  During the second half of the   th century  it stayed apparent that technological progress was benefiting all sections of society  including the working class  Concerns over the negative impact of innovation diminished  The term  Luddite fallacy  was coined to describe the thinking that innovation would have lasting harmful effects on employment 
The view that technology is unlikely to lead to long term unemployment has been repeatedly challenged by a minority of economists      who       In the early     s these included David Ricardo  There were dozens of economists     who       warning about technological unemployment during brief intensifications of the debate that spiked in the     s and     s  Especially in Europe  there were further warnings in the closing two decades of the twentieth century  as commentators     who       noted an enduring rise in unemployment suffered by many industrialised nations since the     s  Yet a clear majority of both professional economists and the interested general public held the optimistic view through most of the   th century 
Advances in artificial intelligence  AI  have reignited debates about the possibility of mass unemployment  or even the end of employment altogether  Some experts such as Geoffrey Hinton believe that the development of artificial general intelligence and advanced robotics will eventually enable the automation of all intellectual and physical tasks  suggesting the need for a basic income for non workers to subsist                        Others like Daron Acemoglu argue that humans will remain necessary for certain tasks  or complementary to AI  disrupting the labor market without necessarily causing mass unemployment                          World Bank s      World Development Report argues that while automation displaces workers  technological innovation creates more new industries and jobs on balance             


History edit 
Classical era edit 
Roman Emperor Vespasian  who refused a low cost method of transport of heavy goods that would put laborers out of work
According to author Gregory Woirol  the phenomenon of technological unemployment is likely to have existed since at least the invention of the wheel              Ancient societies had various methods for relieving the poverty of those unable to support themselves with their own labour  Ancient China and ancient Egypt may have had various centrally run relief programmes in response to technological unemployment dating back to at least the second millennium BC              Ancient Hebrews and adherents of the ancient Vedic religion had decentralised responses where aiding the poor was encouraged by their faiths              In ancient Greece  free labourers could find themselves unemployed due to both the effects of ancient labour saving technology and to competition from slaves   machines of flesh and blood                Sometimes  these unemployed workers would starve to death or were forced into slavery themselves although in other cases they were supported by handouts  Pericles responded to perceived technological unemployment by launching public works programmes to provide paid work to the jobless  Pericle s programmes were criticized for wasting public money but these criticisms were defeated             
Perhaps the earliest example of a scholar discussing the phenomenon of technological unemployment occurs with Aristotle  who speculated in Book One of Politics that if machines could become sufficiently advanced  there would be no more need for human labour              Similar to the Greeks  ancient Romans responded to the problem of technological unemployment by relieving poverty with handouts  such as the Cura Annonae   Several hundred thousand families were sometimes supported like this at once              Less often  jobs were directly created with public works programmes  such as those launched by the Gracchi  Various emperors even went as far as to refuse or ban labour saving innovations                          In one instance  the introduction of a labor saving invention was blocked  when Emperor Vespasian refused to allow a new method of low cost transportation of heavy goods  saying  You must allow my poor hauliers to earn their bread               Labour shortages began to develop in the Roman empire towards the end of the second century AD  and from this point mass unemployment in Europe appears to have largely receded for over a millennium             

Post classical era edit 
The medieval and early renaissance period saw the widespread adoption of newly invented technologies  as well as older ones which had been conceived yet barely used in the Classical era              Some were invented in Europe while others were invented in more Eastern countries like China  India  Arabia and Persia  The Black Death left fewer workers across Europe  Mass unemployment began to reappear in Europe  especially in Western  Central and Southern Europe in the   th century  partly as a result of population growth  and partly due to changes in the availability of land for subsistence farming caused by early enclosures              As a result of the threat of unemployment  there was less tolerance for disruptive new technologies  European authorities would often side with groups representing subsections of the working population  such as Guilds  banning new technologies and sometimes even executing those who tried to promote or trade in them             

  th to   th century edit 
 Elizabeth I  who refused to patent a knitting machine invented by William Lee  saying  Consider thou what the invention could do to my poor subjects  It would assuredly bring them to ruin by depriving them of employment  thus making them beggars  
In Great Britain  the ruling elite began to take a less restrictive approach to innovation somewhat earlier than in much of continental Europe  which has been cited as a possible reason for Britain s early lead in driving the Industrial Revolution              Yet concern over the impact of innovation on employment remained strong through the   th and early   th century  A famous example of new technology being refused occurred when the inventor William Lee invited Queen Elizabeth I to view a labour saving knitting machine  The Queen declined to issue a patent on the grounds that the technology might cause unemployment among textile workers  After moving to France and also failing to achieve success in promoting his invention  Lee returned to England but was again refused by Elizabeth s successor James I for the same reason             
After the Glorious Revolution  authorities became less sympathetic to workers concerns about losing their jobs due to innovation  An increasingly influential strand of Mercantilist thought held that introducing labour saving technology would actually reduce unemployment  as it would allow British firms to increase their market share against foreign competition  From the early   th century workers could no longer rely on support from the authorities against the perceived threat of technological unemployment  They would sometimes take direct action  such as machine breaking  in attempts to protect themselves from disruptive innovation  Joseph Schumpeter notes that as the   th century progressed  thinkers would raise the alarm about technological unemployment with increasing frequency  with von Justi being a prominent example              Yet Schumpeter also notes that the prevailing view among the elite solidified on the position that technological unemployment would not be a long term problem                         

  th century edit 
It was only in the   th century that debates over technological unemployment became intense  especially in Great Britain where many economic thinkers of the time were concentrated  Building on the work of Dean Tucker and Adam Smith  political economists began to create what would become the modern discipline of economics      note        While rejecting much of mercantilism  members of the new discipline largely agreed that technological unemployment would not be an enduring problem  In the first few decades of the   th century  several prominent political economists did  however  argue against the optimistic view  claiming that innovation could cause long term unemployment  These included Sismondi              Malthus  J S Mill  and from       David Ricardo himself              As arguably the most respected political economist of his age  Ricardo s view was challenging to others in the discipline  The first major economist to respond was Jean Baptiste Say  who argued that no one would introduce machinery if they were going to reduce the amount of product      note        and that as Say s law states that supply creates its own demand  any displaced workers would automatically find work elsewhere once the market had had time to adjust              Ramsey McCulloch expanded and formalised Say s optimistic views on technological unemployment  and was supported by others such as Charles Babbage  Nassau Senior and many other lesser known political economists  Towards the middle of the   th century  Karl Marx joined the debates  Building on the work of Ricardo and Mill  Marx went much further  presenting a deeply pessimistic view of technological unemployment  his views attracted many followers and founded an enduring school of thought but mainstream economics was not dramatically changed  By the     s  at least in Great Britain  technological unemployment faded both as a popular concern and as an issue for academic debate  It had become increasingly apparent that innovation was increasing prosperity for all sections of British society  including the working class  As the classical school of thought gave way to neoclassical economics  mainstream thinking was tightened to take into account and refute the pessimistic arguments of Mill and Ricardo             

  th century edit 
Critics of the view that innovation causes lasting unemployment argue that technology is used by workers and does not replace them on a large scale 
For the first two decades of the   th century  mass unemployment was not the major problem it had been in the first half of the   th  While the Marxist school and a few other thinkers continued to challenge the optimistic view  technological unemployment was not a significant concern for mainstream economic thinking until the mid to late     s  In the     s mass unemployment re emerged as a pressing issue within Europe  At this time the U S  was generally more prosperous  but even there urban unemployment had begun to increase from       Rural American workers had been suffering job losses from the start of the     s  many had been displaced by improved agricultural technology  such as the tractor  The centre of gravity for economic debates had by this time moved from Great Britain to the United States  and it was here that the   th century s two great periods of debate over technological unemployment largely occurred             
The peak periods for the two debates were in the     s and the     s  According to economic historian Gregory R Woirol  the two episodes share several similarities              In both cases academic debates were preceded by an outbreak of popular concern  sparked by recent rises in unemployment  In both cases the debates were not conclusively settled  but faded away as unemployment was reduced by an outbreak of war   World War II for the debate of the     s  and the Vietnam War for the     s episodes  In both cases  the debates were conducted within the prevailing paradigm at the time  with little reference to earlier thought  In the     s  optimists based their arguments largely on neo classical beliefs in the self correcting power of markets to reduce any short term unemployment via compensation effects  In the     s  belief in compensation effects was less strong  but the mainstream Keynesian economists of the time largely believed government intervention would be able to counter any persistent technological unemployment that was not cleared by market forces  Another similarity was the publication of a major Federal study towards the end of each episode  which broadly found that long term technological unemployment was not occurring  though the studies did agree innovation was a major factor in the short term displacement of workers  and advised government action to provide assistance       note                   
As the golden age of capitalism came to a close in the     s  unemployment once again rose  and this time generally remained relatively high for the rest of the century  across most advanced economies  Several economists once again argued that this may be due to innovation  with perhaps the most prominent being Paul Samuelson              Overall  the closing decades of the   th century saw most concern expressed over technological unemployment in Europe  though there were several examples in the U S              A number of popular works warning of technological unemployment were also published  These included James S  Albus s      book titled Peoples  Capitalism  The Economics of the Robot Revolution                          David F  Noble with works published in                  and                   Jeremy Rifkin and his      book The End of Work              and the      book The Global Trap              Yet for the most part  other than during the periods of intense debate in the     s and   s  the consensus in the   th century among both professional economists and the general public remained that technology does not cause long term joblessness             

  st century edit 
Opinions edit 


There is a prevailing opinion that we are in an era of technological unemployment   that technology is increasingly making skilled workers obsolete 


Prof  Mark MacCarthy                   

The general consensus that innovation does not cause long term unemployment held strong for the first decade of the   st century although it continued to be challenged by a number of academic works                          and by popular works such as Marshall Brain s Robotic Nation             and Martin Ford s The Lights in the Tunnel  Automation  Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future             
Since the publication of their      book Race Against the Machine  MIT professors Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson have been prominent among those raising concern about technological unemployment  The two professors remain relatively optimistic  however  stating  the key to winning the race is not to compete against machines but to compete with machines                                                                                      
Concern about technological unemployment grew in      due in part to a number of studies predicting substantially increased technological unemployment in forthcoming decades and empirical evidence that  in certain sectors  employment is falling worldwide despite rising output  thus discounting globalization and offshoring as the only causes of increasing unemployment                                     
In       professor Nick Bloom of Stanford University stated there had recently been a major change of heart concerning technological unemployment among his fellow economists              In      the Financial Times reported that the impact of innovation on jobs has been a dominant theme in recent economic discussion              According to the academic and former politician Michael Ignatieff writing in       questions concerning the effects of technological change have been  haunting democratic politics everywhere               Concerns have included evidence showing worldwide falls in employment across sectors such as manufacturing  falls in pay for low and medium skilled workers stretching back several decades even as productivity continues to rise  the increase in often precarious platform mediated employment  and the occurrence of  jobless recoveries  after recent recessions  The   st century has seen a variety of skilled tasks partially taken over by machines  including translation  legal research and even low level journalism  Care work  entertainment  and other tasks requiring empathy  previously thought safe from automation  have also begun to be performed by robots                                                                         
Former U S  Treasury Secretary and Professor of Economics at Harvard University Lawrence Summers stated in      that he no longer believed automation would always create new jobs and that  This isn t some hypothetical future possibility  This is something that s emerging before us right now   Summers noted that already  more labor sectors were losing jobs than creating new ones      note                                                        While himself doubtful about technological unemployment  professor Mark MacCarthy stated in the fall of      that it is now the  prevailing opinion  that the era of technological unemployment has arrived             
At the      Davos meeting  Thomas Friedman reported that the link between technology and unemployment seemed to have been the dominant theme of that year s discussions  A survey at Davos      found that     of     respondents agreed that technology was driving jobless growth              At the      Davos  Gillian Tett found that almost all delegates attending a discussion on inequality and technology expected an increase in inequality over the next five years  and gives the reason for this as the technological displacement of jobs                   saw Martin Ford win the Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award for his Rise of the Robots  Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future  and saw the first world summit on technological unemployment  held in New York  In late       further warnings of potential worsening for technological unemployment came from Andy Haldane  the Bank of England s chief economist  and from Ignazio Visco  the governor of the Bank of Italy                          In an October      interview  US President Barack Obama said that due to the growth of artificial intelligence  society would be debating  unconditional free money for everyone  within    to    years              In       computer scientist and artificial intelligence expert Stuart J  Russell stated that  in the long run nearly all current jobs will go away  so we need fairly radical policy changes to prepare for a very different future economy   In a book he authored  Russell claims that  One rapidly emerging picture is that of an economy where far fewer people work because work is unnecessary   However  he predicted that employment in healthcare  home care  and construction would increase             
Other economists     who       have argued that long term technological unemployment is unlikely  In       Pew Research canvassed       technology professionals and economists and found a split of opinion      of respondents believed that new technologies would displace more jobs than they would create by the year       while     maintained that they would not              Economics professor Bruce Chapman from Australian National University has advised that studies such as Frey and Osborne s tend to overstate the probability of future job losses  as they don t account for new employment likely to be created  due to technology  in what are currently unknown areas              Looking deeper into this  small and mid sized businesses have created a large amount of new jobs around the world  which allows for entrepreneurs and investors to have the freedom to create and grow businesses  which is extremely vital with new technologies emerging everyday              With all of these new buinesses there will be a large number of workers that will be required to work for these companies  which would improve the world s employment situation  replacing jobs that were previously lost  
General public surveys have often found an expectation that automation would impact jobs widely  but not the jobs held by those particular people surveyed             

Studies edit 
A number of studies have predicted that automation will take a large proportion of jobs in the future  but estimates of the level of unemployment this will cause vary  Research by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne of the Oxford Martin School showed that employees engaged in  tasks following well defined procedures that can easily be performed by sophisticated algorithms  are at risk of displacement  The study  published in       shows that automation can affect both skilled and unskilled work and both high and low paying occupations  however  low paid physical occupations are most at risk  It estimated that     of US jobs were at high risk of automation              In       the economic think tank Bruegel released a study  based on the Frey and Osborne approach  claiming that across the European Union s    member states      of jobs were at risk of automation  The countries where jobs were least vulnerable to automation were Sweden  with        of jobs vulnerable  the UK at         the Netherlands at         and France and Denmark  both at         The countries where jobs were found to be most vulnerable were Romania at         Portugal at         Croatia at        and Bulgaria at                                 A      report by the Taub Center found that     of jobs in Israel were at risk of being automated within the next two decades              In January       a joint study by the Oxford Martin School and Citibank  based on previous studies on automation and data from the World Bank  found that the risk of automation in developing countries was much higher than in developed countries  It found that     of jobs in China      of jobs in India      of jobs in Ethiopia  and     of jobs in Uzbekistan were at risk of automation              The World Bank similarly employed the methodology of Frey and Osborne  A      study by the International Labour Organization found     of salaried electrical  amp  electronics industry positions in Thailand      of salaried electrical  amp  electronics industry positions in Vietnam      of salaried electrical  amp  electronics industry positions in Indonesia  and     of salaried electrical  amp  electronics industry positions in the Philippines were at high risk of automation              A      United Nations report stated that     of jobs in the developing world were at risk of automation  and predicted that more jobs might be lost when corporations stop outsourcing to developing countries after automation in industrialized countries makes it less lucrative to outsource to countries with lower labor costs             
The Council of Economic Advisers  a US government agency tasked with providing economic research for the White House  in the      Economic Report of the President  used the data from the Frey and Osborne study to estimate that     of jobs with an hourly wage below          of jobs with an hourly wage between     and      and    of jobs with an hourly wage above     were at risk of automation              A      study by Ryerson University  now Toronto Metropolitan University  found that     of jobs in Canada were at risk of automation  dividing them into two categories    high risk  jobs and  low risk  jobs  High risk jobs were mainly lower income jobs that required lower education levels than average  Low risk jobs were on average more skilled positions  The report found a     chance that high risk jobs and a     chance that low risk jobs would be affected by automation in the next       years              A      study by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that up to     of jobs in the US      of jobs in Germany      of jobs in the UK  and     of jobs in Japan were at high risk of being automated by the early     s              A      study by Ball State University found about half of American jobs were at risk of automation  many of them low income jobs              A September      report by McKinsey  amp  Company found that as of           billion out of     billion working hours per year dedicated to manufacturing  or      trillion out of      trillion in labor  were already automatable  In low skill areas      of labor in apparel goods      of agriculture processing      of food manufacturing  and     of beverage manufacturing were subject to automation  In mid skill areas      of basic materials production and     of furniture manufacturing was automatable  In high skill areas      of aerospace and defense labor and     of advanced electronics labor could be automated              In October       a survey of information technology decision makers in the US and UK found that a majority believed that most business processes could be automated by       On average  they said that    
of business processes were subject to automation              A November      report by the McKinsey Global Institute that analyzed around     occupations in    countries estimated that between     million and     million jobs could be lost due to robotic automation by       It estimated that jobs were more at risk in developed countries than developing countries due to a greater availability of capital to invest in automation              Job losses and downward mobility blamed on automation has been cited as one of many factors in the resurgence of nationalist and protectionist politics in the US  UK and France  among other countries                                                             
However  not all recent empirical studies have found evidence to support the idea that automation will cause widespread unemployment  A study released in       examining the impact of industrial robots in    countries between      and       found no overall reduction in employment was caused by the robots  and that there was a slight increase in overall wages              According to a study published in McKinsey Quarterly             in      the impact of computerization in most cases is not replacement of employees but automation of portions of the tasks they perform              A      OECD study found that among the    OECD countries surveyed  on average only    of jobs were in foreseeable danger of automation  but this varied greatly among countries  for example in South Korea the figure of at risk jobs was    while in Austria it was                  In contrast to other studies  the OECD study does not primarily base its assessment on the tasks that a job entails  but also includes demographic variables  including sex  education and age  It is not clear however why a job should be more or less automatise just because it is performed by a woman  In       Forrester estimated that automation would result in a net loss of about    of jobs in the US by       replacing     of jobs while creating new jobs equivalent to     of the workforce               Another study argued that the risk of US jobs to automation had been overestimated due to factors such as the heterogeneity of tasks within occupations and the adaptability of jobs being neglected  The study found that once this was taken into account  the number of occupations at risk to automation in the US drops  ceteris paribus  from     to                  A      study on the effect of automation on Germany found no evidence that automation caused total job losses but that they do effect the jobs people are employed in  losses in the industrial sector due to automation were offset by gains in the service sector  Manufacturing workers were also not at risk from automation and were in fact more likely to remain employed  though not necessarily doing the same tasks  However  automation did result in a decrease in labour s income share as it raised productivity but not wages              
A      Brookings Institution study that analyzed    industries in    OECD countries from      to      found that automation was responsible for holding down wages  Although it concluded that automation did not reduce the overall number of jobs available and even increased them  it found that from the     s to the     s  it had reduced the share of human labor in the value added to the work  and thus had helped to slow wage growth               In April       Adair Turner  former Chairman of the Financial Services Authority and head of the Institute for New Economic Thinking  stated that it would already be possible to automate     of jobs with current technology  and that it will be possible to automate all jobs by                   

Premature deindustrialization edit 
Premature deindustrialization occurs when developing nations deindustrialize without first becoming rich  as happened with the advanced economies  The concept was popularized by Dani Rodrik in       who went on to publish several papers showing the growing empirical evidence for the phenomena  Premature deindustrialization adds to concern over technological unemployment for developing countries   as traditional compensation effects that advanced economy workers enjoyed  such being able to get well paid work in the service sector after losing their factory jobs   may not be available                           
Some commentators  such as Carl Benedikt Frey  argue that with the right responses  the negative effects of further automation on workers in developing economies can still be avoided              

Artificial intelligence edit

Since about       a new wave of concern over technological unemployment had become prominent  this time over the effects of artificial intelligence  AI               
Commentators including Calum Chace and Daniel Hulme have warned that if unchecked  AI threatens to cause an  economic singularity   with job churn too rapid for humans to adapt to  leading to widespread technological unemployment  However  they also advise that with the right responses by business leaders  policy makers and society  the impact of AI could be a net positive for workers                           
Morgan R  Frank et al  cautions that there are several barriers preventing researchers from making accurate predictions of the effects AI will have on future job markets               Marian Krakovsky has argued that the jobs most likely to be completely replaced by AI are in middle class areas  such as professional services  Often  the practical solution is to find another job  but workers may not have the qualifications for high level jobs and so must drop to lower level jobs  However  Krakovsky        predicts that AI will largely take the route of  complementing people   rather than  replicating people   Suggesting that the goal of people implementing AI is to improve the life of workers  not replace them               Studies have also shown that rather than solely destroying jobs AI can also create work  albeit low skill jobs to train AI in low income countries              
Following Russian president Vladimir Putin s      statement that whichever country first achieves mastery in AI  will become the ruler of the world   various national and supranational governments have announced AI strategies  Concerns on not falling behind in the AI arms race have been more prominent than worries over AI s potential to cause unemployment  Several strategies suggest that achieving a leading role in AI should help their citizens get more rewarding jobs  Finland has aimed to help the citizens of other EU nations acquire the skills they need to compete in the post AI jobs market  making a free course on  The Elements of AI  available in multiple European languages                                         
Oracle CEO Mark Hurd predicted that AI  will actually create more jobs  not less jobs  as humans will be needed to manage AI systems              
Martin Ford argues that many jobs are routine  repetitive and  to an AI  predictable  Ford warns that these jobs may be automated in the next couple of decades  and that many of the new jobs may not be  accessible to people with average capability   even with retraining              
Certain digital technologies are predicted to result in more job losses than others  For example  in recent years  the adoption of modern robotics has led to net employment growth  However  many businesses anticipate that automation  or employing robots would result in job losses in the future  This is especially true for companies in Central and Eastern Europe                                        
Other digital technologies  such as platforms or big data  are projected to have a more neutral impact on employment                           

Issues within the debates edit 
Long term effects on employment edit 


There are more sectors losing jobs than creating jobs  And the general purpose aspect of software technology means that even the industries and jobs that it creates are not forever 


Lawrence Summers            

Participants in the technological employment debates agree that temporary job losses can result from technological innovation  Similarly  there is no dispute that innovation sometimes has positive effects on workers  Disagreement focuses on whether it is possible for innovation to have a lasting negative impact on overall employment  Levels of persistent unemployment can be quantified empirically  but the causes are subject to debate  Optimists accept short term unemployment may be caused by innovation  yet claim that after a while  compensation effects will always create at least as many jobs as were originally destroyed  While this optimistic view has been continually challenged  it was dominant among mainstream economists for most of the   th and   th centuries                            For example  labor economists Jacob Mincer and Stephan Danninger developed an empirical study using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics  and find that although in the short run  technological progress seems to have unclear effects on aggregate unemployment  it reduces unemployment in the long run  When they include a   year lag  however  the evidence supporting a short run employment effect of technology seems to disappear as well  suggesting that technological unemployment  appears to be a myth                Other studies  on the other hand  suggest that the labour market effects of technologies such as industrial robots strongly depend on domestic institutional context              
The concept of structural unemployment  a lasting level of joblessness that does not disappear even at the high point of the business cycle  became popular in the     s  For pessimists  technological unemployment is one of the factors driving the wider phenomena of structural unemployment  Since the     s  even optimistic economists have increasingly accepted that structural unemployment has indeed risen in advanced economies  but they have tended to attribute this on globalisation and offshoring rather than technological change      citation needed      Others claim a chief cause of the lasting increase in unemployment has been the reluctance of governments to pursue expansionary policies since the displacement of Keynesianism that occurred in the     s and early   s                                        In the   st century  and especially since       pessimists have been arguing with increasing frequency that lasting worldwide technological unemployment is a growing threat                                                   

Compensation effects edit 
John Kay inventor of the Fly Shuttle AD       by Ford Madox Brown  depicting the inventor John Kay kissing his wife goodbye as men carry him away from his home to escape a mob angry about his labour saving mechanical loom  Compensation effects were not widely understood at this time  
Compensation effects are labour friendly consequences of innovation which  compensate  workers for job losses initially caused by new technology  In the     s  several compensation effects were described by Jean Baptiste Say in response to Ricardo s statement that long term technological unemployment could occur  Soon after  a whole system of effects was developed by Ramsey McCulloch  The system was labelled  compensation theory  by Karl Marx  who criticized its ideas  arguing that none of the effects were guaranteed to operate  Disagreement over the effectiveness of compensation effects has remained a central part of academic debates on technological unemployment ever since                          
Compensation effects include  

By new machines   The labour needed to build the new equipment that applied innovation requires  
By new investments   Enabled by the cost savings and therefore increased profits from the new technology  
By changes in wages   In cases where unemployment does occur  this can cause a lowering of wages  thus allowing more workers to be re employed at the now lower cost  On the other hand  sometimes workers will enjoy wage increases as their profitability rises  This leads to increased income and therefore increased spending  which in turn encourages job creation  
By lower prices   Which then lead to more demand  and therefore more employment   Lower prices can also help offset wage cuts  as cheaper goods will increase workers  buying power 
By new products   Where innovation directly creates new jobs  
The  by new machines  effect is now rarely discussed by economists  it is often accepted that Marx successfully refuted it              Even pessimists often concede that product innovation associated with the  by new products  effect can sometimes have a positive effect on employment  An important distinction can be drawn between  process  and  product  innovations      note        Evidence from Latin America seems to suggest that product innovation significantly contributes to the employment growth at the firm level  more so than process innovation               The extent to which the other effects are successful in compensating the workforce for job losses has been extensively debated throughout the history of modern economics  the issue is still not resolved                          One such effect that potentially complements the compensation effect is job multiplier  According to research developed by Enrico Moretti  with each additional skilled job created in high tech industries in a given city  more than two jobs are created in the non tradable sector  His findings suggest that technological growth and the resulting job creation in high tech industries might have a more significant spillover effect than anticipated               Evidence from Europe also supports such a job multiplier effect  showing local high tech jobs could create five additional low tech jobs              
Many economists pessimistic about technological unemployment accept that compensation effects did largely operate as the optimists claimed through most of the   th and   th century  Yet they hold that the advent of computerisation means that compensation effects have become less effective  An early example of this argument was made by Wassily Leontief in       He conceded that after some disruption  the advance of mechanization during the Industrial Revolution increased the demand for labour as well as increasing pay due to effects that flow from increased productivity               While early machines lowered the demand for muscle power  they were unintelligent and needed large numbers of human operators to remain productive  Yet since the introduction of computers into the workplace  there is now less need not just for muscle power but also for human brain power  Hence even as productivity continues to rise  the lower demand for human labour may mean less pay and employment                         

Luddite fallacy edit 


If the Luddite fallacy were true we would all be out of work because productivity has been increasing for two centuries 


Alex Tabarrok             

The term  Luddite fallacy  is sometimes used to express the view that those concerned about long term technological unemployment are committing a fallacy  as they fail to account for compensation effects  People who use the term typically expect that technological progress will have no long term impact on employment levels  and eventually will raise wages for all workers  because progress helps to increase the overall wealth of society  The term is originating on from the Luddites  members of an early   th century English anti textile machinery organisation  During the   th century and the first decade of the   st century  the dominant view among economists has been that belief in long term technological unemployment was indeed a fallacy  More recently  there has been increased support for the view that the benefits of automation are not equally distributed                                        
There are two different theories for why long term difficulty could develop 

Traditionally ascribed to the Luddites  accurately or not   that there is a finite amount of work available and if machines do it  there can be none left for humans  Economists may call this the lump of labour fallacy  arguing that in reality no such limitation exists 
A long term difficulty can arise that has nothing to do with any lump of labour  In this view  the amount of work that can exist is infinite  but
machines can do most of the  easy  work that requires less skill  talent  knowledge  or insight
the definition of what is  easy  expands as information technology progresses  and
the work that lies beyond  easy  may require greater brainpower than most people have 
This second view is supported by many modern advocates of the possibility of long term  systemic technological unemployment 

Skill levels and technological unemployment edit 
A frequent view among those discussing the effect of innovation on the labour market has been that it mainly hurts those with low skills  while often benefiting skilled workers  According to scholars such as Lawrence F  Katz  this may have been true for much of the twentieth century  yet in the   th century  innovations in the workplace largely displaced costly skilled artisans  and generally benefited the low skilled  While   st century innovation has been replacing some unskilled work  other low skilled occupations remain resistant to automation  while white collar work requiring intermediate skills is increasingly being performed by autonomous computer programs                                        
Some recent studies however  such as a      paper by Georg Graetz and Guy Michaels  found that at least in the area they studied   the impact of industrial robots   innovation is boosting pay for highly skilled workers while having a more negative impact on those with low to medium skills              A      report by Carl Benedikt Frey  Michael Osborne and Citi Research agreed that innovation had been disruptive mostly to middle skilled jobs  yet predicted that in the next ten years the impact of automation would fall most heavily on those with low skills              
Geoffrey Colvin at Forbes argued that predictions on the kind of work a computer will never be able to do have proven inaccurate  A better approach to anticipate the skills on which humans will provide value would be to find out activities where we will insist that humans remain accountable for important decisions  such as with judges  CEOs  bus drivers and government leaders  or where human nature can only be satisfied by deep interpersonal connections  even if those tasks could be automated              
In contrast  others see even skilled human laborers being obsolete  Oxford academics Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A Osborne have predicted computerization could make nearly half of jobs redundant               of the     professions assessed  they found a strong correlation between education and income with ability to be automated  with office jobs and service work being some of the more at risk               In      co founder of Sun Microsystems Vinod Khosla predicted that     of medical doctors  jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software              
The issue of redundant job places is elaborated by the      paper by Natalya Kozlova  according to which over     of workers in Russia perform work that requires low levels of education and can be replaced by applying digital technologies  Only     of those people possess education that exceeds the level of intellectual computer systems present today and expected within the following decade              

Empirical findings edit 
There has been a significant amount of empirical research that attempts to quantify the impact of technological unemployment  mainly at the microeconomic level  Most existing firm level research has found a labor friendly nature of technological innovations  For example  German economists Stefan Lachenmaier and Horst Rottmann find that both product and process innovation have a positive effect on employment  They also find that process innovation has a more significant job creation effect than product innovation               This result is supported by evidence in the United States as well  which shows that manufacturing firm innovations have a positive effect on the total number of jobs  not just limited to firm specific behavior              
At the industry level  however  researchers have found mixed results with regard to the employment effect of technological changes  A      study on manufacturing and service sectors in    European countries suggests that positive employment effects of technological innovations only exist in the medium  and high tech sectors  There also seems to be a negative correlation between employment and capital formation  which suggests that technological progress could potentially be labor saving given that process innovation is often incorporated in investment              
Limited macroeconomic analysis has been done to study the relationship between technological shocks and unemployment  The small amount of existing research  however  suggests mixed results  Italian economist Marco Vivarelli finds that the labor saving effect of process innovation appears to have affected the Italian economy more negatively than the United States  On the other hand  the job creating effect of product innovation could only be observed in the United States  not Italy               Another study in      finds a more transitory  rather than permanent  unemployment effect of technological change              

Measures of technological innovation edit 
There have been four main approaches that attempt to capture and document technological innovation quantitatively      citation needed      The first one  proposed by Jordi Gali in      and further developed by Neville Francis and Valerie A  Ramey in       is to use long run restrictions in a vector autoregression  VAR  to identify technological shocks  assuming that only technology affects long run productivity                           
The second approach is from Susanto Basu  John Fernald and Miles Kimball               They create a measure of aggregate technology change with augmented Solow residuals  controlling for aggregate  non technological effects such as non constant returns and imperfect competition 
The third method  initially developed by John Shea in       takes a more direct approach and employs observable indicators such as research and development  R amp D  spending  and number of patent applications               This measure of technological innovation is widely used in empirical research  since it does not rely on the assumption that only technology affects long run productivity  and fairly accurately captures output variation based on input variation  However  there are limitations with direct measures such as R amp D  For example  since R amp D only measures the input in innovation  the output is unlikely to be perfectly correlated with the input  In addition  R amp D fails to capture the indeterminate lag between developing a new product or service  and bringing it to market              
The fourth approach  constructed by Michelle Alexopoulos  looks at the number of new titles published in the fields of technology and computer science to reflect technological progress  which he found to be consistent with R amp D expenditure data               Compared with R amp D  this indicator captures the lag between changes in technology 

Solutions edit 
Preventing net job losses edit 
Banning refusing innovation edit 
 What I object to  is the craze for machinery  not machinery as such  The craze is for what they call labour saving machinery  Men go on  saving labour   till thousands are without work and thrown on the open streets to die of starvation     Gandhi                   
Historically  innovations were sometimes banned due to concerns about their impact on employment  Since the development of modern economics  however  this option has generally not even been considered as a solution  at least not for the advanced economies  Even commentators who are pessimistic about long term technological unemployment invariably consider innovation to be an overall benefit to society  with J  S  Mill being perhaps the only prominent western political economist to have suggested prohibiting the use of technology as a possible solution to unemployment              
Gandhian economics called for a delay in the uptake of labour saving machines until unemployment was alleviated  however this advice was largely rejected by Nehru who was to become prime minister once India achieved its independence  The policy of slowing the introduction of innovation so as to avoid technological unemployment was  however  implemented in the   th century within China under Mao s administration                                        

Shorter working hours edit 
In       the average American worker clocked up about    hours per week  Just prior to World War II working hours had fallen to about    per week  and the fall was similar in other advanced economies  According to Wassily Leontief  this was a voluntary increase in technological unemployment  The reduction in working hours helped share out available work  and was favoured by workers who were happy to reduce hours to gain extra leisure  as innovation was at the time generally helping to increase their rates of pay              
Further reductions in working hours have been proposed as a possible solution to unemployment by economists including John R  Commons  Lord Keynes and Luigi Pasinetti  Yet once working hours have reached about    hours per week  workers have been less enthusiastic about further reductions  both to prevent loss of income and as many value engaging in work for its own sake      citation needed      Generally    th century economists had argued against further reductions as a solution to unemployment  saying it reflects a lump of labour fallacy              
In       Google s co founder  Larry Page  suggested a four day workweek  so as technology continues to displace jobs  more people can find employment                                       

Public works edit 
Programmes of public works have traditionally been used as way for governments to directly boost employment  though this has often been opposed by some  but not all  conservatives  Jean Baptiste Say  although generally associated with free market economics  advised that public works could be a solution to technological unemployment               Some commentators  such as professor Mathew Forstater  have advised that public works and guaranteed jobs in the public sector may be the ideal solution to technological unemployment  as unlike welfare or guaranteed income schemes they provide people with the social recognition and meaningful engagement that comes with work                           
For less developed economies  public works may be an easier to administrate solution compared to universal welfare programmes               A partial exception is for spending on infrastructure  which has been recommended as a solution to technological unemployment even by economists previously associated with a neoliberal agenda  such as Larry Summers              

Education edit 
Improved availability to quality education  including skills training for adults  is a solution that in principle at least is not opposed by any side of the political spectrum  and welcomed even by those who are optimistic about long term technological employment  Improved education paid for by government tends to be especially popular with industry  However  several academics have argued that improved education alone will not be sufficient to solve technological unemployment  pointing to recent declines in the demand for many intermediate skills  and suggesting that not everyone is capable in becoming proficient in the most advanced skills                                         Kim Taipale has said that  The era of bell curve distributions that supported a bulging social middle class is over    Education per se is not going to make up the difference                while back in      Paul Krugman argued that better education would be an insufficient solution to technological unemployment              

Living with technological unemployment edit 
Welfare payments edit 
The use of various forms of subsidies has often been accepted as a solution to technological unemployment even by conservatives and by those who are optimistic about the long term effect on jobs  Welfare programmes have historically tended to be more durable once established  compared with other solutions to unemployment such as directly creating jobs with public works  Despite being the first person to create a formal system describing compensation effects  Ramsey McCulloch and most other classical economists advocated government aid for those suffering from technological unemployment  as they understood that market adjustment to new technology was not instantaneous and that those displaced by labour saving technology would not always be able to immediately obtain alternative employment through their own efforts              

Basic income edit 
Main articles  Basic income and Guaranteed minimum income
Several commentators have argued that traditional forms of welfare payment may be inadequate as a response to the future challenges posed by technological unemployment  and have suggested a basic income as an alternative               People advocating some form of basic income as a solution to technological unemployment include Martin Ford  
              Erik Brynjolfsson              Robert Reich  Andrew Yang  Elon Musk  Zoltan Istvan  and Guy Standing  Reich has gone as far as to say the introduction of a basic income  perhaps implemented as a negative income tax is  almost inevitable                while Standing has said he considers that a basic income is becoming  politically essential               
Since late       new basic income pilots have been announced in Finland  the Netherlands  and Canada  Further recent advocacy for basic income has arisen from a number of technology entrepreneurs  the most prominent being Sam Altman  president of Y Combinator              
Skepticism about basic income includes both right and left elements  and proposals for different forms of it have come from all segments of the spectrum  For example  while the best known proposed forms  with taxation and distribution  are usually thought of as left leaning ideas that right leaning people try to defend against  other forms have been proposed even by libertarians  such as von Hayek and Friedman  In the United States  President Richard Nixon s Family Assistance Plan  FAP  of       which had much in common with basic income  passed in the House but was defeated in the Senate              
One objection to basic income is that it could be a disincentive to work  but evidence from older pilots in India  Africa  and Canada indicates that this does not happen and that a basic income encourages low level entrepreneurship and more productive  collaborative work  Another objection is that funding it sustainably is a huge challenge  While new revenue raising ideas have been proposed such as Martin Ford s wage recapture tax  how to fund a generous basic income remains a debated question  and skeptics have dismissed it as utopian  Even from a progressive viewpoint  there are concerns that a basic income set too low may not help the economically vulnerable  especially if financed largely from cuts to other forms of welfare                                                     
To better address both the funding concerns and concerns about government control  one alternative model is that the cost and control would be distributed across the private sector instead of the public sector  Companies across the economy would be required to employ humans  but the job descriptions would be left to private innovation  and individuals would have to compete to be hired and retained  This would be a for profit sector analog of basic income  that is  a market based form of basic income  It differs from a job guarantee in that the government is not the employer  rather  companies are  and there is no aspect of having employees who  cannot be fired   a problem that interferes with economic dynamism  The economic salvation in this model is not that every individual is guaranteed a job  but rather just that enough jobs exist that massive unemployment is avoided and employment is no longer solely the privilege of only the very smartest or highly trained     of the population  Another option for a market based form of basic income has been proposed by the Center for Economic and Social Justice  CESJ  as part of  a Just Third Way   a Third Way with greater justice  through widely distributed power and liberty  Called the Capital Homestead Act               it is reminiscent of James S  Albus s Peoples  Capitalism                         in that money creation and securities ownership are widely and directly distributed to individuals rather than flowing through  or being concentrated in  centralized or elite mechanisms 

Broadening the ownership of technological assets edit 
Several solutions have been proposed which do not fall easily into the traditional left right political spectrum  This includes broadening the ownership of robots and other productive capital assets  Enlarging the ownership of technologies has been advocated by people including James S  Albus                          John Lanchester               Richard B  Freeman               and Noah Smith              
Jaron Lanier has proposed a somewhat similar solution  a mechanism where ordinary people receive  nano payments  for the big data they generate by their regular surfing and other aspects of their online presence              

Structural changes towards a post scarcity economy edit 
Main article  Post work society
See also  Post scarcity economy
The Zeitgeist Movement  TZM   The Venus Project  TVP  as well as various individuals and organizations propose structural changes towards a form of a post scarcity economy in which people are  freed  from their automatable  monotonous jobs  instead of  losing  their jobs  In the system proposed by TZM all jobs are either automated  abolished for bringing no true value for society  such as ordinary advertising   rationalized by more efficient  sustainable and open processes and collaboration or carried out based on altruism and social relevance  opposed to compulsion or monetary gain                                                                   The movement also speculates that the free time made available to people will permit a renaissance of creativity  invention  community and social capital as well as reducing stress              

Other approaches edit 
The threat of technological unemployment has occasionally been used by free market economists as a justification for supply side reforms  to make it easier for employers to hire and fire workers  Conversely  it has also been used as a reason to justify an increase in employee protection                           
Economists including Larry Summers have advised a package of measures may be needed  He advised vigorous cooperative efforts to address the  myriad devices    such as tax havens  bank secrecy  money laundering  and regulatory arbitrage   which enable the holders of great wealth to avoid paying taxes  and to make it more difficult to accumulate great fortunes without requiring  great social contributions  in return  Summers suggested more vigorous enforcement of anti monopoly laws  reductions in  excessive  protection for intellectual property  greater encouragement of profit sharing schemes that may benefit workers and give them a stake in wealth accumulation  strengthening of collective bargaining arrangements  improvements in corporate governance  strengthening of financial regulation to eliminate subsidies to financial activity  easing of land use restrictions that may cause estates to keep rising in value  better training for young people and retraining for displaced workers  and increased public and private investment in infrastructure development  such as energy production and transportation                                                  
Michael Spence has advised that responding to the future impact of technology will require a detailed understanding of the global forces and flows technology has set in motion  Adapting to them  will require shifts in mindsets  policies  investments  especially in human capital   and quite possibly models of employment and distribution       note

Notes edit 


  Smith did not directly address the problem of technological unemployment  but the Dean had  saying in      that in the long term  the introduction of machinery would allow more employment than would have been possible without them 

  Typically the introduction of machinery would both increase output and lower cost per unit 

  In the     s  this study was 
Unemployment and technological change Report no  G           by Corrington Calhoun Gill of the  National Research Project on Reemployment Opportunities and Recent changes in Industrial Techniques   Some earlier Federal reports took a pessimistic view of technological unemployment  e g  Memorandum on Technological Unemployment        by Ewan Clague Bureau of Labor Statistics  Some authorities   e g  Udo Sautter in Chpt   of Three Cheers for the Unemployed  Government and Unemployment Before the New Deal  Cambridge University Press          say that in the early     s there was near consensus among US experts that technological unemployment was a major problem  Other s though like Bruce Bartlett in Is Industrial Innovation Destroying Jobs  Cato Journal       argue that most economists remained optimistic even during the     s  In the     s episode  the major Federal study that bookmarked the end of the period of intense debate was Technology and the American economy        by the  National Commission on Technology  Automation  and Economic Progress  established by president Lyndon Johnson in      Archived   March      at the Wayback Machine

  Other recent statements by Summers include warnings on the  devastating consequences  for those who perform routine tasks arising from robots    D printing  artificial intelligence  and similar technologies  In his view   already there are more American men on disability insurance than doing production work in manufacturing  And the trends are all in the wrong direction  particularly for the less skilled  as the capacity of capital embodying artificial intelligence to replace white collar as well as blue collar work will increase rapidly in the years ahead   Summers has also said that   T here are many reasons to think the software revolution will be even more profound than the agricultural revolution  This time around  change will come faster and affect a much larger share of the economy         T here are more sectors losing jobs than creating jobs  And the general purpose aspect of software technology means that even the industries and jobs that it creates are not forever        If current trends continue  it could well be that a generation from now a quarter of middle aged men will be out of work at any given moment  

  Labour displacing technologies can be classified under the headings of mechanization  automation  and process improvement  The first two fundamentally involve transferring tasks from humans to machines  The third often involves the elimination of tasks altogether  The common theme of all three is that tasks are removed from the workforce  decreasing employment  In practice  the categories often overlap  a process improvement can include an automating or mechanizing achievement  The line between mechanization and automation is also subjective  as sometimes mechanization can involve sufficient control to be viewed as part of automation 

  Spence also wrote that  Now comes a     powerful  wave of digital technology that is replacing labor in increasingly complex tasks  This process of labor substitution and disintermediation has been underway for some time in service sectors   think of ATMs  online banking  enterprise resource planning  customer relationship management  mobile payment systems  and much more  This revolution is spreading to the production of goods  where robots and  D printing are displacing labor   In his view  the vast majority of the cost of digital technologies comes at the start  in the design of hardware  e g  sensors  and  more important  in creating the software that enables machines to carry out various tasks   Once this is achieved  the marginal cost of the hardware is relatively low  and declines as scale rises   and the marginal cost of replicating the software is essentially zero  With a huge potential global market to amortize the upfront fixed costs of design and testing  the incentives to invest  in digital technologies  are compelling   Spence believes that  unlike prior digital technologies  which drove firms to deploy underutilized pools of valuable labor around the world  the motivating force in the current wave of digital technologies  is cost reduction via the replacement of labor   For example  as the cost of  D printing technology declines  it is  easy to imagine  that production may become  extremely  local and customized  Moreover  production may occur in response to actual demand  not anticipated or forecast demand   Meanwhile  the impact of robotics     is not confined to production  Though self driving cars and drones are the most attention getting examples  the impact on logistics is no less transformative  Computers and robotic cranes that schedule and move containers around and load ships now control the Port of Singapore  one of the most efficient in the world   Spence believes that labor  no matter how inexpensive  will become a less important asset for growth and employment expansion  with labor intensive  process oriented manufacturing becoming less effective  and that re localization will appear globally  In his view  production will not disappear  but it will be less labor intensive  and all countries will eventually need to rebuild their growth models around digital technologies and the human capital supporting their deployment and expansion

  The Global Trap defines a possible        society  that may emerge in the   st century  In this potential society      of the working age population will be enough to keep the world economy going  The authors describe how at a conference at the invitation of Mikhail Gorbachev with     leading politicians  business leaders and academics from all continents from    September     October      at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco  the term  one fifth society  arose  The authors describe an increase in productivity caused by the decrease in the amount of work  so this could be done by one fifth of the global labor force and leave four fifths of the working age people out of work

  On the other hand  from a more positive perspective  some have argued that technological change will alter the structure of an organization in the sense that those in management roles will increasingly become more specialized to those roles as technology that assists collaboration and workflow management allows employees to manage themselves  The typical management role will  as a result  change to allow managers to concentrate on the task of supporting employees and improving their performance thus allowing them to add more  rather than less  value
