Branch of logic
Not to be confused with Propositional analysis or predicate calculus 

The propositional calculus     a      is a branch of logic             It is also called propositional logic             statement logic             sentential calculus             sentential logic                        or sometimes zeroth order logic      b                                       Sometimes  it is called first order propositional logic            to contrast it with System F  but it should not be confused with first order logic  It deals with propositions             which can be true or false              and relations between propositions              including the construction of arguments based on them              Compound propositions are formed by connecting propositions by logical connectives representing the truth functions of conjunction  disjunction  implication  biconditional  and negation                                                  Some sources include other connectives  as in the table below 
Unlike first order logic  propositional logic does not deal with non logical objects  predicates about them  or quantifiers  However  all the machinery of propositional logic is included in first order logic and higher order logics  In this sense  propositional logic is the foundation of first order logic and higher order logic 
Propositional logic is typically studied with a formal language      c      in which propositions are represented by letters  which are called propositional variables  These are then used  together with symbols for connectives  to make propositional formula  Because of this  the propositional variables are called atomic formulas of a formal propositional language                         While the atomic propositions are typically represented by letters of the alphabet      d                  there is a variety of notations to represent the logical connectives  The following table shows the main notational variants for each of the connectives in propositional logic

The most thoroughly researched branch of propositional logic is classical truth functional propositional logic             in which formulas are interpreted as having precisely one of two possible truth values  the truth value of true or the truth value of false              The principle of bivalence and the law of excluded middle are upheld  By comparison with first order logic  truth functional propositional logic is considered to be zeroth order logic                       


History edit 
Main article  History of logic
Although propositional logic  also called propositional calculus  had been hinted by earlier philosophers  it was developed into a formal logic  Stoic logic  by Chrysippus in the  rd century BC             and expanded by his successor Stoics  The logic was focused on propositions  This was different from the traditional syllogistic logic  which focused on terms  However  most of the original writings were lost             and  at some time between the  rd and  th century CE  Stoic logic faded into oblivion  to be resurrected only in the   th century  in the wake of the  re  discovery of propositional logic             
Symbolic logic  which would come to be important to refine propositional logic  was first developed by the   th   th century mathematician Gottfried Leibniz  whose calculus ratiocinator was  however  unknown to the larger logical community  Consequently  many of the advances achieved by Leibniz were recreated by logicians like George Boole and Augustus De Morgan  completely independent of Leibniz             
Gottlob Frege s predicate logic builds upon propositional logic  and has been described as combining  the distinctive features of syllogistic logic and propositional logic               Consequently  predicate logic ushered in a new era in logic s history  however  advances in propositional logic were still made after Frege  including natural deduction  truth trees and truth tables  Natural deduction was invented by Gerhard Gentzen and Stanis aw Ja kowski  Truth trees were invented by Evert Willem Beth              The invention of truth tables  however  is of uncertain attribution 
Within works by Frege             and Bertrand Russell              are ideas influential to the invention of truth tables  The actual tabular structure  being formatted as a table   itself  is generally credited to either Ludwig Wittgenstein or Emil Post  or both  independently               Besides Frege and Russell  others credited with having ideas preceding truth tables include Philo  Boole  Charles Sanders Peirce              and Ernst Schr der  Others credited with the tabular structure include Jan  ukasiewicz  Alfred North Whitehead  William Stanley Jevons  John Venn  and Clarence Irving Lewis              Ultimately  some have concluded  like John Shosky  that  It is far from clear that any one person should be given the title of  inventor  of truth tables              

Sentences edit 
Main article  Proposition
Propositional logic  as currently studied in universities  is a specification of a standard of logical consequence in which only the meanings of propositional connectives are considered in evaluating the conditions for the truth of a sentence  or whether a sentence logically follows from some other sentence or group of sentences            

Declarative sentences edit 
Propositional logic deals with statements  which are defined as declarative sentences having truth value                         Examples of statements might include 

Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit 
London is the capital of England 
All Wikipedia editors speak at least three languages 
Declarative sentences are contrasted with questions  such as  What is Wikipedia    and imperative statements  such as  Please add citations to support the claims in this article                            Such non declarative sentences have no truth value              and are only dealt with in nonclassical logics  called erotetic and imperative logics 

Compounding sentences with connectives edit 
See also  Atomic formula and Atomic sentence
In propositional logic  a statement can contain one or more other statements as parts             Compound sentences are formed from simpler sentences and express relationships among the constituent sentences              This is done by combining them with logical connectives                          the main types of compound sentences are negations  conjunctions  disjunctions  implications  and biconditionals              which are formed by using the corresponding connectives to connect propositions                          In English  these connectives are expressed by the words  and   conjunction    or   disjunction    not   negation    if   material conditional   and  if and only if   biconditional                          Examples of such compound sentences might include 

Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit  and millions already have   conjunction 
It is not true that all Wikipedia editors speak at least three languages   negation 
Either London is the capital of England  or London is the capital of the United Kingdom  or both   disjunction      f     
If sentences lack any logical connectives  they are called simple sentences             or atomic sentences              if they contain one or more logical connectives  they are called compound sentences              or molecular sentences             
Sentential connectives are a broader category that includes logical connectives                         Sentential connectives are any linguistic particles that bind sentences to create a new compound sentence                         or that inflect a single sentence to create a new sentence             A logical connective  or propositional connective  is a kind of sentential connective with the characteristic feature that  when the original sentences it operates on are  or express  propositions  the new sentence that results from its application also is  or expresses  a proposition             Philosophers disagree about what exactly a proposition is                         as well as about which sentential connectives in natural languages should be counted as logical connectives                         Sentential connectives are also called sentence functors              and logical connectives are also called truth functors             

Arguments edit 
Main article  Argument
An argument is defined as a pair of things  namely a set of sentences  called the premises      g      and a sentence  called the conclusion                                      The conclusion is claimed to follow from the premises              and the premises are claimed to support the conclusion             

Example argument edit 
The following is an example of an argument within the scope of propositional logic 

Premise    If it s raining  then it s cloudy 
Premise    It s raining 
Conclusion  It s cloudy 
The logical form of this argument is known as modus ponens              which is a classically valid form              So  in classical logic  the argument is valid  although it may or may not be sound  depending on the meteorological facts in a given context  This example argument will be reused when explaining        Formalization 

Validity and soundness edit 
Main articles  Validity  logic  and Soundness
An argument is valid if  and only if  it is necessary that  if all its premises are true  its conclusion is true                                      Alternatively  an argument is valid if  and only if  it is impossible for all the premises to be true while the conclusion is false                         
Validity is contrasted with soundness              An argument is sound if  and only if  it is valid and all its premises are true                          Otherwise  it is unsound             
Logic  in general  aims to precisely specify valid arguments              This is done by defining a valid argument as one in which its conclusion is a logical consequence of its premises              which  when this is understood as semantic consequence  means that there is no case in which the premises are true but the conclusion is not true               see        Semantics below 

Formalization edit 
Propositional logic is typically studied through a formal system in which formulas of a formal language are interpreted to represent propositions  This formal language is the basis for proof systems  which allow a conclusion to be derived from premises if  and only if  it is a logical consequence of them  This section will show how this works by formalizing the        Example argument  The formal language for a propositional calculus will be fully specified in        Language  and an overview of proof systems will be given in        Proof systems 

Propositional variables edit 
Main article  Propositional variable
Since propositional logic is not concerned with the structure of propositions beyond the point where they cannot be decomposed any more by logical connectives                         it is typically studied by replacing such atomic  indivisible  statements with letters of the alphabet  which are interpreted as variables representing statements  propositional variables              With propositional variables  the        Example argument would then be symbolized as follows 

Premise    
  
    
      
        P
          x     
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle P to Q 
  

Premise    
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  

Conclusion  
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle Q 
  

When P is interpreted as  It s raining  and Q as  it s cloudy  these symbolic expressions correspond exactly with the original expression in natural language  Not only that  but they will also correspond with any other inference with the same logical form 
When a formal system is used to represent formal logic  only statement letters  usually capital roman letters such as 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
  
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle Q 
  
 and 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
      displaystyle R 
  
  are represented directly  The natural language propositions that arise when they re interpreted are outside the scope of the system  and the relation between the formal system and its interpretation is likewise outside the formal system itself 

Gentzen notation edit 
If we assume that the validity of modus ponens has been accepted as an axiom  then the same        Example argument can also be depicted like this 


  
    
      
        
          
            
              P
                x     
              Q
               
              P
            
            Q
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle   frac  P to Q P  Q   
  

This method of displaying it is Gentzen s notation for natural deduction and sequent calculus              The premises are shown above a line  called the inference line              separated by a comma  which indicates combination of premises              The conclusion is written below the inference line              The inference line represents syntactic consequence              sometimes called deductive consequence              gt  which is also symbolized with                            So the above can also be written in one line as 
  
    
      
        P
          x     
        Q
         
        P
          x  a  
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle P to Q P vdash Q 
  
      h     
Syntactic consequence is contrasted with semantic consequence              which is symbolized with                            In this case  the conclusion follows syntactically because the natural deduction inference rule of modus ponens has been assumed  For more on inference rules  see the sections on proof systems below

What was given as Definition   above  which is responsible for the composition of formulas  is referred to by Colin Howson as the principle of composition                  j      It is this recursion in the definition of a language s syntax which justifies the use of the word  atomic  to refer to propositional variables  since all formulas in the language

      displaystyle   mathcal  L   
  
 are built up from the atoms as ultimate building blocks             Composite formulas  all formulas besides atoms  are called molecules              or molecular sentences               This is an imperfect analogy with chemistry  since a chemical molecule may sometimes have only one atom  as in monatomic gases              
The definition that  nothing else is a formula   given above as Definition    excludes any formula from the language which is not specifically required by the other definitions in the syntax              In particular  it excludes infinitely long formulas from being well formed              It is sometimes called the Closure Clause             

CF grammar in BNF edit 
An alternative to the syntax definitions given above is to write a context free  CF  grammar for the language

Constants and schemata edit 
Mathematicians sometimes distinguish between propositional constants  propositional variables  and schemata  Propositional constants represent some particular proposition              while propositional variables range over the set of all atomic propositions              Schemata  or schematic letters  however  range over all formulas                          Schematic letters are also called metavariables               It is common to represent propositional constants by A  B  and C  propositional variables by P  Q  and R  and schematic letters are often Greek letters  most often       and                          
However  some authors recognize only two  propositional constants  in their formal system  the special symbol 
  
    
      
          x  a  
      
    
      displaystyle  top  
  
  called  truth   which always evaluates to True  and the special symbol 
  
    
      
          x  a  
      
    
      displaystyle  bot  
  
  called  falsity   which always evaluates to False                                      Other authors also include these symbols  with the same meaning  but consider them to be  zero place truth functors               or equivalently   nullary connectives              

Semantics edit 
Main articles  Semantics of logic and Model theory
To serve as a model of the logic of a given natural language  a formal language must be semantically interpreted              In classical logic  all propositions evaluate to exactly one of two truth values  True or False                         For example   Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit  evaluates to True              while  Wikipedia is a paper encyclopedia  evaluates to False             
In other respects  the following formal semantics can apply to the language of any propositional logic  but the assumptions that there are only two semantic values  bivalence   that only one of the two is assigned to each formula in the language  noncontradiction   and that every formula gets assigned a value  excluded middle   are distinctive features of classical logic                                      To learn about nonclassical logics with more than two truth values  and their unique semantics  one may consult the articles on  Many valued logic    Three valued logic    Finite valued logic   and  Infinite valued logic

              For a formal language of classical logic  a case is defined as an assignment  to each formula of 
  
    
      
        
          
            L

  of one or the other  but not both  of the truth values  namely truth  T  or    and falsity  F  or                             An interpretation that follows the rules of classical logic is sometimes called a Boolean valuation                          An interpretation of a formal language for classical logic is often expressed in terms of truth tables                         Since each formula is only assigned a single truth value  an interpretation may be viewed as a function  whose domain is

Propositional connective semantics edit 
Main articles  Logical connective and Truth functionAn interpretation assigns semantic values to atomic formulas directly                          Molecular formulas are assigned a function of the value of their constituent atoms  according to the connective used                          the connectives are defined in such a way that the truth value of a sentence formed from atoms with connectives depends on the truth values of the atoms that they re applied to  and only on those                          This assumption is referred to by Colin Howson as the assumption of the truth functionality of the connectives

Since logical connectives are defined semantically only in terms of the truth values that they take when the propositional variables that they re applied to take either of the two possible truth values                         the semantic definition of the connectives is usually represented as a truth table for each of the connectives                                     as seen below

Connective definition methods edit 
Some of these connectives may be defined in terms of others  for instance  implication  p   q  may be defined in terms of disjunction and negation  as  p   q              and disjunction may be defined in terms of negation and conjunction  as    p    q               In fact  a truth functionally complete system      l      in the sense that all and only the classical propositional tautologies are theorems  may be derived using only disjunction and negation  as Russell  Whitehead  and Hilbert did   or using only implication and negation  as Frege did   or using only conjunction and negation  or even using only a single connective for  not and   the Sheffer stroke              as Jean Nicod did             A joint denial connective  logical NOR  will also suffice  by itself  to define all other connectives  Besides NOR and NAND  no other connectives have this property                  m     
Some authors  namely Howson             and Cunningham              distinguish equivalence from the biconditional   As to equivalence  Howson calls it  truth functional equivalence   while Cunningham calls it  logical equivalence    Equivalence is symbolized with   and is a metalanguage symbol  while a biconditional is symbolized with   and is a logical connective in the object language 
  
    
      
        
          
            L
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle   mathcal  L   
  
  Regardless  an equivalence or biconditional is true if  and only if  the formulas connected by it are assigned the same semantic value under every interpretation  Other authors often do not make this distinction  and may use the word  equivalence               and or the symbol                to denote their object language s biconditional connective

For classical logic  which assumes that all cases are complete and consistent              the following theorems apply 

For any given interpretation  a given formula is either true or false under it                         
No formula is both true and false under the same interpretation

Proof systems edit 
See also  Proof theory and Proof calculus
Proof systems in propositional logic can be broadly classified into semantic proof systems and syntactic proof systems                                      according to the kind of logical consequence that they rely on  semantic proof systems rely on semantic consequence

          x  a  
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle  varphi  models  psi  
  
               whereas syntactic proof systems rely on syntactic consequence

          x  a  
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle  varphi  vdash  psi  
  
               Semantic consequence deals with the truth values of propositions in all possible interpretations  whereas syntactic consequence concerns the derivation of conclusions from premises based on rules and axioms within a formal system              This section gives a very brief overview of the kinds of proof systems  with anchors to the relevant sections of this article on each one  as well as to the separate Wikipedia articles on each one

Example of a truth table
A graphical representation of a partially built propositional tableau
Semantic proof systems rely on the concept of semantic consequence  symbolized as 
  
    
      
          x c  
          x  a  
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle  varphi  models  psi  
  
  which indicates that if 
  
    
      
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle  varphi  
  
 is true  then 
  
    
      
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle  psi  
  
 must also be true in every possible interpretation             

Truth tables edit 
Main article  Truth table
A truth table is a semantic proof method used to determine the truth value of a propositional logic expression in every possible scenario              By exhaustively listing the truth values of its constituent atoms  a truth table can show whether a proposition is true  false  tautological  or contradictory              See        Semantic proof via truth tables 

Semantic tableaux edit 
Main article  Method of analytic tableaux
A semantic tableau is another semantic proof technique that systematically explores the truth of a proposition              It constructs a tree where each branch represents a possible interpretation of the propositions involved              If every branch leads to a contradiction  the original proposition is considered to be a contradiction  and its negation is considered a tautology              See        Semantic proof via tableaux 

Syntactic proof systems edit 
Rules for the propositional sequent calculus LK  in Gentzen notation
Syntactic proof systems  in contrast  focus on the formal manipulation of symbols according to specific rules  The notion of syntactic consequence  
  
    
      
          x c  
          x  a  
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle  varphi  vdash  psi  
  
  signifies that 
  
    
      
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle  psi  
  
 can be derived from 
  
    
      
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle  varphi  
  
 using the rules of the formal system             

Axiomatic systems edit 
Main article  Axiomatic system  logic 
An axiomatic system is a set of axioms or assumptions from which other statements  theorems  are logically derived              In propositional logic  axiomatic systems define a base set of propositions considered to be self evidently true  and theorems are proved by applying deduction rules to these axioms              See        Syntactic proof via axioms 

Natural deduction edit 
Main article  Natural deduction
Natural deduction is a syntactic method of proof that emphasizes the derivation of conclusions from premises through the use of intuitive rules reflecting ordinary reasoning               Each rule reflects a particular logical connective and shows how it can be introduced or eliminated               See        Syntactic proof via natural deduction 

Sequent calculus edit 
Main article  Sequent calculus
The sequent calculus is a formal system that represents logical deductions as sequences or  sequents  of formulas               Developed by Gerhard Gentzen  this approach focuses on the structural properties of logical deductions and provides a powerful framework for proving statements within propositional logic                           

Semantic proof via truth tables edit 
See also  Truth table
Taking advantage of the semantic concept of validity  truth in every interpretation   it is possible to prove a formula s validity by using a truth table  which gives every possible interpretation  assignment of truth values to variables  of a formula                                      If  and only if  all the lines of a truth table come out true  the formula is semantically valid  true in every interpretation                           Further  if  and only if  
  
    
      
          xac 
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle  neg  varphi  
  
 is valid  then 
  
    
      
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle  varphi  
  
 is inconsistent

Semantic proof via tableaux edit 
Main article  Method of analytic tableaux
Since truth tables have  n lines for n variables  they can be tiresomely long for large values of n              Analytic tableaux are a more efficient  but nevertheless mechanical              semantic proof method  they take advantage of the fact that  we learn nothing about the validity of the inference from examining the truth value distributions which make either the premises false or the conclusion true  the only relevant distributions when considering deductive validity are clearly just those which make the premises true or the conclusion false              
Analytic tableaux for propositional logic are fully specified by the rules that are stated in schematic form below              These rules use  signed formulas   where a signed formula is an expression 
  
    
      
        T
        X
      
    
      displaystyle TX 
  
 or 
  
    
      
        F
        X
      
    
      displaystyle FX 
  
  where 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
      displaystyle X 
  
 is a  unsigned  formula of the language 
  
    
      
        
          
            L

      displaystyle TX 
  
 is read  
  
    
      
        X
      
    
      displaystyle X 
  
 is true   and

 is read  
  
    
      
        X
      
    
      displaystyle X 
  
 is false                 Their formal semantic definition is that  under any interpretation  a signed formula 
  
    
      
        T
        X
      
    
      displaystyle TX 
  
 is called true if 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
      displaystyle X 
  
 is true  and false if 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
      displaystyle X 
  
 is false  whereas a signed formula

  The notation is to be understood analogously for rules   and                Often  in tableaux for classical logic  the signed formula notation is simplified so that 
  
    
      
        T
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle T varphi  
  
 is written simply as 
  
    
      
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle  varphi  
  
  and 
  
    
      
        F
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle F varphi  
  
 as 
  
    
      
          xac 
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle  neg  varphi  
  
  which accounts for naming rule   the  Rule of Double Negation                          
One constructs a tableau for a set of formulas by applying the rules to produce more lines and tree branches until every line has been used  producing a complete tableau  In some cases  a branch can come to contain both 
  
    
      
        T
        X
      
    
      displaystyle TX

        F
        X
      
    
      displaystyle FX 
  
 for some 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
      displaystyle X 
  
  which is to say  a contradiction  In that case  the branch is said to close              If every branch in a tree closes  the tree itself is said to close              In virtue of the rules for construction of tableaux  a closed tree is a proof that the original formula  or set of formulas  used to construct it was itself self contradictory  and therefore false              Conversely  a tableau can also prove that a logical formula is tautologous  if a formula is tautologous  its negation is a contradiction  so a tableau built from its negation will close

vteNatural deduction  since it is a method of syntactical proof  is specified by providing inference rules  also called rules of proof              for a language with the typical set of connectives

  no axioms are used other than these rules               The rules are covered below  and a proof example is given afterwards 
Notation styles edit 
Different authors vary to some extent regarding which inference rules they give  which will be noted  More striking to the look and feel of a proof  however  is the variation in notation styles  The        Gentzen notation  which was covered earlier for a short argument  can actually be stacked to produce large tree shaped natural deduction proofs                         not to be confused with  truth trees   which is another name for analytic tableaux              There is also a style due to Stanis aw Ja kowski  where the formulas in the proof are written inside various nested boxes              and there is a simplification of Ja kowski s style due to Fredric Fitch  Fitch notation   where the boxes are simplified to simple horizontal lines beneath the introductions of suppositions  and vertical lines to the left of the lines that are under the supposition              Lastly  there is the only notation style which will actually be used in this article  which is due to Patrick Suppes              but was much popularized by E J  Lemmon and Benson Mates               This method has the advantage that  graphically  it is the least intensive to produce and display  which made it a natural choice for the editor who wrote this part of the article  who did not understand the complex LaTeX commands that would be required to produce proofs in the other methods 
A proof  then  laid out in accordance with the Suppes Lemmon notation style              is a sequence of lines containing sentences              where each sentence is either an assumption  or the result of applying a rule of proof to earlier sentences in the sequence              Each line of proof is made up of a sentence of proof  together with its annotation  its assumption set  and the current line number              The assumption set lists the assumptions on which the given sentence of proof depends  which are referenced by the line numbers              The annotation specifies which rule of proof was applied  and to which earlier lines  to yield the current sentence              See the        Natural deduction proof example 

Inference rules edit 
Natural deduction inference rules  due ultimately to Gentzen  are given below               There are ten primitive rules of proof  which are the rule assumption  plus four pairs of introduction and elimination rules for the binary connectives  and the rule reductio ad adbsurdum              Disjunctive Syllogism can be used as an easier alternative to the proper   elimination              and MTT and DN are commonly given rules               although they are not primitive

Syntactic proof via axioms edit 
Main article  Hilbert system
It is possible to perform proofs axiomatically  which means that certain tautologies are taken as self evident and various others are deduced from them using modus ponens as an inference rule  as well as a rule of substitution  which permits replacing any well formed formula with any substitution instance of it               Alternatively  one uses axiom schemas instead of axioms  and no rule of substitution is used              
This section gives the axioms of some historically notable axiomatic systems for propositional logic  For more examples  as well as metalogical theorems that are specific to such axiomatic systems  such as their completeness and consistency   see the article Axiomatic system  logic  

Frege s Begriffsschrift edit 
Although axiomatic proof has been used since the famous Ancient Greek textbook  Euclid s Elements of Geometry  in propositional logic it dates back to Gottlob Frege s      Begriffsschrift                           Frege s system used only implication and negation as connectives             It had six axioms

        a
         
         
          x     
         
         
        c
          x     
        b
         
          x     
         
        c
          x     
        a
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle  c to  b to a   to   c to b  to  c to a

        a
          x     
          xac

Proposition     
  
    
      
        a
          x     
          xac 
          xac 
        a
      
    
      displaystyle a to  neg  neg a 
  

These were used by Frege together with modus ponens and a rule of substitution  which was used but never precisely stated  to yield a complete and consistent axiomatization of classical truth functional propositional logic              

 ukasiewicz s P  edit 
Jan  ukasiewicz showed that  in Frege s system   the third axiom is superfluous since it can be derived from the preceding two axioms  and that the last three axioms can be replaced by the single sentence 
  
    
      
        C
        C
        N
        p
        N
        q
        C
        p
        q
      
    
      displaystyle CCNpNqCpq 
  
                Which  taken out of  ukasiewicz s Polish notation into modern notation  means 
  
    
      
         
          xac 
        p
          x     
          xac 
        q
         
          x     
         
        p
          x     
        q
         
      
    
      displaystyle   neg p rightarrow  neg q  rightarrow  p rightarrow q  
  
  Hence   ukasiewicz is credited              with this system of three axioms 


  
    
      
        p
          x     
         
        q
          x     
        p
         
      
    
      displaystyle p to  q to p  
  


  
    
      
         
        p
          x     
         
        q
          x     
        r
         
         
          x     
         
         
        p
          x     
        q
         
          x     
         
        p
          x     
        r
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle  p to  q to r   to   p to q  to  p to r   
  


  
    
      
         
          xac 
        p
          x     
          xac 
        q
         
          x     
         
        q
          x     
        p
         
      
    
      displaystyle   neg p to  neg q  to  q to p  
  

Just like Frege s system  this system uses a substitution rule and uses modus ponens as an inference rule               The exact same system was given  with an explicit substitution rule  by Alonzo Church               who referred to it as the system P                            and helped popularize it              

Schematic form of P  edit 
One may avoid using the rule of substitution by giving the axioms in schematic form  using them to generate an infinite set of axioms  Hence  using Greek letters to represent schemata  metalogical variables that may stand for any well formed formulas   the axioms are given as

      displaystyle   neg  varphi  to  neg  psi   to   psi  to  varphi   
  

The schematic version of P  is attributed to John von Neumann               and is used in the Metamath  set mm  formal proof database               It has also been attributed to Hilbert               and named

As an example  a proof of 
  
    
      
        A
          x     
        A
      
    
      displaystyle A to A 
  
 in P  is given below  First  the axioms are given names

          x

        q
          x     
        r
         
         
          x     
         
         
        p
          x     
        q
         
          x     
         
        p
          x     
        r
         
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle   p to  q to r   to   p to q  to  p to r

One notable difference between propositional calculus and predicate calculus is that satisfiability of a propositional formula is decidable                                    Deciding satisfiability of propositional logic formulas is an NP complete problem  However  practical methods exist  e g   DPLL algorithm        Chaff algorithm        that are very fast for many useful cases  Recent work has extended the SAT solver algorithms to work with propositions containing arithmetic expressions  these are the SMT solvers

Notes edit 


  Many sources write this with a definite article  as the propositional calculus  while others just call it propositional calculus with no article 

  Zeroth order logic is sometimes used to denote a quantifier free predicate logic  That is  propositional logic extended with functions  relations  and constants            

  For propositional logic  the formal language used is a propositional language 

  Not to be confused with the formal language s alphabet 

  See all possible connectives on truth functional propositional logic with some of their properties 

  The  or both  makes it clear             that it s a logical disjunction  not an exclusive or  which is more common in English 

  The set of premises may be the empty set                          an argument from an empty set of premises is valid if  and only if  the conclusion is a tautology                         

  The turnstile  for syntactic consequence  is of lower precedence than the comma  which represents premise combination  which in turn is of lower precedence than the arrow  used for material implication  so no parentheses are needed to interpret this formula             

  A very general and abstract syntax is given here  following the notation in the SEP             but including the third definition  which is very commonly given explicitly by other sources  such as Gillon              Bostock              Allen  amp  Hand              and many others  As noted elsewhere in the article  languages variously compose their set of atomic propositional variables from uppercase or lowercase letters  often focusing on P p  Q q  and R r   with or without subscript numerals  and in their set of connectives  they may include either the full set of five typical connectives  
  
    
      
         
          xac 
         
          x     
         
          x     
         
          x     
         
          x     
         
      
    
      displaystyle    neg   land   lor   to   leftrightarrow    
  
  or any of the truth functionally complete subsets of it   And  of course  they may also use any of the notational variants of these connectives  

  Note that the phrase  principle of composition  has referred to other things in other contexts  and even in the context of logic  since Bertrand Russell used it to refer to the principle that  a proposition which implies each of two propositions implies them both              

  The name  interpretation  is used by some authors and the name  case  by other authors  This article will be indifferent and use either  since it is collaboratively edited and there is no consensus about which terminology to adopt 

  A truth functionally complete set of connectives            is also called simply functionally complete  or adequate for truth functional logic              or expressively adequate              or simply adequate                         

  See a table of all    bivalent truth functions 

  Some of these definitions use the word  interpretation   and speak of sentences formulas being true or false  under  it  and some will use the word  case   and speak of sentences formulas being true or false  in  it  Published reliable sources  WP RS  have used both kinds of terminological convention  although usually a given author will use only one of them  Since this article is collaboratively edited and there is no consensus about which convention to use  these variations in terminology have been left standing 

  Conventionally 
  
    
      
          x  a  
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle  models  varphi  
  
  with nothing to the left of the turnstile  is used to symbolize a tautology  It may be interpreted as saying that 
  
    
      
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle  varphi  
  
 is a semantic consequence of the empty set of formulae  i e   
  
    
      
         
         
          x  a  
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle      models  varphi  
  
  but with the empty brackets omitted for simplicity              which is just the same as to say that it is a tautology  i e   that there is no interpretation under which it is false             

  To simplify the statement of the rule  the word  denial  here is used in this way  the denial of a formula 
  
    
      
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle  varphi  
  
 that is not a negation is 
  
    
      
          x     
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle   varphi  
  
  whereas a negation  
  
    
      
          x     
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle   varphi  
  
  has two denials  viz   
  
    
      
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle  varphi  
  
 and 
  
    
      
          x     
          x     
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle    varphi
