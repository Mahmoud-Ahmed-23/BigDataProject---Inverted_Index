							A new study published in Discover Food sheds light on the potential of cultivating non traditional oilseed crops chia  amaranth  and quinoa as a sustainable strategy to reduce Egypt s heavy reliance on imported edible oils and bolster national food security 
Conducted by a team of Egyptian researchers  the study examines the adaptability and productivity of these high nutrient crops across diverse agroclimatic regions  aiming to offer locally viable alternatives that could help close the country       s widening edible oil production gap 
Egypt currently meets only    of its domestic edible oil demand through local production  with the remaining     sourced from imports making the country highly vulnerable to global price volatility and supply chain disruptions  The study advocates for the strategic integration of adaptable oilseed crops into Egypt s agricultural landscape as part of a long term solution 
Field trials were carried out in four governorates Sharqeya  Giza  Minya  and Aswan chosen to represent a broad range of soil types and climatic conditions  Results indicate that Sharqeya provided the most favorable environment for plant development and seed yield across all three crops 
Chia  in particular  recorded a       increase in plant height and an       rise in seed yield in Sharqeya compared to other regions  Amaranth and quinoa also performed well  with yield improvements of       and        respectively  highlighting the region s suitability for cultivating these crops 
The study also analyzed the nutritional and oil content of the harvested seeds  Chia grown in Giza exhibited the highest fixed oil content at         while chia and quinoa from Sharqeya showed elevated levels of essential fatty acids enhancing their nutritional profiles and oil quality 
In terms of macronutrients  chia and quinoa cultivated in Minya recorded the highest carbohydrate and nitrogen content  suggesting strong potential for producing nutrient dense seeds in that region  Meanwhile  amaranth from Sharqeya had a significant carbohydrate content of        further reinforcing the region s promise for alternative crop production 
The findings present a compelling case for integrating chia  amaranth  and quinoa into Egypt s agricultural policy framework  These crops not only show strong agronomic performance and nutritional benefits but also align with broader goals for sustainable farming  climate resilience  and food sovereignty 
Researchers concluded that the successful cultivation of these crops could pave the way for increased domestic edible oil production  diversification of agricultural outputs  and a more secure and self sufficient food system 
However  they emphasize the need for continued research to refine cultivation practices  ensure long term sustainability  and develop market pathways  Effective implementation will require collaboration among agricultural institutions  policymakers  and local farmers to bring these findings from research to reality
