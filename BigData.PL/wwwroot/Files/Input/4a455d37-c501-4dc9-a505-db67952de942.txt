The AI boom                       is an ongoing period of rapid progress in the field of artificial intelligence  AI  that started in the late     s before gaining international prominence in late      with the public release of ChatGPT  Examples include large language models and generative AI applications developed by OpenAI as well as protein folding prediction led by Google DeepMind  This period is sometimes referred to as an AI spring  to contrast it with previous AI winters                       


History edit 
For broader coverage of this topic  see History of artificial intelligence 
The number of Google searches for the term  AI  accelerated in      
In       a University of Toronto research team used artificial neural networks and deep learning techniques to lower the error rate below     for the first time during the ImageNet challenge for object recognition in computer vision  The event catalyzed the AI boom later that decade  when many alumni of the ImageNet challenge became leaders in the tech industry                        In March       AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol in a five game match  marking the first time a computer Go program had beaten a   dan professional without handicap  This match led to significant increase in public interest in AI             The generative AI race began in earnest in      or      following the founding of OpenAI and earlier advances made in graphical processing units  GPUs   the amount and quality of training data  generative adversarial networks  diffusion models and transformer architectures                        
In       the Artificial Intelligence Index  an initiative from Stanford University  reported a global explosion of commercial and research efforts in AI  Europe published the largest number of papers in the field that year  followed by China and North America              Technologies such as AlphaFold led to more accurate predictions of protein folding and improved the process of drug development              Economists and lawmakers began to discuss the potential impact of AI more frequently                          By       large language models  LLMs  saw increased usage in chatbot applications  text to image models could generate images that appeared to be human made              and speech synthesis software was able to replicate human speech efficiently             
According to metrics from      to       the United States outranks the rest of the world in terms of venture capital funding  the number of startups  and patents granted in AI                          Scientists who have immigrated to the U S  play an outsized role in the country s development of AI technology                          Many of them were educated in China  prompting debates about national security concerns amid worsening relations between the two countries             
Experts have framed AI development as a competition for economic and geopolitical advantage between the United States and China              In       an analyst for the Council on Foreign Relations outlined ways that the U S  could maintain its position amid progress made by China                          In       an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies advocated for the U S  to use its dominance in AI technology to drive its foreign policy instead of relying on trade agreements

Biomedical edit 
The AlphaFold   score of more than    in CASP s global distance test  GDT  is considered a significant achievement in computational biology             and great progress towards a decades old grand challenge of biology              The structural biologist and Nobel Prize winner Venki Ramakrishnan called the result  a stunning advance on the protein folding problem               adding that  It has occurred decades before many people in the field would have predicted                          
The ability to predict protein structures accurately based on the constituent amino acid sequence is expected to accelerate drug discovery and enable a better understanding of diseases                                     

Images and videos edit 
An image generated by Stable Diffusion based on the text prompt  a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse 
Text to image models captured widespread public attention when OpenAI announced DALL E  a transformer system  in January                   A successor capable of generating complex and realistic images  DALL E    was unveiled in April                   An alternative text to image model  Midjourney  was released in July                   Another alternative  open source model Stable Diffusion  released in August                  
Following other text to image models  language model powered text to video platforms such as Runway              OpenAI s Sora  DAMO              Make A Video              Imagen Video             and Phenaki             can generate video from text as well as image prompts             

Language edit 
GPT   is a large language model that was released in      by OpenAI and is capable of generating high quality human like text              The tool has been credited with spurring and accelerating the AI boom following its release                                      An upgraded version called GPT     was used in ChatGPT  which later garnered attention for its detailed responses and articulate answers across many domains of knowledge              A new version called GPT   was released on March           and was used in the Microsoft Bing search engine                          Other language models have been released  such as PaLM and Gemini by Google             and LLaMA by Meta Platforms 
In January       DeepL Write  an AI based tool to improve monolingual texts  was released             

Music and voice edit 
In       Google DeepMind unveiled WaveNet  a deep learning network that produced English  Mandarin  and piano music              
   ai  a free text to speech web application launched in March       was an early development in the AI boom that used AI for voice synthesis  The platform could generate convincing character voices using as little as    seconds of training data               The application gained widespread attention in early      for its ability to synthesize emotionally expressive speech from popular fictional characters                          becoming particularly influential in online content creation                         
By April       full length original songs generated by a pseudonymous creator named  Glorb  using the voices of cartoon characters from the SpongeBob SquarePants cartoon were being listened to millions of times on Spotify and YouTube  Glorb is not affiliated with the copyright holder or the original voice performers                         
ElevenLabs allowed users to upload voice samples and create audio that sounds similar to the samples  The company was criticized             after controversial                         statements were generated based on the vocal styles of celebrities  public officials  and other famous individuals              raising concerns     among whom       that the technology could make deepfakes even more convincing              An unofficial song created using the voices of musicians Drake and The Weeknd raised questions     among whom       about the ethics and legality of similar software             

Impact edit 
Energy edit 
Electricity consumed by hardware used for AI has increased demands on power grids  which has led to prolonged use of fossil fuel power plants which would otherwise have been deactivated                                     
Microsoft  Google  and Amazon have all invested in existing or proposed nuclear power plants to meet these demands                          In September       Microsoft signed a deal with Constellation Energy to purchase power from a reactor at Three Mile Island which had been shut down in       The reactor is set to reopen in      to provide power to Microsoft s data centers  The reactor is next to the unit which caused the worst nuclear power accident in US history in                                          

Cultural edit 
During the AI boom  different groups emerged  ranging from the ones that want to  accelerate AI development as quickly as possible to those that are more concerned about AI safety and would like to  decelerate              

Business and economy edit 
In       AI patents in China and the US numbered more than three fourths of AI patents worldwide              Though China had more AI patents  the US had     more patents per AI patent applicant company than China             
Some economists have been optimistic about the potential of the current wave of AI to boost productivity and economic growth   Notably  Stanford University economist Erik Brynjolfsson  in a series of articles has argued for an  AI powered Productivity Boom               and a  Coming Productivity Boom               At the same time  others like Northwestern University economist Robert Gordon remain more pessimistic              Brynjolfsson and Gordon have made a formal bet  registered at long bets  about the rate of productivity growth in the     s  to be resolved at the end of the decade             
Big Tech companies view the AI boom as both opportunity and threat  Alphabet s Google  for example  realized that ChatGPT could be an innovator s dilemma like replacement for Google Search  The company merged DeepMind and Google Brain  a rival internal unit  to accelerate its AI research             
The market capitalization of Nvidia  whose GPUs are in high demand to train and use generative AI models  rose to over US     trillion  making it the world s largest company by market capitalization as of June                      
In       San Francisco s population increased for the first time in years  with the boom cited as a contributing factor             
Machine learning resources  hardware or software can be bought and licensed off the shelf or as cloud platform services              This enables wide and publicly available uses  spreading AI skills              Over half of businesses consider AI to be a top organizational priority and to be the most crucial technological advancement in many decades              
Across industries  generative AI tools are becoming widely available through the AI boom and are increasingly used in businesses across regions              A main area of use is data analytics  Seen as an incremental change  machine learning improves industry performance              Businesses report AI to be most useful in increased process efficiency  improved decision making and strengthening of existing services and products              Through adoption  AI has already positively influenced revenue generation in multiple business functions  Businesses have experienced revenue increases of up to      mainly in manufacturing  risk management and research and development             
AI and generative AI investments have been increasing with the boom  increasing from     billion in      to      billion in       Most notably  the share of generative AI investments was around     in                   Further  generative AI businesses have seen considerable venture capital investments even though regulatory and economic outlooks remain in question             
Tech giants capture the bulk of the monetary gains from AI and act as major suppliers to or customers of private users and other businesses                         

Concerns edit 
Inaccuracy  cybersecurity and intellectual property infringement are considered to be the main risks associated with the boom  although not many actively attempt to mitigate the risk              Large language models have been criticized for reproducing biases inherited from their training data  including discriminatory biases related to ethnicity or gender              As a dual use technology  AI carries risks of misuse by malicious actors              As AI becomes more sophisticated  it may eventually become cheaper and more efficient than human workers  which could cause technological unemployment and a transition period of economic turmoil                          Public reaction to the AI boom has been mixed  with some hailing the new possibilities that AI creates  its sophistication and potential for benefiting humanity                          while others denounced it for threatening job security                         and for giving  uncanny  or flawed responses             

Dominance by tech giants edit 
The commercial AI scene is dominated by American Big Tech companies such as Alphabet Inc   Amazon  Apple Inc   Meta Platforms  and Microsoft  whose investments in this area have surpassed those from U S  based venture capitalists                                      Some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure  AI chips  and computing power from data centers  allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace                            AI related patents have been hoarded by the largest American tech companies as well  with IBM leading the way with                    

Intellectual property edit 
Tech companies such as Meta  OpenAI and Nvidia have been sued by artists  writers  journalists  and software developers for using their work to train AI models                            Early generative AI chatbots  such as the GPT    used the BookCorpus  and books are still the best source of training data for producing high quality language models  ChatGPT aroused suspicion that its sources included libraries of pirated content after the chatbot produced detailed summaries of every part of Sarah Silverman s The Bedwetter and verbatim excerpts of paywalled content from The New York Times                            In protest of the UK government holding consultations on how copyrighted music can legally be used to train AI models               more than a thousand British musicians released an album with no sounds  entitled Is This What We Want

On April           as part of an ongoing feud with fellow rapper Kendrick Lamar  the artist Drake released the diss track  Taylor Made Freestyle   which featured AI generated vocals imitating the voices of Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg               Shakur s estate threatened to sue over the use of Shakur s likeness               saying that it constituted a violation of Shakur s personality rights 
On May           following the release of a demo of updates to OpenAI s ChatGPT Voice Mode feature a week earlier                            actor Scarlett Johansson issued a statement                           in relation to the  Sky  voice shown in the demo  accusing OpenAI of producing it to be very similar to her own  and her portrayal of the artificial intelligence voice assistant Samantha in the film Her         despite Johansson refusing an earlier offer from the company to provide her voice for the system  The agent of the unnamed voice actress who voiced Sky stated that she had recorded her lines in her natural speaking voice and that OpenAI had not mentioned the movie Her nor Johansson                           
Several incidents involving sharing of non consensual deepfake pornography have occurred  In late January       deepfake images of American musician Taylor Swift proliferated  Several experts have warned that deepfake pornography is more quickly created and disseminated  due to the relative ease of using the technology               Canada introduced federal legislation targeting sharing of non consensual sexually explicit AI generated photos  most provinces already had such laws               In the United States  the DEFIANCE Act was introduced in March                   

Environment edit 
A large amount of electricity is needed to power generative AI products               making it more difficult for companies to achieve net zero emissions  From      to       Google s greenhouse gas emissions increased by                  

Biosecurity and cybersecurity edit 
AI is expected by researchers of the Center for AI Safety to improve the  accessibility  success rate  scale  speed  stealth and potency of cyberattacks   potentially causing  significant geopolitical turbulence  if it reinforces attack more than defense                           Concerns have been raised about the potential capability of future AI systems to engineer particularly lethal and contagious pathogens                           
The AI boom is said to have started an arms race in which large companies are competing against each other to have the most powerful AI model on the market  with speed and profit prioritized over safety and user protection                                        

Sentience and human extinction edit 
Further information  AI takeover
Rapid progress in artificial intelligence has also sparked interest in whether some future AI systems will be sentient or otherwise worthy of moral consideration               and whether they should be granted rights              
Industry leaders have further warned in the statement on AI risk of extinction that humanity might irreversibly lose control over a sufficiently advanced artificial general intelligence
