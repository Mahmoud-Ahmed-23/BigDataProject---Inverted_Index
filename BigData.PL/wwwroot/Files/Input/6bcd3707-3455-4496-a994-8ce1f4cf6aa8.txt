History edit 
Main article  History of computing
For a chronological guide  see Timeline of computing 
The history of computing is longer than the history of computing hardware and includes the history of methods intended for pen and paper  or for chalk and slate  with or without the aid of tables  Computing is intimately tied to the representation of numbers  though mathematical concepts necessary for computing existed before numeral systems  The earliest known tool for use in computation is the abacus  and it is thought to have been invented in Babylon circa between      and      BC  Abaci  of a more modern design  are still used as calculation tools today 
The first recorded proposal for using digital electronics in computing was the      paper  The Use of Thyratrons for High Speed Automatic Counting of Physical Phenomena  by C  E  Wynn Williams             Claude Shannon s      paper  A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits  then introduced the idea of using electronics for Boolean algebraic operations 
The concept of a field effect transistor was proposed by Julius Edgar Lilienfeld in       John Bardeen and Walter Brattain  while working under William Shockley at Bell Labs  built the first working transistor  the point contact transistor  in                             In       the University of Manchester built the first transistorized computer  the Manchester Baby             However  early junction transistors were relatively bulky devices that were difficult to mass produce  which limited them to a number of specialised applications             
In       Frosch and Derick were able to manufacture the first silicon dioxide field effect transistors at Bell Labs  the first transistors in which drain and source were adjacent at the surface             Subsequently  a team demonstrated a working MOSFET at Bell Labs                               The MOSFET made it possible to build high density integrated circuits                          leading to what is known as the computer revolution             or microcomputer revolution             

Computer edit 
Main articles  Computer  Outline of computers  and Glossary of computer terms
A computer is a machine that manipulates data according to a set of instructions called a computer program              The program has an executable form that the computer can use directly to execute the instructions  The same program in its human readable source code form  enables a programmer to study and develop a sequence of steps known as an algorithm              Because the instructions can be carried out in different types of computers  a single set of source instructions converts to machine instructions according to the CPU type             
The execution process carries out the instructions in a computer program  Instructions express the computations performed by the computer  They trigger sequences of simple actions on the executing machine  Those actions produce effects according to the semantics of the instructions 

Computer hardware edit 
Main article  Computer hardware
Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer  including the central processing unit  memory  and input output              Computational logic and computer architecture are key topics in the field of computer hardware                         

Computer software edit 
Main article  Computer software
Computer software  or just software  is a collection of computer programs and related data  which provides instructions to a computer  Software refers to one or more computer programs and data held in the storage of the computer  It is a set of programs  procedures  algorithms  as well as its documentation concerned with the operation of a data processing system      citation needed      Program software performs the function of the program it implements  either by directly providing instructions to the computer hardware or by serving as input to another piece of software  The term was coined to contrast with the old term hardware  meaning physical devices   In contrast to hardware  software is intangible             
Software is also sometimes used in a more narrow sense  meaning application software only 

System software edit 
Main article  System software
System software  or systems software  is computer software designed to operate and control computer hardware  and to provide a platform for running application software  System software includes operating systems  utility software  device drivers  window systems  and firmware  Frequently used development tools such as compilers  linkers  and debuggers are classified as system software              System software and middleware manage and integrate a computer s capabilities  but typically do not directly apply them in the performance of tasks that benefit the user  unlike application software 

Application software edit 
Main article  Application software
Application software  also known as an application or an app  is computer software designed to help the user perform specific tasks  Examples include enterprise software  accounting software  office suites  graphics software  and media players  Many application programs deal principally with documents              Apps may be bundled with the computer and its system software  or may be published separately  Some users are satisfied with the bundled apps and need never install additional applications  The system software manages the hardware and serves the application  which in turn serves the user 
Application software applies the power of a particular computing platform or system software to a particular purpose  Some apps  such as Microsoft Office  are developed in multiple versions for several different platforms  others have narrower requirements and are generally referred to by the platform they run on  For example  a geography application for Windows or an Android application for education or Linux gaming  Applications that run only on one platform and increase the desirability of that platform due to the popularity of the application  known as killer applications             

Computer network edit 
Main article  Computer network
A computer network  often simply referred to as a network  is a collection of hardware components and computers interconnected by communication channels that allow the sharing of resources and information              When at least one process in one device is able to send or receive data to or from at least one process residing in a remote device  the two devices are said to be in a network  Networks may be classified according to a wide variety of characteristics such as the medium used to transport the data  communications protocol used  scale  topology  and organizational scope 
Communications protocols define the rules and data formats for exchanging information in a computer network  and provide the basis for network programming  One well known communications protocol is Ethernet  a hardware and link layer standard that is ubiquitous in local area networks  Another common protocol is the Internet Protocol Suite  which defines a set of protocols for internetworking  i e  for data communication between multiple networks  host to host data transfer  and application specific data transmission formats             
Computer networking is sometimes considered a sub discipline of electrical engineering  telecommunications  computer science  information technology  or computer engineering  since it relies upon the theoretical and practical application of these disciplines

Main article  Internet
The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet Protocol Suite  TCP IP  to serve billions of users  This includes millions of private  public  academic  business  and government networks  ranging in scope from local to global  These networks are linked by a broad array of electronic  wireless  and optical networking technologies  The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services  such as the inter linked hypertext documents of the World Wide Web and the infrastructure to support email             

Computer programming edit 
Main articles  Computer programming and Software engineering
Computer programming is the process of writing  testing  debugging  and maintaining the source code and documentation of computer programs  This source code is written in a programming language  which is an artificial language that is often more restrictive than natural languages  but easily translated by the computer  Programming is used to invoke some desired behavior  customization  from the machine             
Writing high quality source code requires knowledge of both the computer science domain and the domain in which the application will be used  The highest quality software is thus often developed by a team of domain experts  each a specialist in some area of development              However  the term programmer may apply to a range of program quality  from hacker to open source contributor to professional  It is also possible for a single programmer to do most or all of the computer programming needed to generate the proof of concept to launch a new killer application             

Computer programmer edit 
Main articles  Programmer  Software engineer  and Software developer
A programmer  computer programmer  or coder is a person who writes computer software  The term computer programmer can refer to a specialist in one area of computer programming or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software  One who practices or professes a formal approach to programming may also be known as a programmer analyst              A programmer s primary computer language  C  C    Java  Lisp  Python  etc   is often prefixed to the above titles  and those who work in a web environment often prefix their titles with Web  The term programmer can be used to refer to a software developer  software engineer  computer scientist  or software analyst  However  members of these professions typically possess other software engineering skills  beyond programming             

Computer industry edit

Sub disciplines of computing edit 
Computer engineering edit 
Main article  Computer engineering
Computer engineering is a discipline that integrates several fields of electrical engineering and computer science required to develop computer hardware and software              Computer engineers usually have training in electronic engineering  or electrical engineering   software design  and hardware software integration  rather than just software engineering or electronic engineering  Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing  from the design of individual microprocessors  personal computers  and supercomputers  to circuit design  This field of engineering includes not only the design of hardware within its own domain  but also the interactions between hardware and the context in which it operates             

Software engineering edit 
Main article  Software engineering
Software engineering is the application of a systematic  disciplined  and quantifiable approach to the design  development  operation  and maintenance of software  and the study of these approaches  That is  the application of engineering to software                                      It is the act of using insights to conceive  model and scale a solution to a problem  The first reference to the term is the      NATO Software Engineering Conference  and was intended to provoke thought regarding the perceived software crisis at the time                                      Software development  a widely used and more generic term  does not necessarily subsume the engineering paradigm  The generally accepted concepts of Software Engineering as an engineering discipline have been specified in the Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge  SWEBOK   The SWEBOK has become an internationally accepted standard in ISO IEC TR

Research and emerging technologies edit 
Further information  List of unsolved problems in computer science
DNA based computing and quantum computing are areas of active research for both computing hardware and software  such as the development of quantum algorithms  Potential infrastructure for future technologies includes DNA origami on photolithography             and quantum antennae for transferring information between ion traps              By       researchers had entangled    qubits                          Fast digital circuits  including those based on Josephson junctions and rapid single flux quantum technology  are becoming more nearly realizable with the discovery of nanoscale superconductors             
Fiber optic and photonic  optical  devices  which already have been used to transport data over long distances  are starting to be used by data centers  along with CPU and semiconductor memory components  This allows the separation of RAM from CPU by optical interconnects              IBM has created an integrated circuit with both electronic and optical information processing in one chip  This is denoted CMOS integrated nanophotonics  CINP               One benefit of optical interconnects is that motherboards  which formerly required a certain kind of system on a chip  SoC   can now move formerly dedicated memory and network controllers off the motherboards  spreading the controllers out onto the rack  This allows standardization of backplane interconnects and motherboards for multiple types of SoCs  which allows more timely upgrades of CPUs             
Another field of research is spintronics  Spintronics can provide computing power and storage  without heat buildup              Some research is being done on hybrid chips  which combine photonics and spintronics                          There is also research ongoing on combining plasmonics  photonics  and electronics             

Cloud computing edit 
Cloud computing is a model that allows for the use of computing resources  such as servers or applications  without the need for interaction between the owner of these resources and the end user  It is typically offered as a service  making it an example of Software as a Service  Platforms as a Service  and Infrastructure as a Service  depending on the functionality offered  Key characteristics include on demand access  broad network access  and the capability of rapid scaling              It allows individual users or small business to benefit from economies of scale 
One area of interest in this field is its potential to support energy efficiency  Allowing thousands of instances of computation to occur on one single machine instead of thousands of individual machines could help save energy  It could also ease the transition to renewable energy source  since it would suffice to power one server farm with renewable energy  rather than millions of homes and offices             
However  this centralized computing model poses several challenges  especially in security and privacy  Current legislation does not sufficiently protect users from companies mishandling their data on company servers  This suggests potential for further legislative regulations on cloud computing and tech companies             

Quantum computing edit 
Quantum computing is an area of research that brings together the disciplines of computer science  information theory  and quantum physics  While the idea of information as part of physics is relatively new  there appears to be a strong tie between information theory and quantum mechanics              Whereas traditional computing operates on a binary system of ones and zeros  quantum computing uses qubits  Qubits are capable of being in a superposition  i e  in both states of one and zero  simultaneously  Thus  the value of the qubit is not between   and    but changes depending on when it is measured  This trait of qubits is known as quantum entanglement  and is the core idea of quantum computing that allows quantum computers to do large scale computations              Quantum computing is often used for scientific research in cases where traditional computers do not have the computing power to do the necessary calculations  such in molecular modeling  Large molecules and their reactions are far too complex for traditional computers to calculate  but the computational power of quantum computers could provide a tool to perform such calculations
