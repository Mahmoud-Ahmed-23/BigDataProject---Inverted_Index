Copyright law in the use of AI


In the     s  the rapid advancement of deep learning based generative artificial intelligence models raised questions about whether copyright infringement occurs when such are trained or used  This includes text to image models such as Stable Diffusion and large language models such as ChatGPT  As of       there were several pending U S  lawsuits challenging the use of copyrighted data to train AI models  with defendants arguing that this falls under fair use            Intellectual property

Popular deep learning models are trained on mass amounts of media scraped from the Internet  often utilizing copyrighted material             When assembling training data  the sourcing of copyrighted works may infringe on the copyright holder s exclusive right to control reproduction  unless covered by exceptions in relevant copyright laws  Additionally  using a model s outputs might violate copyright  and the model creator could be accused of vicarious liability and held responsible for that copyright infringement 


Copyright status of AI generated works edit 
The United States Copyright Office has declared that works not created by a human author  like this  selfie  portrait taken by a monkey  are not eligible for copyright protection 
Since most legal jurisdictions only grant copyright to original works of authorship by human authors  the definition of  originality  is central to the copyright status of AI generated works            

United States edit 
In the U S   the Copyright Act protects  original works of authorship              The U S  Copyright Office has interpreted this as being limited to works  created by a human being              declining to grant copyright to works generated without human intervention             Some legal professionals have suggested that Naruto v  Slater         in which the U S   th Circuit Court of Appeals held that non humans cannot be copyright holders of artistic works  could be a potential precedent in copyright litigation over works created by generative AI             Some have suggested that certain AI generations might be copyrightable in the U S  and similar jurisdictions if it can be shown that the human who ran the AI program exercised sufficient originality in selecting the inputs to the AI or editing the AI s output                       
Proponents of this view suggest that an AI model may be viewed as merely a tool  akin to a pen or a camera  used by its human operator to express their creative vision                        For example  proponents argue that if the standard of originality can be satisfied by an artist clicking the shutter button on a camera  then perhaps artists using generative AI should get similar deference  especially if they go through multiple rounds of revision to refine their prompts to the AI             Other proponents argue that the Copyright Office is not taking a technology neutral  approach to the use of AI or algorithmic tools  For other creative expressions  music  photography  writing  the test is effectively whether there is de minimis  or limited human creativity  For works using AI tools  the Copyright Office has made the test a different one i e  whether there is no more than de minimis technological involvement            

Th  tre D op ra Spatial        created using Midjourney  prompted by Jason M  Allen
This difference in approach can be seen in the recent decision in respect of a registration claim by Jason Matthew Allen for his work Th  tre D op ra Spatial created using Midjourney and an upscaling tool  The Copyright Office stated  The Board finds that the Work contains more than a de minimis amount of content generated by artificial intelligence   AI    and this content must therefore be disclaimed in an application for registration  Because Mr  Allen is unwilling to disclaim the AI generated material  the Work cannot be registered as submitted             
As AI is increasingly used to generate literature  music  and other forms of art  the U S  Copyright Office has released new guidance emphasizing whether works  including materials generated by artificial intelligence  exhibit a  mechanical reproduction  nature or are the  manifestation of the author s own creative conception               The U S  Copyright Office published a Rule in March      on a range of issues related to the use of AI  where they stated 

   because the Office receives roughly half a million applications for registration each year  it sees new trends in registration activity that may require modifying or expanding the information required to be disclosed on an application 
One such recent development is the use of sophisticated artificial intelligence   AI   technologies capable of producing expressive material  These technologies  train  on vast quantities of preexisting human authored works and use inferences from that training to generate new content  Some systems operate in response to a user s textual instruction  called a  prompt  â€‰

The resulting output may be textual  visual  or audio  and is determined by the AI based on its design and the material it has been trained on  These technologies  often described as  generative AI   raise questions about whether the material they produce is protected by copyright  whether works consisting of both human authored and AI generated material may be registered  and what information should be provided to the Office by applicants seeking to register them             
The Copyright Office further clarified in a January      that AI assisted works which the creative expression of the human remains evident in the work can be copyrighted  which can include creative adaption of prompts for AI generators or usage of AI to assist in creation process of a work such as filmmaking              Works  where the expressive elements are determine by a machine  still remain uncopyrightable              Following this guidance  the Copyright Office registered  A Single Piece of American Cheese   the first visual artwork composed solely of AI generated outputs as a composite work in January                   The basis for the copyright involved arguing that human driven selection  arrangement  and coordination involved in the creative process on a single work constituted sufficient human authorship to merit the copyright 
Both the federal and circuit courts in the District of Columbia have upheld the Copyright Office s refusal to register copyrights for works generated solely by machines  establishing that machine ownership would conflict with heritable property rights as establish by the Copyright Act of                  
The U S  Patent and Trademark Office  USPTO  similarly codified restrictions on the patentability of patents credits solely to AI authors in February       following an August      ruling in the case Thaler v  Perlmutter  In this case  the Patent Office denied grant to patents created by Stephen Thaler s AI program  DABUS due to the lack of a  natural person  on the patents  authorship  The U S  Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld this decision                          In the subsequent rule making  the USPTO allows for human inventors to incorporate the output of artificial intelligence  as long as this method is appropriately documented in the patent application              However  it may become virtually impossible as when the inner workings and the use of AI in inventive transactions are not adequately understood or are largely unknown             
Representative Adam Schiff proposed the Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act in April       If passed  the bill would require AI companies to submit copyrighted works to the Register of Copyrights before releasing new generative AI systems  These companies would have to file these documents    days before publicly showing their AI tools             

United Kingdom edit 
Other jurisdictions include explicit statutory language related to computer generated works  including the United Kingdom s Copyright  Designs and Patents Act       which states 

In the case of a literary  dramatic  musical or artistic work which is computer generated  the author shall be taken to be the person by whom the arrangements necessary for the creation of the work are undertaken            
However  the computer generated work law under UK law relates to autonomous creations by computer programs  Individuals using AI tools will usually be the authors of the works assuming they meet the minimum requirements for copyright work  The language used for computer generated work relates  in respect of AI  to the ability of the human programmers to have copyright in the autonomous productions of the AI tools  i e  where there is no direct human input   In so far as each composite frame is a computer generated work then the arrangements necessary for the creation of the work were undertaken by Mr Jones because he devised the appearance of the various elements of the game and the rules and logic by which each frame is generated and he wrote the relevant computer program  In these circumstances I am satisfied that Mr Jones is the person by whom the arrangements necessary for the creation of the works were undertaken and therefore is deemed to be the author by virtue of s                  
The UK government has consulted on the use of generative tools and AI in respect of intellectual property leading to a proposed specialist Code of Practice               to provide guidance to support AI firms to access copyrighted work as an input to their models  whilst ensuring there are protections on generated output to support right holders of copyrighted work               The U S  Copyright Office recently     when       published a notice of inquiry and request for comments following its      Registration Guidance             

China edit 
On November           the Beijing Internet Court issued a decision recognizing copyright in AI generated images in a litigation             
As noted by a lawyer and AI art creator  the challenge for intellectual property regulators  legislators and the courts is how to protect human creativity in a technologically neutral fashion whilst considering the risks of automated AI factories  AI tools have the ability to autonomously create a range of material that is potentially subject to copyright  music  blogs  poetry  images  and technical papers  or other intellectual property rights  patents and design rights             

Training AI with copyrighted data edit 
Deep learning models source large data sets from the Internet such as publicly available images and the text of web pages  The text and images are then converted into numeric formats the AI can analyze  A deep learning model identifies patterns linking the encoded text and image data and learns which text concepts correspond to elements in images  Through repetitive testing  the model refines its accuracy by matching images to text descriptions  The trained model undergoes validation to evaluate its skill in generating or manipulating new images using only the text prompts provided after the training process              When assembling these training datasets involves making copies of copyrighted works  this has raised the question of whether this process infringes the copyright holder s exclusive right to make reproductions of their works  or if it falls use fair use allowances                         

United States edit 
U S  machine learning developers have traditionally believed this to be allowable under fair use because using copyrighted work is transformative  and limited              The situation has been compared to Google Books s scanning of copyrighted books in Authors Guild  Inc  v  Google  Inc   which was ultimately found to be fair use  because the scanned content was not made publicly available  and the use was non expressive             
Timothy B  Lee  in Ars Technica  argues that if the plaintiffs succeed  this may shift the balance of power in favour of large corporations such as Google  Microsoft  and Meta which can afford to license large amounts of training data from copyright holders and leverage their proprietary datasets of user generated data              IP scholars Bryan Casey and Mark Lemley argue in the Texas Law Review that datasets are so large that  there is no plausible option simply to license all  of the data      So allowing  any generative training  copyright claim is tantamount to saying  not that copyright owners will get paid  but that the use won t be permitted at all               Other scholars disagree  some predict a similar outcome to the U S  music licensing procedures             
One of the earliest case to challenge the nature of fair use for training AI was a lawsuit that Thomson Reuters brought against Ross Intelligence first filed in       Thomson Reuters argued that Ross Intelligence had used their Westlaw headnotes  brief summaries of court decisions  to train their AI engine designed to compete with Westlaw  While Thomson Reuters  claims were initially denied by judge Stephanos Bibas of the Third Circuit on the basis that headnotes may not have been copyrightable  Bibas reevaluated his decision in February      and issued a ruling favoring Thomson Reuters  in that headnotes are copyrightable  and that Ross Intelligence  which had since closed down in       had inappropriately used the material  In the case of Ross s AI  the engine was not generative  and produced output that was composed of pieces of Westlaw s material  which aided in Thomson Reuter s claims of reuse  so how the case may apply to other generative AI like OpenAI is not clear             
In a consolidated case brought by several authors against Meta and OpenAI  federal district judge Vince Chhabria expressed doubt that the use of unlicensed copyrighted material for training AI would fall under fair use  He stated during court hearings to Meta s lawyers that  You have companies using copyright protected material to create a product that is capable of producing an infinite number of competing products  You are dramatically changing  you might even say obliterating  the market for that person s work  and you re saying that you don t even have to pay a license to that person  I just don t understand how that can be fair use              

EU edit 
In the EU  such TDM exceptions form part of the      Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market              They are specifically referred to in the EU s AI Act  which came into force in        which  is widely seen as a clear indication of the EU legislator s intention that the exception covers AI data collection   a view that was also endorsed in a      German court decision              Unlike the TDM exception for scientific research  the more general exception covering commercial AI only applies if the copyright holder has not opted out              In order to facilitate the opt out to the TDM exception  the EU s AI Act of      requires providers of  general purpose  AI models to implement a policy to comply with EU law  including the TDM exception opt out  and to publish a detailed summary of training content according to a template provided by the AI Office  These provisions will come into force in August       with further clarification on exactly what will be required to providers of general purpose AI models expected to come from a Code of Practice to be released in advance of this             

UK edit 
Unlike the EU  the United Kingdom prohibits data mining for commercial purposes but has proposed this should be changed to support the development of AI   For text and data mining  we plan to introduce a new copyright and database exception which allows TDM for any purpose  Rights holders will still have safeguards to protect their content  including a requirement for lawful access              

India edit 
Indian copyright law provides fair use exceptions for scientific research  but lacks specific provisions for commercial AI training models  Unlike the EU and UK  India has not established text and data mining  TDM  provisions that explicitly address commercial AI systems  This regulatory uncertainty became apparent in      when Asian News International  ANI  sued OpenAI for using its content to train AI models without authorization  While OpenAI offered an opt out policy that ANI used in October      to block AI scrapers  ANI claimed this measure was ineffective since their content remained available through content syndication  The case also highlighted jurisdictional challenges  as OpenAI argued it was not subject to Indian law because its servers and training operations were located outside the country                         

Copyright infringing AI outputs edit 
A photograph of Anne Graham Lotz included in Stable Diffusion s training setAn image generated by Stable Diffusion using the prompt Anne Graham LotzGenerative AI models may produce outputs that are virtually identical to images from their training set  The research paper from which this example was taken was able to produce similar replications for only       of training images             
An image generated by Flux using the prompt an astronaut riding a horse  by Picasso and Juan Gris  Generative image models are adept at imitating the visual style of particular artists in their training set 
In some cases  deep learning models may replicate items in their training set when generating output  This behaviour is generally considered an undesired overfitting of a model by AI developers  and has in previous generations of AI been considered a manageable problem              Memorization is the emergent phenomenon of LLMs to repeat long strings of training data  and it is no longer related to overfitting              Evaluations of controlled LLM output measure the amount memorized from training data  focused on GPT   series models  as variously over    for exact duplicates             or up to about                 This is potentially a security risk and a copyright risk  for both users and providers              As of August          update       major consumer LLMs have attempted to mitigate these problems  but researchers have still been able to prompt leakage of copyrighted material             
Under U S  law  to prove that an AI output infringes a copyright  a plaintiff must show the copyrighted work was  actually copied   meaning that the AI generates output which is  substantially similar  to their work  and that the AI had access to their work            
In the course of learning to statistically model the data on which they are trained  deep generative AI models may learn to imitate the distinct style of particular authors in the training set  Since fictional characters enjoy some copyright protection in the U S  and other jurisdictions  an AI may also produce infringing content in the form of novel works which incorporate fictional characters                        
A generative image model such as Stable Diffusion is able to model the stylistic characteristics of an artist like Pablo Picasso  including his particular brush strokes  use of colour  perspective  and so on   and a user can engineer a prompt such as  an astronaut riding a horse  by Picasso  to cause the model to generate a novel image applying the artist s style to an arbitrary subject  However  an artist s overall style is generally not subject to copyright protection             Additional questions related to the copyrightability of style and the output of AI models was raised in March       following an update to ChatGPT s model that was able to produce images strongly resembling the work of Studio Ghibli s artist Hayao Miyazaki  While users initially used it to make  Ghiblification  of popular meme images  further users were found to be distasteful in light of Miyazaki s negative stance on AI  and ChatGPT placed limits on the ability for users to make images in the style of living artists                         

Litigation edit 
A November      class action lawsuit against Microsoft  GitHub and OpenAI alleged that GitHub Copilot  an AI powered code editing tool trained on public GitHub repositories  violated the copyright of the repositories  authors  noting that the tool was able to generate source code which matched its training data verbatim  without providing attribution             
In January      three US artists Sarah Andersen  Kelly McKernan  and Karla Ortiz filed a class action copyright infringement lawsuit against Stability AI  Midjourney  and DeviantArt  claiming that these companies have infringed the rights of millions of artists by training AI tools on five billion images scraped from the web without the consent of the original artists              The plaintiffs  complaint has been criticized for technical inaccuracies  such as incorrectly claiming that  a trained diffusion model can produce a copy of any of its Training Images   and describing Stable Diffusion as  merely a complex collage tool               In addition to copyright infringement  the plaintiffs allege unlawful competition and violation of their right of publicity in relation to AI tools  ability to create works in the style of the plaintiffs en masse              In July       U S  District Judge William Orrick inclined to dismiss most of the lawsuit filed by Andersen  McKernan  and Ortiz but allowed them to file a new complaint              Judge Orrick later dismissed all but one claim  that of copyright infringement towards Stability AI  in October                   However  after refiling on some of the eliminated claims  Orrick agreed in August      to include some of these additional claims against the AI companies  which included both copyright and trademark infringements             
In January       Stability AI was sued in London by Getty Images for using its images in their training data without purchasing a license                         
Getty filed another suit against Stability AI in a U S  district court in Delaware in February       The suit again alleges copyright infringement for the use of Getty s images in the training of Stable Diffusion  and further argues that the model infringes Getty s trademark by generating images with Getty s watermark             
In July       authors Paul Tremblay and Mona Awad filed a lawsuit in a San Francisco court against OpenAI  alleging that its ChatGPT language model had been trained on their copyrighted books without permission  citing ChatGPT s  very accurate  summaries of their works as evidence                          Two separate lawsuits were filed by authors Sarah Silverman  Christopher Golden and Richard Kadrey against Meta and OpenAI  arguing that in addition to copyright infringement for training their engines on their works  that products produced from the AI engines were derivative works and also copyright infringements              The two suits against OpenAI were combined  during which Awad left the suit  and by February       Judge Araceli Mart nez Olgu n of the Northern District of California threw out all but one claim related to the use of the author s copyrighted works as part of the training data for the AI model             
The New York Times has sued Microsoft and OpenAI in December       claiming that their engines were trained on wholesale articles from the Times  which the Times considers infringement of their copyright  The Times further claimed that fair use claims made by these AI companies were invalid since the generated information around news stories directly competes with the Times and impacts the newspaper s commercial opportunities              In March       the federal district judge denied OpenAI s motion to dismiss the lawsuit  while narrowing the Times     s claims to those related to copyright infringement in training OpenAI s models             
Eight U S  national newspapers owned by Tribune Publishing sued Microsoft and OpenAI in April      over copyright infringement related to the use of their news articles for training data  as well as for output that creates false and misleading statements that are attributed to the newspapers             
The Recording Industry Association of America  RIAA  and several major music labels sued the developers of Suno AI and Udio  AI models that can take text input to create songs with both lyrics and backing music  in separate lawsuits in June       alledging that both AI models were trained without consent with music from the labels             
In September       the Regional Court of Hamburg dismissed a German photographer s lawsuit against the non profit organization LAION for unauthorized reproduction of his copyrighted work while creating a dataset for AI training              The decision was described as a  landmark ruling on TDM exceptions for AI training data  in Germany and EU more generally             
Indian news agency ANI sued OpenAI before the Delhi High Court in India  The suit claims that OpenAI s ChatGPT reproduces ANI s copyrighted news content without authorization  amounting to copyright infringement and unauthorized use of proprietary journalistic material             
Several Canadian news agencies under News Media Canada sued OpenAI in November      for copyright violations related to the use of their news articles being used to train ChatGPT  They are seeking damages up to CA        per news article used for training
