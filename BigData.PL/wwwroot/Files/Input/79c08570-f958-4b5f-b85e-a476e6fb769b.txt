Foreign policy  also known as external policy  is the set of strategies and actions a state employs in its interactions with other states  unions  and international entities  It encompasses a wide range of objectives  including defense and security  economic benefits  and humanitarian assistance  The formulation of foreign policy is influenced by various factors such as domestic considerations  the behavior of other states  and geopolitical strategies  Historically  the practice of foreign policy has evolved from managing short term crises to addressing long term international relations  with diplomatic corps playing a crucial role in its development 
The objectives of foreign policy are diverse and interconnected  contributing to a comprehensive approach for each state  Defense and security are often primary goals             with states forming military alliances and employing soft power to combat threats  Economic interests  including trade agreements and foreign aid  are central to a country s role in the global economy  Additionally  many states have developed humanitarian programs based on the responsibility to protect  supporting less powerful countries through various forms of assistance  The study of foreign policy examines the reasons and methods behind state interactions  with think tanks and academic institutions providing research and analysis to inform policy decisions 


History edit 
See also  Diplomatic history
The idea of long term management of relationships followed the development of professional diplomatic corps that managed diplomacy 
In the   th century  due to extreme turbulence in European diplomacy and ongoing conflicts  the practice of diplomacy was often fragmented by the necessity to deal with isolated issues  termed  affairs   Therefore  while domestic management of such issues was termed civil affairs  peasant riots  treasury shortfalls  and court intrigues   the term foreign affairs was applied to the management of temporary issues outside the sovereign realm  This term remained in widespread use in the English speaking states into the   th century  and remains the name of departments in several states that manage foreign relations  Although originally intended to describe short term management of a specific concern  these departments now manage all day to day and long term international relations among states      citation needed     
Think tanks are occasionally employed by government foreign relations organizations to provide research and advocacy in the development of foreign policy proposals  alternatives to existing policy  or to provide analytical assessments of evolving relationships 

Objectives edit 
Several objectives may motivate a government s foreign policy  Foreign policy may be directed for defense and security  for economic benefit  or to provide assistance to states that need it  All foreign policy objectives are interconnected and contribute to a single  comprehensive foreign policy for each state  Unlike domestic policy  foreign policy issues often arise suddenly in response to developments and major events in foreign countries            

Defense edit 
Foreign policy is often directed for the purpose of ensuring national security             Governments forming military alliances with foreign states in order to deter and show stronger resistance to attack             Foreign policy also focuses on combating adversarial states through soft power  international isolation  or war 
In the   st century  defensive foreign policy has expanded to address the threat of global terrorism                                  

Economic edit 
Foreign policy is central for a country s role within the world economy and international trade  Economic foreign policy issues may include the establishment of trade agreements  the distribution of foreign aid  and the management of imports and exports 

Internationalist edit 
Many states have developed humanitarian programs under the concept of the responsibility to protect  Proponents of liberal internationalism believe that it is the duty of stronger and more well off countries to assist and support less powerful countries  This idea is often associated with the idealist school of thought  Liberal internationalist support can take the form of defensive or economic support            

Influences edit 
Power and National capabilities edit 
Superpowers are able to project power and exercise their influence across the world  while great powers and middle powers have moderate influence in global affairs 
Small powers have less ability to exercise influence unilaterally  as they have fewer economic and military resources to leverage  As a result  they are more likely to support international and multilateral organizations  The diplomatic bureaucracies of smaller states are also smaller  which limits their capacity to engage in complex diplomacy  Smaller states may seek to ally themselves with larger countries for economic and defensive benefits  or they may avoid involvement in international disputes so as to remain on friendly terms with all countries            

Form of government edit 
The political institutions and forms of government play a role in a country s foreign policy  In a democracy  public opinion and the methods of political representation both affect a country s foreign policy              Democratic countries are also believed to be less likely to resort to military conflict with one another              Autocratic states are less likely to use legalism in their foreign policies              Under a dictatorship  a state s foreign policy may depend heavily on the preferences of the dictator              Dictators that interfere significantly with their foreign policy apparatus may be less predictable and more likely to make foreign policy blunders             

Study edit 
Main article  Foreign policy analysis
The study of foreign policy considers why and how states interact with one another and maintain relations  Several schools of thought exist in the study of foreign policy  including the rational actor model based on rational choice theory  the government bargaining model that posits the foreign policy apparatus as several competing interests  and the organizational process model that posits the foreign policy apparatus as interlinked bureaucracies that each play their own role             
Think tanks exist that study foreign policy specifically  including the Council on Foreign Relations in the United States and the Chatham House in the United Kingdom
