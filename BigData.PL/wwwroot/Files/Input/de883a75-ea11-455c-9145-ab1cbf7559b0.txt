Scope severity grid from Bostrom s paper  Existential Risk Prevention as Global Priority            
Risks of astronomical suffering  also called suffering risks or s risks  are risks involving much more suffering than all that has occurred on Earth so far                        They are sometimes categorized as a subclass of existential risks            
According to some scholars  s risks warrant serious consideration as they are not extremely unlikely and can arise from unforeseen scenarios  Although they may appear speculative  factors such as technological advancement  power dynamics  and historical precedents indicate that advanced technology could inadvertently result in substantial suffering  Thus  s risks are considered to be a morally urgent matter  despite the possibility of technological benefits            
Sources of possible s risks include embodied artificial intelligence            and superintelligence             as well as space colonization  which could potentially lead to  constant and catastrophic wars             and an immense increase in wild animal suffering by introducing wild animals  who  generally lead short  miserable lives full of sometimes the most brutal suffering   to other planets  either intentionally or inadvertently            


Types of S risk edit 
Artificial intelligence edit 
Artificial intelligence is central to s risk discussions because it may eventually enable powerful actors to control vast technological systems  In a worst case scenario  AI could be used to create systems of perpetual suffering  such as a totalitarian regime expanding across space              Additionally  s risks might arise incidentally  such as through AI driven simulations of conscious beings experiencing suffering  or from economic activities that disregard the well being of nonhuman or digital minds             Steven Umbrello  an AI ethics researcher  has warned that biological computing may make system design more prone to s risks             Brian Tomasik has argued that astronomical suffering could emerge from solving the AI alignment problem incompletely  He argues for the possibility of a  near miss  scenario  where a superintelligent AI that is slightly misaligned has the maximum likelihood of causing astronomical suffering  compared to a completely unaligned AI             

Space colonization edit 
Space colonization could increase suffering by introducing wild animals to new environments  leading to ecological imbalances  In unfamiliar habitats  animals may struggle to survive  facing hunger  disease  and predation  These challenges  combined with unstable ecosystems  could cause population crashes or explosions  resulting in widespread suffering  Additionally  the lack of natural predators or proper biodiversity on colonized planets could worsen the situation  mirroring Earth s ecological problems on a larger scale  This raises ethical concerns about the unintended consequences of space colonization  as it could propagate immense animal suffering in new  unstable ecosystems  Phil Torres argues that space colonization poses significant  suffering risks   where expansion into space will lead to the creation of diverse species and civilizations with conflicting interests  These differences  combined with advanced weaponry and the vast distances between civilizations  would result in catastrophic and unresolvable conflicts  Strategies like a  cosmic Leviathan  to impose order or deterrence policies are unlikely to succeed due to physical limitations in space and the destructive power of future technologies  Thus  Torres concludes that space colonization could create immense suffering and should be delayed or avoided altogether             
Magnus Vinding s  astronomical atrocity problem  questions whether vast amounts of happiness can justify extreme suffering from space colonization  He highlights moral concerns such as diminishing returns on positive goods  the potentially incomparable weight of severe suffering  and the priority of preventing misery  He argues that if colonization is inevitable  it should be led by agents deeply committed to minimizing harm             

Genetic engineering edit 
David Pearce has argued that genetic engineering is a potential s risk  Pearce argues that while technological mastery over the pleasure pain axis and solving the hard problem of consciousness could lead to the potential eradication of suffering  it could also potentially increase the level of contrast in the hedonic range that sentient beings could experience  He argues that these technologies might make it feasible to create  hyperpain  or  dolorium  that experience levels of suffering beyond the human range             

Excessive criminal punishment edit 
S risk scenarios may arise from excessive criminal punishment  with precedents in both historical and in modern penal systems  These risks escalate in situations such as warfare or terrorism  especially when advanced technology is involved  as conflicts can amplify destructive tendencies like sadism  tribalism  and retributivism  War often intensifies these dynamics  with the possibility of catastrophic threats being used to force concessions  Agential s risks are further aggravated by malevolent traits in powerful individuals  such as narcissism or psychopathy  This is exemplified by totalitarian dictators like Hitler and Stalin  whose actions in the   th century inflicted widespread suffering             

Exotic risks edit 
According to David Pearce  there are other potential s risks that are more exotic  such as those posed by the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics             

Mitigation strategies edit 
To mitigate s risks  efforts focus on researching and understanding the factors that exacerbate them  particularly in emerging technologies and social structures  Targeted strategies include promoting safe AI design  ensuring cooperation among AI developers  and modeling future civilizations to anticipate risks  Broad strategies may advocate for moral norms against large scale suffering and stable political institutions  According to Anthony DiGiovanni  prioritizing s risk reduction is essential  as it may be more manageable than other long term challenges  while avoiding catastrophic outcomes could be easier than achieving an entirely utopian future              

Induced amnesia edit 
Induced amnesia has been proposed as a way to mitigate s risks in locked in conscious AI and certain AI adjacent biological systems like brain organoids             

Cosmic rescue missions edit 
David Pearce s concept of  cosmic rescue missions  proposes the idea of sending probes to alleviate potential suffering in extraterrestrial environments  These missions aim to identify and mitigate suffering among hypothetical extraterrestrial life forms  ensuring that if life exists elsewhere  it is treated ethically              However  challenges include the lack of confirmed extraterrestrial life  uncertainty about their consciousness  and public support concerns  with environmentalists advocating for non interference and others focusing on resource extraction
