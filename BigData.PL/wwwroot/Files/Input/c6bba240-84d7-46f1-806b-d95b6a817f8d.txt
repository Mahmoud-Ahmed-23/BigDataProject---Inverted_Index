that image and then sends that signal to our brain  Then After  our brain processes that signal data and converted it into meaningful full information about the object then It recognizes categorises that object based on its properties  In a similar fashion to Computer Vision Work  In CV we have a camera to capture the Objects and Then it processes that Visual data by some pattern recognition algorithms and based on that property that object is identified  But  Before giving unknown data to the machine Algorithm  we trained that machine on a vast amount of Visual labelled data  This labelled data enables the machine to analyze different patterns in all the data points and can relate to those labels Example  Suppose we provide audio data of thousands of bird songs  In that case  the computer learns from this data  analyzes each sound  pitch  duration of each note  rhythm  etc   and hence identifies patterns similar to bird songs and generates a model  As a result  this audio recognition model can now accurately detect whether the sound contains a bird song or not for each input sound Evolution of Computer VisionTime PeriodEvolution of Computer Vision         Development
