							       Film as dream  film as music  No art passes our conscience in the way film does  and goes directly to our feelings  deep down into the dark rooms of our souls         This is how Swedish director  writer  and producer Ingmar Bergman described cinema 
In our society  cinema has been playing a crucial role in documenting history  revolutions  culture  and lifestyles throughout time  The rise of commercial movies had led to a noticeable decrease in the quality of the movies presented over the past decades  but independent filmmakers are always the solution to this equation  With their purposeful movies  they manage to balance the scales and present an honest mirror that reflects the society       s problems and mistakes 
Mohammed Saadoun is an Alexandrian independent filmmaker who studied directing at the Arab Academy for Cinema and TV  Away from his private business  he produces and directs short movies  believing that art is a noble message that must be conveyed to all segments of any society  His first movie Intezar  The Wait  tackled the philosophical context of how people waste their time waiting for something  and eventually discover that it was not meant for them from the very beginning 
Last year  his movie Sokkar Welad  Boy       s Sugary Dream  participated in a big number of film festivals and won the Best Script Award at the Red Carpet Festival in Bahrain and the Tiharqa International Award for Cinema and Art  The movie received positive feedback from critics and viewers 
The film tackled the sufferings of a poor child who managed to achieve his dream his way   Shooting the movie was not an easy task  as Saadoun faced a lot of hardships related to getting the required licenses for shooting some scenes in public streets 
This year  Saadoun decided to tackle the sufferings of Egyptian and Arab women in his fourth movie Alia  The film features a number of talented actors and actresses  including Ola Mandor  Mostafa El Feky  Ahmed El Dars  and others 
       I started writing this movie one year ago and modified the script many times  We started the shooting preparations three months ago         Saadoun said 
       I chose this topic in particular because the Egyptian mother does not usually receive enough attention from her husband and children  and the movie aims o present a simple recipe that can help each mother lead a happier life with her family         he added 
Saadoun reaches out to different entities to get the required financial support for the production of his movies         I usually fund my movies independently  However  Alexandria Independent Films Company helps me with the editing  and One Three Company provides me with the needed shooting equipment         he noted 
Saadoun is currently searching for an idea for his first feature film         I am always interested in shedding light on social cases and neglected characters  I love to get closer to people       s sufferings  pains  dreams  and hopes         he concluded
