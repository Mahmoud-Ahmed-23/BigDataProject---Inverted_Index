Open question in philosophy of how abstract minds interact with physical bodies
Illustration of mind body dualism by Ren  Descartes  Inputs are passed by the sensory organs to the pineal gland  and from there to the immaterial spirit 
The mind body problem is a philosophical problem concerning the relationship between thought and consciousness in the human mind and body                        It addresses the nature of consciousness  mental states  and their relation to the physical brain and nervous system  The problem centers on understanding how immaterial thoughts and feelings can interact with the material world  or whether they are ultimately physical phenomena 
This problem has been a central issue in philosophy of mind since the   th century  particularly following Ren  Descartes  formulation of dualism  which proposes that mind and body are fundamentally distinct substances  Other major philosophical positions include monism  which encompasses physicalism  everything is ultimately physical  and idealism  everything is ultimately mental   More recent approaches include functionalism  property dualism  and various non reductive theories 
The mind body problem raises fundamental questions about causation between mental and physical events  the nature of consciousness  personal identity  and free will  It remains significant in both philosophy and science  influencing fields such as cognitive science  neuroscience  psychology  and artificial intelligence 
In general  the existence of these mind body connections seems unproblematic  Issues arise  however  when attempting to interpret these relations from a metaphysical or scientific perspective  Such reflections raise a number of questions  including 

Are the mind and body two distinct entities  or a single entity 
If the mind and body are two distinct entities  do the two of them causally interact 
Is it possible for these two distinct entities to causally interact 
What is the nature of this interaction 
Can this interaction ever be an object of empirical study 
If the mind and body are a single entity  then are mental events explicable in terms of physical events  or vice versa 
Is the relation between mental and physical events something that arises de novo at a certain point in development 
These and other questions that discuss the relation between mind and body are questions that all fall under the banner of the  mind body problem  


Mind body interaction and mental causation edit 
Philosophers David L  Robb and John F  Heil introduce mental causation in terms of the mind body problem of interaction 

Mind body interaction has a central place in our pretheoretic conception of agency  Indeed  mental causation often figures explicitly in formulations of the mind body problem  Some philosophers insist that the very notion of psychological explanation turns on the intelligibility of mental causation  If your mind and its states  such as your beliefs and desires  were causally isolated from your bodily behavior  then what goes on in your mind could not explain what you do  If psychological explanation goes  so do the closely related notions of agency and moral responsibility  Clearly  a good deal rides on a satisfactory solution to the problem of mental causation  and  there is more than one way in which puzzles about the mind s  causal relevance  to behavior  and to the physical world more generally  can arise 
 Ren  Descartes  set the agenda for subsequent discussions of the mind body relation  According to Descartes  minds and bodies are distinct kinds of  substance   Bodies  he held  are spatially extended substances  incapable of feeling or thought  minds  in contrast  are unextended  thinking  feeling substances  If minds and bodies are radically different kinds of substance  however  it is not easy to see how they  could  causally interact  Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia puts it forcefully to him in a      letter 

how the human soul can determine the movement of the animal spirits in the body so as to perform voluntary acts being as it is merely a conscious substance  For the determination of movement seems always to come about from the moving body s being propelled to depend on the kind of impulse it gets from what sets it in motion  or again  on the nature and shape of this latter thing s surface  Now the first two conditions involve contact  and the third involves that the impelling thing has extension  but you utterly exclude extension from your notion of soul  and contact seems to me incompatible with a thing s being immaterial   
Elizabeth is expressing the prevailing mechanistic view as to how causation of bodies works  Causal relations countenanced by contemporary physics can take several forms  not all of which are of the push pull variety                    David Robb and John Heil   Mental Causation  in The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
Contemporary neurophilosopher Georg Northoff suggests that mental causation is compatible with classical formal and final causality            
Biologist  theoretical neuroscientist and philosopher  Walter J  Freeman  suggests that explaining mind body interaction in terms of  circular causation  is more relevant than linear causation            
In neuroscience  much has been learned about correlations between brain activity and subjective  conscious experiences  Many suggest that neuroscience will ultimately explain consciousness 
    consciousness is a biological process that will eventually be explained in terms of molecular signaling pathways used by interacting populations of nerve cells                However  this view has been criticized because consciousness has yet to be shown to be a process             and the  hard problem  of relating consciousness directly to brain activity remains elusive            

Cognitive science today gets increasingly interested in the embodiment of human perception  thinking  and action  Abstract information processing models are no longer accepted as satisfactory accounts of the human mind  Interest has shifted to interactions between the material human body and its surroundings and to the way in which such interactions shape the mind  Proponents of this approach have expressed the hope that it will ultimately dissolve the Cartesian divide between the immaterial mind and the material existence of human beings  Damasio        Gallagher         A topic that seems particularly promising for providing a bridge across the mind body cleavage is the study of bodily actions  which are neither reflexive reactions to external stimuli nor indications of mental states  which have only arbitrary relationships to the motor features of the action  e g   pressing a button for making a choice response   The shape  timing  and effects of such actions are inseparable from their meaning  One might say that they are loaded with mental content  which cannot be appreciated other than by studying their material features  Imitation  communicative gesturing  and tool use are examples of these kinds of actions                    Georg Goldenberg   How the Mind Moves the Body  Lessons From Apraxia  in Oxford Handbook of Human Action
Since       at the Solvay Conference in Austria  European physicists of the late   th and early   th centuries realized that the interpretations of their experiments with light and electricity required a different theory to explain why light behaves both as a wave and particle  The implications were profound  The usual empirical model of explaining natural phenomena could not account for this duality of matter and non matter  In a significant way  this has brought back the conversation on the mind body duality                  page      needed     

Neural correlates edit 
Main article  Neural correlates of consciousness
The neuronal correlates of consciousness constitute the smallest set of neural events and structures sufficient for a given conscious percept or explicit memory  This case involves synchronized action potentials in neocortical pyramidal neurons             
The neural correlates of consciousness  are the smallest set of brain mechanisms and events sufficient for some specific conscious feeling  as elemental as the color red or as complex as the sensual  mysterious  and primeval sensation evoked when looking at  a  jungle scene                 Neuroscientists use empirical approaches to discover neural correlates of subjective phenomena             

Neurobiology and neurophilosophy edit 
Main articles  Neurobiology and Neurophilosophy
A science of consciousness must explain the exact relationship between subjective conscious mental states and brain states formed by electrochemical interactions in the body  the so called hard problem of consciousness              Neurobiology studies the connection scientifically  as do neuropsychology and neuropsychiatry  Neurophilosophy is the interdisciplinary study of neuroscience and philosophy of mind  In this pursuit  neurophilosophers  such as Patricia Churchland                          Paul Churchland             and Daniel Dennett                          have focused primarily on the body rather than the mind  In this context  neuronal correlates may be viewed as causing consciousness  where consciousness can be thought of as an undefined property that depends upon this complex  adaptive  and highly interconnected biological system              However  it s unknown if discovering and characterizing neural correlates may eventually provide a theory of consciousness that can explain the first person experience of these  systems   and determine whether other systems of equal complexity lack such features 
The massive parallelism of neural networks allows redundant populations of neurons to mediate the same or similar percepts  Nonetheless  it is assumed that every subjective state will have associated neural correlates  which can be manipulated to artificially inhibit or induce the subject s experience of that conscious state  The growing ability of neuroscientists to manipulate neurons using methods from molecular biology in combination with optical tools             was achieved by the development of behavioral and organic models that are amenable to large scale genomic analysis and manipulation  Non human analysis such as this  in combination with imaging of the human brain  have contributed to a robust and increasingly predictive theoretical framework 

Arousal and content edit 
Midline structures in the brainstem and thalamus necessary to regulate the level of brain arousal  Small  bilateral lesions in many of these nuclei cause a global loss of consciousness             There are two common but distinct dimensions of the term consciousness              one involving arousal and states of consciousness and the other involving content of consciousness and conscious states  To be conscious of something  the brain must be in a relatively high state of arousal  sometimes called vigilance   whether awake or in REM sleep  Brain arousal level fluctuates in a circadian rhythm but these natural cycles may be influenced by lack of sleep  alcohol and other drugs  physical exertion  etc  Arousal can be measured behaviorally by the signal amplitude required to trigger a given reaction  for example  the sound level that causes a subject to turn and look toward the source   High arousal states involve conscious states that feature specific perceptual content  planning and recollection or even fantasy  Clinicians use scoring systems such as the Glasgow Coma Scale to assess the level of arousal in patients with impaired states of consciousness such as the comatose state  the persistent vegetative state  and the minimally conscious state  Here   state  refers to different amounts of externalized  physical consciousness  ranging from a total absence in coma  persistent vegetative state and general anesthesia  to a fluctuating  minimally conscious state  such as sleep walking and epileptic seizure             
Many nuclei with distinct chemical signatures in the thalamus  midbrain and pons must function for a subject to be in a sufficient state of brain arousal to experience anything at all  These nuclei therefore belong to the enabling factors for consciousness  Conversely it is likely that the specific content of any particular conscious sensation is mediated by particular neurons in the cortex and their associated satellite structures  including the amygdala  thalamus  claustrum and the basal ganglia 

Theoretical frameworks edit 
Different approaches toward resolving the mind body problem
A variety of approaches have been proposed  Most are either dualist or monist  Dualism maintains a rigid distinction between the realms of mind and matter  Monism maintains that there is only one unifying reality as in neutral or substance or essence  in terms of which everything can be explained 
Each of these categories contains numerous variants  The two main forms of dualism are substance dualism  which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics  and property dualism  which holds that mental properties involving conscious experience are fundamental properties  alongside the fundamental properties identified by a completed physics  The three main forms of monism are physicalism  which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way  idealism  which holds that only thought truly exists and matter is merely a representation of mental processes  and neutral monism  which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them  Psychophysical parallelism is a third possible alternative regarding the relation between mind and body  between interaction  dualism  and one sided action  monism              
Several philosophical perspectives that have sought to escape the problem by rejecting the mind body dichotomy have been developed  The historical materialism of Karl Marx and subsequent writers  itself a form of physicalism  held that consciousness was engendered by the material contingencies of one s environment              An explicit rejection of the dichotomy is found in French structuralism  and is a position that generally characterized post war Continental philosophy             
An ancient model of the mind known as the Five Aggregate Model  described in the Buddhist teachings  explains the mind as continuously changing sense impressions and mental phenomena              Considering this model  it is possible to understand that it is the constantly changing sense impressions and mental phenomena  i e   the mind  that experience analyze all external phenomena in the world as well as all internal phenomena including the body anatomy  the nervous system as well as the organ brain  This conceptualization leads to two levels of analyses   i  analyses conducted from a third person perspective on how the brain works  and  ii  analyzing the moment to moment manifestation of an individual s mind stream  analyses conducted from a first person perspective   Considering the latter  the manifestation of the mind stream is described as happening in every person all the time  even in a scientist who analyzes various phenomena in the world  including analyzing and hypothesizing about the organ brain             
Christian List argues that Benj Hellie s vertiginous question  i e  why an individual exists as themselves and not as someone else  and the existence of first personal facts  is evidence against physicalism  However  according to List  this is also evidence against other third personal metaphysical pictures  including standard versions of dualism              List also argues that the vertiginous question implies a  quadrilemma  for theories of consciousness  He claims that at most three of the following metaphysical claims can be true   first person realism    non solipsism    non fragmentation   and  one world    and thus one of these four must be rejected              List has proposed a model he calls the  many worlds theory of consciousness  in order to reconcile the subjective nature of consciousness without lapsing into solipsism             

Dualism edit 
The following is a very brief account of some contributions to the mind body problem 

Interactionism edit 
Main article  Interactionism  philosophy of mind 
The viewpoint of interactionism suggests that the mind and body are two separate substances  but that each can affect the other              This interaction between the mind and body was first put forward by the philosopher Ren  Descartes  Descartes believed that the mind was non physical and permeated the entire body  but that the mind and body interacted via the pineal gland                          This theory has changed throughout the years  and in the   th century its main adherents were the philosopher of science Karl Popper and the neurophysiologist John Carew Eccles                          A more recent and popular version of Interactionism is the viewpoint of emergentism              This perspective states that mental states are a result of the brain states  and that the mental events can then influence the brain  resulting in a two way communication between the mind and body             
The absence of an empirically identifiable meeting point between the non physical mind  if there is such a thing  and its physical extension  if there is such a thing  has been raised as a criticism of interactionalist dualism  This criticism has led many modern philosophers of mind to maintain that the mind is not something separate from the body              These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences  particularly in the fields of sociobiology  computer science  evolutionary psychology  and the neurosciences                                                 
Avshalom Elitzur has defended interactionism and has described himself as a  reluctant dualist   One argument Elitzur makes in favor of dualism is an argument from bafflement  According to Elitzur  a conscious being can conceive of a P zombie version of his herself  However  a P zombie cannot conceive of a version of itself that lacks corresponding qualia             

Epiphenomenalism edit 
Main article  Epiphenomenalism
The viewpoint of epiphenomenalism suggests that the physical brain can cause mental events in the mind  but that the mind cannot interact with the brain at all  stating that mental occurrences are simply a side effect of the brain s processes              This viewpoint explains that while one s body may react to them feeling joy  fear  or sadness  that the emotion does not cause the physical response  Rather  it explains that joy  fear  sadness  and all bodily reactions are caused by chemicals and their interaction with the body             

Psychophysical parallelism edit 
Main article  Psychophysical parallelism
The viewpoint of psychophysical parallelism suggests that the mind and body are entirely independent from one another  Furthermore  this viewpoint states that both mental and physical stimuli and reactions are experienced simultaneously by both the mind and body  however  there is no interaction nor communication between the two                         

Double aspectism edit 
Main article  Double aspectism
Double aspectism is an extension of psychophysical parallelism which also suggests that the mind and body cannot interact  nor can they be separated              Baruch Spinoza and Gustav Fechner were two of the notable users of double aspectism  however  Fechner later expanded upon it to form the branch of psychophysics in an attempt to prove the relationship of the mind and body             

Pre established harmony edit 
The viewpoint of pre established harmony is another offshoot of psychophysical parallelism which suggests that mental events and bodily events are separate and distinct  but that they are both coordinated by an external agent  an example of such an agent could be God              A notable adherent to the idea of pre established harmony is Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz in his theory of Monadology              His explanation of pre established harmony relied heavily upon God as the external agent who coordinated the mental and bodily events of all things in the beginning             
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz s theory of pre established harmony  French  harmonie pr  tablie  is a philosophical theory about causation under which every  substance  affects only itself  but all the substances  both bodies and minds  in the world nevertheless seem to causally interact with each other because they have been programmed by God in advance to  harmonize  with each other  Leibniz s term for these substances was  monads   which he described in a popular work  Monadology     as  windowless  
The concept of pre established harmony can be understood by considering an event with both seemingly mental and physical aspects  For example  consider saying  ouch  after stubbing one s toe  There are two general ways to describe this event  in terms of mental events  where the conscious sensation of pain caused one to say  ouch   and in terms of physical events  where neural firings in one s toe  carried to the brain  are what caused one to say  ouch    The main task of the mind body problem is figuring out how these mental events  the feeling of pain  and physical events  the nerve firings  relate  Leibniz s pre established harmony attempts to answer this puzzle  by saying that mental and physical events are not genuinely related in any causal sense  but only seem to interact due to psycho physical fine tuning 
Leibniz s theory is best known as a solution to the mind body problem of how mind can interact with the body  Leibniz rejected the idea of physical bodies affecting each other  and explained all physical causation in this way  
Under pre established harmony  the preprogramming of each mind must be extremely complex  since only it causes its own thoughts or actions  for as long as it exists  To appear to interact  each substance s  program  must contain a description of either the entire universe  or of how the object behaves at all times during all interactions that appear to occur 
An example 

An apple falls on Alice s head  apparently causing the experience of pain in her mind  In fact  the apple does not cause the pain the pain is caused by some previous state of Alice s mind  If Alice then seems to shake her hand in anger  it is not actually her mind that causes this  but some previous state of her hand 
Note that if a mind behaves as a windowless monad  there is no need for any other object to exist to create that mind s sense perceptions  leading to a solipsistic universe that consists only of that mind  Leibniz seems to admit this in his Discourse on Metaphysics  section     However  he claims that his principle of harmony  according to which God creates the best and most harmonious world possible  dictates that the perceptions  internal states  of each monad  expresses  the world in its entirety  and the world expressed by the monad actually exists  Although Leibniz says that each monad is  windowless   he also claims that it functions as a  mirror  of the entire created universe 
On occasion  Leibniz styled himself as  the author of the system of pre established harmony              
Immanuel Kant s professor Martin Knutzen regarded pre established harmony as  the pillow for the lazy mind              
In his sixth Metaphysical Meditation  Descartes talked about a  coordinated disposition of created things set up by God   shortly after having identified  nature in its general aspect  with God himself  His conception of the relationship between God and his normative nature actualized in the existing world recalls both the pre established harmony of Leibniz and the Deus sive Natura of Baruch Spinoza             

Occasionalism edit 
Main article  Occasionalism
The viewpoint of Occasionalism is another offshoot of psychophysical parallelism  however  the major difference is that the mind and body have some indirect interaction  Occasionalism suggests that the mind and body are separate and distinct  but that they interact through divine intervention              Nicolas Malebranche was one of the main contributors to this idea  using it as a way to address his disagreements with Descartes  view of the mind body problem              In Malebranche s occasionalism  he viewed thoughts as a wish for the body to move  which was then fulfilled by God causing the body to act             

Historical background edit 
The problem was popularized by Ren  Descartes in the   th century  which resulted in Cartesian dualism  also by pre Aristotelian philosophers                          in Avicennian philosophy              and in earlier Asian traditions 

The Buddha edit 
See also  Gautama Buddha  Buddhism and the body  and Prat tyasamutp da
The Buddha          B C E   founder of Buddhism  described the mind and the body as depending on each other in a way that two sheaves of reeds were to stand leaning against one another             and taught that the world consists of mind and matter which work together  interdependently  Buddhist teachings describe the mind as manifesting from moment to moment  one thought moment at a time as a fast flowing stream              The components that make up the mind are known as the five aggregates  i e   material form  feelings  perception  volition  and sensory consciousness   which arise and pass away continuously  The arising and passing of these aggregates in the present moment is described as being influenced by five causal laws  biological laws  psychological laws  physical laws  volitional laws  and universal laws              The Buddhist practice of mindfulness involves attending to this constantly changing mind stream 
Ultimately  the Buddha s philosophy is that both mind and forms are conditionally arising qualities of an ever changing universe in which  when nirv na is attained  all phenomenal experience ceases to exist              According to the anatt  doctrine of the Buddha  the conceptual self is a mere mental construct of an individual entity and is basically an impermanent illusion  sustained by form  sensation  perception  thought and consciousness              The Buddha argued that mentally clinging to any views will result in delusion and stress              since  according to the Buddha  a real self  conceptual self  being the basis of standpoints and views  cannot be found when the mind has clarity 

Plato edit 
See also  Plato and Theory of forms
Plato          B C E   believed that the material world is a shadow of a higher reality that consists of concepts he called Forms  According to Plato  objects in our everyday world  participate in  these Forms  which confer identity and meaning to material objects  For example  a circle drawn in the sand would be a circle only because it participates in the concept of an ideal circle that exists somewhere in the world of Forms  He argued that  as the body is from the material world  the soul is from the world of Forms and is thus immortal  He believed the soul was temporarily united with the body and would only be separated at death  when it  if pure  would return to the world of Forms  otherwise  reincarnation follows  Since the soul does not exist in time and space  as the body does  it can access universal truths  For Plato  ideas  or Forms  are the true reality  and are experienced by the soul  The body is for Plato empty in that it cannot access the abstract reality of the world  it can only experience shadows  This is determined by Plato s essentially rationalistic epistemology             

Aristotle edit 
Main article  Hylomorphism        Body soul hylomorphism
For Aristotle          BC  mind is a faculty of the soul                          Regarding the soul  he said 

It is not necessary to ask whether soul and body are one  just as it is not necessary to ask whether the wax and its shape are one  nor generally whether the matter of each thing and that of which it is the matter are one  For even if one and being are spoken of in several ways  what is properly so spoken of is the actuality         De Anima ii       b   
In the end  Aristotle saw the relation between soul and body as uncomplicated  in the same way that it is uncomplicated that a cubical shape is a property of a toy building block  The soul is a property exhibited by the body  one among many  Moreover  Aristotle proposed that when the body perishes  so does the soul  just as the shape of a building block disappears with destruction of the block             

Medieval Aristotelianism edit 
Working in the Aristotelian influenced tradition of Thomism  Thomas Aquinas              like Aristotle  believed that the mind and the body are one  like a seal and wax  therefore  it is pointless to ask whether or not they are one  However   referring to  mind  as  the soul   he asserted that the soul persists after the death of the body in spite of their unity  calling the soul  this particular thing   Since his view was primarily theological rather than philosophical  it is impossible to fit it neatly within either the category of physicalism or dualism             

Influences of Eastern monotheistic religions edit 
Main articles  Dualistic cosmology and Gnosticism
In religious philosophy of Eastern monotheism  dualism denotes a binary opposition of an idea that contains two essential parts  The first formal concept of a  mind body  split may be found in the divinity secularity dualism of the ancient Persian religion of Zoroastrianism around the mid fifth century BC  Gnosticism is a modern name for a variety of ancient dualistic ideas inspired by Judaism popular in the first and second century AD  These ideas later seem to have been incorporated into Galen s  tripartite soul                     that led into both the Christian sentiments             expressed in the later Augustinian theodicy and Avicenna s Platonism in Islamic Philosophy 

Descartes edit 
Main article  Ren  Descartes
Ren  Descartes             believed that mind exerted control over the brain via the pineal gland 

My view is that this gland is the principal seat of the soul  and the place in which all our thoughts are formed                     Ren  Descartes  Treatise of Man The  mechanism of our body is so constructed that simply by this gland s being moved in any way by the soul or by any other cause  it drives the surrounding spirits towards the pores of the brain  which direct them through the nerves to the muscles  and in this way the gland makes the spirits move the limbs                     Ren  Descartes  Passions of the Soul
His posited relation between mind and body is called Cartesian dualism or substance dualism  He held that mind was distinct from matter  but could influence matter  How such an interaction could be exerted remains a contentious issue 

Kant edit 
Main article  Immanuel Kant
For Immanuel Kant             beyond mind and matter there exists a world of a priori forms  which are seen as necessary preconditions for understanding  Some of these forms  space and time being examples  today seem to be pre programmed in the brain 

   whatever it is that impinges on us from the mind independent world does not come located in a spatial or a temporal matrix    The mind has two pure forms of intuition built into it to allow it to    organize this  manifold of raw intuition                      Andrew Brook  Kant s view of the mind and consciousness of self  Transcendental aesthetic
Kant views the mind body interaction as taking place through forces that may be of different kinds for mind and body             

Huxley edit 
Main article  Thomas Henry Huxley
For Thomas Henry Huxley             the conscious mind was a by product of the brain that has no influence upon the brain  a so called epiphenomenon 

On the epiphenomenalist view  mental events play no causal role  Huxley  who held the view  compared mental events to a steam whistle that contributes nothing to the work of a locomotive                     William Robinson  Epiphenomenalism
Whitehead edit 
Main article  Alfred North Whitehead
Alfred North Whitehead advocated a sophisticated form of panpsychism that has been called by David Ray Griffin panexperientialism             

Popper edit 
Main article  Karl Popper
For Karl Popper             there are three aspects of the mind body problem  the worlds of matter  mind  and of the creations of the mind  such as mathematics  In his view  the third world creations of the mind could be interpreted by the second world mind and used to affect the first world of matter  An example might be radio  an example of the interpretation of the third world  Maxwell s electromagnetic theory  by the second world mind to suggest modifications of the external first world 

The body mind problem is the question of whether and how our thought processes in World   are bound up with brain events in World       I would argue that the first and oldest of these attempted solutions is the only one that deserves to be taken seriously  namely   World   and World   interact  so that when someone reads a book or listens to a lecture  brain events occur that act upon the World   of the reader s or listener s thoughts  and conversely  when a mathematician follows a proof  his World   acts upon his brain and thus upon World    This  then  is the thesis of body mind interaction                     Karl Popper  Notes of a realist on the body mind problem
Ryle edit 
Main article  Gilbert Ryle
With his      book  The Concept of Mind  Gilbert Ryle  was seen to have put the final nail in the coffin of Cartesian dualism              

In the chapter  Descartes  Myth   Ryle introduces  the dogma of the Ghost in the machine  to describe the philosophical concept of the mind as an entity separate from the body I hope to prove that it is entirely false  and false not in detail but in principle  It is not merely an assemblage of particular mistakes  It is one big mistake and a mistake of a special kind  It is  namely  a category mistake 
Searle edit 
Main article  John Searle
For John Searle  b        the mind body problem is a false dichotomy  that is  mind is a perfectly ordinary aspect of the brain  Searle proposed biological naturalism in       

According to Searle then  there is no more a mind body problem than there is a macro micro economics problem  They are different levels of description of the same set of phenomena        But Searle is careful to maintain that the mental   the domain of qualitative experience and understanding   is autonomous and has no counterpart on the microlevel  any redescription of these macroscopic features amounts to a kind of evisceration                         Joshua Rust  John Searle

  Gendlin     b  p                 a   Hence the soul is as the hand is  forthe hand is a tool of tools  andthe nous is a form of forms                                                                      Aristotle now lets this aspect of nous and hand define a new term which he does not use anywhere else  so far as I know  The hand is  a tool of tools   The nous is a  form of forms   The hand and the soul are unique in this respect  Let us see further what this means 
Aristotle seems to say that the nous is a form  but on closer inspection we find that it is not  or at least not the usual kind  Nous is a maker of forms  A  form of forms  is like a tool of tools  like a living body s organ that makes tools  Nous is certainly not itself the sort of form that it makes  The hand is not a made tool  it would have to be made by yet another hand  In Greek  tool  and  organ  are the same word  So we see   In the phrase  tool of tools  the first use of the word stands for a living organ  the second for an artificially made tool  In II   he says  all natural bodies are tools  organs  of the soul s    both as food and as material from which to make tools   In English we would say that the hand is the organ of tools 


  Hicks       p         b             a    To sum up  the soul is in a manner the universe of things  which is made up of things sensible and things intelligible  and knowledge is in a manner identical with its object  the intelligible  sense with its object  the sensible  This statement calls for further explanation  Sense and knowledge  whether potential or actual  are distributed over things potential or actual  as the case may be  In the soul  again  the sensitive faculty and the cognitive faculty are potentially their respective objects  These objects must therefore exist in the soul  not indeed as concrete wholes  form and matter combined  which is impossible  it must be the forms of things which exist in the soul  Thus within the soul intellect is the form of forms  i e  of intelligible forms  and sense the form of sensibles  precisely as in the body the hand is the instrument of instruments  i e  the instrument by which other instruments are acquired
