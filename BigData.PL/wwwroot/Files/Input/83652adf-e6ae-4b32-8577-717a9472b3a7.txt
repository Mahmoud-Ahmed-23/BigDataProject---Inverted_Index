scientific article by Alan Turing

 
 Computing Machinery and Intelligence  is a seminal paper written by Alan Turing on the topic of artificial intelligence  The paper  published in      in Mind  was the first to introduce his concept of what is now known as the Turing test to the general public 
Turing s paper considers the question  Can machines think   Turing says that since the words  think  and  machine  cannot be clearly defined  we should  replace the question by another  which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words              To do this  he must first find a simple and unambiguous idea to replace the word  think   second he must explain exactly which  machines  he is considering  and finally  armed with these tools  he formulates a new question  related to the first  that he believes he can answer in the affirmative 


Turing s test edit 
The  standard interpretation  of the Turing Test  in which the interrogator is tasked with trying to determine which player is a computer and which is a human
Main article  Turing test 
Rather than trying to determine if a machine is thinking  Turing suggests we should ask if the machine can win a game  called the  Imitation Game   The original Imitation game  that Turing described  is a simple party game involving three players  Player A is a man  player B is a woman and player C  who plays the role of the interrogator  can be of either sex  In the Imitation Game  player C is unable to see either player A or player B  and knows them only as X and Y   and can communicate with them only through written notes or any other form that does not give away any details about their gender  By asking questions of player A and player B  player C tries to determine which of the two is the man and which is the woman  Player A s role is to trick the interrogator into making the wrong decision  while player B attempts to assist the interrogator in making the right one            
Turing proposes a variation of this game that involves the computer            

We now ask the question   What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game   Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman  These questions replace our original   Can machines think  
So the modified game becomes one that involves three participants in isolated rooms  a computer  which is being tested   a human  and a  human  judge  The human judge can converse with both the human and the computer by typing into a terminal  Both the computer and human try to convince the judge that they are the human  If the judge cannot consistently tell which is which  then the computer wins the game            
Researchers in the United Kingdom had been exploring  machine intelligence  for up to ten years prior to the founding of the field of artificial intelligence  AI  research in                  It was a common topic among the members of the Ratio Club  an informal group of British cybernetics and electronics researchers that included Alan Turing  Turing  in particular  had been running the notion of machine intelligence since at least      and one of the earliest known mentions of  computer intelligence  was made by him in                 
As Stevan Harnad notes             the question has become  Can machines do what we  as thinking entities  can do   In other words  Turing is no longer asking whether a machine can  think   he is asking whether a machine can act indistinguishably            from the way a thinker acts  This question avoids the difficult philosophical problem of pre defining the verb  to think  and focuses instead on the performance capacities that being able to think makes possible  and how a causal system can generate them 
Since Turing introduced his test  it has been both highly influential and widely criticised  and has become an important concept in the philosophy of artificial intelligence                         Some of its criticisms  such as John Searle s Chinese room  are themselves controversial                          Some have taken Turing s question to have been  Can a computer  communicating over a teleprinter  fool a person into believing it is human               but it seems clear that Turing was not talking about fooling people but about generating human cognitive capacity             

Digital machines edit 
See also  Turing machine and Church Turing thesis
Turing also notes that we need to determine which  machines  we wish to consider  He points out that a human clone  while man made  would not provide a very interesting example  Turing suggested that we should focus on the capabilities of digital machinery machines which manipulate the binary digits of   and    rewriting them into memory using simple rules  He gave two reasons 
First  there is no reason to speculate whether or not they can exist  They already did in      
Second  digital machinery is  universal   Turing s research into the foundations of computation had proved that a digital computer can  in theory  simulate the behaviour of any other digital machine  given enough memory and time   This is the essential insight of the Church Turing thesis and the universal Turing machine   Therefore  if any digital machine can  act like it is thinking   then every sufficiently powerful digital machine can  Turing writes   all digital computers are in a sense equivalent              
This allows the original question to be made even more specific  Turing now restates the original question as  Let us fix our attention on one particular digital computer C  Is it true that by modifying this computer to have an adequate storage  suitably increasing its speed of action  and providing it with an appropriate programme  C can be made to play satisfactorily the part of A in the imitation game  the part of B being taken by a man              
Hence  Turing states that the focus is not on  whether all digital computers would do well in the game nor whether the computers that are presently available would do well  but whether there are imaginable computers which would do well               What is more important is to consider the advancements possible in the state of our machines today regardless of whether we have the available resource to create one or not 

Nine common objections edit 
See also  Philosophy of artificial intelligence
Having clarified the question  Turing turned to answering it  he considered the following nine common objections  which include all the major arguments against artificial intelligence raised in the years since his paper was first published             

Religious Objection  This states that thinking is a function of man s immortal soul  therefore  a machine cannot think    In attempting to construct such machines   wrote Turing   we should not be irreverently usurping His power of creating souls  any more than we are in the procreation of children  rather we are  in either case  instruments of His will providing mansions for the souls that He creates  
  Heads in the Sand  Objection   The consequences of machines thinking would be too dreadful   Let us hope and believe that they cannot do so    This thinking is popular among intellectual people  as they believe superiority derives from higher intelligence and the possibility of being overtaken is a threat  as machines have efficient memory capacities and processing speed  machines exceeding the learning and knowledge capabilities are highly probable   This objection is a fallacious appeal to consequences  confusing what should not be with what can or cannot be  Wardrip Fruin      
The Mathematical Objection  This objection uses mathematical theorems  such as G del s incompleteness theorem  to show that there are limits to what questions a computer system based on logic can answer   Turing suggests that humans are too often wrong themselves and pleased at the fallibility of a machine    This argument would be made again by philosopher John Lucas in      and physicist Roger Penrose in       and later would be called Penrose Lucas argument              
Argument From Consciousness  This argument  suggested by Professor Geoffrey Jefferson in his      Lister Oration  acceptance speech for his      award of Lister Medal              states that  not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto because of thoughts and emotions felt  and not by the chance fall of symbols  could we agree that machine equals brain                Turing replies by saying that we have no way of knowing that any individual other than ourselves experiences emotions  and that therefore we should accept the test   He adds   I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness      b ut I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question  of whether machines can think     This argument  that a computer can t have conscious experiences or understanding  would be made in      by philosopher John Searle in his Chinese room argument  Turing s reply is now known as the  other minds reply   See also Can a machine have a mind  in the philosophy of AI              
Arguments from various disabilities  These arguments all have the form  a computer will never do X   Turing offers a selection Be kind  resourceful  beautiful  friendly  have initiative  have a sense of humour  tell right from wrong  make mistakes  fall in love  enjoy strawberries and cream  make someone fall in love with it  learn from experience  use words properly  be the subject of its own thought  have as much diversity of behaviour as a man  do something really new Turing notes that  no support is usually offered for these statements   and that they depend on naive assumptions about how versatile machines may be in the future  or are  disguised forms of the argument from consciousness   He chooses to answer a few of them 
Machines cannot make mistakes  He notes it s easy to program a machine to appear to make a mistake 
A machine cannot be the subject of its own thought  or can t be self aware   A program which can report on its internal states and processes  in the simple sense of a debugger program  can certainly be written  Turing asserts  a machine can undoubtably be its own subject matter  
A machine cannot have much diversity of behaviour  He notes that  with enough storage capacity  a computer can behave in an astronomical number of different ways 
Lady Lovelace s Objection  One of the most famous objections states that computers are incapable of originality  This is largely because  according to Ada Lovelace  machines are incapable of independent learning The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything  It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform  It can follow analysis  but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths              Turing suggests that Lovelace s objection can be reduced to the assertion that computers  can never take us by surprise  and argues that  to the contrary  computers could still surprise humans  in particular where the consequences of different facts are not immediately recognizable  Turing also argues that Lady Lovelace was hampered by the context from which she wrote  and if exposed to more contemporary scientific knowledge  it would become evident that the brain s storage is quite similar to that of a computer 
Argument from continuity in the nervous system  Modern neurological research has shown that the brain is not digital  Even though neurons fire in an all or nothing pulse  both the exact timing of the pulse and the probability of the pulse occurring have analog components  Turing acknowledges this  but argues that any analog system can be simulated to a reasonable degree of accuracy given enough computing power   Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus would make this argument against  the biological assumption  in                   
Argument from the informality of behaviour  This argument states that any system governed by laws will be predictable and therefore not truly intelligent  Turing replies by stating that this is confusing laws of behaviour with general rules of conduct  and that if on a broad enough scale  such as is evident in man  machine behaviour would become increasingly difficult to predict  He argues that  just because we can t immediately see what the laws are  does not mean that no such laws exist  He writes  we certainly know of no circumstances under which we could say   we have searched enough  There are no such laws      Hubert Dreyfus would argue in      that human reason and problem solving was not based on formal rules  but instead relied on instincts and awareness that would never be captured in rules  More recent AI research in robotics and computational intelligence attempts to find the complex rules that govern our  informal  and unconscious skills of perception  mobility and pattern matching  See Dreyfus  critique of AI               This rejoinder also includes the Turing s Wager argument 
Extra sensory perception  In       extra sensory perception was an active area of research and Turing chooses to give ESP the benefit of the doubt  arguing that conditions could be created in which mind reading would not affect the test  Turing admitted to  overwhelming statistical evidence  for telepathy  likely referring to early     s experiments by Samuel Soal  a member of the Society for Psychical Research             
Learning machines edit 
See also  Machine learning
In the final section of the paper Turing details his thoughts about the Learning Machine that could play the imitation game successfully 
Here Turing first returns to Lady Lovelace s objection that the machine can only do what we tell it to do and he likens it to a situation where a man  injects  an idea into the machine to which the machine responds and then falls off into quiescence  He extends on this thought by an analogy to an atomic pile of less than critical size  which is to be considered the machine  and an injected idea is to correspond to a neutron entering the pile from outside the pile  the neutron will cause a certain disturbance which eventually dies away  Turing then builds on that analogy and mentions that  if the size of the pile were to be sufficiently large  then a neutron entering the pile would cause a disturbance that would continue to increase until the whole pile were destroyed  the pile would be supercritical  Turing then asks the question as to whether this analogy of a super critical pile could be extended to a human mind and then to a machine  He concludes that such an analogy would indeed be suitable for the human mind with  There does seem to be one for the human mind  The majority of them seem to be  subcritical   i e   to correspond in this analogy to piles of sub critical size  An idea presented to such a mind will on average give rise to less than one idea in reply  A smallish proportion are supercritical  An idea presented to such a mind that may give rise to a whole  theory  consisting of secondary  tertiary and more remote ideas   He finally asks if a machine could be made to be supercritical 
Turing then mentions that the task of being able to create a machine that could play the imitation game is one of programming and he postulates that by the end of the century it will indeed be technologically possible to program a machine to play the game  He then mentions that in the process of trying to imitate an adult human mind it becomes important to consider the processes that lead to the adult mind being in its present state  which he summarizes as 

   The initial state of the mind  say at birth 
   The education to which it has been subjected 
   Other experience  not to be described as education  to which it has been subjected 
Given this process he asks whether it would be more appropriate to program a child s mind instead of an adult s mind and then subject the child mind to a period of education  He likens the child to a newly bought notebook and speculates that due to its simplicity it would be more easily programmed  The problem then is broken down into two parts  the programming of a child mind and its education process  He mentions that a child mind would not be expected as desired by the experimenter  programmer  at the first attempt  A learning process that involves a method of reward and punishment must be in place that will select desirable patterns in the mind  This whole process  Turing mentions  to a large extent is similar to that of evolution by natural selection where the similarities are 

Structure of the child machine   hereditary material
Changes of the child machine   mutations
Natural selection   judgment of the experimenter
Following this discussion Turing addresses certain specific aspects of the learning machine  

Nature of inherent complexity  The child machine could either be one that is as simple as possible  merely maintaining consistency with general principles  or the machine could be one with a complete system of logical inference programmed into it  This more complex system is explained by Turing as    would be such that the machines store would be largely occupied with definitions and propositions  The propositions would have various kinds of status  e g   well established facts  conjectures  mathematically proved theorems  statements given by an authority  expressions having the logical form of proposition but not belief value  Certain propositions may be described as  imperatives   The machine should be so constructed that as soon as an imperative is classed as  well established  the appropriate action automatically takes place   Despite this built in logic system the logical inference programmed in would not be one that is formal  rather it would be one that is more pragmatic  In addition the machine would build on its built in logic system by a method of  scientific induction  
Ignorance of the experimenter  An important feature of a learning machine that Turing points out is the ignorance of the teacher of the machines  internal state during the learning process  This is in contrast to a conventional discrete state machine where the objective is to have a clear understanding of the internal state of the machine at every moment during the computation  The machine will be seen to be doing things that we often cannot make sense of or something that we consider to be completely random  Turing mentions that this specific character bestows upon a machine a certain degree of what we consider to be intelligence  in that intelligent behaviour consists of a deviation from the complete determinism of conventional computation but only so long as the deviation does not give rise to pointless loops or random behaviour 
The importance of random behaviour  Though Turing cautions us of random behaviour he mentions that inculcating an element of randomness in a learning machine would be of value in a system  He mentions that this could be of value where there might be multiple correct answers or ones where it might be such that a systematic approach would investigate several unsatisfactory solutions to a problem before finding the optimal solution which would entail the systematic process inefficient  Turing also mentions that the process of evolution takes the path of random mutations in order to find solutions that benefit an organism but he also admits that in the case of evolution the systematic method of finding a solution would not be possible 
Turing concludes by speculating about a time when machines will compete with humans on numerous intellectual tasks and suggests tasks that could be used to make that start  Turing then suggests that abstract tasks such as playing chess could be a good place to start another method which he puts as    it is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that money can buy  and then teach it to understand and speak English   
An examination of the development in artificial intelligence that has followed reveals that the learning machine did take the abstract path suggested by Turing as in the case of Deep Blue  a chess playing computer developed by IBM and one which defeated the world champion Garry Kasparov  though  this too is controversial  and the numerous computer chess games which can outplay most amateurs              As for the second suggestion Turing makes  it has been likened by some authors as a call to finding a simulacrum of human cognitive development              Such attempts at finding the underlying algorithms by which children learn the features of the world around them are only beginning to be made
