Event resulting in major damage  destruction or death

Ruins from the      San Francisco earthquake  one of the worst disasters in the history of the United StatesA disaster is an event that causes serious harm to people  buildings  economies  or the environment  and the affected community cannot handle it alone                            better      source      needed      Natural disasters like avalanches  floods  earthquakes  and wildfires are caused by natural hazards             Human made disasters like oil spills  terrorist attacks and power outages are caused by people  Nowadays  it is hard to separate natural and human made disasters because human actions can make natural disasters worse                                   Climate change also affects how often disasters due to extreme weather hazards happen 
Disasters usually hit people in developing countries harder than people in wealthy countries  Over     of deaths from disasters happen in low income countries  and those countries lose a lot more money compared to richer countries  For example  the damage from natural disasters is    times greater in developing countries than in industrialized countries                        This is because low income countries often do not have well built buildings or good plans to handle emergencies 
To reduce the damage from disasters  it is important to be prepared and have fit for purpose infrastructure  Disaster risk reduction  DRR  aims to make communities stronger and better prepared to handle disasters  It focuses on actions to reduce risk before a disaster occurs  rather than on response and recovery after the event  DRR and climate change adaptation measures are similar in that they aim to reduce vulnerability of people and places to natural hazards 
When a disaster happens  the response includes actions like warning and evacuating people  rescuing those in danger  and quickly providing food  shelter  and medical care  The goal is to save lives and help people recover as quickly as possible  In some cases  national or international help may be needed to support recovery  This can happen  for example  through the work of humanitarian organizations 


Definitions edit 
Painting of the Cathedral and the Academy building after the Great Fire of Turku  by Gustaf Wilhelm Finnberg      
The UN defines a disaster as  a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society at any scale                                   It results from hazards in places where people live in exposed or vulnerable conditions  Some human failures make communities vulnerable to climate hazards  These are poor planning or development  or a lack of preparation             
Disasters are events that have an effect on people  A hazard that overwhelms or injures a community is considered a disaster              The international disaster database EM DAT defines a disaster as  a situation or event that overwhelms local capacity  necessitating a request for external assistance at the national or international level  it is an unforeseen and often sudden event that causes great damage  destruction and human suffering               The effects of a disaster include all human  material  economic and environmental losses and impacts                                 
UNDRO        defined a disaster in a more qualitative fashion as               an event  concentrated in time and space  in which a community undergoes severe danger and incurs such losses to its members and physical appurtenances that the social structure is disrupted and the fulfilment of all or some of the essential functions of the society is prevented   Like other definitions this looks beyond the social aspects of the disaster impacts  It also focuses on losses  This raises the need for emergency response as an aspect of the disaster              It does not set out quantitative thresholds or scales for damage  death  or injury      citation needed     
A study in      defined major disasters as conforming to the following criteria  based on the amount of deaths or damage                          At least     people dead  at least     people injured  or at least    million damage  This definition includes indirect losses of life caused after the initial onset of the disaster  These could be the effects of diseases such as cholera or dysentery arising from the disaster  This definition is still commonly used  However it is limited to the number of deaths  injuries  and damage in money terms             

Types edit 
The scale of a disaster matters  Small scale disasters only affect local communities but need help beyond the affected community  Large scale disasters affect wider society and need national or international help            
It is usual to divide disasters into natural or human made  Recently the divide between natural  man made and man accelerated disasters has become harder to draw                                    Some manufactured disasters such as smog and acid rain have been wrongly attributed to nature

Main article  Natural disaster
Disasters with links to natural hazards are commonly called natural disasters  However experts have questioned this term for a long time

This section is an excerpt from Natural disaster  edit 
Economic loss risk for six natural disasters  tropical cyclones  droughts  earthquakes  floods  landslides  and volcanoes 
A natural disaster is the very harmful impact on a society or community brought by natural phenomenon or hazard  Some examples of natural hazards include avalanches  droughts  earthquakes  floods  heat waves  landslides   including submarine landslides  tropical cyclones  volcanic activity and wildfires              Additional natural hazards include blizzards  dust storms  firestorms  hails  ice storms  sinkholes  thunderstorms  tornadoes and tsunamis              
A natural disaster can cause loss of life or damage property  It typically causes economic damage  How bad the damage is depends on how well people are prepared for disasters and how strong the buildings  roads  and other structures are              

Scholars have argued the term  natural disaster  is unsuitable and should be abandoned              Instead  the simpler term disaster could be used  At the same time  the type of hazard would be specified                                      A disaster happens when a natural or human made hazard impacts a vulnerable community  It results from the combination of the hazard and the exposure of a vulnerable society 
Unrelated to natural hazards edit 
See also  Hazard
Airplane crashes and terrorist attacks are examples of man made disasters  they kill and injure people  destroy and damage property  and cause pollution  The pictured example is the September    attacks in      at the World Trade Center in New York City 
Human made disasters are serious harmful events caused by human actions and social processes  Technological hazards also fall into this category  That is because they result in human instigated disasters  Human made hazards are sometimes called anthropogenic hazards                                  Examples include criminality  social unrest  crowd crushes  fires  transport accidents  industrial accidents  power outages  oil spills  terrorist attacks  and nuclear explosions nuclear radiation              Catastrophic climate change  nuclear war  and bioterrorism also fall into this category 
Climate change and environmental degradation are sometimes called socio natural hazards  These are hazards involving a combination of both natural and human factors                                   All disasters can be regarded as human made  because of failure to introduce the right emergency management measures             
Famines may be caused locally by drought  flood  fire or pestilence  In modern times there is plenty of food globally  Long lasting local shortages are generally due to government mismanagement  violent conflict  or an economic system that does not distribute food where needed             


Disasters without links to natural hazards


Disaster

Profile


Bioterrorism
The intentional release or dissemination of biological agents as a means of coercion


Civil unrest
A disturbance caused by a group of people that may include sit ins and other forms of obstructions  riots  sabotage and other forms of crime  and which is intended to be a demonstration to the public and the government  but can escalate into general chaos


Fire  urban 
Even with strict building fire codes  people still perish in fires


Hazardous material spills
The escape of solids  liquids  or gases that can harm people  other living organisms  property or the environment  from their intended controlled environment such as a container 


Nuclear and radiation accidents
An event involving the significant release of radioactivity to the environment or a reactor core meltdown and which leads to major undesirable consequences to people  the environment  or the facility


Power failure
Caused by summer or winter storms  lightning or construction equipment digging in the wrong location

Others edit 
Complex disasters  where there is no single root cause  are more common in developing countries  A specific hazard may also spawn a secondary disaster that increases the impact  A classic example is an earthquake that causes a tsunami  This results in coastal flooding  damaging a nuclear power plant on the coast  The Fukushima nuclear disaster is a case in point  Experts examine these cascading events to see how risks and impacts can amplify and spread  This is particularly important given the increase in climate risks                                       
Some researchers distinguish between recurring events like seasonal flooding and unpredictable one off events              Recurring events often carry an estimate of how often they occur  Experts call this the return period 

Impacts edit 
Further information  Natural disaster        Impacts
The effects of a disaster include all human  material  economic and environmental losses and impacts                                 
The Emergency Events Database  EM DAT  records statistics about disasters related to natural hazards  For       EM DAT recorded     disasters  which was higher than the    year average of                 

Economic losses edit 
Between      and      the total reported economic losses amounted to      billion  This figure is likely to be an underestimation  It is very challenging to measure the costs of disasters accurately  and many countries lack the resources and technical capacity to do so                                   Over the    year period from      to      losses were estimated at      trillion 

Human impacts edit 
In       natural hazard related disasters resulted in        fatalities and affected      million people              Whilst the number of deaths was much higher than the    year average of         the number affected was much lower than the    year average of       million 
According to a UN report      of deaths from hazards from      to      occurred in developing countries              These countries already have higher vulnerability and lower resilience to these events  which exacerbates the effects of the hazards 

Effects of climate change edit 
Hazards such as droughts  floods  and cyclones are naturally occurring phenomena              However  climate change has caused these hazards to become more unreliable  frequent and severe  They thus contribute to disaster risks  Countries contributing most to climate change are often at the lowest risk of feeling the consequences              As of       countries with the highest vulnerability per capita release the lowest amount of emissions per capita  and yet still experience the most heightened droughts and extreme precipitation             

Prevention and response edit 
Disaster risk reduction edit 
Disaster risk reduction progress score for some countries in       The score of   is best  Assessments include four indicators that reflect the degree to which countries have prioritized disaster risk reduction and the strengthening of relevant institutions             
This section is an excerpt from Disaster risk reduction  edit 
Disaster risk reduction aims to make disasters less likely to happen  The approach  also called DRR or disaster risk management  also aims to make disasters less damaging when they do occur  DRR aims to make communities stronger and better prepared to handle disasters  In technical terms  it aims to make them more resilient or less vulnerable  When DRR is successful  it makes communities less the vulnerable because it mitigates the effects of disasters              This means DRR can make risky events fewer and less severe  Climate change can increase climate hazards  So development efforts often consider DRR and climate change adaptation together              

It is possible to include DRR in almost all areas of development and humanitarian work  People from local communities  agencies or federal governments can all propose DRR strategies  DRR policies aim to  define goals and objectives across different timescales and with concrete targets  indicators and time frames                                   
Disaster response edit 
This section is an excerpt from Disaster response  edit 
Relief camp at Bhuj after the      Gujarat earthquake
Disaster response refers to the actions taken directly before  during  or immediately after a disaster  The objective is to save lives  ensure health and safety  and meet the subsistence needs of the people affected                                   It includes warning and evacuation  search and rescue  providing immediate assistance  assessing damage  continuing assistance  and the immediate restoration or construction of infrastructure  An example of this would be building provisional storm drains or diversion dams  Emergency response aims to provide immediate help to keep people alive  improve their health and support their morale  It can involve specific but limited aid  such as helping refugees with transport  temporary shelter  and food  Or it can involve establishing semi permanent settlements in camps and other locations  It may also involve initial repairs to damage to infrastructure  or diverting it 

The response phase focuses on keeping people safe  preventing the next disasters and meeting people s basic needs until more permanent and sustainable solutions are available  The governments where the disaster has happened have the main responsibility for addressing these needs  Humanitarian organisations are often present in this phase of the disaster management cycle  This is particularly so in countries where the government does not have the resources for a full response 
Etymology edit 
The word disaster is derived from Middle French d sastre which comes from Old Italian disastro  This in turn comes from the Ancient Greek pejorative prefix       dus    bad              and        aster    star               So the word disaster   bad star  in Greek  comes from an astrological sense of a calamity blamed on the position of planets
