In       S  Graphics introduced the S    C     which its designers named after the Porsche     as an indication of the performance increase it promised              The   C    spawned a variety of imitators  by       all major PC graphics chip makers had added  D acceleration support to their chips              Fixed function Windows accelerators surpassed expensive general purpose graphics coprocessors in Windows performance  and such coprocessors faded from the PC market 
Throughout the     s   D GUI acceleration evolved  As manufacturing capabilities improved  so did the level of integration of graphics chips  Additional application programming interfaces  APIs  arrived for a variety of tasks  such as Microsoft s WinG graphics library for Windows   x  and their later DirectDraw interface for hardware acceleration of  D games in Windows    and later 
In the early  and mid     s  real time  D graphics became increasingly common in arcade  computer  and console games  which led to increasing public demand for hardware accelerated  D graphics  Early examples of mass market  D graphics hardware can be found in arcade system boards such as the Sega Model    Namco System     and Sega Model    and the fifth generation video game consoles such as the Saturn  PlayStation  and Nintendo     Arcade systems such as the Sega Model   and SGI Onyx based Namco Magic Edge Hornet Simulator in      were capable of hardware T amp L  transform  clipping  and lighting  years before appearing in consumer graphics cards                          Another early example is the Super FX chip  a RISC based on cartridge graphics chip used in some SNES games  notably Doom and Star Fox  Some systems used DSPs to accelerate transformations  Fujitsu  which worked on the Sega Model   arcade system              began working on integrating T amp L into a single LSI solution for use in home computers in                   the Fujitsu Pinolite  the first  D geometry processor for personal computers  released in                   The first hardware T amp L GPU on home video game consoles was the Nintendo    s Reality Coprocessor  released in                   In       Mitsubishi released the  Dpro  MP  a GPU capable of transformation and lighting  for workstations and Windows NT desktops              ATi used it for its FireGL      graphics card  released in                  
The term  GPU  was coined by Sony in reference to the    bit Sony GPU  designed by Toshiba  in the PlayStation video game console  released in                  
In the PC world  notable failed attempts for low cost  D graphics chips included the S  ViRGE  ATI Rage  and Matrox Mystique  These chips were essentially previous generation  D accelerators with  D features bolted on  Many were pin compatible with the earlier generation chips for ease of implementation and minimal cost  Initially   D graphics were possible only with discrete boards dedicated to accelerating  D functions  and lacking  D graphical user interface  GUI  acceleration entirely  such as the PowerVR and the  dfx Voodoo  However  as manufacturing technology continued to progress  video   D GUI acceleration  and  D functionality were all integrated into one chip  Rendition s Verite chipsets were among the first to do this well  In       Rendition collaborated with Hercules and Fujitsu on a  Thriller Conspiracy  project which combined a Fujitsu FXG   Pinolite geometry processor with a V rit  V     core to create a graphics card with a full T amp L engine years before Nvidia s GeForce      This card  designed to reduce the load placed upon the system s CPU  never made it to market      citation needed      NVIDIA RIVA     was one of the first consumer facing GPU integrated  D processing unit and  D processing unit on a chip 
OpenGL was introduced in the early     s by Silicon Graphics as a professional graphics API  with proprietary hardware support for  D rasterization  In       Microsoft acquired Softimage  the dominant CGI movie production tool used for early CGI movie hits like Jurassic Park  Terminator   and Titanic  With that deal came a strategic relationship with SGI and a commercial license of their OpenGL libraries  enabling Microsoft to port the API to the Windows NT OS but not to the upcoming release of Windows     Although it was little known at the time  SGI had contracted with Microsoft to transition from Unix to the forthcoming Windows NT OS  the deal which was signed in      was not announced publicly until       In the intervening period  Microsoft worked closely with SGI to port OpenGL to Windows NT  In that era  OpenGL had no standard driver model for competing hardware accelerators to compete on the basis of support for higher level  D texturing and lighting functionality  In      Microsoft announced DirectX     and support for gaming in the forthcoming Windows    consumer OS  In      Microsoft announced the acquisition of UK based Rendermorphics Ltd and the Direct D driver model for the acceleration of consumer  D graphics  The Direct D driver model shipped with DirectX     in       It included standards and specifications for  D chip makers to compete to support  D texture  lighting and Z buffering  ATI  which was later to be acquired by AMD  began development on the first Direct D GPUs  Nvidia quickly pivoted from a failed deal with Sega  in      to aggressively embracing support for Direct D  In this era Microsoft merged their internal Direct D and OpenGL teams and worked closely with SGI to unify driver standards for both industrial and consumer  D graphics hardware accelerators   Microsoft ran annual events for  D chip makers called  Meltdowns  to test their  D hardware and drivers to work both with Direct D and OpenGL  It was during this period of strong Microsoft influence over  D standards that  D accelerator cards moved beyond being simple rasterizers to become more powerful general purpose processors as support for hardware accelerated texture mapping  lighting  Z buffering and compute created the modern GPU  During this period the same Microsoft team responsible for Direct D and OpenGL driver standardization introduced their own Microsoft  D chip design called Talisman  Details of this era are documented extensively in the books  Game of X  v   and v   by Russel Demaria   Renegades of the Empire  by Mike Drummond   Opening the Xbox  by Dean Takahashi and  Masters of Doom  by David Kushner   The Nvidia GeForce      also known as NV    was the first consumer level card with hardware accelerated T amp L  While the OpenGL API provided software support for texture mapping and lighting  the first  D hardware acceleration for these features arrived with the first Direct D accelerated consumer GPU s

NVIDIA released the GeForce      marketed as the world s first GPU  integrating transform and lighting engines for advanced  D graphics rendering  Nvidia was first to produce a chip capable of programmable shading  the GeForce    Each pixel could now be processed by a short program that could include additional image textures as inputs  and each geometric vertex could likewise be processed by a short program before it was projected onto the screen  Used in the Xbox console  this chip competed with the one in the PlayStation    which used a custom vector unit for hardware accelerated vertex processing  commonly referred to as VU  VU    The earliest incarnations of shader execution engines used in Xbox were not general purpose and could not execute arbitrary pixel code  Vertices and pixels were processed by different units  which had their resources  with pixel shaders having tighter constraints  because they execute at higher frequencies than vertices   Pixel shading engines were more akin to a highly customizable function block and did not  run  a program  Many of these disparities between vertex and pixel shading were not addressed until the Unified Shader Model 
In October       with the introduction of the ATI Radeon       also known as R      the world s first Direct D     accelerator  pixel and vertex shaders could implement looping and lengthy floating point math  and were quickly becoming as flexible as CPUs  yet orders of magnitude faster for image array operations  Pixel shading is often used for bump mapping  which adds texture to make an object look shiny  dull  rough  or even round or extruded             
With the introduction of the Nvidia GeForce   series and new generic stream processing units  GPUs became more generalized computing devices  Parallel GPUs are making computational inroads against the CPU  and a subfield of research  dubbed GPU computing or GPGPU for general purpose computing on GPU  has found applications in fields as diverse as machine learning              oil exploration  scientific image processing  linear algebra              statistics               D reconstruction  and stock options pricing  GPGPU was the precursor to what is now called a compute shader  e g  CUDA  OpenCL  DirectCompute  and actually abused the hardware to a degree by treating the data passed to algorithms as texture maps and executing algorithms by drawing a triangle or quad with an appropriate pixel shader      clarification needed      This entails some overheads since units like the scan converter are involved where they are not needed  nor are triangle manipulations even a concern except to invoke the pixel shader       clarification needed     
Nvidia s CUDA platform  first introduced in                   was the earliest widely adopted programming model for GPU computing  OpenCL is an open standard defined by the Khronos Group that allows for the development of code for both GPUs and CPUs with an emphasis on portability              OpenCL solutions are supported by Intel  AMD  Nvidia  and ARM  and according to a report in      by Evans Data  OpenCL had become the second most popular HPC tool

In       AMD released the successor to their Graphics Core Next  GCN  microarchitecture instruction set  Dubbed RDNA  the first product featuring it was the Radeon RX      series of video cards              The company announced that the successor to the RDNA microarchitecture would be incremental  a  refresh    AMD unveiled the Radeon RX      series  its RDNA   graphics cards with support for hardware accelerated ray tracing              The product series  launched in late       consisted of the RX       RX      XT  and RX      XT                          The RX      XT  which is based on Navi     was launched in early                  
The PlayStation   and Xbox Series X and Series S were released in       they both use GPUs based on the RDNA   microarchitecture with incremental improvements and different GPU configurations in each system s implementation                                     
Intel first entered the GPU market in the late     s  but produced lackluster  D accelerators compared to the competition at the time  Rather than attempting to compete with the high end manufacturers Nvidia and ATI AMD  they began integrating Intel Graphics Technology GPUs into motherboard chipsets  beginning with the Intel     for the Pentium III  and later into CPUs  They began with the Intel Atom  Pineview  laptop processor in       continuing in      with desktop processors in the first generation of the Intel Core line and with contemporary Pentiums and Celerons  This resulted in a large nominal market share  as the majority of computers with an Intel CPU also featured this embedded graphics processor  These generally lagged behind discrete processors in performance  Intel re entered the discrete GPU market in      with its Arc series  which competed with the then current GeForce    series and Radeon      series cards at competitive prices      citation needed

Modern smartphones use mostly Adreno GPUs from Qualcomm  PowerVR GPUs from Imagination Technologies  and Mali GPUs from ARM 

Computational functions edit 
Modern GPUs have traditionally used most of their transistors to do calculations related to  D computer graphics  In addition to the  D hardware  today s GPUs include basic  D acceleration and framebuffer capabilities  usually with a VGA compatibility mode   Newer cards such as AMD ATI HD     HD     lack dedicated  D acceleration  it is emulated by  D hardware  GPUs were initially used to accelerate the memory intensive work of texture mapping and rendering polygons  Later  units     clarification needed      were added to accelerate geometric calculations such as the rotation and translation of vertices into different coordinate systems  Recent developments in GPUs include support for programmable shaders which can manipulate vertices and textures with many of the same operations that are supported by CPUs  oversampling and interpolation techniques to reduce aliasing  and very high precision color spaces 
Several factors of GPU construction affect the performance of the card for real time rendering  such as the size of the connector pathways in the semiconductor device fabrication  the clock signal frequency  and the number and size of various on chip memory caches  Performance is also affected by the number of streaming multiprocessors  SM  for NVidia GPUs  or compute units  CU  for AMD GPUs  or Xe cores for Intel discrete GPUs  which describe the number of on silicon processor core units within the GPU chip that perform the core calculations  typically working in parallel with other SM CUs on the GPU  GPU performance is typically measured in floating point operations per second  FLOPS   GPUs in the     s and     s typically deliver performance measured in teraflops  TFLOPS   This is an estimated performance measure  as other factors can affect the actual display rate

Dedicated graphics processing unit edit 
See also  Video card
Dedicated graphics processing units uses RAM that is dedicated to the GPU rather than relying on the computer s main system memory  This RAM is usually specially selected for the expected serial workload of the graphics card  see GDDR   Sometimes systems with dedicated discrete GPUs were called  DIS  systems as opposed to  UMA  systems  see next section              
Dedicated GPUs are not necessarily removable  nor does it necessarily interface with the motherboard in a standard fashion  The term  dedicated  refers to the fact that graphics cards have RAM that is dedicated to the card s use  not to the fact that most dedicated GPUs are removable  Dedicated GPUs for portable computers are most commonly interfaced through a non standard and often proprietary slot due to size and weight constraints  Such ports may still be considered PCIe or AGP in terms of their logical host interface  even if they are not physically interchangeable with their counterparts 
Graphics cards with dedicated GPUs typically interface with the motherboard by means of an expansion slot such as PCI Express  PCIe  or Accelerated Graphics Port  AGP   They can usually be replaced or upgraded with relative ease  assuming the motherboard is capable of supporting the upgrade  A few graphics cards still use Peripheral Component Interconnect  PCI  slots  but their bandwidth is so limited that they are generally used only when a PCIe or AGP slot is not available 
Technologies such as Scan Line Interleave by  dfx  SLI and NVLink by Nvidia and CrossFire by AMD allow multiple GPUs to draw images simultaneously for a single screen  increasing the processing power available for graphics  These technologies  however  are increasingly uncommon  most games do not fully use multiple GPUs  as most users cannot afford them                                      Multiple GPUs are still used on supercomputers  like in Summit   on workstations to accelerate video  processing multiple videos at once                                      and  D rendering              for VFX              GPGPU workloads and for simulations              and in AI to expedite training  as is the case with Nvidia s lineup of DGX workstations and servers  Tesla GPUs  and Intel s Ponte Vecchio GPUs

Integrated graphics processing units  IGPU   integrated graphics  shared graphics solutions  integrated graphics processors  IGP   or unified memory architectures  UMA  use a portion of a computer s system RAM rather than dedicated graphics memory  IGPs can be integrated onto a motherboard as part of its northbridge chipset              or on the same die  integrated circuit  with the CPU  like AMD APU or Intel HD Graphics   On certain motherboards              AMD s IGPs can use dedicated sideport memory  a separate fixed block of high performance memory that is dedicated for use by the GPU  As of early          update      computers with integrated graphics account for about     of all PC shipments                  needs update      They are less costly to implement than dedicated graphics processing  but tend to be less capable  Historically  integrated processing was considered unfit for  D games or graphically intensive programs but could run less intensive programs such as Adobe Flash  Examples of such IGPs would be offerings from SiS and VIA circa                   However  modern integrated graphics processors such as AMD Accelerated Processing Unit and Intel Graphics Technology  HD  UHD  Iris  Iris Pro  Iris Plus  and Xe LP  can handle  D graphics or low stress  D graphics 
Since GPU computations are memory intensive  integrated processing may compete with the CPU for relatively slow system RAM  as it has minimal or no dedicated video memory  IGPs use system memory with bandwidth up to a current maximum of          GB s  whereas a discrete graphics card may have a bandwidth of more than           GB s between its VRAM and GPU core  This memory bus bandwidth can limit the performance of the GPU  though multi channel memory can mitigate this deficiency              Older integrated graphics chipsets lacked hardware transform and lighting  but newer ones include it                         
On systems with  Unified Memory Architecture   UMA   including modern AMD processors with integrated graphics              modern Intel processors with integrated graphics              Apple processors  the PS  and Xbox Series  among others   the CPU cores and the GPU block share the same pool of RAM and memory address space  This allows the system to dynamically allocate memory between the CPU cores and the GPU block based on memory needs  without needing a large static split of the RAM  and thanks to zero copy transfers  removes the need for either copying data over a bus  computing  between physically separate RAM pools or copying between separate address spaces on a single physical pool of RAM  allowing more efficient transfer of data

Hybrid GPUs compete with integrated graphics in the low end desktop and notebook markets  The most common implementations of this are ATI s HyperMemory and Nvidia s TurboCache 
Hybrid graphics cards are somewhat more expensive than integrated graphics  but much less expensive than dedicated graphics cards  They share memory with the system and have a small dedicated memory cache  to make up for the high latency of the system RAM  Technologies within PCI Express make this possible  While these solutions are sometimes advertised as having as much as          MB of RAM  this refers to how much can be shared with the system memory 

Stream processing and general purpose GPUs  GPGPU  edit 
Main articles  GPGPU and Stream processing
It is common to use a general purpose graphics processing unit  GPGPU  as a modified form of stream processor  or a vector processor   running compute kernels  This turns the massive computational power of a modern graphics accelerator s shader pipeline into general purpose computing power  In certain applications requiring massive vector operations  this can yield several orders of magnitude higher performance than a conventional CPU  The two largest discrete  see  Dedicated graphics processing unit  above  GPU designers  AMD and Nvidia  are pursuing this approach with an array of applications  Both Nvidia and AMD teamed with Stanford University to create a GPU based client for the Folding home distributed computing project for protein folding calculations  In certain circumstances  the GPU calculates forty times faster than the CPUs traditionally used by such applications                         
GPGPUs can be used for many types of embarrassingly parallel tasks including ray tracing  They are generally suited to high throughput computations that exhibit data parallelism to exploit the wide vector width SIMD architecture of the GPU 
GPU based high performance computers play a significant role in large scale modelling  Three of the ten most powerful supercomputers in the world take advantage of GPU acceleration             
GPUs support API extensions to the C programming language such as OpenCL and OpenMP  Furthermore  each GPU vendor introduced its own API which only works with their cards  AMD APP SDK from AMD  and CUDA from Nvidia  These allow functions called compute kernels to run on the GPU s stream processors  This makes it possible for C programs to take advantage of a GPU s ability to operate on large buffers in parallel  while still using the CPU when appropriate  CUDA was the first API to allow CPU based applications to directly access the resources of a GPU for more general purpose computing without the limitations of using a graphics API      citation needed     
Since      there has been interest in using the performance offered by GPUs for evolutionary computation in general  and for accelerating the fitness evaluation in genetic programming in particular  Most approaches compile linear or tree programs on the host PC and transfer the executable to the GPU to be run  Typically a performance advantage is only obtained by running the single active program simultaneously on many example problems in parallel  using the GPU s SIMD architecture              However  substantial acceleration can also be obtained by not compiling the programs  and instead transferring them to the GPU  to be interpreted there              Acceleration can then be obtained by either interpreting multiple programs simultaneously  simultaneously running multiple example problems  or combinations of both  A modern GPU can simultaneously interpret hundreds of thousands of very small programs 

External GPU  eGPU  edit 
An external GPU is a graphics processor located outside of the housing of the computer  similar to a large external hard drive  External graphics processors are sometimes used with laptop computers  Laptops might have a substantial amount of RAM and a sufficiently powerful central processing unit  CPU   but often lack a powerful graphics processor  and instead have a less powerful but more energy efficient on board graphics chip  On board graphics chips are often not powerful enough for playing video games  or for other graphically intensive tasks  such as editing video or  D animation rendering 
Therefore  it is desirable to attach a GPU to some external bus of a notebook  PCI Express is the only bus used for this purpose  The port may be  for example  an ExpressCard or mPCIe port  PCIe     up to   or          Gbit s respectively   a Thunderbolt       or   port  PCIe     up to         or         Gbit s respectively   a USB  port with Thunderbolt compatibility  or an OCuLink port  Those ports are only available on certain notebook systems              eGPU enclosures include their own power supply  PSU   because powerful GPUs can consume hundreds of watts             

Energy efficiency edit 
This section is an excerpt from Performance per watt   GPU efficiency  edit 
Graphics processing units  GPU  have continued to increase in energy usage  while CPUs designers have recently     when       focused on improving performance per watt   High performance GPUs may draw large amount of power  therefore intelligent techniques are required to manage GPU power consumption  Measures like  DMark     score per watt can help identify more efficient GPUs              However that may not adequately incorporate efficiency in typical use  where much time is spent doing less demanding tasks             
With modern GPUs  energy usage is an important constraint on the maximum computational capabilities that can be achieved  GPU designs are usually highly scalable  allowing the manufacturer to put multiple chips on the same video card  or to use multiple video cards that work in parallel  Peak performance of any system is essentially limited by the amount of power it can draw and the amount of heat it can dissipate  Consequently  performance per watt of a GPU design translates directly into peak performance of a system that uses that design 

Since GPUs may also be used for some general purpose computation  sometimes their performance is measured in terms also applied to CPUs  such as FLOPS per watt 
Sales edit 
In             million GPUs were shipped globally and the forecast for      was       million  However  by the third quarter of       shipments of integrated GPUs totaled around      million units  down     year over year                    needs update
