							It s an odd quirk of history that  on the first day of his ill fated presidential campaign in March       Robert F Kennedy chose to talk to his audience about the limitations of gross domestic product   GDP    the world s headline indicator of economic progress ContentsThe goods  the bads  and the missingThe trouble with GDP  Historical flawsNew challenges to the value of GDPChange behaviour  not just what we measureGDP alternatives in practiceA potential gamechanger It s time to abandon this  GDP fetish 



It seems stranger still that  despite the power of that iconic speech  growth in GDP remains to this day the predominant measure of progress across the world  Economic success is measured by it  Government policy is assessed by it  Political survival hangs on it 



Kennedy s speech inspired a host of critiques  It has been quoted by presidents  prime ministers and Nobel laureates  Yet GDP itself has survived until now  more or less unscathed  But amid ever louder concerns about the failure of national economies to tackle the multiple threats posed by climate change  spiralling energy costs  insecure employment and widening levels of inequality  the need to define and measure progress in a different way now looks as unarguable as it is urgent 



The goods  the bads  and the missing



In simple terms  GDP is a measure of the size of a country s economy  how much is produced  how much is earned  and how much is spent on goods and services across the nation  The monetary total  whether in dollars or euros  yuan or yen  is then adjusted for any general increase in prices to give a measure of  real  economic growth over time  When governments adopt policies to pursue economic growth  this is how those policies are evaluated 



Since       GDP has been the headline measure in a complex system of national accounts overseen by the United Nations  Developed during the second world war  these accounts were motivated in part by the need to determine how much governments could afford to spend on the war effort 











This story is part of Conversation InsightsThe Insights team generates long form journalism and is working with academics from different backgrounds who have been engaged in projects to tackle societal and scientific challenges 







But in measuring the monetary value of economic activity  GDP can incorporate many of the  bads  that detract from our quality of life  War  pollution  crime  prostitution  traffic congestion  disasters like wildfires and the destruction of nature   all can have a positive impact on GDP  Yet they cannot really be construed as components of economic success 



At the same time  there are numerous aspects of our lives that simply go missing from this conventional account  The inequality in our societies  The contributions from unpaid work  The labour of those who care for the young and the elderly at home or in the community  The depletion of natural resources or biodiversity  And the value of data and many digital services 



What lies outside the market  including public services funded out of taxation  remains unmeasured in a metric of monetary exchange  Kennedy was blunt    GDP  measures everything  in short  except that which makes life worthwhile   









It s a sentiment that has resonance half a century later  In a striking encounter during the Brexit debate  a UK academic was trying to convey to a public meeting the dangers of leaving the EU  The impact on GDP would dwarf any savings from the UK s contributions to the EU budget  he told the audience   That s your bloody GDP   shouted a woman in the crowd   It s not ours  



This sense of an indicator out of touch with reality may be one of the reasons there is momentum for reform  When GDP conceals crucial differences between the richest and the poorest in society  it inevitably says little about the prospects for ordinary people 



But there are other reasons too for an emerging change of heart  The pursuit of GDP growth as a policy goal  and the impact that has on government  business and personal decision making  has accompanied increasing devastation of the natural world  a loss of forests and habitats  the destabilisation of the climate  and near meltdowns of the world s financial markets  At the same time  GDP has become a poor measure of the technological transformation of society 



Its tenacity as a measure of progress  despite these well known limitations  arises from factors which are on the one hand technocratic  and on the other sociological  As the headline measure in a sophisticated system of national accounts  GDP has a technocratic convenience and analytical elegance that remains unsurpassed by many alternative measures  Its authority arises from its ability to be simultaneously a measure of production output  consumption expenditure and income in the economy 



Despite this complex framework  it also offers the deceptive simplicity of a single headline figure which appears to be directly comparable from year to year and across nations  based on the simple  if inadequate  idea that more economic activity necessarily leads to a better life 



However  the combined technical authority and political usefulness of this idea has led to  path dependence  and forms of social lock in that are difficult to address without significant effort  Think of switching to an alternative as being like switching from driving on the left to the right hand side of the road 



Yet what we measure matters  And while we re busy looking in the wrong direction  as Kennedy pointed out  bad things can happen  Kennedy s campaign   and his critique of GDP   was cut cruelly short on June         when he was fatally wounded by an assassin s bullet  More than half a century later  his call for reform of how we assess progress  or its absence  has never been stronger 



The trouble with GDP  Historical flaws



The way societies have understood and measured progress has changed considerably over the centuries  Measurement of  the economy  as a whole is a relatively modern    th century concept  beginning with efforts by statisticians and economists such as Colin Clark and Simon Kuznets in the     s and     s to understand the impact of financial crisis and depression 



Kuznets  now best known for his curve describing the relationship between GDP and income inequality  was particularly concerned to develop a measure of economic welfare rather than just activity  For example  he argued for omitting expenditures that were unwelcome necessities rather than services or goods consumers actively wanted   such as defence spending 



However  the second world war overtook and absorbed these earlier notions of a single measure of economic welfare  resulting in what first became modern gross national product  GNP   and then GDP  The imperative   set out on the Allied side by John Maynard Keynes in his      pamphlet How to Pay for the War   was measuring productive capacity  and the reduction in consumption required to have enough resources to support the military effort  Economic welfare was a peacetime concern 



Post war  unsurprisingly  American and British economists such as Milton Gilbert  James Meade and Richard Stone took the lead in codifying these statistical definitions through the UN   and its process for agreeing and formalising definitions in the system of national accounts  SNA  is still in place today  However  since at least the     s  some important inadequacies of both the SNA and GDP have been widely known and debated 



Indeed  as long ago as       Margaret Reid published her book Economics of Household Production  which pointed out the need to include unpaid work in the home when thinking about economically useful activity 



The question of whether and how to measure the household and informal sectors was debated during the     s   particularly as this makes up a larger share of activity in low income countries   but was omitted until some countries  including the UK  started to create household satellite accounts around       Omitting unpaid work meant  for instance  that the UK s increased productivity growth between the     s and     s was then overstated  because it in part reflected the inclusion of many more women in paid work whose contributions had previously been invisible to the national GDP metric 



Another longstanding and widely understood failure of GDP is not including environmental externalities and the depletion of natural capital  The metric takes incomplete account of many activities that do not have market prices  and ignores the additional social costs of pollution  greenhouse gas emissions and similar outputs associated with economic activities 



What s more  the depletion or loss of assets such as natural resources  or indeed buildings and infrastructure lost in disasters  boosts GDP in the short term because these resources are used in economic activities  or because there is a surge in construction after a disaster  Yet the long term opportunity costs are never counted  This massive shortcoming was widely discussed at the time of landmark publications such as the      Limits to Growth report from the Club of Rome  and the      Brundtland Report from the World Commission on Environment and Development 



As with household and informal activity  there has been recent progress in accounting for nature  with the development of the System of Environmental Economic Accounting  SEEA  and publication of regular  but separate  statistics on natural capital in a number of countries  The UK has again been a pioneer in this area  while the US recently announced it would start following this approach too 



New challenges to the value of GDP



Other  perhaps less obvious failings of GDP have become more prominent recently  Digitisation of the economy has transformed the way many people spend their days in work and leisure  and the way many businesses operate  yet these transformations are not apparent in official statistics 



Measuring innovation has always been tricky  because new goods or improved quality need to be incorporated into observable prices and quantities   and what is the metric for a unit of software or management consultancy  But it is harder now because many digital services are  free  at point of use  or have the features of public goods in that many people can use them at the same time  or are intangible  For example  data is without doubt improving the productivity of companies that know how to use it to improve their services and produce goods more effectively   but how should a dataset s value  or potential value  to society  as opposed to a big tech company  be estimated 



Recent work looking at the price of telecommunications services in the UK has estimated that output growth in this sector since      has ranged anywhere from about    to      depending on how the price index used to convert market prices to real  inflation adjusted  prices takes account of the economic value of our rapidly growing use of data  Similarly  it is not obvious how to incorporate advertising funded  free  search  crypto currencies and NFTs in the measurement framework

A key limitation of GDP  particularly in terms of its use as an indicator of social progress  is that it offers no systematic account of the distribution of incomes  It is entirely possible for average or aggregate GDP to be rising  even as a significant proportion of the population find themselves worse off 



Ordinary incomes have stagnated or fallen in recent decades even as the richest in society have become wealthier  In the US  for example  Thomas Piketty and his colleagues have shown that in the period between      and       the top        of society saw their incomes grow by an average of    per year  Income for the poorest    of society fell in real terms 



Given these many issues  it might seem surprising that the debate about  Beyond GDP  is only now   possibly   turning into actions to change the official statistical framework  But paradoxically  one hurdle has been the proliferation of alternative progress metrics 



Whether these are single indices that combine a number of different indicators or dashboards showcasing a wide range of metrics  they have been ad hoc and too varied to build consensus around a new global way of measuring progress  Few of them provide an economic framework for consideration of trade offs between the separate indicators  or guidance as to how to interpret indicators moving in different directions  There is a breadth of information but as a call to action  this cannot compete against the clarity of a single GDP statistic 



Statistical measurement is like a technical standard such as voltage in electricity networks or the Highway Code s rules of the road  a shared standard or definition is essential  While an overwhelming majority might agree on the need to go beyond GDP  there also needs to be enough agreement about what  beyond  actually involves before meaningful progress on how we measure progress can be made 



Change behaviour  not just what we measure



There are many visions to supplant GDP growth as the dominant definition of progress and better lives  In the wake of the COVID pandemic  it has been reported that most people want a fairer  more sustainable future 



Politicians can make it sound straightforward  Writing in       the then French president Nicolas Sarkozy explained he had convened a commission   led by internationally acclaimed economists Amartya Sen  Joseph Stiglitz and Jean Paul Fitoussi   on the measurement of economic performance and social progress on the basis of a firm belief  that we will not change our behaviour  unless we change the ways we measure our economic performance  



Sarkozy also committed to encouraging other countries and international organisations to follow the example of France in implementing his commission s recommendations for a suite of measures beyond GDP  The ambition was no less than the construction of a new global economic  social and environmental order 



In       the recently elected UK prime minister  David Cameron  launched a programme to implement the Sarkozy commission s recommendations in the UK  He described this as starting to measure progress as a country  not just by how our economy is growing  but by how our lives are improving   not just by our standard of living  but by our quality of life  



Once again  the emphasis was on measurement  how far have we got   rather than behaviour change  what should people do differently    The implication is that changing what we measure necessarily leads to different behaviours   but the relationship is not that simple  Measures and measurers exist in political and social spheres  not as absolute facts and neutral agents to be accepted by all 



This should not dissuade statisticians from developing new measures  but it should prompt them to engage with all who might be affected   not just those in public policy  commerce or industry  The point after all is to change behaviour  not just to change the measures 



Economists are increasingly adopting complex systems thinking  including both social and psychological understandings of human behaviour  For example  Jonathan Michie has pointed to ethical and cultural values  as well as public policy and the market economy  as the big influences on behaviour  Katharina Lima di Miranda and Dennis Snower have highlighted social solidarity  individual agency and concern for the environment alongside the  traditional  economic incentives captured by GDP 



GDP alternatives in practice



Since Kennedy s      critique  there have been numerous initiatives to replace  augment or complement GDP over the years  Many dozens of indicators have been devised and implemented at local  national and international scales 



Some aim to account more directly for subjective wellbeing  for example by measuring self reported life satisfaction or  happiness   Some hope to reflect more accurately the state of our natural or social assets by developing adjusted monetary and non monetary measures of  inclusive wealth   including a team at the University of Cambridge led by this article s co author Diane Coyle   The UK government has accepted this as a meaningful approach to measurement in several recent policy documents  including its Levelling Up white paper 



There are two fundamental arguments for a wealth based approach 




It embeds consideration for sustainability in the valuing of all assets  their value today depends on the entire future flow of services they make available  This is exactly why stockmarket prices can fall or rise suddenly  when expectations about the future change  Similarly  the prices at which assets such as natural resources or the climate are valued are not just market prices  the true  accounting prices  include social costs and externalities 



It also introduces several dimensions of progress  and flags up the correlations between them  Inclusive wealth includes produced  natural and human capital  and also intangible and social or organisational capital  Using a comprehensive wealth balance sheet to inform decisions could contribute to making better use of resources   for example  by considering the close links between sustaining natural assets and the social and human capital context of people living in areas where those assets are under threat 




Other initiatives aim to capture the multi dimensional nature of social progress by compiling a dashboard of indicators   often measured in non monetary terms   each of which attempts to track some aspect of what matters to society 



New Zealand s Living Standards Framework is the best known example of this dashboard approach  Dating back to a      Royal Commission on Social Policy and developed over more than a decade within the New Zealand Treasury  this framework was precipitated by the need to do something about the discrepancy between what GDP can reflect and the ultimate aim of the Treasury  to make life better for people in New Zealand 



The NZ Treasury now uses it to allocate fiscal budgets in a manner consistent with the identified needs of the country in relation to social and environmental progress  The relevance to combating climate change is particularly clear  if government spending and investment are focused on narrow measures of economic output  there is every possibility that the deep decarbonisation needed to achieve a just transition to a net zero carbon economy will be impossible  Equally  by identifying areas of society with declining wellbeing  such as children s mental health  it becomes possible to allocate Treasury resources directly to alleviate the problem 



The UK s Measuring National Wellbeing  MNW  programme  directed by Paul Allin  a co author of this article   was launched in November      as part of a government led drive to place greater emphasis on wellbeing in national life and business  Much of the emphasis was on the subjective personal wellbeing measures that the UK s Office for National Statistics  ONS  continues to collect and publish  and which appear to be increasingly taken up as policy goals  driven in part by the What Works Centre for Wellbeing  



The MNW team was also charged with addressing the full  beyond GDP  agenda  and undertook a large consultation and engagement exercise to find out what matters to people in the UK  This provided the basis for a set of indicators covering ten broad areas which are updated by the ONS from time to time  While these indicators continue to be published  there is no evidence that they are being used to supplement GDP as the UK s measure of progress 



Accounting for inequality within a single aggregate index is obviously tricky  But several solutions to this problem exist  One of them  advocated by the Sen Stiglitz Fitoussi commission  is to report median rather than mean  or average  values when calculating GDP per head 



Another fascinating possibility is to adjust the aggregate measure using a welfare based index of inequality  such as the one devised by the late Tony Atkinson  An exercise using the Atkinson index carried out by Tim Jackson  also a co author of this article  calculated that the welfare loss associated with inequality in the UK in      amounted to almost      billion   around twice the annual budget of the NHS at that time 



Among the most ambitious attempts to create a single alternative to GDP is a measure which has become known as the Genuine Progress Indicator  GPI   Proposed initially by economist Herman Daly and theologian John Cobb  GPI attempts to adjust GDP for a range of factors   environmental  social and financial   which are not sufficiently well reflected in GDP itself 



GPI has been used as a progress indicator in the US state of Maryland since       Indeed  a bill introduced to US Congress in July      would  if enacted  require the Department of Commerce to publish a US GPI  and to  use both the indicator and GDP for budgetary reporting and economic forecasting   GPI is also used in Atlantic Canada  where the process of building and publishing the index forms part of this community s approach to its development 



A potential gamechanger 



In       the UN secretary general Ant nio Guterres concluded his Our Common Agenda report with a call for action   We must urgently find measures of progress that complement GDP  as we were tasked to do by      in target       of the Sustainable Development Goals   He repeated this demand in his priorities for      speech to the UN General Assembly 



Guterres called for a process  to bring together member states  international financial institutions and statistical  science and policy experts to identify a complement or complements to GDP that will measure inclusive and sustainable growth and prosperity  building on the work of the Statistical Commission  



The first manual explaining the UN s system of national accounts was published in       It has since been through five revisions  the last in       designed to catch up with developments in the economy and financial markets  as well as to meet user needs across the world for a wider spread of information 



The next SNA revision is currently in development  led by the UN Statistics Division and mainly involving national statistical offices  other statistical experts and institutional stakeholders such as the IMF  World Bank and Eurostat 



But unlike the UN s COP processes relating to climate change and  to a lesser extent  biodiversity  there has  to date  been little wider engagement with interested parties   from business leaders and political parties to civil society  non governmental organisations and the general public 



As the British science writer Ehsan Masood has observed  this revision process is happening below the radar of most people who are not currently users of national accounts  And this means many very useful ideas that could be being fed in are going unheard by those who will ultimately make decisions about how nations measure their progress in the future 



The essence of sustainable development was captured in the      Brundtland Report   To contribute to the welfare and wellbeing of the current generation  without compromising the potential of future generations for a better quality of life   Yet it remains unclear how the next SNA revision will provide such an intergenerational lens  despite a new focus on  missing  capitals including natural capital 



Similarly  while the revision programme is addressing globalisation issues  these are only about global production and trade   not  for example  the impacts of national economies on the environment and wellbeing of other countries and populations 



Ambitious deadlines have been set further into the future  achieving the UN s Sustainable Development Goals by       and reducing global net emissions of greenhouse gases to zero before       The SNA revision process   which will see a new system of national accounts agreed in      and enacted from        is a key step in achieving these longer term goals  That is why opening up this revision process to wider debate and scrutiny is so important 



It s time to abandon this  GDP fetish 



One lesson to learn from the history of indicators  such as those about poverty and social exclusion  is that their impact and effectiveness depends not only on their technical robustness and their fitness for purpose  but also on the political and social context   what are the needs of the time  and the prevailing climate of ideas 



The current SNA revision should be a process as much about the use and usefulness of new measures as about their methodological rigour  Indeed  we might go as far as Gus O Donnell  the former UK cabinet secretary  who said in        Of course measurement is hard  But roughly measuring the right concepts is a better way to make policy choices than using more precise measures of the wrong concepts  



In short  there is an inherent tension involved in constructing an alternative to GDP   namely achieving a balance between technical robustness and social resonance  The complexity of a dashboard of indicators such as New Zealand s Living Standards Framework is both an advantage in terms of meaningfulness  and a disadvantage in terms of communicability  In contrast  the simplicity of a single measure of progress such as the Genuine Progress Indicator   or  indeed  GDP   is both an advantage in terms of communication  and a disadvantage in terms of its inability to provide a more nuanced picture of progress 



Ultimately  a plurality of indicators is probably essential in navigating a pathway towards a sustainable prosperity that takes full account of individual and societal wellbeing  Having a wider range of measures should allow for more diverse narratives of progress 



Some momentum in the current SNA revisions process and ongoing statistical research is directed toward measurement of inclusive wealth   building on the economics of sustainability brought together in Partha Dasgupta s recent review of the economics of biodiversity  This framework can probably gain a broad consensus among economists and statisticians  and is already being implemented by the UN  starting with natural capital and environmental accounting 



Including wellbeing measures in the mix would signal that wellbeing matters  at least to some of us  while also recognising that many different things can affect wellbeing  The evidence to date is that planting wellbeing measures in a different part of the data ecosystem means they will be overlooked or ignored  Wellbeing measures are not a panacea  but without them we will continue to do things that restrict rather than enhance wellbeing and fail to recognise the potential economic  social and environmental benefits that a wellbeing focus should bring 



The task of updating the statistical framework to measure economic progress better is non trivial  The development of the SNA and its spread to many countries took years or even decades  New data collection methodologies should be able to speed things up now   but the first step in getting political buy in to a better framework for the measurement of progress is an agreement about what to move to 



National accounting needs what the name suggests  an internally consistent  exhaustive and mutually exclusive set of definitions and classifications  A new framework will require collecting different source data  and therefore changing the processes embedded in national statistical offices  It will need to incorporate recent changes in the economy due to digitalisation  as well as the long standing issues such as inadequate measurement of environmental change 



 That which makes life worthwhile   Robert Kennedy visits a summer reading programme in Harlem        Alamy



Ultimately  this  beyond GDP  process needs to grapple not only with measurement problems but also with the various uses and abuses to which GDP has been put  Kennedy s neat summary that it measures  everything except that which makes life worthwhile  points as much to the misuse of GDP as to its statistical limitations  Its elegance in being simultaneously a measure of income  spending and output means that in some form  it is likely to remain a valid tool for macroeconomic analysis  But its use as an unequivocal arbiter of social progress was never appropriate  and probably never will be 



Clearly  the desire to know if society is moving in the right direction remains a legitimate and important goal   perhaps more so now than ever  But in their search for a reliable guide towards social wellbeing  governments  businesses  statisticians  climate scientists and all other interested parties must abandon once and for all what the Nobel Laureate Stiglitz called a  GDP fetish   and work with civil society  the media and the public to establish a more effective framework for measuring progress
