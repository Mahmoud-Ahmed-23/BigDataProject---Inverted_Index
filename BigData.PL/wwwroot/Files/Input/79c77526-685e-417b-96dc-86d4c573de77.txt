Warren Sturgis McCulloch  November            September           was an American neurophysiologist and cybernetician known for his work on the foundation for certain brain theories and his contribution to the cybernetics movement             Along with Walter Pitts  McCulloch created computational models based on mathematical algorithms called threshold logic which split the inquiry into two distinct approaches  one approach focused on biological processes in the brain and the other focused on the application of neural networks to artificial intelligence            


Biography edit 
Warren Sturgis McCulloch was born in Orange  New Jersey  in       His brother was a chemical engineer and Warren was originally planning to join the Christian ministry  As a teenager he was associated with the theologians Henry Sloane Coffin  Harry Emerson Fosdick  Herman Karl Wilhelm Kumm and Julian F  Hecker  He was also mentored by the Quaker Rufus Jones             He attended Haverford College then studied philosophy and psychology at Yale University  where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in        He continued to study psychology at Columbia and received a Master of Arts degree in       Receiving his MD in      from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York  he undertook an internship at Bellevue Hospital  New York  Then he worked under Eilhard von Domarus at the Rockland State Hospital for the Insane             He returned to academia in        He worked at the Laboratory for Neurophysiology at Yale University from      to      
In      he moved to Chicago and joined the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago  where he was a professor of psychiatry  as well as the director of the Illinois Neuropsychiatric Institute until                  From      he worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge  Massachusetts with Norbert Wiener  He was a founding member of the American Society for Cybernetics and its second president during             He was a mentor to the British operations research pioneer Stafford Beer 
McCulloch had a range of interests and talents  In addition to his scientific contributions he wrote poetry  sonnets   and he designed and engineered buildings and a dam at his farm in Old Lyme  Connecticut 
McCulloch married Ruth Metzger  known as  Rook   in      and they had three children             He died in Cambridge in      

Work edit 
He is remembered for his work with Joannes Gregorius Dusser de Barenne from Yale            and later with Walter Pitts from the University of Chicago  He provided the foundation for certain brain theories in a number of classic papers  including  A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity         and  How We Know Universals   The Perception of Auditory and Visual Forms          both published in the Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics  The former is  widely credited with being a seminal contribution to neural network theory  the theory of automata  the theory of computation  and cybernetics             
McCulloch was the chair of the set of Macy conferences dedicated to Cybernetics  These  greatly due to the diversity of the backgrounds of the participants McCulloch brought in  became the foundation for the field 
In Wiener s Cybernetics         he recounted an event in the spring of       when McCulloch designed a machine to allow the blind to read  by converting printed letters to tones  He designed it so that the tone is invariant for the same letter viewed under different angles  Gerhardt von Bonin saw the design  and immediately asked    Is this a diagram of the fourth layer of the visual cortex of the brain                                              
In his last days in     s  he worked on loops  oscillations and triadic relations with Moreno D az  the reticular formation with Kilmer and dynamic models of memory with Da Fonseca             His work in the     s was summarized in a      paper             

Neuroscience edit 
He studied the excitation of the brain by strychnine neuronography  which was a method to map brain connections  Applying strychnine in one point of the brain causes excitations in different points of the brain              Bailey  Bonin  and McCulloch conducted a series of studies in the     s that identified connections in the brains of macaque and chimpanzee that are consistent with modern understanding of VOF                         

Mathematical logic edit 
In      he began to work mainly on mathematical logic  and by      he attempted to make a logic of transitive verbs  His goal in psychology is to invent a  psychon  or  least psychic event  that are binary atomic events with necessary causes  such that they can be combined to create complex logical propositions concerning their antecedents  He noticed in      that these may correspond to the all or nothing firings of neurons in the brain            
In the      paper  they described how memories can be formed by a neural network with loops in it  or alterable synapses  These then encodes for sentences like  There was some x such that x was a    or 
  
    
      
         
          x     
        x
         
         
          x c  
        x
         
      
    
      displaystyle   exists x   psi x  
  
  and showed that looped neural networks can encode all first order logic with equality and conversely  any looped neural networks is equivalent to a sentence in first order logic with equality  thus showing that they are equivalent in logical expressiveness            
The      paper describes neural networks operating over time  and logical universals     there exists  and  for all  for spatial objects  such as geometric figures  was further developed in their      paper             
He worked with Manuel Blum in studying how a neural network can be  logically stable   that is  can implement a boolean function even if the activation thresholds of individual neurons are varied                                   They were inspired by the problem of how the brain can perform the same functions  such as breathing  under influence of caffeine or alcohol  which shifts the activation threshold over the entire brain            
He worked on triadic relations  an extension of the calculus of relations to handle relations that relates   objects  such as  A gives B to C  or  A perceives B to be C   He was convinced that such a logic is necessary for understanding brain activity                         

How we know universals edit 
In the      paper How we know universals  they studied the problem of recognizing objects despite changes in representation  For example  recognizing a square under different viewing angles and lighting conditions  or recognizing a phoneme under different loudness and tones  That is  recognizing objects invariant under the action of some symmetry group  This problem was partly inspired by a practical problem in designing a machine for the blind to read  recounted in Wiener s Cybernetics  see before              
The paper proposed two solutions  The first is in computing an invariant by averaging over the symmetry group  Let the symmetry group be 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
      displaystyle G 
  
 and the object to be recognized be 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
      displaystyle x 
  
  Let a neural network implement a function 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
      displaystyle T 
  
  Then  the group invariant representation would be 
  
    
      
        
          
             
            
              
                 
              
              G
              
                 
              
            
          
        
        
            x     
          
            g
              x     
            G
          
        
        T
         
        g
        x
         
      
    
      displaystyle   frac      G    sum   g in G T gx  
  
  the group action average  The second solution is in a negative feedback circuit that drives a canonical representation  Consider the problem of recognizing whether an object is a square  The circuit moves the eye so that the  center of gravity of brightness  of the object is moved to the middle of the visual field  This then effectively converts each object into a canonical representation  which can then be compared with a representation in the brain                         

Neural network modelling edit 
In the      paper McCulloch and Pitts attempted to demonstrate that a Turing machine program could be implemented in a finite network of formal neurons  in the event  the Turing Machine contains their model of the brain  but the converse is not true               that the neuron was the base logic unit of the brain  In the      paper they offered approaches to designing  nervous nets  to recognize visual inputs despite changes in orientation or size 
From      McCulloch worked at the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT  working primarily on neural network modelling  His team examined the visual system of the frog in consideration of McCulloch s      paper  discovering that the eye provides the brain with information that is already  to a degree  organized and interpreted  instead of simply transmitting an image 
With Roberto Moreno D az  he studied a formalized problem of memory  Given that neural networks can story memory by a pattern of oscillations in a circle  they studied the number of possible oscillation patterns that can be sustained by some neural network with 
  
    
      
        N
      
    
      displaystyle N 
  
 neurons  This came out to be 
  
    
      
        K
         
        N
         
         
        
          
            
               
            
            
              
                 
                
                  N
                
              
              k
            
            
               
            
          
        
        
            x     
          
            k
             
             
          
          
            
               
              
                N
              
            
              x

  Schnabel                     Also  they proved a universality theorem  in that for each 
  
    
      
        N
      
    
      displaystyle N 
  
  there exists a neural network  possibly with more than

      displaystyle N 
  
 neurons  with

        K
         
        N
         
      
    
      displaystyle  log     K N  
  
 binary inputs  such that  for any oscillation pattern realizable by some neural network with 
  
    
      
        N
      
    
      displaystyle N 
  
 neurons  there exists a binary input for this universal network such that it exhibits the same pattern                                     

Control edit 
McCulloch considered the problem of contradictory information and motives  which he called a  heterarchy  of motives  meaning that the motives are not linearly ordered  but can be ordered like 
  
    
      
        A
         gt 
        B
         gt 
        C
         gt 
        A
      
    
      displaystyle A gt B gt C gt A 
  
              He posited the concept of  poker chip  reticular formations as to how the brain deals with contradictory information in a democratic  somatotopical neural network  Specifically  how the brain can commit the animal to a single course of action when the situation is ambiguous 
They designed a prototypic example neural network  RETIC   with     anastomatically coupled modules stacked in columnar array   which can switch between unambiguous stable modes based on ambiguous inputs                         
His principle of   Redundancy of Potential Command              was developed by von Foerster and Pask in their study of self organization             and by Pask in his Conversation Theory and Interactions of Actors Theory
