							Daily News Egypt interviewed Minister of Civil Aviation Sherif Fathy to learn about the obstacles facing the air transport industry in Egypt  especially in the wake of his visit to Russia in an attempt to resume flights between both countries 
What are the results of your visit to Russia 
Our bilateral relations with Russia are more expansive than cooperation in just one sector  We deal with it comprehensively 
We are working hard to increase security at airports to resume flights with Russia 
Investigations on the fall of the Russian aeroplane are in the hands of the general prosecutors 
What were the requirements from Russia in terms of security 
The Russian side requested that wall cameras and biometric devices be installed to regulate entry and exit of airport employees 
The Ministry of Civil Aviation began processing the Russian requests 
All the devices that arrived at Egyptian airports in the first phase were not due to demands from any country  but rather a previous plan penned by the ministry and airport authorities 
We had several meetings with Russian officials and discussed a security cooperation protocol in Egyptian airports 
Is it true that a special hall will be dedicated to Russian tourists or that Russian security will be allowed to escort groups 
No  all these rumours are false  However  it is ordinary for a country to request a special hall for its nationals  but this would first require a great number of that country       s tourists coming to Egypt 
This is not a matter of Egyptian sovereignty over its territory 
In some countries  EgyptAir requires an Egyptian escort for its passengers 
A Russian delegation is scheduled to visit Egypt end of August  What are the details about the visit 
The delegation will discuss strengthening security capacities at airports with Egyptian security teams 
Egypt has received two Russian delegations in the past    days to inspect security at hotels and resorts in Sharm El Sheikh and Hurghada  as well as to look into the latest developments of the investigations on the Russian airliner fall 
How was EgyptAir affected by the halt in Russian flights 
There were several incidents that took place in a short time the fall of the Russian plane  hijacking of another  and finally the MS    flight that crashed into the Mediterranean  Thus  EgyptAir has suffered a great deal in the past period 
If any other company had these incidents  it would have announced bankruptcy  But EgyptAir is based on a solid foundation and has leaders with expertise in both the financial and the technical aspects 
Ground services at EgyptAir suffered losses of more than EGP    m since the fall of the Russian plane 
What are EgyptAir       s expansion plans 
The growth of EgyptAir over the past years was very moderate  in comparison with other airlines operating in the region 
EgyptAir is now seeking to pay off debts owed to the Ministry of Petroleum  including a portion from current consumption as well as accumulated debts 
We have a plan to add    new aircrafts to the fleet over the next five years 
This is a long term plan that is based on flexibility in order to cope with changing circumstances 
Did the Egyptian pound depreciation against the US dollar impact EgyptAir 
The company witnessed greater losses after the devaluation of the Egyptian pound 
About     of the company       s costs are in dollars  which also increased financial burdens 
EgyptAir has a national duty  Hence  it operates in all conditions without aiming for profit  but to maintain the interests of the state 
The company was one of the most important communication channels with the world after the    January Revolution 
Did EgyptAir raise its tickets prices to cope with the increasing costs 
EgyptAir did not raise prices of domestic flights  International flight tickets were raised by     which is still insufficient to offset the impact of the dollar exchange rate against the pound 
What are the details of the deal with Dubai Aerospace Enterprise for nine Boeing aircrafts 
The Chinese bank that was supposed to finance the deal backed out after EgyptAir had already ordered the new aircrafts 
The company could not give the deal away  as this would have hindered our expansion plans  so the deal will be an ordinary sell and leaseback deal 
This will save on the monthly rental of the planes  and EgyptAir will not bear any additional financial burdens  as the new planes will replace older ones that we were aiming to dispose of anyway 
The deal between EgyptAir and Boeing for nine         Boeing aircrafts was worth     m 
Egypt currently has    NG        aircrafts 
How is EgyptAir cooperating with General Electric 
The cooperation with General Electric is to develop the engines workshop at EgyptAir 
We strive to make EgyptAir one of the most important General Electric engine maintenance workshops in the region 
There is a good market for maintenance  as     of the company       s business is maintenance of other companies        engines 
About     of EgyptAir s fleet has General Electric engines and CFM International engines or turbines 
You announced that EgyptAir intends to sell a number of dilapidated aircrafts  What is new in this regard 
EgyptAir has been facing difficulties disposing of its older aircrafts mainly due to laws and procedures related to the sale of assets 
The period for evaluating and pricing old planes is very long 
The long period depreciates the prices  but we should not stress the committee conducting the evaluation  This law is binding for everyone 
We are  however  waiting for proposals to lease these aeroplanes as we wait for the evaluation process to be completed 
EgyptAir is currently renting out nine of its planes  which generates revenue of     m per year 
What are the latest developments with the airport city 
The project needs the mind of real estate developers  more than just investors 
Two plots of land have been selected as part of the project  but we are waiting for the cabinet to amend some laws to be put forward to investors 
There is a study being conducted for selling the lands instead of offering them for usufruct 
The ministry is considering some proposals for the development of the infrastructure within the project to increase revenue 
There are also three alternatives under consideration  including resorting to the help of specialised real estate companies 
Airport City is planned to lie on   m sqm  It is divided into five investment regions  It is expected to bring investments worth more than EGP   bn 
The Ministry of Civil Aviation announced earlier an agreement to supply Egyptian airports with Russian radars  Are there any new updates 
We have paid advances on the deal  which would cover the entire Egyptian airspace 
The Egyptian Airport Company has financed the project  It includes buying    radars from Russian companies 
In later stages  we will resort to government borrowing to complete the deal 
The contract was signed in February between the Egyptian Airport Company and Russian companies to import    radar stations in a deal worth     m making it the largest deal in the history of civil aviation in Egypt  It is expected to make the Egyptian airspace one of the safest in the world 
There have been proposals to increase EgyptAir s capital  How is this going 
The idea of increasing the company       s capital was proposed by the government 
The state  however  has priorities in distributing the budget  This makes the government seek alternatives in order to finance the capital increase 
What is the ministry       s stance on Britain suspending its flights to and from Sharm El Sheikh 
The Egyptian aviation sector does not have any new offer to present to the British side  We are currently waiting for their decision 
Egypt has fulfilled all the procedures and requirements that Britain put forward to resume flights to Sharm El Sheikh  it is in their hands now  We do not have any plans to visit the UK at least for now 
Did you accept any incentive programmes for foreign airlines 
We offer incentives to airlines according to the growth plans for passengers 
But we cannot build on a subsiding foundation  as it will eventually fail  We must discuss with foreign companies and offer them discounts in exchange for an added value to the Egyptian economy 
The Ministry of Civil Aviation is ready to provide assistance to all companies  so long as they increase tourist inflow to Egypt 
There was a project to launch two satellites belonging to Navisat satellite system  What are the latest developments of this project 
The Egyptian Armed Forces is coordinating this project with Navisat satellite systems 
Navisat satellite systems operates in the Middle East and Africa  It is owned by the Egyptian government and has put forward a proposal to investors to manufacture satellites 
The satellites are planned to provide communication services for aviation traffic  airlines  and aero navigation in the region  They are planned to meet the standards of the International Civil Aviation Organisation  ICAO   Moreover  they would offer internet services and commercial communications 
What are the plans for Smart Aviation  
Smart Aviation  owned by the Ministry of Civil Aviation  is under examination now  We are choosing between serving businessmen  or transforming it into a services company 
The transport of businessmen on the company       s private jets has declined significantly in the last few years 
You have met with the private airlines  What are the details about the ministry       s vision and the companies        requests 
There is a work plan and an agenda for the activity of private airlines in the coming period 
We operate through carefully drawn plans to strengthen the sector in the coming years 
Egyptian private airlines should present themselves as an alternative to charter airlines that have been offering less expensive flights to Egypt 
Air Cairo flies    tourist trips per week  Other companies must follow suit 
The Ministry of Civil Aviation has flexibility to accept any requests for private aviation companies to operate new lines for flights 
The approval of the ministry on new lines should add to the Egyptian state network and hubs to transport tourists 
The ministry is committed to offering all aid and incentives for private airlines 
EgyptAir and private airlines have signed contracts for ground services for payment of fees in dollars 
What are the details of the request for private companies to pay bills for jet fuel in Egyptian pounds instead of US dollars 
The ministry will seek to negotiate with the Ministry of Petroleum during the coming period
