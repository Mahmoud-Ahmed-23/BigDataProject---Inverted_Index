Terry Allen Winograd  born February           is an American computer scientist  He is a professor at Stanford University  and co director of the Stanford Human Computer Interaction Group             He is known within the philosophy of mind and artificial intelligence fields for his work on natural language using the SHRDLU program 


Education edit 
Winograd grew up in Colorado and graduated from Colorado College in       He wrote SHRDLU as a PhD thesis at MIT in the years from          In making the program Winograd was concerned with the problem of providing a computer with sufficient  understanding  to be able to use natural language  Winograd built a blocks world  restricting the program s intellectual world to a simulated  world of toy blocks   The program could accept commands such as   Find a block which is taller than the one you are holding and put it into the box  and carry out the requested action using a simulated block moving  arm  The program could also respond verbally  for example   I do not know which block you mean   The SHRDLU program can be viewed historically as one of the classic examples of how difficult it is for a programmer to build up a computer s semantic memory by hand and how limited or  brittle  such programs are            

Research edit 
In       Winograd moved to Stanford University and developed an AI based framework for understanding natural language which was to give rise to a series of books  But only the first volume  Syntax  was ever published    What I came to realize is that the success of the communication depends on the real intelligence on the part of the listener  and that there are many other ways of communicating with a computer that can be more effective  given that it doesn t have the intelligence             
His approach shifted away from classical Artificial Intelligence after encountering the critique of cognitivism by Hubert Dreyfus and meeting  with the Chilean philosopher Fernando Flores  They  published a critical appraisal from a perspective based in phenomenology as Understanding Computers and Cognition  a new foundation for design in       In the latter part of the     s  Winograd worked with Flores on an early form of groupware  Their approach was based on conversation for action analysis 
In the early     s  Winograd was a founding member and national president of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility  a group of computer scientists concerned about nuclear weapons  SDI  and increasing participation by the U S  Department of Defense in the field of computer science            
In general  Winograd s work at Stanford has focused on software design in a broader sense than software engineering  In      he founded the  Project on People  Computers and Design  in order to promote teaching and research into software design  The book  Bringing Design to Software  describes some of this work  His thesis is that software design is a distinct activity from both analysis and programming  but it should be informed by both  as well as by design practices in other professions  textile design  industrial design  etc   
Starting in       Winograd served as adviser to Stanford PhD student Larry Page             who was working on a research project involving web search  In       Page took a leave of absence from Stanford to co found Google  In       Winograd took a sabbatical from teaching and spent some time at Google as a visiting researcher             There  he studied the intersection of theory and practice of human computer interaction 
Recently      when       Winograd has continued to research collaborative computing  including uses of ubiquitous computing in collaborative work 
Winograd continues to do research at Stanford and teach classes and seminars in human computer interaction   In addition to the Computer Science Dept   Winograd is associated with the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford  also known as the  d school   which he helped found            

Awards edit 
He is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery                    and received the SIGCHI Lifetime Research Award in
