What are the challenges that mixed use residential projects face in Egypt 
Developing successful master planned mixed use communities requires significant planning both from a market and urban design point of view  Except for a few established developers  many second third tier developers build residential projects with limited planning and consideration given to mixed use community elements  such as retail  leisure  open spaces  etc  Since the collective volume of residential supply in Egypt is developed by these second third tier developers  most residential projects are faced with these challenges 
The lack of infrastructure services  such as train metro networks  also strain vehicular traffic  making exit and entry into residential communities a challenging task  Furthermore  high land prices payable by landlords developers is another challenge 
What are the most successful Egyptian mixed use residential projects 
There are several successful mixed use residential projects in East and West Cairo  including Uptown Cairo  Cairo Festival City  Katameya Heights  Hyde Park  Mivida  Mountain Views  Eastown Cairo  and New Giza  as well as Palm Hills in  th of October City  There are also successful developments outside Cairo  such as Sahl El Hasheesh  Red Sea   and Marasi  North Coast  
Why are mixed use projects and brand premium more expensive in Egypt than in Dubai 
The difference in price premiums is due to the individual market landscape of each city  In Dubai  social infrastructure facilities  such as retail  schools  clinics  etc   are in close proximity or are within short driving distance from communities  This provides consumers an option to live in communities even further away from the main city  In Cairo on the other hand  the emphasis given to self sustained gated communities is much higher than in Dubai  Residents are less likely to leave their community for their everyday needs  thereby placing a much higher premium on unit prices 
The target markets are different in each city as well  i e   unit sales in Dubai are driven by expatriates and investors  Therefore  high unit prices with higher premiums are likely to discourage both end user and investor buyers in Dubai  while Cairo is more focused on local residents willing to pay the price to live in a respected community and also invest in tangible assets to hedge against inflation 
Why does the report make a comparison between Egypt and Dubai 
The report is comparing two key regional markets that are world leaders in developing large scale communities Dubai and Cairo  the former  popular for expatriate living  while the residential market of the later is primarily focused on local residents 
Colliers International is also in the process of publishing reports on other regional markets as well 
What are the areas with most retail elements within a residential community in Egypt 
The majority of retail space in key residential communities  such as Uptown Cairo  Katameya Heights  and Eastown Cairo  comprise of convenience retail elements  such as supermarkets  caf s  and restaurants  creating a community where residents are less dependent on leaving their gated communities for everyday needs 
What is the percent of projects in Egypt including social infrastructure in mixed use developments 
Approximately         of total Grade A compounds in Cairo 
In your opinion  what is the impact of the recent cabinet decision to increase fuel prices on real estate development and units  prices 
Increasing fuel prices up to     is likely to increase construction cost  reflecting the increase in transportation cost 
The increase in construction cost is expected to be translated into an increase in unit price  which generally ends up being paid as higher unit prices 
Do you think that the rise in interest rates of banks may affect the real estate sector 
The market is less driven by mortgages  Mortgage represents less than    of total GDP  Although there is likely to be an impact  it is Colliers  opinion that it will be minimum 
Interest rates on developer finance  however  are expected to remain high  resulting in higher unit prices passed on to end users 
After the Egyptian parliament s approval of the New Investment Law  what are the advantages you see that will benefit the sector 
The government is seen taking many steps to attract investment and investors to Egypt  This initiative is reflected in several decisions  including the New Investment Law approved by the House of Representatives  as well as the government s decision to grant foreigners the right to buy a property of a minimum value of          to obtain a   year residency 
The new law includes many advantages  including a one stop shop where investors can complete all investment procedures through one entity  which is generally the largest bureaucratic obstacle when it comes to investment  The incentives include tax deduction at a rate of     of the investment costs in sector A  which are the geographical areas most in need of development according to reports issued by the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics  as well as a discount of     on investment costs in sector B and a     discount in sector C 
In your opinion  why does Egypt s real estate sector remain strong 
Egyptians have historically purchased properties in order to hedge against inflation  With the recent devaluation and currency fluctuations  residential prices have witnessed a year on year increase of approximately      in EGP terms   and properties continue to sell on the back of an undersupplied residential market 
Marriage remains the primary driver of new demand  with the total number of marriages each year equaling approximately    of the total population  Directly correlating this to new housing demand in Greater Cairo would suggest that approximately        residential units are required each year 
Additionally  Egypt s residential sector benefits from a large and growing young domestic population who will eventually need housing  Approximately     of the country s current population is under     with the total population anticipated to grow at an average annual rate of
