Menor is an informative  collaborative  and interactive person who will help you in climbing up the career ladder  I would recommend this course to everyone who is starting with his her interview preparations or has intermediate interview skills and are not sure where they are going wrong Reviews and RatingsNISHI KANT RANJANPlaced in Globallogic a Hitachi group company Live classes of DSA for Working Professional are very good and they covered all the important topics for placement in good MNC  This course helped me a lot and gives me the confidence to develop coding logic  Before this course  I didn  x   t knew the concept of  data structures but now I bagged multiple offers from TOP MNCs 
SameerPlaced at GoogleIn addition to the DSA live for working professional  I also enrolled in the System design   Both of these Courses offers a diverse set of challenging and non repetitive questions  which helps save time that would otherwise be spent on selecting appropriate questions  After the standard questions  the tests also provide time bound challenges 
In my opinion  the level of difficulty of the questions is sufficient for preparing for a FAANG coding interview  The GeeksforGeeks team has done a great job in creating courses that are tailored towards a specific audience with a specific goal in mind Harshit KhandelwalPlaced at United Health GroupThe course helped in better shaping my answers in interviews  The practice sessions improved my Data structures and problem solving ability  and live online lectures helped me to further brush up on those DSA problems which once looked intimidating Rajan AroraCFR Intern at American ExpressGeeks For Geeks is an amazing place to learn code from starting  Being an absolute beginner  I started my coding life at GFG  First  I enrolled in Fork CPP that helped me to clear my fundamentals of C   and start learning from the Placement Preparation Course because of the hands of the coding concept of DSA  I was able to improve my code writing skills and my problem solving skills  to brush my skill I took the Amazon test series and participate in every event contest like Must Do Interview Preparation  Coding Round Contests   Test Series     Days of Code  etc 
I can say Sandeep Jain sir is an amazing  fun loving teacher and made the class very enjoyable  The teaching assistants were very helpful and helped me learn from my mistakes  It was an amazing journey with Geeks For Geeks and I was fully satisfied with my course  
I Owe my success to Sandeep Sir and Geeks For Geeks   Cheers Yogesh jhaPlaced at Netmeds com   Miq digital This course is an excellent resource for interview preparation  I want to thank GeeksforGeeks for providing an outstanding course that covers all of the important questions that are needed to succeed in technical interviews and online assessments  This course helped me to solidify my understanding of data structures and algorithms and prepared me for a software engineer job interview  It provided a step by step approach to learning the concepts from the basics to more advanced topics such as trees  graphs  and dynamic programming  
I am grateful to Sandeep Jain and the entire GeeksforGeeks team for creating such a valuable course at an affordable price and for building this amazing platform  The questions in the course are of the same difficulty level as those asked in interviews and online assessments
Shubham Kumar AgrawalPlaced at Brane  NSLHUB I am Shubham  a mechanical undergrad from IIT Bhubaneswar 
I would like to thank  GeeksforGeeks for providing an immensely detailed course for the ease of students  This course has helped a non Computer Science B Tech  student like me  to secure   offers in the software industry 
Being an alumnus from IIT without any offer in hand  was very depressing for me   I bought the System Design Live course from GeeksforGeeks and apart from this  four other courses like DSA self paced course  CPP STL  SDE Theory  and Low Level Design course  around    months back and practiced rigorously 
Today I can proudly say  that I have   offers in hand with a base pay of   LPA     LPA  and    LPA  
Thanks a lot to the whole community of GeeksForGeeks 
Thank you Sandeep Jain sir for making GeeksforGeeks Neeraj KumarPlaced at Montbleu TechnologiesCompleting the  quot DSA to System Design for Working Professionals quot  course  anchored by the  quot Mastery in DSA  quot  was a game changer  From refining my coding skills to seamlessly applying them in real world system design scenarios  this course is a practical investment for any professional serious about software development Taranjeet SinghPlaced at NECI was able to develop my coding skills through this course  The training had industry oriented problems that required extremely sound logic  but the mentor took his time explaining every line of code and giving homework assignments similar to the training problems  Everyone should take this course  in my opinion Shubham KaushalSWE Intern Google     I purchased a bundle from GeeksforGeeks and used it to prepare for online tests and interviews by taking all of the mock tests and solving most of the problems  This series was very helpful for me  Thank you  GeeksforGeeks BRIJESH KUMARInternship at GoogleI found this bundle to be the best for software engineer  because it covers all of the core questions and provides an effective way to master each data structure  The test series has a good selection of questions from each topic of data structures and algorithms  The Preparation Guide included in the course was also very helpful for me as I started my interview preparation journey 

To prepare  I followed a strategy of reading about the data structures and algorithms on GeeksforGeeks blogs and practicing the problems provided for each one  For revision  I found that taking online coding assessments was the best way  To challenge myself  I also took the mock rounds included in the test series 

Overall  this test series was very helpful for me  I wish you the best of luck on your preparation journey MrinalPlaced in HCL Technologies Ltd as a Lead Engineer  quot I had always struggled with data structures and wanted to transition from a support role to a development role  This course not only helped me land a job that allowed me to work with the latest technologies  but it also greatly improved my skills in data structures  The live classes  study materials  and videos provided were very thorough and descriptive  I highly recommend this course to anyone  quot AdeshPlaced at Volante SystemsOnce I had basic knowledge of Data Structures  I started using the questions to practice questions based on topic and difficulty levels  Whenever I felt like in need to brush up some Data Structure or Algorithm  I used to practice them from the portal 
The question sets covers most of the important and reoccurring problems that are commonly asked in tech interviews  Going through the problems made me confident that I can clear most of the interview round based on Data Structures  amp  Algorithms Illisha SinghPlaced at Goldman SachsMy college  Shiv Nadar University  gave us a chance to appear for an online coding test that was held on GFG itself to assess and choose students who they would sponsor for this Advanced Programming course  I was interning back then  but since I was interested in programming  I decided to appear for the same  I was fortunate enough to get selected and subsequently enrolled in this wonderful course with an extremely brilliant mentor named Sachin Chandani  The course was very evenly paced and took care of a lot of concepts that are otherwise missed out on if one chooses to go ahead and study on their own  The course started with the basic level and the weekly coding practice tests made sure that everyone was completing those in time and learning holistically as well  The environment was very constructive and we were encouraged to gain more and experiment more throughout  Had I not been enrolled on this by my college  I doubt I would have ever found this learning resource Chitransh GuptaPlaced at AmazonThis course indeed is the right investment one can look for in gaining insights into Data Structure and Algorithms  Either a college student or a working professional can benefit from the course as DS  amp  Algorithms is a core to crack the technical interviews  amp  currently working as Software Development Engineer  Apart from this  Sandeep Sir  x   s teaching is phenomenal  Thank you GeeksforGeeks for this amazing test series Nikhil KumarPlaced in DateTheRampI have joined the Geeks Classes batch for DSA to get placed in a good product based company  This course helped me a lot to understand Data structures and algorithms from basics to an advanced level  The course was well mentored and the content was very well presented  I bagged an offer at a very good product based company and I am extremely thankful to Sandeep sir and GFG for designing this course
