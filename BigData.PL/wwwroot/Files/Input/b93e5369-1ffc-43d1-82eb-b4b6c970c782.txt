New company developing a novel  scalable business
 Startup  redirects here  For other uses  see Startup  disambiguation  
A startup or start up is a company or project undertaken by an entrepreneur to seek  develop  and validate a scalable business model                        While entrepreneurship includes all new businesses including self employment and businesses that do not intend to go public  startups are new businesses that intend to grow large beyond the solo founder             During the beginning  startups face high uncertainty            and have high rates of failure  but a minority of them do go on to become successful and influential  such as unicorns            


Actions edit 
Startups typically begin by a founder  solo founder  or co founders who have a way to solve a problem  The founder of a startup will do the market validation by problem interview  solution interview  and building a minimum viable product  MVP   i e  a prototype  to develop and validate their business models             The startup process can take a long period of time  hence  sustaining effort is required  Over the long term  sustaining effort is especially challenging because of the high failure rates and uncertain outcomes             Having a business plan in place outlines what to do and how to plan and achieve an idea in the future  Typically  these plans outline the first three to five years of your business strategy            

Design principles edit 
Models behind startups presenting as ventures are usually associated with design science  Design science uses design principles considered to be a coherent set of normative ideas and propositions to design and construct the company s backbone             For example  one of the initial design principles is affordable loss             

Heuristics and biases in startup actions edit 
Because of the lack of information  high uncertainty  and the need to make decisions quickly  founders usually use many heuristics and exhibit biases in their leadership decisions             
Entrepreneurs often become overconfident about their startups and their influence on an outcome  case of the illusion of control   Below are some of the most critical decision biases of entrepreneurs to start up a new business             

Overconfidence  Perceive a subjective certainty higher than the objective accuracy The gap often leads individuals to overestimate their understanding of complex situations  resulting in decisions that are based more on subjective certainty than on objective facts or accurate information
Illusion of control  Overemphasize how much skills  instead of chance  improve performance 
The law of small numbers  Reach conclusions about a larger population using a limited sample 
Availability bias  Make judgments about the probability of events based on how easy it is to think of examples 
Escalation of commitment  Persist unduly with unsuccessful initiatives or courses of action 
Startups use several action principles to generate evidence as quickly as possible to reduce the downside effect of decision biases such as an escalation of commitment  overconfidence  and the illusion of control 

Mentoring edit 
Many entrepreneurs seek feedback from mentors in creating their startups  Mentors guide founders and impart entrepreneurial skills and may increase the self efficacy of nascent entrepreneurs              Mentoring offers direction for entrepreneurs to enhance their knowledge of how to sustain their assets relating to their status and identity and strengthen their real time skills             

Principles edit 
There are many principles in creating a startup  Some of the principles needed are listed below 

Lean startup edit 
Lean startup is a clear set of principles to create and design startups under limited resources and tremendous uncertainty to build their ventures more flexibly and at a lower cost  It is based on the idea that entrepreneurs can make their implicit assumptions about how their venture works explicit and empirically testing it              The empirical test is to de validate these assumptions and to get an engaged understanding of the business model of the new ventures  and in doing so  the new ventures are created iteratively in a build measure learn loop  Hence  lean startup is a set of principles for entrepreneurial learning and business model design  More precisely  it is a set of design principles aimed for iteratively experiential learning under uncertainty in an engaged empirical manner  Typically  a lean startup focuses on a few lean principles 

find a problem worth solving  then define a solution
engage early adopters for market validation
continually test with smaller  faster iterations
build a function  measure customer response  and verify refute the idea
evidence based decisions on when to pivot by changing your plan s course
maximize the efforts for speed  learning  and focus
Market validation edit 
A key principle of startup is to validate the market need before providing a customer centric product or service to avoid business ideas with weak demand              Market validation can be done in a number of ways  including surveys  cold calling  email responses  word of mouth or through sample research             

Design thinking edit 
Design thinking is a human centered approach to problem solving that emphasizes empathy  collaboration  and experimentation  It is widely used to deeply understand customers  needs  behaviors  and pain points through immersive engagement and iterative feedback  By placing users at the center of the innovation process  design thinking seeks to uncover insights that can lead to more effective  relevant  and impactful solutions 
However  while design thinking and its complementary methodology  customer development aim to reduce assumptions and promote evidence based innovation  they are not immune to cognitive biases  In fact  both processes can inadvertently reinforce existing biases at multiple stages  For instance  the way problems are framed  the sources of information selected  the questions posed during interviews  and the interpretation of qualitative data can all be influenced by the facilitator s or team s preconceived notions 
These biases can subtly shape what is observed and how it is understood  potentially leading to solutions that reflect the designers  perspectives more than the users   As a result  the promise of achieving  customer empathy  can be compromised if critical reflection and bias checking mechanisms are not embedded throughout the process  Therefore  while design thinking is a powerful tool for innovation  its effectiveness depends heavily on the rigor  objectivity  and self awareness of the individuals applying it               Encouraging people to consider the opposite of whatever decision they are about to make tends to reduce biases such as overconfidence  the hindsight bias  and anchoring                         

Decision making under uncertainty edit 
In startups  many decisions are made under uncertainty             and hence a key principle for startups is to be agile and flexible  Founders can embed options to design startups in flexible manners  so that the startups can change easily in future 
Uncertainty can vary within person  I feel more uncertain this year than last year  and between person  he feels more uncertain than she does   A study found that when entrepreneurs feel more uncertain  they identify more opportunities  within person difference   but entrepreneurs who perceive more uncertainties than others do not identify more opportunities than others do  no between person difference             

Partnering edit 
Startups may form partnerships with other firms to enable their business model to operate              To become attractive to other businesses  startups need to align their internal features  such as management style and products with the market situation  In their      study  Kask and Linton develop two ideal profiles  or also known as configurations or archetypes  for startups that are commercializing inventions  The inheritor profile calls for a management style that is not too entrepreneurial  more conservative  and the startup should have an incremental invention  building on a previous standard   This profile is set out to be more successful  in finding a business partner  in a market with a dominant design  a clear standard is applied in this market   In contrast to this  profile is the originator which has a management style that is highly entrepreneurial and in which a radical invention or a disruptive innovation  totally new standard  is being developed  This profile is set out to be more successful  in finding a business partner  in a market that does not have a dominant design  established standard   New startups should align themselves to one of the profiles when commercializing an invention to be able to find and be attractive to a business partner  By finding a business partner  a startup has greater chances of success             
Startups usually need many different partners to realize their business idea  The commercialization process is often a bumpy road with iterations and new insights during the process  Hasche and Linton             argue that startups can learn from their relationships with other firms  and even if the relationship ends  the startup will have gained valuable knowledge about how it should move on going forward  When a relationship is failing for a startup it needs to make changes  Three types of changes can be identified according to Hasche and Linton             

Change of business concept for the start up
Change of collaboration constellation  change several relationships 
Change of characteristic of business relationship  with the partner  e g  from a transactional relationship to more of a collaborative type of relationship 
Entrepreneurial learning edit 
See also  Validated learning
Startups need to learn at a huge speed before running out of resources  Proactive actions  experimentation  searching  etc   enhance a founder s learning to start a company              To learn effectively  founders often formulate falsifiable hypotheses  build a minimum viable product  MVP   and conduct A B testing 

Business model design edit 
With the key learnings from market validation  design thinking  and lean startup  founders can design a business model  However it is important not to dive into business models too early before there is sufficient learning on market validation  Paul Graham said   What I tell founders is not to sweat the business model too much at first  The most important task at first is to build something people want  If you don t do that  it won t matter how clever your business model is              

Founders entrepreneurs edit 
Main article  Organizational founder
Founders or co founders are people involved in the initial launch of startup companies  Three people are mainly required as co founders to create a powerful team  the product person  e g  an engineer   a marketing person  for market research  customer interaction  vision  and a finance or operation s person  to handle operations or raise funds  
The founder that is responsible for the overall strategy of the startup plays the role of founder CEOs  much like CEOs in established firms  Startup studios provide an opportunity for founders and team members to grow along with the business they help to build  In order to create forward momentum  founders must ensure that they provide opportunities for their team members to grow and evolve within the company             
The language of securities regulation in the United States considers co founders to be promoters under Regulation D  The U S  Securities and Exchange Commission definition of promoter includes   i  Any person who  acting alone or in conjunction with one or more other persons  directly or indirectly takes initiative in founding and organizing the business or enterprise of an issuer              However  not every promoter is a co founder  In fact  there is no formal  legal definition of what makes somebody a co founder                                      The right to call oneself a co founder can be established through an agreement with one s fellow co founders or with permission of the board of directors  investors  or shareholders of a startup company  When there is no definitive agreement  like shareholders  agreement   disputes about who the co founders are  can arise 

Self efficacy edit 
Self efficacy refers to the confidence an individual has to create a new business or startup  It has a strong relation with startup actions              Entrepreneurs  sense of self efficacy can play a major role in how they approach goals  tasks  and challenges  Entrepreneurs with high self efficacy that is  those who believe they can perform well are more likely to view difficult tasks as something to be mastered rather than something to be avoided 

Stress edit 


Startups are pressure cookers  Don t let the casual dress and playful office environment fool you  New enterprises operate under do or die conditions  If you do not roll out a useable product or service in a timely fashion  the company will fail  Bye bye paycheck  hello eviction 


Iman Jalali  chief of staff at ContextMedia                 unreliable source      

Entrepreneurs often feel stressed  They have internal and external pressures  Internally  they need to meet deadlines to develop the prototypes and get the product or service ready for market  Externally they are expected to meet milestones of investors and other stakeholders to ensure continued resources from them on the startups              Coping with stress is critical to entrepreneurs because of the stressful nature of starting up a new firm under uncertainty  Coping with stress unsuccessfully could lead to emotional exhaustion  and the founders may close or exit the startups 

Emotional exhaustion edit 
Sustaining effort is required as the startup process can take a long period of time  by one estimate  three years or longer              Sustaining effort over the long term is especially challenging because of the high failure rates and uncertain outcomes             

Founder identity and culture edit 
Some startup founders have a more casual or offbeat attitude in their dress  office space and marketing  as compared to executives in established corporations  For example  startup founders in the     s wore hoodies  sneakers and other casual clothes to business meetings  Their offices may have recreational facilities in them  such as pool tables  ping pong tables  football tables and pinball machines  which are used to create a fun work environment  stimulate team development and team spirit  and encourage creativity  Some of the casual approaches  such as the use of  flat  organizational structures  in which regular employees can talk with the founders and chief executive officers informally  are done to promote efficiency in the workplace  which is needed to get their business off the ground             
In a      study  Douglas McGregor stressed that punishments and rewards for uniformity in the workplace are not necessary because some people are born with the motivation to work without incentives              Some startups do not use a strict command and control hierarchical structure  with executives  managers  supervisors and employees  Some startups offer employees incentives such as stock options  to increase their  buy in  from the start up  as these employees stand to gain if the company does well   This removal of stressors allows the workers and researchers in the startup to focus less on the work environment around them  and more on achieving the task at hand  giving them the potential to achieve something great for both themselves and their company 

Failure edit 
The failure rate of startup companies is very high  A      article in Fortune estimated that     of startups ultimately fail  In a sample of     unsuccessful startups  companies reported that experiencing one or more of five common factors were the reason for failure  the lack of consumer interest in the product or service      of failures   funding or cash problems        personnel or staffing problems        competition from rival companies       and problems with pricing of the product or service                   In cases of funding problems  it can leave employees without paychecks  Sometimes  these companies are purchased by other companies if they are deemed to be viable  but oftentimes  they leave employees with very little recourse to recoup lost income for worked time              More than one third of founders believe that running out of money led to failure  Second to that  founders attribute their failure to a lack of financing or investor interest  These common mistakes and missteps that happen early in the startup journey can result in failure  but there are precautions entrepreneurs can take to help mitigate risk  For example  startup studios offer a buffer against many of the obstacles that solo entrepreneurs face  such as funding and insufficient team structure  making them a good resource for startups in their earliest phases              Another large study of         failed companies  identified key factors such as a dysfunctional founding team  a poor business plan  or just a flawed product market fit as examples of the primary sources of failure             
The lack of human and financial resources or even dedicated patent attorneys in the early stages of a startup makes it difficult to compete with larger companies  and likewise increases the time and reduces the probability of patent applications             

Re starters edit 
Failed entrepreneurs  or restarters  who after some time restart in the same sector with more or less the same activities  have an increased chance              of becoming a better entrepreneur              However  some studies indicate that restarters are more heavily discouraged in Europe than in the US             

Training edit 
See also  Entrepreneurship education
Many institutions and universities provide training on startups  In the context of universities  some of the courses are entrepreneurship courses that also deal with the topic of startups  while other courses are specifically dedicated to startups  Startup courses are found both in traditional economic or business disciplines as well as the side of information technology disciplines  As startups are often focused on software  they are also occasionally taught while focusing on software development alongside the business aspects of a startup             
Founders go through a lot to set up a startup  A startup requires patience and resilience  and training programs need to have both the business components and the psychological components              Entrepreneurship education is effective in increasing the entrepreneurial attitudes and perceived behavioral control              helping people and their businesses grow              Most of startup training falls into the mode of experiential learning                          in which students are exposed to a large extent to a real life entrepreneurship context as new venture teams                          An example of group based experiential startup training is the Lean LaunchPad initiative that applies the principles of customer development             and Lean Startup             to technology based startup projects 
As startups are typically thought to operate under a notable lack of resources              have little or no operating history              and to consist of individuals with little practical experience                          it is possible to simulate startups in a classroom setting with reasonable accuracy  In fact  it is not uncommon for students to actually participate in real startups during and after their studies  Similarly  university courses teaching software startup themes often have students found mock up startups during the courses and encourage them to make them into real startups should they wish to do so              Such mock up startups  however  may not be enough to accurately simulate real world startup practice if the challenges typically faced by startups  e g  lack of funding to keep operating  are not present in the course setting             
To date  much of the entrepreneurship training is yet to be personalized to match the participants and the training 

Ecosystem edit 
A startup ecosystem can contribute to local entrepreneurial culture 
The size and maturity of the startup ecosystem is where a startup is launched and where it grows to have an effect on the volume and success of the startups  The startup ecosystem consists of the individuals  entrepreneurs  venture capitalists  angel investors  mentors  advisors   institutions and organizations  top research universities and institutes  business schools and entrepreneurship programs and centres operated by universities and colleges  non profit entrepreneurship support organizations  government entrepreneurship programs and services  Chambers of commerce  business incubators and business accelerators and top performing entrepreneurial firms and startups  A region with all of these elements is considered to be a  strong  startup ecosystem 
One of the most famous startup ecosystems is Silicon Valley in California  where major computer and internet firms and top universities such as Stanford University create a stimulating startup environment  Boston  where Massachusetts Institute of Technology is located  and Berlin  home of WISTA  a top research area   also have numerous creative industries  leading entrepreneurs and startup firms  Basically  attempts are being made worldwide  for example in Israel with its Silicon Wadi  in France with the Inovall e or in Italy in Trieste with the AREA Science Park  to network basic research  universities and technology parks in order to create a startup friendly ecosystem 
Although there are startups created in all types of businesses  and all over the world  some locations and business sectors are particularly associated with startup companies  The internet bubble of the late     s was associated with huge numbers of internet startup companies  some selling the technology to provide internet access  others using the internet to provide services  Most of this startup activity was located in the most well known startup ecosystem   Silicon Valley  an area of northern California renowned for the high level of startup company activity 

The spark that set off the explosive boom of  Silicon startups  in Stanford Industrial Park was a personal dispute in      between employees of Shockley Semiconductor and the company s namesake and founder  Nobel laureate and co inventor of the transistor William Shockley     His employees  formed Fairchild Semiconductor immediately following their departure   
After several years  Fairchild gained its footing  becoming a formidable presence in this sector  Its founders began leaving to start companies based on their own latest ideas and were followed on this path by their own former leading employees    The process gained momentum and what had once begun in a Stanford s research park became a veritable startup avalanche    Thus  over the course of just    years  a mere eight of Shockley s former employees gave forth    new enterprises  which then went on to do the same                
Startup advocates are also trying to build a community of tech startups in New York City with organizations like NY Tech Meet Up             and Built in NYC              In the early     s  the patent assets of failed startup companies were being purchased by people known as patent trolls  who assert those patents against companies that might be infringing the technology covered by the patents

Startup investing is the action of making an investment in an early stage company  Beyond founders  own contributions  some startups raise additional investment at some or several stages of their growth  Not all startups trying to raise investments are successful in their fundraising      citation needed     Venture Capital is a subdivision of Private Equity wherein external investors fund small scale startups that have high growth potential in the long run  Venture capital is the money of invention that is invested into young businesses which hold no historic background  Usually  the business of venture capital is highly risky but one can at the same time expect high returns as well             
In the United States  the solicitation of funds became easier for startups as result of the JOBS Act                                                  Prior to the advent of equity crowdfunding  a form of online investing that has been legalized in several nations  startups did not advertise themselves to the general public as investment opportunities until and unless they first obtained approval from regulators for an initial public offering  IPO  that typically involved a listing of the startup s securities on a stock exchange  Today  there are many alternative forms of IPO commonly employed by startups and startup promoters that do not include an exchange listing  so they may avoid certain regulatory compliance obligations  including mandatory periodic disclosures of financial information and factual discussion of business conditions by management that investors and potential investors routinely receive from registered public companies             
Over the last decade  Europe has developed a rapid start up scene that has given birth to global players  including more than    unicorns  and has created more than two million jobs  Investment in European start ups increased sixfold between      and       reaching approximately     billion                          Europe does a poorer job of nurturing young companies because of a failure to support their development into industry leaders  Promising European start ups then struggle to raise the necessary capital to expand and mature  They are forced to either relocate to the US s deep capital markets or sell themselves to larger rivals with more financial availability  As a result  start ups in the United States can typically raise far more money up to five times as much as in Europe                         
Investors are generally most attracted to those new companies distinguished by their strong co founding team  a balanced  risk reward  profile  in which high risk due to the untested  disruptive innovations is balanced out by high potential returns  and  scalability   the likelihood that a startup can expand its operations by serving more markets or more customers       citation needed      Attractive startups generally have lower  bootstrapping   self funding of startups by the founders  costs  higher risk  and higher potential return on investment  Successful startups are typically more scalable than an established business  in the sense that the startup has the potential to grow rapidly with a limited investment of capital  labor or land                  failed verification      Timing has often been the single most important factor for biggest startup successes              while at the same time it is identified to be one of the hardest things to master by many serial entrepreneurs and investors             
Startups have several options for funding  Revenue based financing lenders can help startup companies by providing non dilutive growth capital in exchange for a percentage of monthly revenue              Venture capital firms and angel investors may help startup companies begin operations  exchanging seed money for an equity stake in the firm  Venture capitalists and angel investors provide financing to a range of startups  a portfolio   with the expectation that a very small number of the startups will become viable and make money  In practice though  many startups are initially funded by the founders themselves using  bootstrapping   in which loans or monetary gifts from friends and family are combined with savings and credit card debt to finance the venture  Factoring is another option  though it is not unique to startups  Other funding opportunities include various forms of crowdfunding  for example equity crowdfunding              in which the startup seeks funding from a large number of individuals  typically by pitching their idea on the Internet 
Startups can receive funding via more involved stakeholders  such as startup studios  Startup studios provide funding to support the business through a successful launch  but they also provide extensive operational support  such as HR  finance and accounting  marketing  and product development  to increase the probability of success and propel growth             
Startup are funded through preset rounds  depending on their funding requirement and the stage of growth of the company  Startup investing is generally divided into six stage  namely

Angel funding
Seed Funding
Pre Series A
Series B
Series C D
Series E  F and Beyond             
Necessity of funding edit 
While some  would be  entrepreneurs believe that they can t start a company without funding from VC  Angel  etc       that is not the case              In fact  many entrepreneurs have founded successful businesses for almost no capital  including the founders of MailChimp  Shopify  and ShutterStock             

Valuations edit 
If a company s value is based on its technology  it is often equally important for the business owners to obtain intellectual property protection for their idea  The newsmagazine The Economist estimated that up to     of the value of US public companies is now based on their intellectual property  up from     in                    Often       of a small startup company s value is based on its intellectual property  As such  it is important for technology oriented startup companies to develop a sound strategy for protecting their intellectual capital as early as possible              Startup companies  particularly those associated with new technology  sometimes produce huge returns to their creators and investors a recent example of such is Google  whose creators became billionaires through their stock ownership and options 

Investing rounds edit 
When investing in a startup  there are different types of stages in which the investor can participate  The first round is called seed round  The seed round generally is when the startup is still in the very early phase of execution when their product is still in the prototype phase  There is likely no performance data or positive financials as of yet  Therefore  investors rely on strength of the idea and the team in place  At this level  family friends and angel investors will be the ones participating  At this stage the level of risk and payoff are at their greatest  The next round is called Series A  At this point the company already has traction and may be making revenue  In Series A rounds venture capital firms will be participating alongside angels or super angel investors  The next rounds are Series B  C  and D  These three rounds are the ones leading towards the Initial Public Offering  IPO   Venture capital firms and private equity firms will be participating              Series B  Companies are generating consistent revenue but must scale to meet growing demand  Series C  amp  D  Companies with strong financial performance looking to expand to new markets  develop new products  make an acquisition  and or preparing for IPO 

History of startup investing edit 
After the Great Depression  which was blamed in part on a rise in speculative investments in unregulated small companies  startup investing was primarily a word of mouth activity reserved for the friends and family of a startup s co founders  business angels  and Venture Capital funds  In the United States  this has been the case ever since the implementation of the Securities Act of       Many nations implemented similar legislation to prohibit general solicitation and general advertising of unregistered securities  including shares offered by startup companies  In       a new Accelerator investment model was introduced by Y Combinator that combined fixed terms investment model with fixed period intense bootcamp style training program  to streamline the seed early stage investment process with training to be more systematic 
Following Y Combinator  many accelerators with similar models have emerged around the world  The accelerator model has since become very common and widely spread and they are key organizations of any Startup ecosystem  Title II of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act  JOBS Act   first implemented on    September       granted startups in and startup co founders or promoters in US  the right to generally solicit and advertise publicly using any method of communication on the condition that only accredited investors are allowed to purchase the securities                                      However the regulations affecting equity crowdfunding in different countries vary a lot with different levels and models of freedom and restrictions  In many countries there are no limitations restricting general public from investing to startups  while there can still be other types of restrictions in place  like limiting the amount that companies can seek from investors  Due to positive development and growth of crowdfunding              many countries are actively updating their regulation in regards to crowdfunding 

Investing online edit 
The first known investment based crowdfunding platform for startups was launched in February      by Grow VC              followed by the first US  based company ProFounder launching model for startups to raise investments directly on the site              but ProFounder later decided to shut down its business due regulatory reasons preventing them from continuing              having launched their model for US  markets prior to JOBS Act  With the positive progress of the JOBS Act for crowd investing in US   equity crowdfunding platforms like SeedInvest and CircleUp started to emerge in      and platforms such as investiere  Companisto and Seedrs in Europe and OurCrowd in Israel  The idea of these platforms is to streamline the process and resolve the two main points that were taking place in the market  The first problem was for startups to be able to access capital and to decrease the amount of time that it takes to close a round of financing  The second problem was intended to increase the amount of deal flow for the investor and to also centralize the process                         

Internal startups edit 
Internal startups are a form of corporate entrepreneurship              Large or well established companies often try to promote innovation by setting up  internal startups   new business divisions that operate at arm s length from the rest of the company  Examples include Bell Labs  a research unit within the Bell System and Target Corporation  which began as an internal startup of the Dayton s department store chain  and threedegrees  a product developed by an internal startup of Microsoft             

Unicorns edit 
See also  List of unicorn startup companies
Some startups become big and they become unicorns  i e  privately held startup companies valued at over US   billion  The term was coined in      by venture capitalist Aileen Lee  choosing the mythical animal to represent the statistical rarity of such successful ventures  According to TechCrunch  there were     unicorns as of May       and most of the unicorns are in the US  followed by China  The unicorns are concentrated in a few countries  The unicorn leaders are the U S  with     companies  China with      India with                 and the U K  with                 The largest unicorns included Ant Financial  ByteDance  DiDi  Uber  Xiaomi  and Airbnb  When the value of a company is over US    billion  the company will be called as a decacorn  When the company is valued over US     billion  hectocorn will be used 

Critiques of the start up mode edit 
According to Nikos Smyrnaios  Silicon Valley s start ups are emblematic of the post Fordist enterprise              reflecting a move toward values of liberty  autonomy and authenticity  and away from the Fordist emphasis on solidarity  economic security and equality 
For some researchers  such as Antoine Gouritin  the start up model  like many digital related objects  is underpinned by a  solutionist  logic  as Evgeny Morozov describes it  Technological solutionism corresponds to the belief that thanks to digital tools such as those created by start ups  simple and technical solutions can be found to all kinds of problems  Therefore  what is expected of start ups is not that they address the root causes of problems  but that they find effective technical solutions quickly             
The organizational model of start ups is also questioned by former employees  For example  Mathilde Ramadier  a former start up employee  brings the debate to the fore in France with her book Bienvenue dans le nouveau monde  Comment j ai surv cu   la coolitude des start ups  Welcome to the new world  How I survived start up coolness  in                   Since then  awareness     clarification needed      has been growing              The non hierarchical organization of start ups means that all employees bear equal responsibility for their running smoothly  They are based on voluntary commitment and internalized behavioral norms rather than formal hierarchical constraints              Employees  encouraged to meet targets  often exceed overtime limits  Professional and personal life often blend in this highly connected environment  Employees are expected  without discussion  to give of themselves without counting the cost  to be always reachable and available  without asking for compensation commensurate with their professional commitment  in terms of time and activities   and to place the general interest of the organization before their personal interest  Finally  the employment contracts of start up employees are often precarious since the company itself is not completely stable             
Economist Scott A  Shane has used data on start ups published in many countries to draw conclusions in terms of public policy  He is critical of public policy that encourages start ups  pointing to evidence that these policies lead people to create marginal businesses that are more likely to fail  have little economic impact  and generate a very limited number of jobs             

Today edit 
Today  the San Francisco bay area has the highest number of startups globally  with         It is followed by New York City with        and Silicon Wadi in Israel  with around       which is the highest per capita figure in the world                           
According to PitchBook research  nearly   in   startups claims to be an Artificial intelligence company as of

 Proceedings of the  th European Conference on Innovation      p    In other words  failed entrepreneurs will set up a new business with more and better know how  Especially if they choose to restart in the same sector with more or less the same activities  there is a big chance that the restarter becomes the better entrepreneur  Schror         Restarters in this study are defined as entrepreneurs  whose company went bankrupt  but who  after some time  have the courage to start a new company  i e   pure  restarters   

  Adam Jolly The European Business Handbook                      p   Our interviews with entrepreneurial restarters underscore the fact that failure is still severely stigmatised in Europe  In marked contrast to the United States  there is no general public perception in Europe that failure  is a necessary precondition for success
