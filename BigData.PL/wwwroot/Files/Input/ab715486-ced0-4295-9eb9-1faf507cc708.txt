developers can develop a SPA Single page application  easily  Some of them provide inbuilt functions or pre defined components so that developer can directly use those in their projects jQuery    Introduced in August      and now at version        is an open source JavaScript library specializing in DOM manipulation  CSS editing  event handling  AJAX requests  animations  and DOM traversal  It

accommodate different device sizes  Media Queries  CSS tool defining responsive changes at specific points based on device characteristics  Query in CSS is also used to make web pages responsive  In that we describe what to change on specific point  Frontend SecurityWhenever we create any web page and there is a section for login or signup then there must be a security so that the password given by the user must be secured and can not be accessed by third party between the login session  so we must provide security to our web pages  same goes for the web pages where a payment statement or any other confidential data is transfered or stored  These are the attacks that can make your web page more risky DoS  denial of service  attacks  This attack is common in all the other attacks  It can be difficult to deal with this attack as it is originate from thousand of systems in a single time and make your web page very slow  In this attack the attacker try to access the web page from thousands
