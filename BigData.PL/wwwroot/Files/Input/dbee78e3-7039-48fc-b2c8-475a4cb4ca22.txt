Philosophical concept
In the philosophy of mind  the hard problem of consciousness is to explain why and how humans and other organisms have qualia  phenomenal consciousness  or subjective experience                        It is contrasted with the  easy problems  of explaining why and how physical systems give a human being the ability to discriminate  to integrate information  and to perform behavioural functions such as watching  listening  speaking  including generating an utterance that appears to refer to personal behaviour or belief   and so forth             The easy problems are amenable to functional explanation that is  explanations that are mechanistic or behavioural since each physical system can be explained purely by reference to the  structure and dynamics  that underpin the phenomenon                       
Proponents of the hard problem argue that it is categorically different from the easy problems since no mechanistic or behavioural explanation could explain the character of an experience  not even in principle  Even after all the relevant functional facts are explicated  they argue  there will still remain a further question   why is the performance of these functions accompanied by experience              To bolster their case  proponents of the hard problem frequently turn to various philosophical thought experiments  involving philosophical zombies  which  they claim  are conceivable  or inverted qualia  or the claimed ineffability of colour experiences  or the claimed unknowability of foreign states of consciousness  such as the experience of being a bat

The terms  hard problem  and  easy problems  were coined by the philosopher David Chalmers in a      talk given at The Science of Consciousness conference held in Tucson  Arizona             The following year  the main talking points of Chalmers  talk were published in The Journal of Consciousness Studies             The publication gained significant attention from consciousness researchers and became the subject of a special volume of the journal                        which was later published into a book             In       Chalmers published The Conscious Mind  a book length treatment of the hard problem  in which he elaborated on his core arguments and responded to counterarguments  His use of the word easy is  tongue in cheek              As the cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker puts it  they are about as easy as going to Mars or curing cancer   That is  scientists more or less know what to look for  and with enough brainpower and funding  they would probably crack it in this century             
The existence of the hard problem is disputed  It has been accepted by some philosophers of mind such as Joseph Levine              Colin McGinn              and Ned Block             and cognitive neuroscientists such as Francisco Varela              Giulio Tononi                          and Christof Koch                          On the other hand  its existence is denied by other philosophers of mind  such as Daniel Dennett              Massimo Pigliucci              Thomas Metzinger  Patricia Churchland              and Keith Frankish              and by cognitive neuroscientists such as Stanislas Dehaene              Bernard Baars              Anil Seth              and Antonio Damasio              Clinical neurologist and sceptic Steven Novella has dismissed it as  the hard non problem               According to a      PhilPapers survey  a majority          of the philosophers surveyed said they believed that the hard problem is a genuine problem  while        said that it does not exist             
There are a number of other potential philosophical problems that are related to the Hard Problem  Ned Block believes that there exists a  Harder Problem of Consciousness   due to the possibility of different physical and functional neurological systems potentially having phenomenal overlap              Another potential philosophical problem which is closely related to Benj Hellie s vertiginous question  dubbed  The Even Harder Problem of Consciousness   refers to why a given individual has their own particular personal identity  as opposed to existing as someone else             


Overview edit 
Cognitive scientist David Chalmers first formulated the hard problem in his paper  Facing up to the problem of consciousness                    and expanded upon it in The Conscious Mind         His works provoked comment  Some  such as philosopher David Lewis and Steven Pinker  have praised Chalmers for his argumentative rigour and  impeccable clarity               Pinker later said  in        In the end I still think that the hard problem is a meaningful conceptual problem  but agree with Dennett that it is not a meaningful scientific problem  No one will ever get a grant to study whether you are a zombie or whether the same Captain Kirk walks on the deck of the Enterprise and the surface of Zakdorn  And I agree with several other philosophers that it may be futile to hope for a solution at all  precisely because it is a conceptual problem  or  more accurately  a problem with our concepts               Daniel Dennett and Patricia Churchland  among others  believe that the hard problem is best seen as a collection of easy problems that will be solved through further analysis of the brain and behaviour                         
Consciousness is an ambiguous term  It can be used to mean self consciousness  awareness  the state of being awake  and so on  Chalmers uses Thomas Nagel s definition of consciousness   the feeling of what it is like to be something   Consciousness  in this sense  is synonymous with experience                         

Chalmers  formulation edit 
     even when we have explained the performance of all the cognitive and behavioral functions in the vicinity of experience perceptual discrimination  categorization  internal access  verbal report there may still remain a further unanswered question  Why is the performance of these functions accompanied by experience         David Chalmers  Facing up to the problem of consciousnessThe problems of consciousness  Chalmers argues  are of two kinds  the easy problems and the hard problem 
Easy problems edit 
The easy problems are amenable to reductive enquiry  They are a logical consequence of lower level facts about the world  similar to how a clock s ability to tell time is a logical consequence of its clockwork and structure  or a hurricane being a logical consequence of the structures and functions of certain weather patterns  A clock  a hurricane  and the easy problems  are all the sum of their parts  as are most things              
The easy problems relevant to consciousness concern mechanistic analysis of the neural processes that accompany behaviour  Examples of these include how sensory systems work  how sensory data is processed in the brain  how that data influences behaviour or verbal reports  the neural basis of thought and emotion  and so on  They are problems that can be analysed through  structures and functions              

Hard problem edit 
The hard problem  in contrast  is the problem of why and how those processes are accompanied by experience             It may further include the question of why these processes are accompanied by this or that particular experience  rather than some other kind of experience  In other words  the hard problem is the problem of explaining why certain mechanisms are accompanied by conscious experience              For example  why should neural processing in the brain lead to the felt sensations of  say  feelings of hunger  And why should those neural firings lead to feelings of hunger rather than some other feeling  such as  for example  feelings of thirst  
Chalmers argues that it is conceivable that the relevant behaviours associated with hunger  or any other feeling  could occur even in the absence of that feeling  This suggests that experience is irreducible to physical systems such as the brain  This is the topic of the next section 

How the easy and hard problems are related edit 
Chalmers believes that the hard problem is irreducible to the easy problems  solving the easy problems will not lead to a solution to the hard problems  This is because the easy problems pertain to the causal structure of the world while the hard problem pertains to consciousness  and facts about consciousness include facts that go beyond mere causal or structural description             

For example  suppose someone were to stub their foot and yelp  In this scenario  the easy problems are mechanistic explanations that involve the activity of the nervous system and brain and its relation to the environment  such as the propagation of nerve signals from the toe to the brain  the processing of that information and how it leads to yelping  and so on   The hard problem is the question of why these mechanisms are accompanied by the feeling of pain  or why these feelings of pain feel the particular way that they do  Chalmers argues that facts about the neural mechanisms of pain  and pain behaviours  do not lead to facts about conscious experience  Facts about conscious experience are  instead  further facts  not derivable from facts about the brain                         The hard problem is often illustrated by appealing to the logical possibility of inverted visible spectra  If there is no logical contradiction in supposing that one s colour vision could be inverted  it follows that mechanistic explanations of visual processing do not determine facts about what it is like to see colours  An explanation for all of the relevant physical facts about neural processing would leave unexplained facts about what it is like to feel pain  This is in part because functions and physical structures of any sort could conceivably exist in the absence of experience  Alternatively  they could exist alongside a different set of experiences  For example  it is logically possible for a perfect replica of Chalmers to have no experience at all  or for it to have a different set of experiences  such as an inverted visible spectrum  so that the blue yellow red green axes of its visual field are flipped              
The same cannot be said about clocks  hurricanes  or other physical things  In those cases  a structural or functional description is a complete description  A perfect replica of a clock is a clock  a perfect replica of a hurricane is a hurricane  and so on  The difference is that physical things are nothing more than their physical constituents  For example  water is nothing more than H O molecules  and understanding everything about H O molecules is to understand everything there is to know about water  But consciousness is not like this  Knowing everything there is to know about the brain  or any physical system  is not to know everything there is to know about consciousness  Consciousness  then  must not be purely physical             

Implications for physicalism edit 
See also  Physicalism
A swarm of birds showing high order structure emerging from simpler physical constituents
Chalmers s idea contradicts physicalism  sometimes labelled materialism  This is the view that everything that exists is a physical or material thing  so everything can be reduced to microphysical things  For example  the rings of Saturn are a physical thing because they are nothing more than a complex arrangement of a large number of subatomic particles interacting in a certain way  According to physicalism  everything  including consciousness  can be explained by appeal to its microphysical constituents  Chalmers s hard problem presents a counterexample to this view and to other phenomena like swarms of birds  since it suggests that consciousness  like swarms of birds  cannot be reductively explained by appealing to their physical constituents  Thus  if the hard problem is a real problem then physicalism must be false  and if physicalism is true then the hard problem must not be a real problem      citation needed     
Though Chalmers rejects physicalism  he is still a naturalist                  importance      
Christian List argues that the existence of first person perspectives and the inability for physicalism to answer Hellie s vertiginous question is evidence against physicalism  since first personal facts cannot supervene on physical third personal facts              List also claims that there exists a  quadrilemma  for metaphysical theories of consciousness  and that for the metaphysical claims of first person realism  non solipsism  non fragmentation  and one world  at least one of these must be false              List has proposed a model he calls the  many worlds theory of consciousness  in order to reconcile the subjective nature of consciousness without lapsing into solipsism             

Historical precedents edit 



Wikiquote has quotations related to Hard problem of consciousness 

The hard problem of consciousness has scholarly antecedents considerably earlier than Chalmers  Chalmers himself notes that  a number of thinkers in the recent and distant past  have  recognised the particular difficulties of explaining consciousness               He states that all his original      paper contributed to the discussion was  a catchy name  a minor reformulation of philosophically familiar points              
Among others  thinkers who have made arguments similar to Chalmers  formulation of the hard problem include Isaac Newton              John Locke              Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz                          John Stuart Mill              and Thomas Henry Huxley                          Likewise  Asian philosophers like Dharmakirti and Guifeng Zongmi discussed the problem of how consciousness arises from unconscious matter                                                  The Tattva Bodha  an eighth century text attributed to Adi Shankara from the Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism  describes consciousness being anubhati  or self revealing  illuminating all objects of knowledge without itself being a material object

The mind body problem edit 
Main article  Mind body problem
The mind body problem is the problem of how the mind and the body relate  The mind body problem is more general than the hard problem of consciousness  since it is the problem of discovering how the mind and body relate in general  thereby implicating any theoretical framework that broaches the topic  The hard problem  in contrast  is often construed as a problem uniquely faced by physicalist or materialist theories of mind 

 What Is It Like to Be a Bat   edit 
Main article  What Is It Like to Be a Bat 
The philosopher Thomas Nagel posited in his      paper  What Is It Like to Be a Bat   that experiences are essentially subjective  accessible only to the individual undergoing them i e   felt only by the one feeling them   while physical states are essentially objective  accessible to multiple individuals   So he argued we have no idea what it could mean to claim that an essentially subjective state just is an essentially non subjective state  i e   that a felt state is nothing but a functional state   In other words  we have no idea of what reductivism amounts to              He believes  every subjective phenomenon is essentially connected with a single point of view  and it seems inevitable that an objective  physical theory will abandon that point of view              

Explanatory gap edit 
Main article  Explanatory gap
See also  Reductionism
In       the philosopher Joseph Levine proposed that there is an explanatory gap between our understanding of the physical world and our understanding of consciousness             
Levine s disputes that conscious states are reducible to neuronal or brain states  He uses the example of pain  as an example of a conscious state  and its reduction to the firing of c fibers  a kind of nerve cell   The difficulty is as follows  even if consciousness is physical  it is not clear which physical states correspond to which conscious states  The bridges between the two levels of description will be contingent  rather than necessary  This is significant because in most contexts  relating two scientific levels of descriptions  such as physics and chemistry  is done with the assurance of necessary connections between the two theories  for example  chemistry follows with necessity from physics              
Levine illustrates this with a thought experiment  Suppose that humanity were to encounter an alien species  and suppose it is known that the aliens do not have any c fiber  Even if one knows this  it is not obvious that the aliens do not feel pain  that would remain an open question  This is because the fact that aliens do not have c fibers does not entail that they do not feel pain  in other words  feelings of pain do not follow with logical necessity from the firing of c fibers   Levine thinks such thought experiments demonstrate an explanatory gap between consciousness and the physical world  even if consciousness is reducible to physical things  consciousness cannot be explained in terms of physical things  because the link between physical things and consciousness is a contingent link             
Levine does not think that the explanatory gap means that consciousness is not physical  he is open to the idea that the explanatory gap is only an epistemological problem for physicalism              In contrast  Chalmers thinks that the hard problem of consciousness does show that consciousness is not physical             

Philosophical zombies edit 
Main article  Philosophical zombie
Philosophical zombies are a thought experiment commonly used in discussions of the hard problem                          They are hypothetical beings physically identical to humans but that lack conscious experience              Philosophers such as Chalmers  Joseph Levine  and Francis Kripke take zombies as impossible within the bounds of nature but possible within the bounds of logic              This would imply that facts about experience are not logically entailed by the  physical  facts  Therefore  consciousness is irreducible  In Chalmers  words   after God  hypothetically  created the world  he had more work to do               Daniel Dennett  a philosopher of mind  criticised the field s use of  the zombie hunch  which he deems an  embarrassment              that ought to  be dropped like a hot potato              

Knowledge argument edit 
Main article  Knowledge argument
The knowledge argument  also known as Mary s Room  is another common thought experiment  A hypothetical neuroscientist named Mary has lived her whole life in a black and white room and has never seen colour before  She also happens to know everything there is to know about the brain and colour perception              Chalmers believes                 page      needed      that when Mary sees the colour red for the first time  she gains new knowledge   the knowledge of  what red looks like    which is distinct from  and irreducible to  her prior physical knowledge of the brain or visual system  A stronger form of the knowledge argument             claims not merely that Mary would lack subjective knowledge of  what red looks like   but that she would lack knowledge of an objective fact about the world  namely   what red looks like   a non physical fact that can be learned only through direct experience  qualia   Others  such as Thomas Nagel  take a  physicalist  position  disagree with the argument in its stronger and or weaker forms              For example  Nagel put forward a  speculative proposal  of devising a language that could  explain to a person blind from birth what it is like to see               The knowledge argument implies that such a language could not exist 

Philosophical responses edit 
David Chalmers  formulation of the hard problem of consciousness provoked considerable debate within philosophy of mind  as well as scientific research             

A diagram showing the relationship between various views concerning the relationship between consciousness and the physical world
The hard problem is considered a problem primarily for physicalist views of the mind  the view that the mind is a physical object or process   since physical explanations tend to be functional  or structural  Because of this  some physicalists have responded to the hard problem by seeking to show that it dissolves upon analysis  Other researchers accept the problem as real and seek to develop a theory of consciousness  place in the world that can solve it  by either modifying physicalism or abandoning it in favour of an alternative ontology  such as panpsychism or dualism  
A third response has been to accept the hard problem as real but deny human cognitive faculties can solve it 
PhilPapers is an organisation that archives academic philosophy papers and periodically surveys professional philosophers about their views  It can be used to gauge professional attitudes towards the hard problem  As of the      survey results  it seems that the majority of philosophers          agree that the hard problem is real  with a substantial minority that disagrees                      
Attitudes towards physicalism also differ among professionals  In the      PhilPapers survey        of philosophers surveyed subscribed to physicalism and       of philosophers surveyed rejected physicalism        fell into the  other  category              In the      PhilPapers survey         of philosophers surveyed indicated that they  accept or lean towards  physicalism and        indicated that they reject physicalism        were  agnostic  or  undecided              
Different solutions have been proposed to the hard problem of consciousness  The sections below taxonomizes the various responses to the hard problem  The shape of this taxonomy was first introduced by Chalmers in a      literature review on the topic              The labelling convention of this taxonomy has been incorporated into the technical vocabulary of analytic philosophy  being used by philosophers such as Adrian Boutel              Raamy Majeed              Janet Levin              Pete Mandik  amp  Josh Weisberg              Roberto Pereira              and Helen Yetter Chappell             

Type A Materialism edit 
Further information  Reductive materialism and A priori physicalism
Type A materialism  also known as reductive materialism or a priori physicalism  is a view characterised by a commitment to physicalism and a full rejection of the hard problem  By this view  the hard problem either does not exist or is just another easy problem  because every fact about the mind is a fact about the performance of various functions or behaviours  So  once all the relevant functions and behaviours have been accounted for  there will not be any facts left over in need of explanation              Thinkers who subscribe to type A materialism include Paul and Patricia Churchland  Daniel Dennett  Keith Frankish  and Thomas Metzinger 
Some type A materialists believe in the reality of phenomenal consciousness but believe it is nothing extra in addition to certain functions or behaviours  This view is sometimes referred to as strong reductionism                          Other type A materialists may reject the existence of phenomenal consciousness entirely  This view is referred to as eliminative materialism or illusionism                                     

Strong reductionism edit 
Many philosophers have disputed that there is a hard problem of consciousness distinct from what Chalmers calls the easy problems of consciousness  Some among them  who are sometimes termed strong reductionists  hold that phenomenal consciousness  i e   conscious experience  does exist but that it can be fully understood as reducible to the brain             
Broadly  strong reductionists accept that conscious experience is real but argue it can be fully understood in functional terms as an emergent property of the material brain              In contrast to weak reductionists  see above   strong reductionists reject ideas used to support the existence of a hard problem  that the same functional organization could exist without consciousness  or that a blind person who understood vision through a textbook would not know everything about sight  as simply mistaken intuitions                         
A notable family of strong reductionist accounts are the higher order theories of consciousness                          In       the philosopher Peter Carruthers wrote about  recognitional concepts of experience   that is   a capacity to recognize  a  type of experience when it occurs in one s own mental life   and suggested that such a capacity could explain phenomenal consciousness without positing qualia              On the higher order view  since consciousness is a representation  and representation is fully functionally analysable  there is no hard problem of consciousness             
The philosophers Glenn Carruthers and Elizabeth Schier said in      that the main arguments for the existence of a hard problem philosophical zombies  Mary s room  and Nagel s bats are only persuasive if one already assumes that  consciousness must be independent of the structure and function of mental states  i e  that there is a hard problem   Hence  the arguments beg the question  The authors suggest that  instead of letting our conclusions on the thought experiments guide our theories of consciousness  we should let our theories of consciousness guide our conclusions from the thought experiments              
The philosopher Massimo Pigliucci argued in      that the hard problem is misguided  resulting from a  category mistake               He said   Of course an explanation isn t the same as an experience  but that s because the two are completely independent categories  like colors and triangles  It is obvious that I cannot experience what it is like to be you  but I can potentially have a complete explanation of how and why it is possible to be you              
In       the philosopher Marco Stango  in a paper on John Dewey s approach to the problem of consciousness  which preceded Chalmers  formulation of the hard problem by over half a century   noted that Dewey s approach would see the hard problem as the consequence of an unjustified assumption that feelings and functional behaviours are not the same physical process   For the Deweyan philosopher  the  hard problem  of consciousness is a  conceptual fact  only in the sense that it is a philosophical mistake  the mistake of failing to see that the physical can be had as an episode of immediate sentiency              
The philosopher Thomas Metzinger likens the hard problem of consciousness to vitalism  a formerly widespread view in biology which was not so much solved as abandoned              Brian Jonathan Garrett has also argued that the hard problem suffers from flaws analogous to those of vitalism             
The philosopher Peter Hacker argues that the hard problem is misguided in that it asks how consciousness can emerge from matter  whereas in fact sentience emerges from the evolution of living organisms              He states   The hard problem isn t a hard problem at all  The really hard problems are the problems the scientists are dealing with        The philosophical problem  like all philosophical problems  is a confusion in the conceptual scheme               Hacker s critique extends beyond Chalmers and the hard problem  being directed against contemporary philosophy of mind and neuroscience more broadly  Along with the neuroscientist Max Bennett  he has argued that most of contemporary neuroscience remains implicitly dualistic in its conceptualisations and is predicated on the mereological fallacy of ascribing psychological concepts to the brain that can properly be ascribed only to the person as a whole              Hacker further states that  consciousness studies   as it exists today  is  literally a total waste of time  and that  the conception of consciousness which they have is incoherent              

Eliminative materialism   Illusionism edit 
Main article  Eliminative materialism
Eliminative materialism or eliminativism is the view that many or all of the mental states used in folk psychology  i e   common sense ways of discussing the mind  do not  upon scientific examination  correspond to real brain mechanisms              According the      PhilPapers survey        of philosophers surveyed subscribe to eliminativism             
While Patricia Churchland and Paul Churchland have famously applied eliminative materialism to propositional attitudes  philosophers including Daniel Dennett  Georges Rey  and Keith Frankish have applied it to qualia or phenomenal consciousness  i e   conscious experience               On their view  it is mistaken not only to believe there is a hard problem of consciousness  but to believe phenomenal consciousness exists at all                         
This stance has recently taken on the name of illusionism  the view that phenomenal consciousness is an illusion  The term was popularized by the philosopher Keith Frankish              Frankish argues that  illusionism  is preferable to  eliminativism  for labelling the view that phenomenal consciousness is an illusion  More substantively  Frankish argues that illusionism about phenomenal consciousness is preferable to realism about phenomenal consciousness  He states   Theories of consciousness typically address the hard problem  They accept that phenomenal consciousness is real and aim to explain how it comes to exist  There is  however  another approach  which holds that phenomenal consciousness is an illusion and aims to explain why it seems to exist               Frankish concludes that illusionism  replaces the hard problem with the illusion problem the problem of explaining how the illusion of phenomenality arises and why it is so powerful              
The philosopher Daniel Dennett was another prominent figure associated with illusionism  After Frankish published a paper in the Journal of Consciousness Studies titled Illusionism as a Theory of Consciousness              Dennett responded with his own paper humorously titled Illusionism as the Obvious Default Theory of Consciousness              Dennett had been arguing for the illusory status of consciousness since early on in his career  For example  in      he published a paper titled On the Absence of Phenomenology  where he argues for the nonexistence of phenomenal consciousness               Similar ideas have been explicated in his      book Consciousness Explained              Dennett argues that the so called  hard problem  will be solved in the process of solving what Chalmers terms the  easy problems               He compares consciousness to stage magic and its capability to create extraordinary illusions out of ordinary things              To show how people might be commonly fooled into overstating the accuracy of their introspective abilities  he describes a phenomenon called change blindness  a visual process that involves failure to detect scenery changes in a series of alternating images                  page      needed      He accordingly argues that consciousness need not be what it seems to be based on introspection  To address the question of the hard problem  or how and why physical processes give rise to experience  Dennett states that the phenomenon of having experience is nothing more than the performance of functions or the production of behaviour  which can also be referred to as the easy problems of consciousness              Thus  Dennett argues that the hard problem of experience is included among not separate from the easy problems  and therefore they can only be explained together as a cohesive unit             
Eliminativists differ on the role they believe intuitive judgement plays in creating the apparent reality of consciousness  The philosopher Jacy Reese Anthis is of the position that this issue is born of an overreliance on intuition  calling philosophical discussions on the topic of consciousness a form of  intuition jousting               But when the issue is tackled with  formal argumentation  and  precise semantics  then the hard problem will dissolve              The philosopher Elizabeth Irvine  in contrast  can be read as having the opposite view  since she argues that phenomenal properties  that is  properties of consciousness  do not exist in our common sense view of the world  She states that  the hard problem of consciousness may not be a genuine problem for non philosophers  despite its overwhelming obviousness to philosophers               
A complete illusionist theory of consciousness must include the description of a mechanism by which the illusion of subjective experience is had and reported by people  Various philosophers and scientists have proposed possible theories              For example  in his book Consciousness and the Social Brain neuroscientist Michael Graziano advocates what he calls attention schema theory  in which our perception of being conscious is merely an error in perception  held by brains which evolved to hold erroneous and incomplete models of their own internal workings  just as they hold erroneous and incomplete models of their own bodies and of the external world                         

Criticisms edit 
The main criticisms of eliminative materialism and illusionism hinge on the counterintuitive nature of the view  Arguments of this form are called Moorean Arguments  A Moorean argument seeks to undermine the conclusion of an argument by asserting that the negation of that conclusion is more certain than the premises of the argument             
The roots of the Moorean Argument against illusionism extend back to Augustine of Hippo who stated that he could not be deceived regarding his own existence  since the very act of being deceived secures the existence of a being there to be the recipient of that deception      note

Descartes  Discourse on the Method Part  

In the Early Modern era  these arguments were repopularized by Ren  Descartes  who coined the now famous phrase  Je pense  donc je suis    I think  therefore I am                Descartes argued that even if he was maximally deceived  because  for example  an evil demon was manipulating all his senses  he would still know with certainty that his mind exists  because the state of being deceived requires a mind as a prerequisite             
This same general argumentative structure is still in use today  For example  in      David Chalmers published an explicitly Moorean argument against illusionism  The argument goes like this  The reality of consciousness is more certain than any theoretical commitments  to  for example  physicalism  that may be motivating the illusionist to deny the existence of consciousness  The reason for this is because we have direct  acquaintance  with consciousness  but we do not have direct acquaintance with anything else  including anything that could inform our beliefs in consciousness being an illusion   In other words  consciousness can be known directly  so the reality of consciousness is more certain than any philosophical or scientific theory that says otherwise              Chalmers concludes that  there is little doubt that something like the Moorean argument is the reason that most people reject illusionism and many find it crazy              
Eliminative materialism and illusionism have been the subject of criticism within the popular press  One highly cited example comes from the philosopher Galen Strawson who wrote an article in the New York Review of Books titled  The Consciousness Deniers   In it  Strawson describes illusionism as the  silliest claim ever made   next to which  every known religious belief is only a little less sensible than the belief that the grass is green               Another notable example comes from Christof Koch  a neuroscientist and one of the leading proponents of Integrated Information Theory  in his popular science book The Feeling of Life Itself  In the early pages of the book  Koch describes eliminativism as the  metaphysical counterpart to Cotard s syndrome  a psychiatric condition in which patients deny being alive               Koch takes the prevalence of eliminativism as evidence that  much of twentieth century analytic philosophy has gone to the dogs              
Frankish has responded to such criticisms by asserting that  qualia realists  have to conceive of qualia as being either observational or theoretical in nature  If conceived of as observational  then realists cannot claim that illusionists are leaving anything out of their theories of consciousness  as such a claim would presuppose qualia as having certain theoretical components  If conceived of as theoretical  then illusionists are simply denying the theoretical components of qualia but not the mere fact that they exist  which is what they re attempting to explain in the first place             

Type B Materialism edit 
Further information  Phenomenal concept strategy and A posteriori physicalism
Type B Materialism  also known as Weak Reductionism or A Posteriori Physicalism  is the view that the hard problem stems from human psychology  and is therefore not indicative of a genuine ontological gap between consciousness and the physical world              Like Type A Materialists  Type B Materialists are committed to physicalism  Unlike Type A Materialists  however  Type B Materialists do accept inconceivability arguments often cited in support of the hard problem  but with a key caveat  that inconceivability arguments give us insight only into how the human mind tends to conceptualize the relationship between mind and matter  but not into what the true nature of this relationship actually is                          According to this view  there is a gap between two ways of knowing  introspection and neuroscience  that will not be resolved by understanding all the underlying neurobiology  but still believe that consciousness and neurobiology are one and the same in reality             
While Type B Materialists all agree that intuitions about the hard problem are psychological rather than ontological in origin  they differ as to whether our intuitions about the hard problem are innate or culturally conditioned  This has been dubbed the  hard wired soft wired distinction                           In relation to Type B Materialism  those who believe that our intuitions about the hard problem are innate  and therefore common to all humans  subscribe to the  hard wired view               Those that believe our intuitions are culturally conditioned subscribe to the  soft wired view   Unless otherwise specified  the term Type B Materialism refers to the hard wired view             
Notable philosophers who subscribe to Type B Materialism include David Papineau              Joseph Levine              and Janet Levine             

The  hard wired view  edit 
Joseph Levine  who formulated the notion of the explanatory gap  states   The explanatory gap argument doesn t demonstrate a gap in nature  but a gap in our understanding of nature               He nevertheless contends that full scientific understanding will not close the gap              and that analogous gaps do not exist for other identities in nature  such as that between water and H O              The philosophers Ned Block and Robert Stalnaker agree that facts about what a conscious experience is like to the one experiencing it cannot be deduced from knowing all the facts about the underlying physiology  but by contrast argue that such gaps of knowledge are also present in many other cases in nature  such as the distinction between water and H O                         
To explain why these two ways of knowing  i e  third person scientific observation and first person introspection  yield such different understandings of consciousness  weak reductionists often invoke the phenomenal concepts strategy  which argues the difference stems from our inaccurate phenomenal concepts  i e   how we think about consciousness   not from the nature of consciousness itself                            By this view  the hard problem of consciousness stems from a dualism of concepts  not from a dualism of properties or substances             

The  soft wired view  edit 
Some consciousness researchers have argued that the hard problem is a cultural artifact  unique to contemporary Western Culture  This is similar to Type B Materialism  but it makes the further claim that the psychological facts that cause us to intuit the hard problem are not innate  but culturally conditioned  Notable researchers who hold this view include Anna Wierzbicka               Hakwan Lau and Matthias Michel              
Wierzbicka  who is a linguist  argues that the vocabulary used by consciousness researchers  including words like experience and consciousness  are not universally translatable  and are  parochially English                Weirzbicka calls David Chalmers out by name for using these words  arguing that if philosophers  were to use panhuman concepts expressed in crosstranslatable words   such as know  think  or feel  then the hard problem would dissolve               David Chalmers has responded to these criticisms by saying that he will not  apologise for using technical terms in an academic article       they play a key role in efficient communication in every discipline  including Wierzbicka s              

Type C Materialism edit 
Type C materialists acknowledge a distinction between knowledge and experience              without asserting a more complete explanation for the experiential phenomenon  One taking this view would admit that there is an explanatory gap for which no answer to date may be satisfactory  but trust that inevitably the gap will be closed              This is described by analogy to progression in other areas of science  such as mass energy equivalence which would have been unfathomable in ancient times              abiogenesis which was once considered paradoxical from an evolutionary framework                            or a suspected future theory of everything combining relativity and quantum mechanics  Similarly  type C materialism posits that the problem of consciousness is a consequence of our ignorance                          but just as resolvable as any other question in neuroscience 
Because the explanatory question of consciousness is evaded  type C materialism does not presuppose              the descriptive question  for instance that there is any self consciousness  wakefulness  or even sentience              in a rock  Principally  the basis for the argument arises from the apparently high correlation of consciousness with living brain tissue               thereby rejecting panpsychism              without explicitly formulating physical causation  More specifically this position denies the existence of philosophical zombies             for which there is an absence of data and no proposed method of testing                            Whether via the inconceivability or actual nonexistence of zombies  a contradiction is exposed nullifying the premise of the consciousness problem s  hardness  
Type C materialism is compatible with several cases and could collapse into one of these other metaphysical views             depending on scientific discovery and its interpretation  With evidence of emergence  it resolves to strong reductionism under type A  With a different  possibly cultural paradigm for understanding consciousness  it resolves to type B materialism              If consciousness is explained by the quantum mind  then it resolves to property dualism under type D               With characterisation of intrinsic properties in physics extending beyond structure and dynamics  it could resolve to type F monism             

Type D Dualism edit 
Main articles  Dualism  philosophy of mind   Interactionism  philosophy of mind   and Epiphenomenalism
Dualism views consciousness as either a non physical substance separate from the brain or a non physical property of the physical brain               Dualism is the view that the mind is irreducible to the physical body               There are multiple dualist accounts of the causal relationship between the mental and the physical  of which interactionism and epiphenomenalism are the most common today  Interactionism posits that the mental and physical causally impact one another  and is associated with the thought of Ren  Descartes                          Epiphenomenalism holds the mental is causally dependent on the physical  but does not in turn causally impact it             
In contemporary philosophy  interactionism has been defended by philosophers including Martine Nida R melin               while epiphenomenalism has been defended by philosophers including Frank Jackson                            although Jackson later changed his stance to physicalism                Chalmers has also defended versions of both positions as plausible              Traditional dualists such as Descartes believed the mental and the physical to be two separate substances  or fundamental types of entities  hence  substance dualism    some more recent dualists  however  accept only one substance  the physical  but state it has both mental and physical properties  hence  property dualism                

Type E Dualism edit 
This section needs expansion     with  See talk page  You can help by adding to it    June      
Type F Monism edit 
Main articles  Panpsychism and Neutral monism
Meanwhile  panpsychism and neutral monism  broadly speaking  view consciousness as intrinsic to matter              In its most basic form  panpsychism holds that all physical entities have minds  though its proponents take more qualified positions                while neutral monism  in at least some variations  holds that entities are composed of a substance with mental and physical aspects and is thus sometimes described as a type of panpsychism              
Forms of panpsychism and neutral monism were defended in the early twentieth century by the psychologist William James                                note        the philosopher Alfred North Whitehead               the physicist Arthur Eddington                            and the philosopher Bertrand Russell                            and interest in these views has been revived in recent decades by philosophers including Thomas Nagel               Galen Strawson                            Philip Goff               and David Chalmers               Chalmers describes his overall view as  naturalistic dualism              but he says panpsychism is in a sense a form of physicalism              as does Strawson               Proponents of panpsychism argue it solves the hard problem of consciousness parsimoniously by making consciousness a fundamental feature of reality                          

Idealism and cosmopsychism edit 
Main article  Idealism
A traditional solution to the hard problem is idealism  according to which consciousness is fundamental and not simply an emergent property of matter  It is claimed that this avoids the hard problem entirely               Objective idealism and cosmopsychism consider mind or consciousness to be the fundamental substance of the universe  Proponents claim that this approach is immune to both the hard problem of consciousness and the combination problem that affects panpsychism                                        
From an idealist perspective  matter is a representation or image of mental processes  Supporters suggest that this avoids the problems associated with the materialist view of mind as an emergent property of a physical brain               Critics argue that this then leads to a decombination problem  how is it possible to split a single  universal conscious experience into multiple  distinct conscious experiences  In response  Bernardo Kastrup claims that nature hints at a mechanism for this in the condition dissociative identity disorder  previously known as Multiple Personality Disorder                Kastrup proposes dissociation as an example from nature showing that multiple minds with their own individual subjective experience could develop within a single universal mind 
Cognitive psychologist Donald D  Hoffman uses a mathematical model based around conscious agents  within a fundamentally conscious universe  to support conscious realism as a description of nature one that falls within the objective idealism approaches to the hard problem   The objective world  i e   the world whose existence does not depend on the perceptions of a particular conscious agent  consists entirely of conscious agents               
David Chalmers calls this form of idealism one of  the handful of promising approaches to the mind body problem               

New mysterianism edit 
Main article  New mysterianism
New mysterianism  most significantly associated with the philosopher Colin McGinn  proposes that the human mind  in its current form  will not be able to explain consciousness                           McGinn draws on Noam Chomsky s distinction between problems  which are in principle solvable  and mysteries  which human cognitive faculties are unequipped to ever understand  and places the mind body problem in the latter category               His position is that a naturalistic explanation does exist but that the human mind is cognitively closed to it due to its limited range of intellectual abilities               He cites Jerry Fodor s concept of the modularity of mind in support of cognitive closure              
While in McGinn s strong form  new mysterianism states that the relationship between consciousness and the material world can never be understood by the human mind  there are also weaker forms that argue it cannot be understood within existing paradigms but that advances in science or philosophy may open the way to other solutions  see above               The ideas of Thomas Nagel and Joseph Levine fall into the second category              Steven Pinker has also endorsed this weaker version of the view  summarising it as follows            

And then there is the theory put forward by philosopher Colin McGinn that our vertigo when pondering the Hard Problem is itself a quirk of our brains  The brain is a product of evolution  and just as animal brains have their limitations  we have ours  Our brains can t hold a hundred numbers in memory  can t visualize seven dimensional space and perhaps can t intuitively grasp why neural information processing observed from the outside should give rise to subjective experience on the inside  This is where I place my bet  though I admit that the theory could be demolished when an unborn genius a Darwin or Einstein of consciousness comes up with a flabbergasting new idea that suddenly makes it all clear to us 
Commentary on the problem s explanatory targets edit 
Philosopher Raamy Majeed argued in      that the hard problem is associated with two  explanatory targets              

 PQ  Physical processing gives rise to experiences with a phenomenal character 
 Q  Our phenomenal qualities are thus and so 
The first fact concerns the relationship between the physical and the phenomenal  i e   how and why are some physical states felt states   whereas the second concerns the very nature of the phenomenal itself  i e   what does the felt state feel like   
Wolfgang Fasching argues that the hard problem is not about qualia  but about the what it is like ness of experience in Nagel s sense about the givenness of phenomenal contents 

Today there is a strong tendency to simply equate consciousness with the qualia  Yet there is clearly something not quite right about this  The  itchiness of itches  and the  hurtfulness of pain  are qualities we are conscious of  So philosophy of mind tends to treat consciousness as if it consisted simply of the contents of consciousness  the phenomenal qualities   while it really is precisely consciousness of contents  the very givenness of whatever is subjectively given  And therefore the problem of consciousness does not pertain so much to some alleged  mysterious  nonpublic objects   i e  objects that seem to be only  visible  to the respective subject  but rather to the nature of  seeing  itself  and in today s philosophy of mind astonishingly little is said about the latter               
Relationship to scientific frameworks edit 
Most neuroscientists and cognitive scientists believe that Chalmers  alleged  hard problem  will be solved  or be shown to not be a real problem  in the course of the solution of the so called  easy problems   although a significant minority disagrees                              better      source      needed     

Neural correlates of consciousness edit 
Further information  Neural correlates of consciousness
Since       researchers including the molecular biologist Francis Crick and the neuroscientist Christof Koch have made significant progress toward identifying which neurobiological events occur concurrently to the experience of subjective consciousness               These postulated events are referred to as neural correlates of consciousness or NCCs  However  this research arguably addresses the question of which neurobiological mechanisms are linked to consciousness but not the question of why they should give rise to consciousness at all  the latter being the hard problem of consciousness as Chalmers formulated it  In  On the Search for the Neural Correlate of Consciousness   Chalmers said he is confident that  granting the principle that something such as what he terms  global availability  can be used as an indicator of consciousness  the neural correlates will be discovered  in a century or two                Nevertheless  he stated regarding their relationship to the hard problem of consciousness 

One can always ask why these processes of availability should give rise to consciousness in the first place  As yet we cannot explain why they do so  and it may well be that full details about the processes of availability will still fail to answer this question  Certainly  nothing in the standard methodology I have outlined answers the question  that methodology assumes a relation between availability and consciousness  and therefore does nothing to explain it        So the hard problem remains  But who knows  Somewhere along the line we may be led to the relevant insights that show why the link is there  and the hard problem may then be solved              
The neuroscientist and Nobel laureate Eric Kandel wrote that locating the NCCs would not solve the hard problem  but rather one of the so called easy problems to which the hard problem is contrasted               Kandel went on to note Crick and Koch s suggestion that once the binding problem understanding what accounts for the unity of experience is solved  it will be possible to solve the hard problem empirically               However  neuroscientist Anil Seth argued that emphasis on the so called hard problem is a distraction from what he calls the  real problem   understanding the neurobiology underlying consciousness  namely the neural correlates of various conscious processes              This more modest goal is the focus of most scientists working on consciousness               Psychologist Susan Blackmore believes  by contrast  that the search for the neural correlates of consciousness is futile and itself predicated on an erroneous belief in the hard problem of consciousness              

Computational cognition edit 
Further information  Computational theory of mind
A functionalist view in cognitive science holds that the mind is an information processing system  and that cognition and consciousness together are a form of computation  Cognition  distinct from consciousness  is explained by neural computation in the computational theory of cognition  The computational theory of mind asserts that not only cognition  but also phenomenal consciousness or qualia  are computational  While the computation system is realised by neurons rather than electronics  in theory it would be possible for artificial intelligence to be conscious 

Integrated information theory edit 
Further information  Integrated information theory
Integrated information theory  IIT   developed by the neuroscientist and psychiatrist Giulio Tononi in      and more recently also advocated by Koch  is one of the most discussed models of consciousness in neuroscience and elsewhere                            The theory proposes an identity between consciousness and integrated information  with the latter item  denoted as    defined mathematically and thus in principle measurable                            The hard problem of consciousness  write Tononi and Koch  may indeed be intractable when working from matter to consciousness              However  because IIT inverts this relationship and works from phenomenological axioms to matter  they say it could be able to solve the hard problem              In this vein  proponents have said the theory goes beyond identifying human neural correlates and can be extrapolated to all physical systems  Tononi wrote  along with two colleagues  

While identifying the  neural correlates of consciousness  is undoubtedly important  it is hard to see how it could ever lead to a satisfactory explanation of what consciousness is and how it comes about  As will be illustrated below  IIT offers a way to analyse systems of mechanisms to determine if they are properly structured to give rise to consciousness  how much of it  and of which kind              
As part of a broader critique of IIT  Michael Cerullo suggested that the theory s proposed explanation is in fact for what he dubs  following Scott Aaronson  the  Pretty Hard Problem  of methodically inferring which physical systems are conscious but would not solve Chalmers  hard problem                Even if IIT is correct   he argues   it does not explain why integrated information generates  or is  consciousness                Chalmers agrees that IIT  if correct  would solve the  Pretty Hard Problem  rather than the hard problem              

Global workspace theory edit 
Further information  Global workspace theory
Global workspace theory  GWT  is a cognitive architecture and theory of consciousness proposed by the cognitive psychologist Bernard Baars in                    Baars explains the theory with the metaphor of a theatre  with conscious processes represented by an illuminated stage               This theatre integrates inputs from a variety of unconscious and otherwise autonomous networks in the brain and then broadcasts them to unconscious networks  represented in the metaphor by a broad  unlit  audience                 The theory has since been expanded upon by other scientists including cognitive neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene              
In his original paper outlining the hard problem of consciousness  Chalmers discussed GWT as a theory that only targets one of the  easy problems  of consciousness             In particular  he said GWT provided a promising account of how information in the brain could become globally accessible  but argued that  now the question arises in a different form  why should global accessibility give rise to conscious experience  As always  this bridging question is unanswered              J  W  Dalton similarly criticised GWT on the grounds that it provides  at best  an account of the cognitive function of consciousness  and fails to explain its experiential aspect               By contrast  A  C  Elitzur argued   While  GWT  does not address the  hard problem   namely  the very nature of consciousness  it constrains any theory that attempts to do so and provides important insights into the relation between consciousness and cognition               
For his part  Baars writes  along with two colleagues  that there is no hard problem of explaining qualia over and above the problem of explaining causal functions  because qualia are entailed by neural activity and themselves causal              Dehaene  in his      book Consciousness and the Brain  rejected the concept of qualia and argued that Chalmers   easy problems  of consciousness are actually the hard problems              He further stated that the  hard problem  is based only upon ill defined intuitions that are continually shifting as understanding evolves             

Once our intuitions are educated by cognitive neuroscience and computer simulations  Chalmers  hard problem will evaporate  The hypothetical concept of qualia  pure mental experience  detached from any information processing role  will be viewed as a peculiar idea of the prescientific era  much like vitalism     Just as science dispatched vitalism  the science of consciousness will keep eating away at the hard problem of consciousness until it vanishes 
Meta problem edit 
In       Chalmers highlighted what he calls the  meta problem of consciousness   another problem related to the hard problem of consciousness             

The meta problem of consciousness is  to a first approximation  the problem of explaining why we think that there is a  hard  problem of consciousness 
In his  second approximation   he says it is the problem of explaining the behaviour of  phenomenal reports   and the behaviour of expressing a belief that there is a hard problem of consciousness             
Explaining its significance  he says             

Although the meta problem is strictly speaking an easy problem  it is deeply connected to the hard problem  We can reasonably hope that a solution to the meta problem will shed significant light on the hard problem  A particularly strong line holds that a solution to the meta problem will solve or dissolve the hard problem  A weaker line holds that it will not remove the hard problem  but it will constrain the form of a solution In other words  the  strong line  holds that the solution to the meta problem would provide an explanation of our beliefs about consciousness that is independent of consciousness  That would debunk our beliefs about consciousness  in the same way that explaining beliefs about god in evolutionary terms may provide arguments against theism itself              
In popular culture edit 
Tom Stoppard s play The Hard Problem  first produced in       is named after the hard problem of consciousness  which Stoppard defines as having  subjective First Person experiences

Notes edit 


   But  without any delusive representations of images or phantasms  I am most certain that I am  and that I know and delight in this  In respect to these truths I am not at all afraid of the arguments of the Academians  who say  What if you are deceived  For if I am deceived  I am  For he who is not  cannot be deceived    

  There has been debate over how best to characterize James  position  The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy states   James s commitment to panpsychism remains somewhat controversial  since he also advanced a cogent set of objections against a version of the view  which he labelled the  mind dust  theory  in chapter six of The Principles of Psychology                These objections are the inspiration for the so called  combination problem   around which much of the twenty first century literature on panpsychism focuses
