History edit

Eleazar Wheelock  Dartmouth College founder
Dartmouth was founded by Eleazar Wheelock  a Yale graduate and Congregational minister from Windham  Connecticut  who had sought to establish a school to train Native Americans as Christian missionaries  It was one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution  Wheelock s ostensible inspiration for such an establishment resulted from his relationship with Mohegan Indian Samson Occom  Occom became an ordained minister after studying under Wheelock from      to       and later moved to Long Island to preach to the Montauks             
Wheelock founded Moor s Indian Charity School in                   The Charity School proved somewhat successful  but additional funding was necessary to continue school s operations  and Wheelock sought the help of friends to raise money  The first major donation to the school was given by John Phillips in       who went on to found Phillips Exeter Academy  Occom  accompanied by the Reverend Nathaniel Whitaker  traveled to England in      to raise money from churches  With these funds  they established a trust to help Wheelock              The head of the trust was a Methodist named William Legge   nd Earl of Dartmouth 

The Charter of Dartmouth College on display in Baker Memorial Library  The charter was signed on December           on behalf of George III 
Although the fund provided Wheelock ample financial support for the Charity School  Wheelock initially had trouble recruiting Indians to the institution  primarily because its location was far from tribal territories  In seeking to expand the school into a college  Wheelock relocated it to Hanover  in the Province of New Hampshire  The move from Connecticut followed a lengthy and sometimes frustrating effort to find resources and secure a charter  The Royal Governor of New Hampshire  John Wentworth  provided the land upon which Dartmouth would be built and on December           issued a royal charter in the name of King George III establishing the college  That charter created a college  for the education and instruction of youth of the Indian tribes in this land in reading  writing  and all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing and christianizing children of pagans as well as in all liberal arts and sciences and also of English youth and any others   The reference to educating Native American youth was included to connect Dartmouth to the Charity School and enable the use of the Charity School s unspent trust funds  Named for William Legge   nd Earl of Dartmouth   an important supporter of Eleazar Wheelock s earlier efforts but who  in fact  opposed creation of the college and never donated to it   Dartmouth is the nation s ninth oldest college and the last institution of higher learning established under colonial rule              The college granted its first degrees in                  
Given the limited success of the Charity School  however  Wheelock intended his new college as one primarily for whites                          Occom  disappointed with Wheelock s departure from the school s original goal of Indian Christianization  went on to form his own community of New England Indians called Brothertown Indians in New York

In March       the estate of Glenn Britt gifted over      million to Dartmouth to enable students from middle income families to attend the college for free              

The Dartmouth Plan edit 
Tower Room in Baker Memorial Library
Dartmouth functions on a quarter system  operating year round on four ten week academic terms  The Dartmouth Plan  or simply  D Plan   is an academic scheduling system that permits the customization of each student s academic year  All undergraduates are required to be in residence for the fall  winter  and spring terms of their freshman year and two terms of their senior year  as well as the summer term of their sophomore year               However  students may petition to alter this plan so that they may be off during terms of their senior year or sophomore summer terms               During all terms  students are permitted to choose between studying on campus  studying at an off campus program  or taking a term off for vacation  outside internships  or research projects               The typical course load is three classes per term  and students will generally enroll in classes for    total terms over the course of their academic career              
The D Plan was instituted in the early     s at the same time that Dartmouth began accepting female undergraduates  It was initially devised as a plan to increase the enrollment without enlarging campus accommodations  and has been described as  a way to put       students into       beds               Although new dormitories have been built since  the number of students has also increased and the D Plan remains in effect  It was modified in the     s in an attempt to reduce the problems of lack of social and academic continuity

Insignia and other representations edit 
Motto and song edit 
Dartmouth s motto  chosen by Eleazar Wheelock  is Vox clamantis in deserto  The Latin motto is literally translated as  The voice of one crying in the wilderness                             but is more often rendered as  A voice crying out in the wilderness              The phrase appears five times in the Bible and is a reference to the college s location on what was once the frontier of European settlement                            Richard Hovey s  Men of Dartmouth  was elected as the best of Dartmouth s songs in                    and became the school s official song in                    The song was retitled to  Alma Mater  in the     s when its lyrics were changed to refer to women as well as men              

Seal edit 
Main article  Seal of Dartmouth College
Seal of Dartmouth College
Dartmouth s      royal charter required the creation of a seal for use on official documents and diplomas               The college s founder  Eleazar Wheelock  designed a seal for his college bearing a striking resemblance to the seal of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel  a missionary society founded in London in       in order to maintain the illusion that his college was more for mission work than for higher education               Engraved by a Boston silversmith  the seal was ready by commencement of       The trustees officially accepted the seal on August           describing it as 

An Oval  circumscribed by a Line containing SIGILL  COL  DARTMUTH  NOV  HANT  IN AMERICA       within projecting a Pine Grove on the Right  whence proceed Natives towards an Edifice two Storey on the left  which bears in a Label over the Grove these Words  vox clamantis in deserto  the whole supported by Religion on the Right and Justice on the Left  and bearing in a Triangle irradiate  with the Hebrew Words  El Shaddai   agreeable to the above Impression  be the common Seal under which to pass all Diplomas or Certificates of Degrees  and all other Affairs of Business of and concerning Dartmouth College              
On October           the trustees affirmed the charter s reservation of the seal for official corporate documents alone               The College Publications Committee commissioned noted typographer William Addison Dwiggins to create a line drawing version of the seal in      that saw widespread use  Dwiggins  design was modified during      to change the date from        to         to accord with the date of the college charter  The trustees commissioned a new set of dies with a date of        to replace the old dies  now badly worn after almost two hundred years of use               The      design continues to be used under trademark number                      

Shield edit 
On October           the trustees approved a  Dartmouth College Shield  for general use  Artist and engraver W  Parke Johnson designed this emblem on the basis of the shield that is depicted at the center of the original seal  This design does not survive  On June          the trustees approved another coat of arms based on the shield part of the seal  this one by Canadian artist and designer Thoreau MacDonald  That design was used widely and  like Dwiggins  seal  had its date changed from        to        around                    That version continues to be used under trademark registration number         and others              
College designer John Scotford made a stylized version of the shield during the     s  but it did not see the success of MacDonald s design               The shield appears to have been used as the basis of the shield of the Geisel School of Medicine  and it has been reproduced in sizes as small as    micrometers across               The design has appeared on Rudolph Ruzicka s Bicentennial Medal  Philadelphia Mint        and elsewhere 

Nickname  symbol  and mascot edit 
Dartmouth has never had an official mascot               The nickname  The Big Green                originating in the     s  is based on students  adoption of a shade of forest green   Dartmouth Green   as the school s official color in                                 Beginning in the     s  the Dartmouth College athletic teams were known by their unofficial nickname  the Indians   a moniker that probably originated among sports journalists               This unofficial mascot and team name was used until the early     s  when its use came under criticism  In       the Trustees declared the  use of the  Indian  symbol in any form to be inconsistent with present institutional and academic objectives of the College in advancing Native American education                Some alumni and students  as well as the conservative student newspaper  The Dartmouth Review  have sought to return the Indian symbol to prominence               but never succeeded in doing so              
Various student initiatives have been undertaken to adopt a mascot  but none has become  official   One proposal devised by the college humor magazine the Dartmouth Jack O Lantern was Keggy the Keg  an anthropomorphic beer keg who makes occasional appearances at college sporting events  Despite student enthusiasm for Keggy               the mascot has received approval from only the student government               In November       student government attempted to revive the  Dartmoose  as a potential replacement amid renewed controversy surrounding the former unofficial Indian mascot
