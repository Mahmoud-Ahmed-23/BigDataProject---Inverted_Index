American aerospace  ocean and computer engineer
Henry J  Kelley             was Christopher C  Kraft Professor of Aerospace and Ocean Engineering at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute  He produced major contributions to control theory  especially in aeronautical engineering and flight optimization            
In       he received a Bachelor of Science from NYU in aeronautical engineering  and began to work for Grumman Aircraft in the same year  His studies continued as a part time student leading
to a Master of Science in mathematics        and to the Sc D  in aeronautical
engineering                    In       he left Grumman  as Assistant Chief of the
Research Department   and founded Analytical Mechanics Associates with two partners  In       he became a professor in the Aerospace and Ocean Engineering Department at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute            
His paper on  Gradient Theory of Optimal Flight Paths                    is considered a major contribution to the field             In the context of control theory  Kelley derived basics of backpropagation                        now widely used for machine learning and artificial neural networks 
Kelley received NYU s Founder s Day Award in       the IAS New York Section Award in       the AIAA Guidance and Control of Flight Award in       and the AIAA Pendray Award in       He was a Fellow of the AIAA  and member of the AAS  the IEEE and SIAM  and founder and first chairman of IFAC s Mathematics of Control Committee
