Extremely large or complex datasets
Not to be confused with Big Data  band  

Big data primarily refers to data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data processing software  Data with many entries  rows  offer greater statistical power  while data with higher complexity  more attributes or columns  may lead to a higher false discovery rate

Big data analysis challenges include capturing data  data storage  data analysis  search  sharing  transfer  visualization  querying  updating  information privacy  and data source  Big data was originally associated with three key concepts  volume  variety  and velocity             The analysis of big data presents challenges in sampling  and thus previously allowing for only observations and sampling  Thus a fourth concept  veracity  refers to the quality or insightfulness of the data             Without sufficient investment in expertise for big data veracity  the volume and variety of data can produce costs and risks that exceed an organization s capacity to create and capture value from big data            
Current usage of the term big data tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics  user behavior analytics  or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from big data  and seldom to a particular size of data set   There is little doubt that the quantities of data now available are indeed large  but that s not the most relevant characteristic of this new data ecosystem             
Analysis of data sets can find new correlations to  spot business trends  prevent diseases  combat crime and so on              Scientists  business executives  medical practitioners  advertising and governments alike regularly meet difficulties with large data sets in areas including Internet searches  fintech  healthcare analytics  geographic information systems  urban informatics  and business informatics  Scientists encounter limitations in e Science work  including meteorology  genomics             connectomics  complex physics simulations  biology  and environmental research            
The size and number of available data sets have grown rapidly as data is collected by devices such as mobile devices  cheap and numerous information sensing Internet of things devices  aerial  remote sensing  equipment  software logs  cameras  microphones  radio frequency identification  RFID  readers and wireless sensor networks                         The world s technological per capita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every    months since the     s              as of          update       every day     exabytes           bytes  of data are generated              Based on an IDC report prediction  the global data volume was predicted to grow exponentially from     zettabytes to    zettabytes between      and       By       IDC predicts there will be     zettabytes of data              According to IDC  global spending on big data and business analytics  BDA  solutions is estimated to reach        billion in                               While Statista report  the global big data market is forecasted to grow to      billion by                   In      McKinsey  amp  Company reported  if US healthcare were to use big data creatively and effectively to drive efficiency and quality  the sector could create more than      billion in value every year              In the developed economies of Europe  government administrators could save more than      billion       billion  in operational efficiency improvements alone by using big data              And users of services enabled by personal location data could capture      billion in consumer surplus              One question for large enterprises is determining who should own big data initiatives that affect the entire organization             
Relational database management systems and desktop statistical software packages used to visualize data often have difficulty processing and analyzing big data  The processing and analysis of big data may require  massively parallel software running on tens  hundreds  or even thousands of servers               What qualifies as  big data  varies depending on the capabilities of those analyzing it and their tools  Furthermore  expanding capabilities make big data a moving target   For some organizations  facing hundreds of gigabytes of data for the first time may trigger a need to reconsider data management options  For others  it may take tens or hundreds of terabytes before data size becomes a significant consideration              


Definition edit 
The term big data has been in use since the     s  with some giving credit to John Mashey for popularizing the term                           Big data usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture  curate  manage  and process data within a tolerable elapsed time                  page      needed       Big data philosophy encompasses unstructured  semi structured and structured data  however  the main focus is on unstructured data              Big data  size  is a constantly moving target  as of          update      ranging from a few dozen terabytes to many zettabytes of data               Big data requires a set of techniques and technologies with new forms of integration to reveal insights from data sets that are diverse  complex  and of a massive scale             
 Volume    variety    velocity   and various other  Vs  are added by some organizations to describe it  a revision challenged by some industry authorities              The Vs of big data were often referred to as the  three Vs    four Vs   and  five Vs   They represented the qualities of big data in volume  variety  velocity  veracity  and value             Variability is often included as an additional quality of big data 
A      definition states  Big data is where parallel computing tools are needed to handle data   and notes   This represents a distinct and clearly defined change in the computer science used  via parallel programming theories  and losses of some of the guarantees and capabilities made by Codd s relational model              
In a comparative study of big datasets  Kitchin and McArdle found that none of the commonly considered characteristics of big data appear consistently across all of the analyzed cases              For this reason  other studies identified the redefinition of power dynamics in knowledge discovery as the defining trait              Instead of focusing on the intrinsic characteristics of big data  this alternative perspective pushes forward a relational understanding of the object claiming that what matters is the way in which data is collected  stored  made available and analyzed 

Big data vs  business intelligence edit 
The growing maturity of the concept more starkly delineates the difference between  big data  and  business intelligence              

Business intelligence uses applied mathematics tools and descriptive statistics with data with high information density to measure things  detect trends  etc 
Big data uses mathematical analysis  optimization  inductive statistics  and concepts from nonlinear system identification             to infer laws  regressions  nonlinear relationships  and causal effects  from large sets of data with low information density             to reveal relationships and dependencies  or to perform predictions of outcomes and behaviors                              promotional source      
Characteristics edit 
This image shows the growth of big data s primary characteristics of volume  velocity  and variety 
Big data can be described by the following characteristics 

Volume
The quantity of generated and stored data  The size of the data determines the value and potential insight  and whether it can be considered big data or not  The size of big data is usually larger than terabytes and petabytes             
Variety
The type and nature of the data  Earlier technologies like RDBMSs were capable to handle structured data efficiently and effectively  However  the change in type and nature from structured to semi structured or unstructured challenged the existing tools and technologies  Big data technologies evolved with the prime intention to capture  store  and process the semi structured and unstructured  variety  data generated with high speed  velocity   and huge in size  volume   Later  these tools and technologies were explored and used for handling structured data also but preferable for storage  Eventually  the processing of structured data was still kept as optional  either using big data or traditional RDBMSs  This helps in analyzing data towards effective usage of the hidden insights exposed from the data collected via social media  log files  sensors  etc  Big data draws from text  images  audio  video  plus it completes missing pieces through data fusion 
Velocity
The speed at which the data is generated and processed to meet the demands and challenges that lie in the path of growth and development  Big data is often available in real time  Compared to small data  big data is produced more continually  Two kinds of velocity related to big data are the frequency of generation and the frequency of handling  recording  and publishing             
Veracity
The truthfulness or reliability of the data  which refers to the data quality and the data value              Big data must not only be large in size  but also must be reliable in order to achieve value in the analysis of it  The data quality of captured data can vary greatly  affecting an accurate analysis             
Value
The worth in information that can be achieved by the processing and analysis of large datasets  Value also can be measured by an assessment of the other qualities of big data              Value may also represent the profitability of information that is retrieved from the analysis of big data 
Variability
The characteristic of the changing formats  structure  or sources of big data  Big data can include structured  unstructured  or combinations of structured and unstructured data  Big data analysis may integrate raw data from multiple sources  The processing of raw data may also involve transformations of unstructured data to structured data 
Other possible characteristics of big data are             

Exhaustive
Whether the entire system  i e   
  
    
      
        n
      
    
      textstyle n 
  
 all  is captured or recorded or not  Big data may or may not include all the available data from sources 
Fine grained and uniquely lexical
Respectively  the proportion of specific data of each element per element collected and if the element and its characteristics are properly indexed or identified 
Relational
If the data collected contains common fields that would enable a conjoining  or meta analysis  of different data sets 
Extensional
If new fields in each element of the data collected can be added or changed easily 
Scalability
If the size of the big data storage system can expand rapidly 
Architecture edit 
Big data repositories have existed in many forms  often built by corporations with a special need  Commercial vendors historically offered parallel database management systems for big data beginning in the     s  For many years  WinterCorp published the largest database report                  promotional source      
Teradata Corporation in      marketed the parallel processing DBC      system  Teradata systems were the first to store and analyze   terabyte of data in       Hard disk drives were     GB in      so the definition of big data continuously evolves  Teradata installed the first petabyte class RDBMS based system in       As of          update       there are a few dozen petabyte class Teradata relational databases installed  the largest of which exceeds    PB  Systems up until      were      structured relational data  Since then  Teradata has added semi structured data types including XML  JSON  and Avro 
In       Seisint Inc   now LexisNexis Risk Solutions  developed a C   based distributed platform for data processing and querying known as the HPCC Systems platform  This system automatically partitions  distributes  stores and delivers structured  semi structured  and unstructured data across multiple commodity servers  Users can write data processing pipelines and queries in a declarative dataflow programming language called ECL  Data analysts working in ECL are not required to define data schemas upfront and can rather focus on the particular problem at hand  reshaping data in the best possible manner as they develop the solution  In       LexisNexis acquired Seisint Inc              and their high speed parallel processing platform and successfully used this platform to integrate the data systems of Choicepoint Inc  when they acquired that company in                   In       the HPCC systems platform was open sourced under the Apache v    License 
CERN and other physics experiments have collected big data sets for many decades  usually analyzed via high throughput computing rather than the map reduce architectures usually meant by the current  big data  movement 
In       Google published a paper on a process called MapReduce that uses a similar architecture  The MapReduce concept provides a parallel processing model  and an associated implementation was released to process huge amounts of data  With MapReduce  queries are split and distributed across parallel nodes and processed in parallel  the  map  step   The results are then gathered and delivered  the  reduce  step   The framework was very successful              so others wanted to replicate the algorithm  Therefore  an implementation of the MapReduce framework was adopted by an Apache open source project named  Hadoop               Apache Spark was developed in      in response to limitations in the MapReduce paradigm  as it adds in memory processing and the ability to set up many operations  not just map followed by reducing  
MIKE    is an open approach to information management that acknowledges the need for revisions due to big data implications identified in an article titled  Big Data Solution Offering               The methodology addresses handling big data in terms of useful permutations of data sources  complexity in interrelationships  and difficulty in deleting  or modifying  individual records             
Studies in      showed that a multiple layer architecture was one option to address the issues that big data presents  A distributed parallel architecture distributes data across multiple servers  these parallel execution environments can dramatically improve data processing speeds  This type of architecture inserts data into a parallel DBMS  which implements the use of MapReduce and Hadoop frameworks  This type of framework looks to make the processing power transparent to the end user by using a front end application server             
The data lake allows an organization to shift its focus from centralized control to a shared model to respond to the changing dynamics of information management  This enables quick segregation of data into the data lake  thereby reducing the overhead time                         

Technologies edit 
A      McKinsey Global Institute report characterizes the main components and ecosystem of big data as follows             

Techniques for analyzing data  such as A B testing  machine learning  and natural language processing
Big data technologies  like business intelligence  cloud computing  and databases
Visualization  such as charts  graphs  and other displays of the data
Multidimensional big data can also be represented as OLAP data cubes or  mathematically  tensors  Array database systems have set out to provide storage and high level query support on this data type 
Additional technologies being applied to big data include efficient tensor based computation              such as multilinear subspace learning              massively parallel processing  MPP  databases  search based applications  data mining              distributed file systems  distributed cache  e g   burst buffer and Memcached   distributed databases  cloud and HPC based infrastructure  applications  storage and computing resources               and the Internet      citation needed      Although  many approaches and technologies have been developed  it still remains difficult to carry out machine learning with big data             
Some MPP relational databases have the ability to store and manage petabytes of data  Implicit is the ability to load  monitor  back up  and optimize the use of the large data tables in the RDBMS                  promotional source      
DARPA s Topological Data Analysis program seeks the fundamental structure of massive data sets and in      the technology went public with the launch of a company called  Ayasdi                   independent source needed     
The practitioners of big data analytics processes are generally hostile to slower shared storage              preferring direct attached storage  DAS  in its various forms from solid state drive  SSD  to high capacity SATA disk buried inside parallel processing nodes  The perception of shared storage architectures storage area network  SAN  and network attached storage  NAS   is that they are relatively slow  complex  and expensive  These qualities are not consistent with big data analytics systems that thrive on system performance  commodity infrastructure  and low cost 
Real or near real time information delivery is one of the defining characteristics of big data analytics  Latency is therefore avoided whenever and wherever possible  Data in direct attached memory or disk is good data on memory or disk at the other end of an FC SAN connection is not  The cost of an SAN at the scale needed for analytics applications is much higher than other storage techniques 

Applications edit 
Bus wrapped with SAP big data parked outside IDF  
Big data has increased the demand of information management specialists so much so that Software AG  Oracle Corporation  IBM  Microsoft  SAP  EMC  HP  and Dell have spent more than          billion on software firms specializing in data management and analytics  In       this industry was worth more than           billion and was growing at almost         percent a year  about twice as fast as the software business as a whole            
Developed economies increasingly use data intensive technologies  There are          billion mobile phone subscriptions worldwide  and between        billion and        billion people accessing the internet             Between      and       more than        billion people worldwide entered the middle class  which means more people became more literate  which in turn led to information growth  The world s effective capacity to exchange information through telecommunication networks was     petabytes in           petabytes in           exabytes in          exabytes in                  and predictions put the amount of internet traffic at     exabytes annually by                  According to one estimate  one third of the globally stored information is in the form of alphanumeric text and still image data              which is the format most useful for most big data applications  This also shows the potential of yet unused data  i e  in the form of video and audio content  
While many vendors offer off the shelf products for big data  experts promote the development of in house custom tailored systems if the company has sufficient technical capabilities

The use and adoption of big data within governmental processes allows efficiencies in terms of cost  productivity  and innovation              but comes with flaws  Data analysis often requires multiple parts of government  central and local  to work in collaboration and create new and innovative processes to deliver the desired outcome  A common government organization that makes use of big data is the National Security Administration  NSA   which monitors the activities of the Internet constantly in search for potential patterns of suspicious or illegal activities their system may pick up 
Civil registration and vital statistics  CRVS  collects all certificates status from birth to death  CRVS is a source of big data for governments 

International development edit 
Research on the effective usage of information and communication technologies for development  also known as  ICT D   suggests that big data technology can make important contributions but also present unique challenges to international development                          Advancements in big data analysis offer cost effective opportunities to improve decision making in critical development areas such as health care  employment  economic productivity  crime  security  and natural disaster and resource management                  page      needed                              Additionally  user generated data offers new opportunities to give the unheard a voice              However  longstanding challenges for developing regions such as inadequate technological infrastructure and economic and human resource scarcity exacerbate existing concerns with big data such as privacy  imperfect methodology  and interoperability issues                  page      needed       The challenge of  big data for development                  page      needed      is currently evolving toward the application of this data through machine learning  known as  artificial intelligence for development  AI D              

Benefits edit 
A major practical application of big data for development has been  fighting poverty with data               In       Blumenstock and colleagues estimated predicted poverty and wealth from mobile phone metadata             and in      Jean and colleagues combined satellite imagery and machine learning to predict poverty              Using digital trace data to study the labor market and the digital economy in Latin America  Hilbert and colleagues                          argue that digital trace data has several benefits such as 

Thematic coverage  including areas that were previously difficult or impossible to measure
Geographical coverage  providing sizable and comparable data for almost all countries  including many small countries that usually are not included in international inventories
Level of detail  providing fine grained data with many interrelated variables  and new aspects  like network connections
Timeliness and timeseries  graphs can be produced within days of being collected
Challenges edit 
At the same time  working with digital trace data instead of traditional survey data does not eliminate the traditional challenges involved when working in the field of international quantitative analysis  Priorities change  but the basic discussions remain the same  Among the main challenges are 

Representativeness  While traditional development statistics is mainly concerned with the representativeness of random survey samples  digital trace data is never a random sample             
Generalizability  While observational data always represents this source very well  it only represents what it represents  and nothing more  While it is tempting to generalize from specific observations of one platform to broader settings  this is often very deceptive 
Harmonization  Digital trace data still requires international harmonization of indicators  It adds the challenge of so called  data fusion   the harmonization of different sources 
Data overload  Analysts and institutions are not used to effectively deal with a large number of variables  which is efficiently done with interactive dashboards  Practitioners still lack a standard workflow that would allow researchers  users and policymakers to efficiently and effectively deal with data             
Finance edit 
Big Data is being rapidly adopted in Finance to    speed up processing and    deliver better  more informed inferences  both internally and to the clients of the financial institutions              The financial applications of Big Data range from investing decisions and trading  processing volumes of available price data  limit order books  economic data and more  all at the same time   portfolio management  optimizing over an increasingly large array of financial instruments  potentially selected from different asset classes   risk management  credit rating based on extended information   and any other aspect where the data inputs are large              Big Data has also been a typical concept within the field of alternative financial service  Some of the major areas involve crowd funding platforms and crypto currency exchanges             

Healthcare edit 
Big data analytics has been used in healthcare in providing personalized medicine and prescriptive analytics  clinical risk intervention and predictive analytics  waste and care variability reduction  automated external and internal reporting of patient data  standardized medical terms and patient registries                                                  Some areas of improvement are more aspirational than actually implemented  The level of data generated within healthcare systems is not trivial  With the added adoption of mHealth  eHealth and wearable technologies the volume of data will continue to increase  This includes electronic health record data  imaging data  patient generated data  sensor data  and other forms of difficult to process data  There is now an even greater need for such environments to pay greater attention to data and information quality               Big data very often means  dirty data  and the fraction of data inaccuracies increases with data volume growth   Human inspection at the big data scale is impossible and there is a desperate need in health service for intelligent tools for accuracy and believability control and handling of information missed              While extensive information in healthcare is now electronic  it fits under the big data umbrella as most is unstructured and difficult to use              The use of big data in healthcare has raised significant ethical challenges ranging from risks for individual rights  privacy and autonomy  to transparency and trust             
Big data in health research is particularly promising in terms of exploratory biomedical research  as data driven analysis can move forward more quickly than hypothesis driven research              Then  trends seen in data analysis can be tested in traditional  hypothesis driven follow up biological research and eventually clinical research 
A related application sub area  that heavily relies on big data  within the healthcare field is that of computer aided diagnosis in medicine                  page      needed       For instance  for epilepsy monitoring it is customary to create   to    GB of data daily              Similarly  a single uncompressed image of breast tomosynthesis averages     MB of data               These are just a few of the many examples where computer aided diagnosis uses big data  For this reason  big data has been recognized as one of the seven key challenges that computer aided diagnosis systems need to overcome in order to reach the next level of performance             

Education edit 
A McKinsey Global Institute study found a shortage of     million highly trained data professionals and managers             and a number of universities                 better      source      needed      including University of Tennessee and UC Berkeley  have created masters programs to meet this demand  Private boot camps have also developed programs to meet that demand  including paid programs like The Data Incubator or General Assembly              In the specific field of marketing  one of the problems stressed by Wedel and Kannan             is that marketing has several sub domains  e g   advertising  promotions 
product development  branding  that all use different types of data 

Media edit 
To understand how the media uses big data  it is first necessary to provide some context into the mechanism used for media process  It has been suggested by Nick Couldry and Joseph Turow that practitioners in media and advertising approach big data as many actionable points of information about millions of individuals  The industry appears to be moving away from the traditional approach of using specific media environments such as newspapers  magazines  or television shows and instead taps into consumers with technologies that reach targeted people at optimal times in optimal locations  The ultimate aim is to serve or convey  a message or content that is  statistically speaking  in line with the consumer s mindset  For example  publishing environments are increasingly tailoring messages  advertisements  and content  articles  to appeal to consumers that have been exclusively gleaned through various data mining activities             

Targeting of consumers  for advertising by marketers             
Data capture
Data journalism  publishers and journalists use big data tools to provide unique and innovative insights and infographics 
Channel    the British public service television broadcaster  is a leader in the field of big data and data analysis             

Insurance edit 
Health insurance providers are collecting data on social  determinants of health  such as food and TV consumption  marital status  clothing size  and purchasing habits  from which they make predictions on health costs  in order to spot health issues in their clients  It is controversial whether these predictions are currently being used for pricing             

Internet of things  IoT  edit

Further information  Edge computing
Big data and the IoT work in conjunction  Data extracted from IoT devices provides a mapping of device inter connectivity  Such mappings have been used by the media industry  companies  and governments to more accurately target their audience and increase media efficiency  The IoT is also increasingly adopted as a means of gathering sensory data  and this sensory data has been used in medical              manufacturing              and transportation              contexts 
Kevin Ashton  the digital innovation expert who is credited with coining the term               defines the Internet of things in this quote   If we had computers that knew everything there was to know about things using data they gathered without any help from us we would be able to track and count everything  and greatly reduce waste  loss  and cost  We would know when things needed replacing  repairing  or recalling  and whether they were fresh or past their best  

Information technology edit 
Especially since       big data has come to prominence within business operations as a tool to help employees work more efficiently and streamline the collection and distribution of information technology  IT   The use of big data to resolve IT and data collection issues within an enterprise is called IT operations analytics  ITOA                By applying big data principles into the concepts of machine intelligence and deep computing  IT departments can predict potential issues and prevent them               ITOA businesses offer platforms for systems management that bring data silos together and generate insights from the whole of the system rather than from isolated pockets of data 

Survey science edit 
Compared to survey based data collection  big data has low cost per data point  applies analysis techniques via machine learning and data mining  and includes diverse and new data sources  e g   registers  social media  apps  and other forms digital data  Since       survey scientists have started to examine how big data and survey science can complement each other to allow researchers and practitioners to improve the production of statistics and its quality  There have been three Big Data Meets Survey Science  BigSurv  conferences in             virtual         and as of          update      one conference forthcoming in                    a special issue in the Social Science Computer Review               a special issue in Journal of the Royal Statistical Society               and a special issue in EP J Data Science               and a book called Big Data Meets Social Sciences              edited by Craig Hill and five other Fellows of the American Statistical Association  In       the founding members of BigSurv received the Warren J  Mitofsky Innovators Award from the American Association for Public Opinion Research

Big data is notable in marketing due to the constant  datafication               of everyday consumers of the internet  in which all forms of data are tracked  The datafication of consumers can be defined as  quantifying many of or all human behaviors for the purpose of marketing               The increasingly digital world of rapid datafication makes this idea relevant to marketing because the amount of data constantly grows exponentially  It is predicted to increase from    to     zettabytes within the span of five years               The size of big data can often be difficult to navigate for marketers               As a result  adopters of big data may find themselves at a disadvantage  Algorithmic findings can be difficult to achieve with such large datasets               Big data in marketing is a highly lucrative tool that can be used for large corporations  its value being as a result of the possibility of predicting significant trends  interests  or statistical outcomes in a consumer based manner              
There are three significant factors in the use of big data in marketing 

Big data provides customer behavior pattern spotting for marketers  since all human actions are being quantified into readable numbers for marketers to analyze and use for their research               In addition  big data can also be seen as a customized product recommendation tool  Specifically  since big data is effective in analyzing customers  purchase behaviors and browsing patterns  this technology can assist companies in promoting specific personalized products to specific customers              
Real time market responsiveness is important for marketers because of the ability to shift marketing efforts and correct to current trends  which is helpful in maintaining relevance to consumers  This can supply corporations with the information necessary to predict the wants and needs of consumers in advance              
Data driven market ambidexterity are being highly fueled by big data               New models and algorithms are being developed to make significant predictions about certain economic and social situations

Science edit 
The Large Hadron Collider experiments represent about     million sensors delivering data         million times per second  There are nearly          million collisions per second  After filtering and refraining from recording more than                        of these streams  there are       collisions of interest per second                                        
As a result  only working with less than        of the sensor stream data  the data flow from all four LHC experiments represents    petabytes annual rate before replication  as of          update        This becomes nearly     petabytes after replication 
If all sensor data were recorded in LHC  the data flow would be extremely hard to work with  The data flow would exceed     million petabytes annual rate  or nearly     exabytes per day  before replication  To put the number in perspective  this is equivalent to     quintillion          bytes per day  almost     times more than all the other sources combined in the world 
The Square Kilometre Array is a radio telescope built of thousands of antennas  It is expected to be operational by       Collectively  these antennas are expected to gather    exabytes and store one petabyte per day                            It is considered one of the most ambitious scientific projects ever undertaken

COVID    edit 
During the COVID    pandemic  big data was raised as a way to minimise the impact of the disease  Significant applications of big data included minimising the spread of the virus  case identification and development of medical treatment              
Governments used big data to track infected people to minimise spread  Early adopters included China  Taiwan  South Korea  and Israel                                        

Research activities edit 
Encrypted search and cluster formation in big data were demonstrated in March      at the American Society of Engineering Education  Gautam Siwach engaged at Tackling the challenges of Big Data by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and Amir Esmailpour at the UNH Research Group investigated the key features of big data as the formation of clusters and their interconnections  They focused on the security of big data and the orientation of the term towards the presence of different types of data in an encrypted form at cloud interface by providing the raw definitions and real time examples within the technology  Moreover  they proposed an approach for identifying the encoding technique to advance towards an expedited search over encrypted text leading to the security enhancements in big data              
In March       The White House announced a national  Big Data Initiative  that consisted of six federal departments and agencies committing more than           million to big data research projects              
The initiative included a National Science Foundation  Expeditions in Computing  grant of     million over five years to the AMPLab              at the University of California  Berkeley               The AMPLab also received funds from DARPA  and over a dozen industrial sponsors and uses big data to attack a wide range of problems from predicting traffic congestion              to fighting cancer              
The White House Big Data Initiative also included a commitment by the Department of Energy to provide     million in funding over five years to establish the Scalable Data Management  Analysis and Visualization  SDAV  Institute               led by the Energy Department s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory  The SDAV Institute aims to bring together the expertise of six national laboratories and seven universities to develop new tools to help scientists manage and visualize data on the department s supercomputers 
The U S  state of Massachusetts announced the Massachusetts Big Data Initiative in May       which provides funding from the state government and private companies to a variety of research institutions               The Massachusetts Institute of Technology hosts the Intel Science and Technology Center for Big Data in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory  combining government  corporate  and institutional funding and research efforts              
The European Commission is funding the two year long Big Data Public Private Forum through their Seventh Framework Program to engage companies  academics and other stakeholders in discussing big data issues  The project aims to define a strategy in terms of research and innovation to guide supporting actions from the European Commission in the successful implementation of the big data economy  Outcomes of this project will be used as input for Horizon       their next framework program              
The British government announced in March      the founding of the Alan Turing Institute  named after the computer pioneer and code breaker  which will focus on new ways to collect and analyze large data sets              
At the University of Waterloo Stratford Campus Canadian Open Data Experience  CODE  Inspiration Day  participants demonstrated how using data visualization can increase the understanding and appeal of big data sets and communicate their story to the world              
Computational social sciences        Anyone can use application programming interfaces  APIs  provided by big data holders  such as Google and Twitter  to do research in the social and behavioral sciences               Often these APIs are provided for free               Tobias Preis et al  used Google Trends data to demonstrate that Internet users from countries with a higher per capita gross domestic products  GDPs  are more likely to search for information about the future than information about the past  The findings suggest there may be a link between online behaviors and real world economic indicators                                         The authors of the study examined Google queries logs made by ratio of the volume of searches for the coming year        to the volume of searches for the previous year         which they call the  future orientation index                They compared the future orientation index to the per capita GDP of each country  and found a strong tendency for countries where Google users inquire more about the future to have a higher GDP 
Tobias Preis and his colleagues Helen Susannah Moat and H  Eugene Stanley introduced a method to identify online precursors for stock market moves  using trading strategies based on search volume data provided by Google Trends               Their analysis of Google search volume for    terms of varying financial relevance  published in Scientific Reports               suggests that increases in search volume for financially relevant search terms tend to precede large losses in financial markets                                                                                            
Big data sets come with algorithmic challenges that previously did not exist  Hence  there is seen by some to be a need to fundamentally change the processing ways              

Sampling big data edit 
A research question that is asked about big data sets is whether it is necessary to look at the full data to draw certain conclusions about the properties of the data or if is a sample is good enough  The name big data itself contains a term related to size and this is an important characteristic of big data  But sampling enables the selection of right data points from within the larger data set to estimate the characteristics of the whole population  In manufacturing different types of sensory data such as acoustics  vibration  pressure  current  voltage  and controller data are available at short time intervals  To predict downtime it may not be necessary to look at all the data but a sample may be sufficient  Big data can be broken down by various data point categories such as demographic  psychographic  behavioral  and transactional data  With large sets of data points  marketers are able to create and use more customized segments of consumers for more strategic targeting 

Critique edit 
Critiques of the big data paradigm come in two flavors  those that question the implications of the approach itself  and those that question the way it is currently done               One approach to this criticism is the field of critical data studies 

Critiques of the big data paradigm edit 
 A crucial problem is that we do not know much about the underlying empirical micro processes that lead to the emergence of the se  typical network characteristics of Big Data                   page      needed       In their critique  Snijders  Matzat  and Reips point out that often very strong assumptions are made about mathematical properties that may not at all reflect what is really going on at the level of micro processes  Mark Graham has leveled broad critiques at Chris Anderson s assertion that big data will spell the end of theory               focusing in particular on the notion that big data must always be contextualized in their social  economic  and political contexts               Even as companies invest eight  and nine figure sums to derive insight from information streaming in from suppliers and customers  less than     of employees have sufficiently mature processes and skills to do so  To overcome this insight deficit  big data  no matter how comprehensive or well analyzed  must be complemented by  big judgment   according to an article in the Harvard Business Review              
Much in the same line  it has been pointed out that the decisions based on the analysis of big data are inevitably  informed by the world as it was in the past  or  at best  as it currently is                   page      needed      Fed by a large number of data on past experiences  algorithms can predict future development if the future is similar to the past               If the system s dynamics of the future change  if it is not a stationary process   the past can say little about the future  In order to make predictions in changing environments  it would be necessary to have a thorough understanding of the systems dynamic  which requires theory               As a response to this critique Alemany Oliver and Vayre suggest to use  abductive reasoning as a first step in the research process in order to bring context to consumers  digital traces and make new theories emerge                 Additionally  it has been suggested to combine big data approaches with computer simulations  such as agent based models                 page      needed      and complex systems  Agent based models are increasingly getting better in predicting the outcome of social complexities of even unknown future scenarios through computer simulations that are based on a collection of mutually interdependent algorithms                            Finally  the use of multivariate methods that probe for the latent structure of the data  such as factor analysis and cluster analysis  have proven useful as analytic approaches that go well beyond the bi variate approaches  e g  contingency tables  typically employed with smaller data sets 
In health and biology  conventional scientific approaches are based on experimentation  For these approaches  the limiting factor is the relevant data that can confirm or refute the initial hypothesis                A new postulate is accepted now in biosciences  the information provided by the data in huge volumes  omics  without prior hypothesis is complementary and sometimes necessary to conventional approaches based on experimentation                            In the massive approaches it is the formulation of a relevant hypothesis to explain the data that is the limiting factor               The search logic is reversed and the limits of induction   Glory of Science and Philosophy scandal   C  D  Broad        are to be considered      citation needed     
Privacy advocates are concerned about the threat to privacy represented by increasing storage and integration of personally identifiable information  expert panels have released various policy recommendations to conform practice to expectations of privacy               The misuse of big data in several cases by media  companies  and even the government has allowed for abolition of trust in almost every fundamental institution holding up society              
Barocas and Nissenbaum argue that one way of protecting individual users is by being informed about the types of information being collected  with whom it is shared  under what constraints and for what purposes              

Critiques of the  V  model edit 
The  V  model of big data is concerning as it centers around computational scalability and lacks in a loss around the perceptibility and understandability of information  This led to the framework of cognitive big data  which characterizes big data applications according to              

Data completeness  understanding of the non obvious from data
Data correlation  causation  and predictability  causality as not essential requirement to achieve predictability
Explainability and interpretability  humans desire to understand and accept what they understand  where algorithms do not cope with this
Level of automated decision making  algorithms that support automated decision making and algorithmic self learning
Critiques of novelty edit 
Large data sets have been analyzed by computing machines for well over a century  including the US census analytics performed by IBM s punch card machines which computed statistics including means and variances of populations across the whole continent  In more recent decades  science experiments such as CERN have produced data on similar scales to current commercial  big data   However  science experiments have tended to analyze their data using specialized custom built high performance computing  super computing  clusters and grids  rather than clouds of cheap commodity computers as in the current commercial wave  implying a difference in both culture and technology stack 

Critiques of big data execution edit 
Ulf Dietrich Reips and Uwe Matzat wrote in      that big data had become a  fad  in scientific research               Researcher Danah Boyd has raised concerns about the use of big data in science neglecting principles such as choosing a representative sample by being too concerned about handling the huge amounts of data               This approach may lead to results that have a bias in one way or another               Integration across heterogeneous data resources some that might be considered big data and others not presents formidable logistical as well as analytical challenges  but many researchers argue that such integrations are likely to represent the most promising new frontiers in science              
In the provocative article  Critical Questions for Big Data                the authors title big data a part of mythology   large data sets offer a higher form of intelligence and knowledge        with the aura of truth  objectivity  and accuracy   Users of big data are often  lost in the sheer volume of numbers   and  working with Big Data is still subjective  and what it quantifies does not necessarily have a closer claim on objective truth                Recent developments in BI domain  such as pro active reporting especially target improvements in the usability of big data  through automated filtering of non useful data and correlations               Big structures are full of spurious correlations              either because of non causal coincidences  law of truly large numbers   solely nature of big randomness               Ramsey theory   or existence of non included factors so the hope  of early experimenters to make large databases of numbers  speak for themselves  and revolutionize scientific method  is questioned               Catherine Tucker has pointed to  hype  around big data  writing  By itself  big data is unlikely to be valuable   The article explains   The many contexts where data is cheap relative to the cost of retaining talent to process it  suggests that processing skills are more important than data itself in creating value for a firm               
Big data analysis is often shallow compared to analysis of smaller data sets               In many big data projects  there is no large data analysis happening  but the challenge is the extract  transform  load part of data pre processing              
Big data is a buzzword and a  vague term                             but at the same time an  obsession               with entrepreneurs  consultants  scientists  and the media  Big data showcases such as Google Flu Trends failed to deliver good predictions in recent years  overstating the flu outbreaks by a factor of two  Similarly  Academy Awards and election predictions solely based on Twitter were more often off than on target 
Big data often poses the same challenges as small data  adding more data does not solve problems of bias  but may emphasize other problems  In particular data sources such as Twitter are not representative of the overall population  and results drawn from such sources may then lead to wrong conclusions  Google Translate which is based on big data statistical analysis of text does a good job at translating web pages  However  results from specialized domains may be dramatically skewed 
On the other hand  big data may also introduce new problems  such as the multiple comparisons problem  simultaneously testing a large set of hypotheses is likely to produce many false results that mistakenly appear significant 
Ioannidis argued that  most published research findings are false               due to essentially the same effect  when many scientific teams and researchers each perform many experiments  i e  process a big amount of scientific data  although not with big data technology   the likelihood of a  significant  result being false grows fast   even more so  when only positive results are published 
Furthermore  big data analytics results are only as good as the model on which they are predicated  In an example  big data took part in attempting to predict the results of the      U S  presidential election              with varying degrees of success 

Critiques of big data policing and surveillance edit 
Big data has been used in policing and surveillance by institutions like law enforcement and corporations  see  corporate surveillance and surveillance capitalism                Due to the less visible nature of data based surveillance as compared to traditional methods of policing  objections to big data policing are less likely to arise  According to Sarah Brayne s Big Data Surveillance  The Case of Policing               big data policing can reproduce existing societal inequalities in three ways 

Placing people under increased surveillance by using the justification of a mathematical and therefore unbiased algorithm
Increasing the scope and number of people that are subject to law enforcement tracking and exacerbating existing racial overrepresentation in the criminal justice system
Encouraging members of society to abandon interactions with institutions that would create a digital trace  thus creating obstacles to social inclusion
If these potential problems are not corrected or regulated  the effects of big data policing may continue to shape societal hierarchies  Conscientious usage of big data policing could prevent individual level biases from becoming institutional biases  Brayne also notes
