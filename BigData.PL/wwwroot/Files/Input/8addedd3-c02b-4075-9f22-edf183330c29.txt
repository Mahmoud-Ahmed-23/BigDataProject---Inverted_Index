Arthur Earl Bryson Jr   born October                      is the Paul Pigott Professor of Engineering Emeritus at Stanford University and the  father of modern optimal control theory       citation needed      With Henry J  Kelley  he also pioneered an early version of the backpropagation procedure                                  
now widely used for machine learning and artificial neural networks 
He was a member of the U S  Navy V    program at Iowa State College  and received his B S  in aeronautical engineering there in                   He earned his Ph D  from the California Institute of Technology  graduating in        His thesis An Interferometric Wind Tunnel Study of Transonic Flow past Wedge and Circular Arcs was advised by Hans W  Liepmann 
Bryson was the Ph D  advisor to the Harvard control theorist Yu Chi Ho 
In       Bryson was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for contributions to engineering education and imaginative application of modern statistical methods to engineering optimization 

Awards and honors edit 
He was awarded membership into the National Academy of Engineering in      and the National Academy of Sciences in       He was awarded the John R  Ragazzini Award in      from the American Automatic Control Council  the IEEE Control Systems Science and Engineering Award in                             the Richard E  Bellman Control Heritage Award in      from the American Automatic Control Council            and the Daniel Guggenheim Medal in
