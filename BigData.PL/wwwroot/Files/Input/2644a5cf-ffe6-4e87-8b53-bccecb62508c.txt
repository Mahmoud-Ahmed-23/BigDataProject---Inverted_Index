Chess is a board game for two players  It is an abstract strategy game which involves no hidden information and no elements of chance  It is played on a square board containing    squares arranged in an     grid  The players  referred to as  White  and  Black   each control sixteen pieces  one king  one queen  two rooks  two bishops  two knights  and eight pawns  each type of piece has a different pattern of movement  An enemy piece may be captured  removed from the board  by moving one s own piece onto the square it occupies  the object of the game is to  checkmate   threaten with inescapable capture  the enemy king  There are also several ways a game can end in a draw 
The recorded history of chess goes back at least to the emergence of chaturanga also thought to be an ancestor to similar games like xiangqi and shogi in seventh century India  After its introduction in Persia  it spread to the Arab world and then to Europe  The modern rules of chess emerged in Europe at the end of the   th century  with standardization and universal acceptance by the end of the   th century  Today  chess is one of the world s most popular games  with millions of players worldwide 
Organized chess arose in the   th century  Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE  F d ration Internationale des  checs  the International Chess Federation   The first universally recognized World Chess Champion  Wilhelm Steinitz  claimed his title in       Gukesh Dommaraju is the current World Champion  having won the title in      
A huge body of chess theory has developed since the game s inception  Aspects of art are found in chess composition  and chess in its turn influenced Western culture and the arts  and has connections with other fields such as mathematics  computer science  and psychology  One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess playing machine  In       Deep Blue became the first computer to beat a reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov  Today s chess engines are significantly stronger than the best human players and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory  however  chess is not a solved game

Rules
Main article  Rules of chess
The rules of chess are published by FIDE  F d ration Internationale des  checs   International Chess Federation    chess s world governing body  in its Handbook             Rules published by national governing bodies  or by unaffiliated chess organizations  commercial publishers  etc   may differ in some details  FIDE s rules were most recently revised in      

Setup
Setup at the start of a chess game
Chess sets come in a wide variety of styles  The Staunton pattern is the most common  and is usually required for competition             Chess sets come with pieces in two colors  referred to as white and black  regardless of their actual color  the players controlling the color sets are referred to as White and Black  respectively  Each set comes with at least the following    pieces in both colors  one king  one queen  two rooks  two bishops  two knights  and eight pawns            
The game is played on a square board of eight rows  called ranks  and eight columns  called files   Although it does not affect gameplay  by convention the    squares alternate in color and are referred to as light and dark squares

To start the game  White s pieces are placed on the first rank in the following order  from left to right  rook  knight  bishop  queen  king  bishop  knight  rook  Pawns are placed on each square of the second rank  Black s position mirrors White s  with equivalent pieces on every file             The board is oriented so that the right hand corner nearest each player is a light square  as a result the white queen always starts on a light square  while the black queen starts on a dark square  This may be remembered by the phrases  white on the right  and  queen on her color             
In competition  the piece colors are allocated to players by the organizers  In informal games  colors may be decided either by mutual agreement  or randomly  for example by a coin toss  or by one player concealing a white pawn in one hand and a black pawn in the other and having the opponent choose      citation needed     

Movement
White moves first  after which players alternate turns  One piece is moved per turn  except when castling  during which two pieces are moved   In the diagrams  dots mark the squares to which each type of piece can move if unoccupied by friendly pieces and there are no intervening piece s  of either color  except the knight  which leaps over any intervening pieces   With the sole exception of en passant  a piece captures an enemy piece by moving to the square it occupies  removing it from play and taking its place  The pawn is the only piece that does not capture the way it moves  and it is the only piece that moves and captures in only one direction  forwards from the player s perspective   A piece is said to control empty squares on which it could capture  attack squares with enemy pieces it could capture  and defend squares with pieces of the same color on which it could recapture  Moving is compulsory  a player may not skip a turn  even when having to move is detrimental

The king moves one square in any direction  There is also a special move called castling which moves the king and a rook  The king is the most valuable piece it is illegal to play any move that puts one s king under attack by an opponent piece  A move that attacks the king must be parried immediately  if this cannot be done  the game is lost   See        Check and checkmate  
A rook can move any number of squares along a rank or file  A rook is involved in the king s castling move 
A bishop can move any number of squares diagonally 
A queen combines the power of a rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along a rank  file  or diagonal 
A knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank  file  or diagonal   Thus the move forms an  L  shape  two squares vertically and one square horizontally  or two squares horizontally and one square vertically   The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces 
A pawn can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file  or on its first move it can optionally advance two squares along the same file  provided both squares are unoccupied  diagram dots   A pawn can capture an opponent s piece on a square diagonally in front of it by moving to that square  diagram crosses   It cannot capture a piece while advancing along the same file  nor can it move to either square diagonally in front without capturing  Pawns have two special moves  the en passant capture and promotion 

Check and checkmate
Main articles  Check and Checkmate







abcdefgh                abcdefghThe black king is in check by the rook 




abcdefgh                abcdefghWhite is in checkmate  being unable to escape attack by the bishop on f  

     


When a king is under immediate attack  it is in check  A move in response to a check is legal only if it results in a position in which the king is no longer in check  There are three ways to counter a check 

Capture the checking piece 
Interpose a piece between the checking piece and the king  possible only if the attacking piece is a queen  rook  or bishop and there is a square between it and the king  
Move the king to a square where it is not under attack 
The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent  this occurs when the opponent s king is in check  and there is no legal way to get it out of check  In casual games  it is common to announce  check  when putting the opponent s king in check  but this is not required by the rules of chess and is usually not done in tournaments            

Castling
Main article  Castling
Examples of castling  view animation 
Kings can castle once per game  Castling consists of moving the king two squares toward either rook of the same color  and then placing the rook on the square that the king crossed 
Castling is possible only if the following conditions are met            

Neither the king nor the rook has previously moved during the game 
There are no pieces between the king and the rook 
The king is not in check and does not pass through or finish on a square controlled by an enemy piece 
Castling is still permitted if the rook is under attack  or if the rook crosses an attacked square  


Special pawn moves


Main articles  En passant and Promotion
Examples of special pawn moves   left  promotion   right  en passant
Pawns have two special moves 

En passant  when a pawn makes a two square advance to the same rank as an opponent s pawn on an adjacent file  that pawn can capture it en passant   in passing    moving to one square behind the captured pawn  A pawn can only be captured en passant on the turn after it makes a two square advance  In the animated diagram  the black pawn advances two squares from g  to g   and the white pawn on f  takes it en passant  landing on g  
Promotion  when a pawn advances to its last rank  it is promoted and replaced with the player s choice of a queen  rook  bishop  or knight  Usually  pawns are promoted to queens  choosing another piece is called underpromotion  In the animated diagram  the c  pawn is advanced to c  and promoted to a queen  If the required piece is not available  e g  a second queen   an inverted rook is sometimes used as a substitute  but this is not recognized in FIDE sanctioned games 

End of the game
Win
A game can be won in the following ways 

Checkmate  The opposing king is in check and the opponent has no legal move   See        Check and checkmate  
Resignation  A player may resign  conceding the game to the opponent             If  however  the opponent has no way of checkmating the resigned player  this is a draw under FIDE Laws             Most tournament players consider it good etiquette to resign in a hopeless position                       
Win on time  In games with a time control  a player wins if the opponent runs out of time  even if the opponent has a superior position  as long as the player has a theoretical possibility to checkmate the opponent were the game to continue 
Forfeit  A player who cheats  violates the rules  or violates the rules of conduct specified for the particular tournament can be forfeited  Occasionally  both players are forfeited            
Draw
There are several ways a game can end in a draw 

Stalemate  If the player to move has no legal move  but is not in check  the position is a stalemate  and the game is drawn 
Dead position  If neither player is able to checkmate the other by any legal sequence of moves  the game is drawn  For example  if only the kings are on the board  all other pieces having been captured  checkmate is impossible  and the game is drawn by this rule  On the other hand  if both players still have a knight  there is a highly unlikely yet theoretical possibility of checkmate  so this rule does not apply  The dead position rule supersedes an older rule which referred to  insufficient material   extending it to include other positions where checkmate is impossible  such as blocked pawn endings where the pawns cannot be attacked 
Draw by agreement  In tournament chess  draws are most commonly reached by mutual agreement between the players  The correct procedure is to verbally offer the draw  make a move  then start the opponent s clock  Traditionally  players have been allowed to agree to a draw at any point in the game  occasionally even without playing a move  More recently efforts have been made to discourage early draws  for example by forbidding draw offers before a certain number of moves have been completed  or even forbidding draw offers altogether 
Threefold repetition  This most commonly occurs when neither side is able to avoid repeating moves without incurring a disadvantage  The three occurrences of the position need not occur on consecutive moves for a claim to be valid  The addition of the fivefold repetition rule in      requires the arbiter to intervene immediately and declare the game a draw after five occurrences of the same position  consecutive or otherwise  without requiring a claim by either player  FIDE rules make no mention of perpetual check  this is merely a specific type of draw by threefold repetition 
Fifty move rule  If during the previous    moves no pawn has been moved and no capture has been made  either player can claim a draw  The addition of the seventy five move rule in      requires the arbiter to intervene and immediately declare the game drawn after    moves without a pawn move or capture  without requiring a claim by either player  There are several known endgames where it is possible to force a mate but it requires more than    moves before a pawn move or capture is made  examples include some endgames with two knights against a pawn and some pawnless endgames such as queen against two bishops  Historically  FIDE has sometimes revised the fifty move rule to make exceptions for these endgames  but these have since been repealed  Some correspondence chess organizations do not enforce the fifty move rule      note       
Draw on time  In games with a time control  the game is drawn if a player is out of time and no sequence of legal moves would allow the opponent to checkmate the player            
Draw by resignation  Under FIDE Laws  a game is drawn if a player resigns and no sequence of legal moves would allow the opponent to checkmate that player

abcdefgh                abcdefghAlso a dead position  neither king can capture the other s pawns in order to promote a pawn and give checkmate 

     



Time control
Typical digital and analog chess clocks
In competition  chess games are played with a time control  Time controls are generally divided into categories based on the amount of time given to each player  which range from classical time controls  which allot about   hours or more to each player and which can take upwards of seven hours  even longer if adjournments are permitted   to bullet chess  in which players receive less than three minutes each  Between these are rapid chess  ten to sixty minutes per player   popular in amateur tournaments  and blitz chess  three to ten minutes   popular online  Non classical chess is sometimes referred to as fast chess 
Time is controlled using a chess clock with two displays  one for each player s remaining time  Analog chess clocks have been largely replaced by digital clocks  which allow for time controls with increments 
There are some aspects unique to online chess  A premove allows a player to submit a move on the opponent s turn  which gets played automatically if possible using little to no time  Premoves  alongside the relative ease of digital inputs  make faster time controls feasible online 
Time controls are also enforced in correspondence chess competitions  A typical time control is    days for every    moves  Time is usually allotted per move in online correspondence chess 

Notation
Main article  Algebraic notation
Historically  many different notation systems have been used to record chess moves  the standard system today is short form algebraic notation              In this system  files are labeled a through h and ranks are labeled   through    Squares are identified by the file and rank they occur on  g  is the square on the g file and the third rank  In English  the piece notations are  K  king   Q  queen   R  rook   B  bishop   and N  knight  N is used to avoid confusion with king   Different initials are used in other languages  Moves are recorded as follows 

notation of piece moved   destination square
Square names in algebraic chess notation
For example  Qg  means  queen moves to g    No letter initial is used for pawns  so e  means  pawn moves to e    When multiple moves could be rendered the same way  the file or rank from which the piece moved is added to resolve ambiguity  e g  Ngf  means  knight from the g file moves to the square f    R e  means  rook on the first rank moves to e     If a move may be disambiguated by rank or file  it is done by file  and in the rare case that both are needed  squares are listed normally  e g  Qh xe   
If the move is a capture   x  is usually inserted before the destination square  thus Bxf  means  bishop captures on f    When a pawn makes a capture  the file from which the pawn departed is often listed even when no disambiguation is necessary  for example  exd  
If a pawn moves to its last rank  achieving promotion  the piece chosen is indicated after the move  for example  e  Q or e Q   Castling is indicated by the special notations     for kingside castling and       for queenside castling  A move that places the opponent s king in check usually has the notation     suffixed  Checkmate can be indicated by suffixing      At the end of the game        means White won        means Black won  and       indicates a draw             Chess moves can be annotated with punctuation marks and other symbols  For example      indicates a good move       an excellent move      a mistake       a blunder       an interesting move that may not be best  or      a dubious move not easily refuted             

 Scholar s mate 
Moves are written as white black pairs  preceded by the move number and a period  Individual white moves are also recorded this way  while black moves are rendered with an ellipsis after the move number  For example  one variation of a simple trap known as the Scholar s mate  see animated diagram  can be recorded 

         e  e     Qh    Nc     Bc  Nf       Qxf  
The move      Nf    is recorded as a blunder  as it allows    Qxf   checkmate 
Games or sequences may be recorded in Portable Game Notation  PGN   a text based file format with support for annotative symbols  commentary  and background information  such as player names  It is based on short form English algebraic notation incorporating markup language  PGN transcripts  stored digitally as PGN   pgn  files can be processed by most chess software and are easily readable by humans 
Variants of algebraic notation include long algebraic  in which both the departure and destination square are indicated  abbreviated algebraic  in which capture signs  check signs  and ranks of pawn captures may be omitted  and figurine algebraic notation  used in chess books and magazines  which uses graphic symbols instead of initials to indicate pieces for readability regardless of language 
Until about       the majority of English language chess publications used descriptive notation  in which files are identified by the initial letter of the piece that occupies the first rank at the beginning of the game  In descriptive notation  the common opening move   e  is rendered as    P K     pawn to king four    Another system is ICCF numeric notation  recognized by the International Correspondence Chess Federation though its use is in decline 
In tournament games  players are normally required to keep a score  written record of the game   This is a requirement in all FIDE sanctioned games played at classical time controls             For this purpose  only algebraic notation is recognized by FIDE  though variants such as long algebraic are acceptable  game scores recorded in a different notation system may not be used as evidence in the event of a dispute

abcdefgh                abcdefgh          and its pawn structure  known as the Rauzer formation

     



Chess strategy is concerned with the evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long term plans for future play  During the evaluation  players must take into account numerous factors such as the value of the pieces on the board  control of the center and centralization  the pawn structure  king safety  and the control of key squares or groups of squares  for example  diagonals  open files  and dark or light squares  
The most basic step in evaluating a position is to count the total value of pieces of both sides              The point values used for this purpose are based on experience  usually  pawns are considered worth one point  knights and bishops about three points each  rooks about five points  the value difference between a rook and a bishop or knight being known as the exchange   and queens about nine points  The king is more valuable than all of the other pieces combined  since its checkmate loses the game  but is still capable as a fighting piece  in the endgame  the king is generally more powerful than a bishop or knight but less powerful than a rook              These basic values are then modified by other factors like position of the piece  e g  advanced pawns are usually more valuable than those on their initial squares   coordination between pieces  e g  a pair of bishops usually coordinate better than a bishop and a knight   or the type of position  e g  knights are generally better in closed positions with many pawns while bishops are more powerful in open positions              
Another important factor in the evaluation of chess positions is pawn structure  sometimes known as the pawn skeleton   the configuration of pawns on the chessboard              Since pawns are the least mobile of the pieces  pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic nature of the position  Weaknesses in pawn structure include isolated  doubled  or backward pawns and holes  once created  they are often permanent  Care must therefore be taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset  for example  by the possibility of developing an attack              


Tactics
Main article  Chess tactics
In chess  tactics generally refer to short term maneuvers        so short term that they can be calculated in advance by a human player  The possible depth of calculation depends on the player s ability  In quiet positions with many possibilities on both sides  a deep calculation is more difficult and may not be practical  while in positions with a limited number of forced variations  strong players can calculate long sequences of moves 
Theoreticians describe many elementary tactical methods and typical maneuvers  for example  pins  forks  skewers  batteries  discovered attacks  especially discovered checks   zwischenzugs  deflections  decoys  sacrifices  underminings  overloadings  and interferences              Simple one move or two move tactical actions        threats  exchanges of material  and double attacks        can be combined into longer sequences of tactical maneuvers that are often forced from the point of view of one or both players  A forced variation that involves a sacrifice and usually results in a tangible gain is called a combination              Brilliant combinations        such as those in the Immortal Game        are considered beautiful and are admired by chess lovers 
A common type of chess exercise  aimed at developing players  tactical skills  is a position where a combination is available and the challenge is to find it  Such positions are usually taken from actual games or from analysis of actual games  Solutions usually result in checkmate  decisive advantage  or successful defense  Tactical exercises are commonly found in instructional books  chess magazines  newspaper chess columns  and internet chess sites             

Phases
Chess theory divides chess games into three phases with different sets of strategies  the opening  the middlegame  and lastly the endgame  There is no universally accepted way to delineate the three phases of the game  the middlegame is typically considered to have begun after       moves  and the endgame when only a few pieces remain 

Opening
Main article  Chess opening

abcdefgh                abcdefghThe Najdorf Variation      a    a popular line of the Sicilian Defense      c    itself a response to the King s Pawn Game    e  

Competitive players typically learn  memorize  and play well documented sequences of opening moves  The most common starting moves for White are   e  and   d   which usually lead to substantially different types of positions  and Black has multiple viable responses to both 
Sequences of opening moves are referred to as openings and are catalogued in reference works  such as the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings  There are thousands of openings  though only a small fraction of them are commonly played  variations of openings may also be given names  Openings vary widely in character from quiet positional play  for example  the R ti Opening  to sharp aggressive play  like the Latvian Gambit   In some opening lines  the exact sequence considered best for both sides has been worked out to more than    moves             
The fundamental strategic aims of most openings are similar             

Development  moving pieces  particularly bishops and knights  forward to squares on which they are useful  defending  attacking  and controlling important squares  and or have the potential to take part in future plans and ideas 
Control of the center  control of the central squares allows pieces to be moved to any part of the board relatively easily  and can inhibit the mobility of the opponent s pieces 
King safety  typically secured by castling  incorrectly timed castling can be wasteful or even harmful  however 
Pawn structure  players strive to avoid the creation of pawn weaknesses such as isolated  doubled  or backward pawns        and to force such weaknesses in the opponent s position 
Most players and theoreticians consider that White  by virtue of the initiative granted from moving first  begins the game with a small advantage              Black usually strives to neutralize White s advantage and achieve equality  or to develop dynamic counterplay in an unbalanced position 

Middlegame
Main article  Chess middlegame
The middlegame is the part of the game that starts after the opening  Because the opening theory has ended  players have to form plans based on the features of the position  and at the same time take into account the tactical possibilities of the position              The middlegame is the phase in which most combinations occur  Combinations are a series of tactical moves executed to achieve some gain  Middlegame combinations are often connected with an attack against the opponent s king  Some typical patterns have their own names  for example  the Boden s Mate or the Lasker Bauer combination             
Specific plans or strategic themes will often arise from particular groups of openings that result in a specific type of pawn structure  An example is the minority attack  which is the attack of queenside pawns against an opponent who has more pawns on the queenside  The study of openings is therefore connected to the preparation of plans that are typical of the resulting middlegames             
Another important strategic question in the middlegame is whether and how to reduce material and transition into an endgame  i e  simplify   Minor material advantages can generally be transformed into victory only in an endgame  and therefore the stronger side must choose an appropriate way to achieve an ending  Not every reduction of material is good for this purpose  for example  if one side keeps a light squared bishop and the opponent has a dark squared one  the transformation into a bishops and pawns ending is usually advantageous for the weaker side only  because an endgame with bishops on opposite colors is likely to be a draw  even with an advantage of a pawn  or sometimes even with a two pawn advantage             

Endgame
Main article  Chess endgame
Example of zugzwang
abcdefgh                abcdefghThe side to move is disadvantaged 

The endgame  also end game or ending  is the stage of the game when there are few pieces left on the board  There are three main strategic differences between earlier stages of the game and the endgame             

Pawns become more important  Endgames often revolve around endeavors to promote a pawn by advancing it to the furthest rank 
The king  which requires safeguarding from attack during the middlegame  emerges as a strong piece in the endgame  It is often used to protect its own pawns  attack enemy pawns  and hinder moves of the opponent s king 
Zugzwang  a situation in which the player who is to move is forced to incur a disadvantage  is often a factor in endgames but rarely in other stages of the game  In the example diagram  either side having the move is in zugzwang  Black to move must play     Kb  allowing White to promote the pawn after   Kd   White to move must permit a draw  either by   Kc  stalemate or by losing the pawn after any other legal move 
Endgames can be classified according to the type of pieces remaining on the board  Basic checkmates are positions in which one side has only a king and the other side has one or two pieces and can checkmate the opposing king  with the pieces working together with their king  For example  king and pawn endgames involve only kings and pawns on one or both sides  and the task of the stronger side is to promote one of the pawns  Other more complicated endings are classified according to pieces on the board other than kings  such as  rook and pawn versus rook  endgames 


Problems and studies

Chess problems  also called chess compositions  are composed positions  usually created for artistic effect rather than practical application  The creator is known as a chess composer             
There are many types of chess problems  the most common being directmates  in which White is required to move and checkmate Black within a specified number of moves  usually two or three  against any defense 
These are commonly referred to as  two movers    three movers   or  more movers    Many movers   also known as  long range problems   of over     moves have been composed  the current record standing at over      these usually require repetitions of the same manoeuvre in order to produce a repeated zugzwang and force detrimental pawn advances                         
Directmates usually consist of positions unlikely to occur in an actual game  and are intended to illustrate a particular theme  usually requiring a surprising or counterintuitive key move  Themes associated with chess problems occasionally appear in actual games  when they are referred to as  problem like  moves             
Other common types of problems include 

Helpmates  in which Black moves first and cooperates with White to get Black s king checkmated
Selfmates  in which White moves first and forces Black to checkmate White
Retrograde analysis problems  in which the solver is required to work out what has previously occurred in the game  for example to prove that castling is illegal in the current position
The above type of problems are usually considered orthodox  in the sense that the standard rules of chess are observed 
Fairy chess problems  also called heterodox problems  involve altered rules  such as the use of unconventional pieces or boards  or stipulations that contradict the standard rules of chess such as reflexmates or seriesmovers 
Studies are usually considered distinct from problems  although there is some overlap  In a study  the stipulation is that White to play must win or draw  without specifying any particular number of moves  The majority of studies are endgame positions  with varying degrees of realism or practical application             
Tournaments for composition and solving of chess problems and studies are organized by the World Federation for Chess Composition  WFCC   which works cooperatively with but independent of FIDE  The WFCC awards titles for composing and solving chess problems             

Chess in public spaces
Chess is often played in public spaces such as parks and town squares  Although the nature of these games is often casual  the chess hustling scene has seen growth in urban areas such as New York City

Organized competition
Tournaments and matches
Tata Steel Chess Tournament       Wijk aan Zee  the Netherlands 
Contemporary chess is an organized sport with structured international and national leagues  tournaments  and congresses  Thousands of chess tournaments  matches  and festivals are held around the world every year catering to players of all levels 
Tournaments with a small number of players may use the round robin format  in which every player plays one game against every other player  For a large number of players  the Swiss system may be used  in which each player is paired against an opponent who has the same  or as similar as possible  score in each round  In either case  a player s score is usually calculated as   point for each game won and one half point for each game drawn  Variations such as  football scoring     points for a win    point for a draw  may be used by tournament organizers  but ratings are always calculated on the basis of standard scoring  A player s score may be reported as total score out of games played  e g         points for versus points against  e g          or by number of wins  losses and draws  e g          
The term  match  refers not to an individual game  but to either a series of games between two players  or a team competition in which each player of one team plays one game against a player of the other team 

Governance
Chess s international governing body is usually known by its French acronym FIDE  pronounced FEE day   French  F d ration Internationale des  checs   or International Chess Federation  FIDE s membership consists of the national chess organizations of over     countries  there are also several associate members  including various supra national organizations  the International Braille Chess Association  IBCA   International Chess Committee of the Deaf  ICCD   and the International Physically Disabled Chess Association  IPCA               FIDE is recognized as a sports governing body by the International Olympic Committee              but chess has never been part of the Olympic Games

Titles and rankings
Main article  Chess titles
In order to rank players  FIDE  ICCF  and most national chess organizations use the Elo rating system developed by Arpad Elo  An average club player has a rating of about       the highest FIDE rating of all time        was achieved by Magnus Carlsen on the March      FIDE rating list             
Players may be awarded lifetime titles by FIDE             

Grandmaster  GM  is the highest title a chess player can attain  For the GM title  a player must have had an Elo rating of      or more at least once and must achieve three results of a prescribed standard  called norms  in tournaments involving other grandmasters  including some from countries other than the applicant s  There are other milestones that can substitute for norms  such as winning the World Junior Championship 
International Master  IM   The conditions are similar to GM  but less demanding  The minimum rating for the IM title is      
FIDE Master  FM   The usual way for a player to qualify for the FIDE Master title is by achieving a FIDE rating of      or more 
Candidate Master  CM   Similar to FM  but with a FIDE rating of at least      
The above titles are known as  open  titles  obtainable by both men and women  There are also separate women only titles  Woman Grandmaster  WGM   Woman International Master  WIM   Woman FIDE Master  WFM  and Woman Candidate Master  WCM   These require a performance level approximately     rating points below their respective open titles  and their continued existence has sometimes been controversial      citation needed      Beginning with Nona Gaprindashvili in       a number of women have earned the open GM title     as of July          update           note       
FIDE also awards titles for arbiters and trainers                          International titles are also awarded to composers and solvers of chess problems and to correspondence chess players  by the International Correspondence Chess Federation   National chess organizations may also award titles 

History

Origins
Sasanian Empire King Khosrow I sits on his throne before the chessboard  while his vizir and the Indian envoy Deva Sharma  probably sent by the Maukhari King  arvavarman of Kannauj  are playing chess  Shahnama    th century AD                         
Texts referring to the origins of chess date from the beginning of the seventh century  Three are written in Pahlavi  Middle Persian              and one  the Harshacharita  is in Sanskrit              One of these texts  the Chatrang namak  represents one of the earliest written accounts of chess  The narrator Bozorgmehr explains that Chatrang   Chess  in Pahlavi  was introduced to Persia by  Dewasarm  a great ruler of India  during the reign of Khosrow I             

Dewasarm has fashioned this chatrang after the likeness of a battle  and in its likeness are two supreme rulers after the likeness of Kings  shah   with the essentials of rooks  rukh  to right and to left  with Counsellor  farzin  in the likeness of a commander of the champions  with the Elephant  pil  in the likeness of the commander of the rearguard  with Horse  asp  in the likeness of the commander of the cavalry  with the Footsoldier  piyadak  in the likeness of so many infantry in the vanguard of the battle         Translation by Murray                   
An illustration from a Persian manuscript  A treatise on chess   The Ambassadors from India present the Chatrang to Khosrow I Anushirwan   Immortal Soul   King of Persia    th century AD 
The oldest known chess manual was in Arabic and dates to about      written by al Adli ar Rumi            a renowned Arab chess player  titled Kitab ash shatranj  The Book of Chess   This is a lost manuscript  but is referenced in later works              Here also  al Adli attributes the origins of Persian chess to India  along with the eighth century collection of fables Kal la wa Dimna              By the   th century  a substantial consensus                         developed regarding chess s origins in northwest India in the early seventh century              More recently  this consensus has been the subject of further scrutiny             
The early forms of chess in India were known as chatura ga  Sanskrit            literally  four divisions   of the military         infantry  cavalry  elephants  and chariotry   represented by pieces that would later evolve into the modern pawn  knight  bishop  and rook  respectively  Chaturanga was played on an     uncheckered board  called asht pada              Thence it spread eastward and westward along the Silk Road  The earliest evidence of chess is found in nearby Sasanian Persia around     A D   where the game came to be known by the name chatrang  Persian                      Chatrang was taken up by the Muslim world after the Islamic conquest of Persia           where it was then named shatranj  Arabic         Persian          with the pieces largely retaining their Persian names  In Spanish   shatranj  was rendered as ajedrez   al shatranj    in Portuguese as xadrez  and in Greek as            zatrikion  which comes directly from the Persian chatrang               but in the rest of Europe it was replaced by versions of the Persian sh h   king    from which the English words  check  and  chess  descend      note        The word  checkmate  is derived from the Persian sh h m t   the king is dead

Xiangqi is the form of chess best known in China  The eastern migration of chess  into China and Southeast Asia  has even less documentation than its migration west  making it largely conjectured  The word xi ngq       was used in China to refer to a game from     A D  at the latest  but it has not been proven that this game was directly related to chess                         
The first reference to Chinese chess appears in a book entitled Xu ngua  L         Record of the Mysterious and Strange    dating to about      A minority view holds that Western chess arose from xi ngq  or one of its predecessors                          Chess historians Jean Louis Cazaux and Rick Knowlton contend that xiangqi s intrinsic characteristics make it easier to construct an evolutionary path from China to India Persia than the opposite direction             
The oldest archaeological chess artifacts   ivory pieces   were excavated in ancient Afrasiab  today s Samarkand  in Uzbekistan  Central Asia  and date to about      with some of them possibly being older  Remarkably  almost all findings of the oldest pieces come from along the Silk Road  from the former regions of the Tarim Basin  today s Xinjiang in China   Transoxiana  Sogdiana  Bactria  Gandhara  to Iran on one end and to India through Kashmir on the other             

These are some of the seven Early Islamic ivory chess pieces excavated in Samarkand in       They date to the    s and are among the oldest in the world               The ivory came from India 
The game reached Western Europe and Russia via at least three routes  the earliest being in the ninth century  By the year       it had spread throughout both the Muslim Iberia and Latin Europe              A Latin poem called Versus de scachis   Verses on Chess   dated to the late   th century  has been preserved at Einsiedeln Abbey in Switzerland 

           Origins of the modern game
The game of chess was then played and known in all European countries  A famous   th century Spanish manuscript covering chess  backgammon  and dice is known as the Libro de los juegos  which is the earliest European treatise on chess as well as being the oldest document on European tables games              The rules were fundamentally similar to those of the Arabic shatranj  The differences were mostly in the use of a checkered board instead of a plain monochrome board used by Arabs and the habit of allowing some or all pawns to make an initial double step  In some regions  the queen  which had replaced the wazir  or the king could also make an initial two square leap under some conditions              

A tactical puzzle from Lucena s      book
Around       the rules of shatranj started to be modified in Europe  culminating  several major changes later  in the emergence of modern chess practically as it is known today              A major change was the modern piece movement rules  which began to appear in intellectual circles in Valencia  Spain  around           note        which established the foundations and brought it very close to current chess  These new rules then were quickly adopted in Italy and Southern France before diffusing into the rest of Europe                          Pawns gained the ability to advance two squares on their first move  while bishops and queens acquired their modern movement powers  The queen replaced the earlier vizier chess piece toward the end of the   th      century and by the   th      century had become the most powerful piece              in light of that  modern chess was often referred to at the time as  Queen s Chess  or  Mad Queen Chess               Castling  derived from the  king s leap   usually in combination with a pawn or rook move to bring the king to safety  was introduced  These new rules quickly spread throughout Western Europe 
Writings about chess theory began to appear in the late   th      century  An anonymous treatise on chess of      with the first part containing some openings and the second    endgames is deposited in the library of the University of G ttingen              The book El Libro dels jochs partitis dels schachs en nombre de     was written by Francesc Vicent in Segorbe in       but no copy of this work has survived              The Repetici n de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez  Repetition of Love and the Art of Playing Chess  by Spanish churchman Luis Ram rez de Lucena was published in Salamanca in                   Lucena and later masters like Portuguese Pedro Damiano  Italians Giovanni Leonardo Di Bona  Giulio Cesare Polerio and Gioachino Greco  and Spanish bishop Ruy L pez de Segura developed elements of opening theory and started to analyze simple endgames 

           Romantic era
The  Immortal Game   Anderssen vs  Kieseritzky      
In the   th century  the center of European chess life moved from Southern Europe to mainland France      citation needed      The two most important French masters were Fran ois Andr  Danican Philidor  a musician by profession  who discovered the importance of pawns for chess strategy  and later Louis Charles Mah  de La Bourdonnais  who won a famous series of matches against Irish master Alexander McDonnell in                   Centers of chess activity in this period were coffee houses in major European cities like Caf  de la R gence in Paris and Simpson s Divan in London                         
At the same time  the Romantic intellectual movement had had a far reaching impact on chess  with aesthetics and tactical beauty being held in higher regard than objective soundness and strategic planning  As a result  virtually all games began with the Open Game  and it was considered unsportsmanlike to decline gambits that invited tactical play such as the King s Gambit and the Evans Gambit              This chess philosophy is known as Romantic chess  and its sharp  tactical style of play was predominant until the late   th century             
The rules concerning stalemate were finalized in the early   th      century  Also in the   th      century  the convention that White moves first was established  formerly either White or Black could move first   Finally  the rules around castling and en passant captures were standardized        variations in these rules persisted in Italy until the late   th      century  The resulting standard game is sometimes referred to as Western chess             or international chess              particularly in Asia where other games of the chess family such as xiangqi are prevalent  Since the   th      century  the only rule changes  such as the establishment of the correct procedure for claiming a draw by repetition  have been technical in nature 

A depiction of the chess match between Howard Staunton and Pierre Saint Amant  on    December     
As the   th century progressed  chess organization developed quickly  Many chess clubs  chess books  and chess journals appeared  There were correspondence matches between cities  for example  the London Chess Club played against the Edinburgh Chess Club in                   Chess problems became a regular part of   th century newspapers  Bernhard Horwitz  Josef Kling  and Samuel Loyd composed some of the most influential problems  In       von der Lasa published his and Bilguer s Handbuch des Schachspiels  Handbook of Chess   the first comprehensive manual of chess theory 
The first modern chess tournament was organized by Howard Staunton  a leading English chess player  and was held in London in       It was won by the German Adolf Anderssen  who was hailed as the leading chess master  His brilliant  energetic attacking style was typical for the time                          Sparkling games like Anderssen s Immortal Game and Evergreen Game or Morphy s  Opera Game  were regarded as the highest possible summit of the art of chess             
Deeper insight into the nature of chess came with the American Paul Morphy  an extraordinary chess prodigy  Morphy won against all important competitors  except Staunton  who refused to play   including Anderssen  during his short chess career between      and       Morphy s success stemmed from a combination of brilliant attacks and sound strategy  he intuitively knew how to prepare attacks             

           Birth of a sport
Wilhelm Steinitz  the first official World Chess Champion  from      to     
Rubinstein vs  Nimzowitsch      
abcdefgh                abcdefghNimzowitsch later commented   Each side castles now with a clear conscience  for not even the most hypermodern pair of masters can produce more than four fianchettoed Bishops              

Prague born Wilhelm Steinitz laid the foundations for a scientific approach to the game  the art of breaking a position down into components             and preparing correct plans              In addition to his theoretical achievements  Steinitz founded an important tradition  his triumph over the leading German master Johannes Zukertort in      is regarded as the first official World Chess Championship  This win marked a stylistic transition at the highest levels of chess from an attacking  tactical style predominant in the Romantic era to a more positional  strategic style introduced to the chess world by Steinitz  Steinitz lost his crown in      to a much younger player  the German mathematician Emanuel Lasker  who maintained this title for    years  the longest tenure of any world champion              
After the end of the   th century  the number of master tournaments and matches held annually quickly grew  The first Olympiad was held in Paris in       and FIDE was founded initially for the purpose of organizing that event  In       the Women s World Chess Championship was established  the first to hold the title was Czech English master Vera Menchik              
A prodigy from Cuba  Jos  Ra l Capablanca  known for his skill in endgames  won the World Championship from Lasker in       Capablanca was undefeated in tournament play for eight years  from      to       His successor        was the Russian French Alexander Alekhine  a strong attacking player who died as the world champion in       Alekhine briefly lost the title to Dutch player Max Euwe in      and regained it two years later              
In the interwar period  chess was revolutionized by the new theoretical school of so called hypermodernists like Aron Nimzowitsch and Richard R ti  They advocated controlling the center of the board with distant pieces rather than with pawns  thus inviting opponents to occupy the center with pawns  which become objects of attack               Among the innovations popularized by hypermodernists was the fianchetto  the development of bishops away from  rather than towards  the center  onto the b  and g files 

           Post World War II era
Mikhail Botvinnik  the first post war World Champion
After the death of Alekhine  a new World Champion was sought  FIDE  which has controlled the title since then  ran a tournament of elite players  The winner of the      tournament was Russian Mikhail Botvinnik  In       FIDE established a system of titles  conferring the title of Grandmaster on    players   Some sources state that  in       the title of chess Grandmaster was first formally conferred by Tsar Nicholas II of Russia to Lasker  Capablanca  Alekhine  Tarrasch  and Marshall  but this is a disputed claim      note        
Botvinnik started an era of Soviet dominance in the chess world  which mainly through the Soviet government s politically inspired efforts to demonstrate intellectual superiority over the West                           stood almost uninterrupted for more than a half century  Until the dissolution of the Soviet Union  there was only one non Soviet champion  American Bobby Fischer  champion                          Botvinnik also revolutionized opening theory  Previously  Black strove for equality  attempting to neutralize White s first move advantage  As Black  Botvinnik strove for the initiative from the beginning               In the previous informal system of World Championships  the current champion decided which challenger he would play for the title and the challenger was forced to seek sponsors for the match  FIDE set up a new system of qualifying tournaments and matches  The world s strongest players were seeded into Interzonal tournaments  where they were joined by players who had qualified from Zonal tournaments  The leading finishers in these Interzonals would go through the  Candidates  stage  which was initially a tournament  and later a series of knockout matches  The winner of the Candidates would then play the reigning champion for the title  A champion defeated in a match had a right to play a rematch a year later  This system operated on a three year cycle  Botvinnik participated in championship matches over a period of fifteen years  He won the world championship tournament in      and retained the title in tied matches in      and       In       he lost to Vasily Smyslov  but regained the title in a rematch in       In       he lost the title to the    year old Latvian prodigy Mikhail Tal  an accomplished tactician and attacking player who is widely regarded as one of the most creative players ever               hence his nickname  the magician from Riga   Botvinnik again regained the title in a rematch in      

Bobby Fischer  World Champion from      to     
Following the      event  FIDE abolished the automatic right of a deposed champion to a rematch  and the next champion  Armenian Tigran Petrosian  a player renowned for his defensive and positional skills  held the title for two cycles             His successor  Boris Spassky from Russia  champion             won games in both positional and sharp tactical style               The next championship  the so called Match of the Century  saw the first non Soviet challenger since World War II  American Bobby Fischer  Fischer defeated his opponents in the Candidates matches by unheard of margins  and convincingly defeated Spassky for the world championship  The match was followed closely by news media of the day  leading to a surge in popularity for chess  it also held significant political importance at the height of the Cold War  with the match being seen by both sides as a microcosm of the conflict between East and West               In       however  Fischer refused to defend his title against Soviet Anatoly Karpov when he was unable to reach agreement on conditions with FIDE  and Karpov obtained the title by default               Fischer modernized many aspects of chess  especially by extensively preparing openings              
Karpov defended his title twice against Viktor Korchnoi and dominated the     s and early     s with a string of tournament successes               In the      World Chess Championship  Karpov faced his toughest challenge to date  the young Garry Kasparov from Baku  Soviet Azerbaijan  The match was aborted in controversial circumstances after   months and    games with Karpov leading by   wins to    but evidently exhausted  many commentators believed Kasparov  who had won the last two games  would have won the match had it continued  Kasparov won the      rematch  Kasparov and Karpov contested three further closely fought matches in            and       Kasparov winning them all               Kasparov became the dominant figure of world chess from the mid     s until his retirement from competition in      

Beginnings of chess technology
Chess playing computer programs  later known as chess engines  began to appear in the     s  In       the first major computer chess tournament  the North American Computer Chess Championship  was held  followed in      by the first World Computer Chess Championship  In the late     s  dedicated home chess computers such as Fidelity Electronics  Chess Challenger became commercially available  as well as software to run on home computers  The overall standard of computer chess was low  however  until the     s 
The first endgame tablebases  which provided perfect play for relatively simple endgames such as king and rook versus king and bishop  appeared in the late     s  This set a precedent to the complete six  and seven piece tablebases that became available in the     s and     s respectively              
The first commercial chess database  a collection of chess games searchable by move and position  was introduced by the German company ChessBase in                    Databases containing millions of chess games have since had a profound effect on opening theory and other areas of chess research 
Digital chess clocks were invented in       though they did not become commonplace until the     s  Digital clocks allow for time controls involving increments and delays 

     present  Rise of computers and online chess
Technology
The Internet enabled online chess as a new medium of playing  with chess servers allowing users to play other people from different parts of the world in real time  The first such server  known as Internet Chess Server  ICS   was developed at the University of Utah in       ICS formed the basis for the first commercial chess server  the Internet Chess Club  which was launched in       and for other early chess servers such as Free Internet Chess Server  FICS   Since then  many other platforms have appeared  and online chess began to rival over the board chess in popularity                            During the      COVID    pandemic  the isolation ensuing from quarantines imposed in many places around the world  combined with the success of the popular Netflix show The Queen s Gambit and other factors such as the popularity of online tournaments  notably PogChamps  and chess Twitch streamers  resulted in a surge of popularity not only for online chess  but for the game of chess in general  this phenomenon has been referred to in the media as the      online chess boom                           
Computer chess has also seen major advances  By the     s  chess engines could consistently defeat most amateurs  and in      Deep Blue defeated World Champion Garry Kasparov in a six game match  starting an era of computer dominance at the highest level of chess  In the     s  engines significantly stronger than even the best human players became accessible for free on a number of PC and mobile platforms  and free engine analysis became a commonplace feature on internet chess servers  An adverse effect of the easy availability of engine analysis on hand held devices and personal computers has been the rise of computer cheating  which has grown to be a major concern in both over the board and online chess               In       AlphaZero   a neural network also capable of playing shogi and Go   was introduced  Since then  many chess engines based on neural network evaluation have been written  the best of which have surpassed the traditional  brute force  engines  AlphaZero also introduced many novel ideas and ways of playing the game  which affected the style of play at the top level              
As endgame tablebases developed  they began to provide perfect play in endgame positions in which the game theoretical outcome was previously unknown  such as positions with king  queen and pawn against king and queen  In       Lewis Stiller published a tablebase for select six piece endgames                            and by       following the publication of Nalimov tablebases  all six piece endgame positions were solved  In       Lomonosov tablebases were published which solved all seven piece endgame positions               Use of tablebases enhances the performance of chess engines by providing definitive results in some branches of analysis 
Technological progress made in the     s and the   st century has influenced the way that chess is studied at all levels  as well as the state of chess as a spectator sport 
Previously  preparation at the professional level required an extensive chess library and several subscriptions to publications such as Chess Informant to keep up with opening developments and study opponents  games  Today  preparation at the professional level involves the use of databases containing millions of games  and engines to analyze different opening variations and prepare novelties               A number of online learning resources are also available for players of all levels  such as online courses  tactics trainers  and video lessons              
Since the late     s  it has been possible to follow major international chess events online  the players  moves being relayed in real time  Sensory boards have been developed to enable automatic transmission of moves  Chess players will frequently run engines while watching these games  allowing them to quickly identify mistakes by the players and spot tactical opportunities  While in the past the moves have been relayed live  today chess organizers will often impose a half hour delay as an anti cheating measure  In the mid to late     s   and especially following the      online boom   it became commonplace for supergrandmasters  such as Hikaru Nakamura and Magnus Carlsen  to livestream chess content on platforms such as Twitch                            Also following the boom  online chess started being viewed as an esport  with esport teams signing chess players for the first time in                    The number of esport teams signing chess players rose considerably in       after chess was added to Saudi Arabia s Esports World Cup                           

Growth
Organized chess even for young children has become common  FIDE holds world championships for age levels down to   years old  The largest tournaments  in number of players  are those held for children              
The number of grandmasters and other chess professionals has also grown in the modern era  Kenneth Regan and Guy Haworth conducted research involving comparison of move choices by players of different levels and from different periods with the analysis of strong chess engines  They concluded that the increase in the number of grandmasters and higher Elo ratings of the top players reflect an actual increase in the average standard of play  rather than  rating inflation  or  title inflation

Magnus Carlsen of Norway  top   FIDE ranked player since July     
In       Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short broke ties with FIDE to organize their own match for the World Championship and formed a competing Professional Chess Association  PCA   From then until       there were two simultaneous World Championships and respective World Champions  the PCA or  classical  champions extending the Steinitzian tradition in which the current champion plays a challenger in a series of games  and the other following FIDE s new format of many players competing in a large knockout tournament to determine the champion  Kasparov lost his PCA title in      to Vladimir Kramnik of Russia               Due to the complicated state of world chess politics and difficulties obtaining commercial sponsorships  Kasparov was never able to challenge for the title again  Despite this  he continued to dominate in top level tournaments and remained the world s highest rated player until his retirement from competitive chess in      
The World Chess Championship       in which Kramnik beat the FIDE World Champion Veselin Topalov  reunified the titles and made Kramnik the undisputed World Chess Champion               In September       he lost the title to Viswanathan Anand of India  Anand defended his title in the revenge match of                         and       Magnus Carlsen defeated Anand in       defending his title in                   and       whereafter he announced that he would not defend his title a fifth time  The      championship was played between the winner and runner up of the Candidates Tournament       Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia and Ding Liren of China  Ding beat Nepomniachtchi  making him the world champion              In       Indian Gukesh Dommaraju beat Ding

In the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance  chess was a part of noble culture  it was used to teach war strategy and was dubbed the  King s Game                Gentlemen are  to be meanly seene in the play at Chestes   says the overview at the beginning of Baldassare Castiglione s The Book of the Courtier        English      by Sir Thomas Hoby   but chess should not be a gentleman s main passion  Castiglione explains it further

And what say you to the game at chestes  It is truely an honest kynde of enterteynmente and wittie  quoth Syr Friderick  But me think it hath a fault  whiche is  that a man may be to couning at it  for who ever will be excellent in the playe of chestes  I beleave he must beestowe much tyme about it  and applie it with so much study  that a man may assoone learne some noble scyence  or compase any other matter of importaunce  and yet in the ende in beestowing all that laboure  he knoweth no more but a game  Therfore in this I beleave there happeneth a very rare thing  namely  that the meane is more commendable  then the excellency              
Some of the elaborate chess sets used by the aristocracy at least partially survive  such as the Lewis chessmen 
Chess was often used as a basis of sermons on morality  An example is Liber de moribus hominum et officiis nobilium sive super ludo scacchorum   Book of the customs of men and the duties of nobles or the Book of Chess    written by an Italian Dominican friar Jacobus de Cessolis c              This book was one of the most popular of the Middle Ages               The work was translated into many other languages  the first printed edition was published at Utrecht in       and was the basis for William Caxton s The Game and Playe of the Chesse         one of the first books printed in English               Different chess pieces were used as metaphors for different classes of people  and human duties were derived from the rules of the game or from visual properties of the chess pieces

Known in the circles of clerics  students  and merchants  chess entered into the popular culture of the Middle Ages  An example is the    th song of Carmina Burana from the   th      century  which starts with the names of chess pieces  Roch  pedites  regina                 The game of chess  at times  has been discouraged by various religious authorities in Middle Ages  Jewish               Catholic and Orthodox               Some Muslim authorities prohibited it even recently  for example Ruhollah Khomeini in      and Abdul Aziz ash Sheikh even later              
During the Age of Enlightenment  chess was viewed as a means of self improvement  Benjamin Franklin  in his article  The Morals of Chess          wrote 


The Game of Chess is not merely an idle amusement  several very valuable qualities of the mind  useful in the course of human life  are to be acquired and strengthened by it  so as to become habits ready on all occasions  for life is a kind of Chess  in which we have often points to gain  and competitors or adversaries to contend with  and in which there is a vast variety of good and ill events  that are  in some degree  the effect of prudence  or the want of it  By playing at Chess then  we may learn 
I  Foresight  which looks a little into futurity  and considers the consequences that may attend an action    
II  Circumspection  which surveys the whole Chess board  or scene of action    the relation of the several Pieces  and their situations    
III  Caution  not to make our moves too hastily                 


Through the Looking Glass  the Red King is snoring  Illustration by Sir John Tenniel 
Chess was occasionally criticized in the   th century as a waste of time                           
Chess is taught to children in schools around the world today  Many schools host chess clubs  and there are many scholastic tournaments specifically for children  Tournaments are held regularly in many countries  hosted by organizations such as the United States Chess Federation and the National Scholastic Chess Foundation              
Chess is many times depicted in the arts  significant works where chess plays a key role range from Thomas Middleton s A Game at Chess to Through the Looking Glass by Lewis Carroll  to Vladimir Nabokov s The Defense  to The Royal Game by Stefan Zweig  Chess has also featured in film classics such as Ingmar Bergman s The Seventh Seal  Satyajit Ray s The Chess Players  and Powell and Pressburger s A Matter of Life and Death 
Chess is also present in contemporary popular culture  For example  the characters in Star Trek play a futuristic version of the game called  Federation Tri Dimensional Chess                and  Wizard s Chess  is played in J K  Rowling s Harry Potter              

Mathematics

The game structure and nature of chess are related to several branches of mathematics  Many combinatorical and topological problems connected to chess  such as the knight s tour and the eight queens puzzle  have been known for hundreds of years 

Mathematicians Euler  Legendre  de Moivre  and Vandermonde studied the knight s tour 
The number of legal positions in chess is estimated to be                                              with a     confidence level               with a game tree complexity of approximately        The game tree complexity of chess was first calculated by Claude Shannon as        a number known as the Shannon number               An average position typically has thirty to forty possible moves  but there may be as few as zero  in the case of checkmate or stalemate  or  in a constructed position  as many as                  
In       Ernst Zermelo used chess as a basis for his theory of game strategies  which is considered one of the predecessors of game theory               Zermelo s theorem states that it is possible to solve chess  i e  to determine with certainty the outcome of a perfectly played game  either White can force a win  or Black can force a win  or both sides can force at least a draw                With      legal positions in chess  however  it will take an impossibly long time to compute a perfect strategy with any feasible technology              

Applied mathematics
A novel methodology in steganography explores the use of chess based covers  such as puzzles  chess problems  game reports  training documents  news articles  etc   for concealing data within a selection of moves  each hiding some bits                            Several proof of concept projects have been developed that convert text or files into binary code  which is then converted into a series of legal chess moves  that can then be decrypted and downloaded              
Correspondence chess has been historically suspected of being a potential steganographic medium  Melville Davisson Post documented a chess problem that was used to create a pictorial cipher during World War I                            During World War II  extensive postal censorship was imposed on military personnel from the United States and Canada that made playing correspondence chess impossible  arising from suspicion that chess could be used to send secret messages to the enemies              

Psychology
There is an extensive scientific literature on chess psychology      note                                                            Alfred Binet and others showed that knowledge and verbal  rather than visuospatial  ability lies at the core of expertise                            In his doctoral thesis  Adriaan de Groot showed that chess masters can rapidly perceive the key features of a position               According to de Groot  this perception  made possible by years of practice and study  is more important than the sheer ability to anticipate moves  De Groot showed that chess masters can memorize positions shown for a few seconds almost perfectly  The ability to memorize does not alone account for chess playing skill  since masters and novices  when faced with random arrangements of chess pieces  had equivalent recall  about six positions in each case   Rather  it is the ability to recognize patterns  which are then memorized  which distinguished the skilled players from the novices  When the positions of the pieces were taken from an actual game  the masters had almost total positional recall              
More recent research has focused on chess as mental training  the respective roles of knowledge and look ahead search  brain imaging studies of chess masters and novices  blindfold chess  the role of personality and intelligence in chess skill  gender differences  and computational models of chess expertise  The role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains of expertise has led to much empirical investigation  Ericsson and colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient for reaching high levels of expertise in chess               Recent research  however  fails to replicate their results and indicates that factors other than practice are also important                           
For example  Fernand Gobet and colleagues have shown that stronger players started playing chess at a young age and that experts born in the Northern Hemisphere are more likely to have been born in late winter and early spring  Compared to the general population  chess players are more likely to be non right handed  though they found no correlation between handedness and skill              
A relationship between chess skill and intelligence has long been discussed in scientific literature as well as in popular culture  Academic studies that investigate the relationship date back at least to                    Although one meta analysis and most children studies find a positive correlation between general cognitive ability and chess skill  adult studies show mixed results
