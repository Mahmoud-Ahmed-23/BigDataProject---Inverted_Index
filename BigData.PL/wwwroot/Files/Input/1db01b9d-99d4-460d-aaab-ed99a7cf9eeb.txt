 Psychology     portalvte
Intelligence has been defined in many ways  the capacity for abstraction  logic  understanding  self awareness  learning  emotional knowledge  reasoning  planning  creativity  critical thinking  and problem solving  It can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information and to retain it as knowledge to be applied to adaptive behaviors within an environment or context            
The term rose to prominence during the early     s      vague                            Most psychologists believe that intelligence can be divided into various domains or competencies            
Intelligence has been long studied in humans  and across numerous disciplines  It has also been observed in the cognition of non human animals             Some researchers have suggested that plants exhibit forms of intelligence  though this remains controversial                                  


Etymology edit 
Main article  Nous
The word intelligence derives from the Latin nouns intelligentia or intell ctus  which in turn stem from the verb intelligere  to comprehend or perceive  In the Middle Ages  the word intellectus became the scholarly technical term for understanding and a translation for the Greek philosophical term nous  This term  however  was strongly linked to the metaphysical and cosmological theories of teleological scholasticism  including theories of the immortality of the soul  and the concept of the active intellect  also known as the active intelligence   This approach to the study of nature was strongly rejected by  early modern philosophers such as Francis Bacon  Thomas Hobbes  John Locke  and David Hume  all of whom preferred  understanding   in place of  intellectus  or  intelligence   in their English philosophical works                         Hobbes for example  in his Latin De Corpore  used  intellectus intelligit   translated in the English version as  the understanding understandeth   as a typical example of a logical absurdity               Intelligence  has therefore become less common in English language philosophy  but it has later been taken up  with the scholastic theories that it now implies  in more contemporary psychology             

Definitions edit 
There is controversy over how to define intelligence  Scholars describe its constituent abilities in various ways  and differ in the degree to which they conceive of intelligence as quantifiable             
A consensus report called Intelligence  Knowns and Unknowns  published in      by the Board of Scientific Affairs of the American Psychological Association  states 

Individuals differ from one another in their ability to understand complex ideas  to adapt effectively to the environment  to learn from experience  to engage in various forms of reasoning  to overcome obstacles by taking thought  Although these individual differences can be substantial  they are never entirely consistent  a given person s intellectual performance will vary on different occasions  in different domains  as judged by different criteria  Concepts of  intelligence  are attempts to clarify and organize this complex set of phenomena  Although considerable clarity has been achieved in some areas  no such conceptualization has yet answered all the important questions  and none commands universal assent  Indeed  when two dozen prominent theorists were recently asked to define intelligence  they gave two dozen  somewhat different  definitions             
Psychologists and learning researchers also have suggested definitions of intelligence such as the following 




Researcher

Quotation


Alfred Binet

Judgment  otherwise called  good sense    practical sense    initiative   the faculty of adapting one s self to circumstances     auto critique             


David Wechsler

The aggregate or global capacity of the individual to act purposefully  to think rationally  and to deal effectively with his environment             


Lloyd Humphreys

    the resultant of the process of acquiring  storing in memory  retrieving  combining  comparing  and using in new contexts information and conceptual skills              


Howard Gardner

To my mind  a human intellectual competence must entail a set of skills of problem solving enabling the individual to resolve genuine problems or difficulties that he or she encounters and  when appropriate  to create an effective product and must also entail the potential for finding or creating problems and thereby laying the groundwork for the acquisition of new knowledge             


Robert Sternberg  amp  William Salter

Goal directed adaptive behavior             


Reuven Feuerstein

The theory of Structural Cognitive Modifiability describes intelligence as  the unique propensity of human beings to change or modify the structure of their cognitive functioning to adapt to the changing demands of a life situation              


Shane Legg  amp  Marcus Hutter

A synthesis of     definitions from psychology  philosophy  and AI researchers   Intelligence measures an agent s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments               which has been mathematically formalized

 Intelligence is a force  F  that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action  It acts to maximize future freedom of action  or keep options open  with some strength T  with the diversity of possible accessible futures  S  up to some future time horizon     In short  intelligence doesn t like to get trapped  


Human edit 
Main article  Human intelligence
Human intelligence is the intellectual power of humans  which is marked by complex cognitive feats and high levels of motivation and self awareness                          Intelligence enables humans to remember descriptions of things and use those descriptions in future behaviors  It gives humans the cognitive abilities to learn  form concepts  understand  and reason  including the capacities to recognize patterns  innovate  plan  solve problems  and employ language to communicate  These cognitive abilities can be organized into frameworks like fluid vs  crystallized and the Unified Cattell Horn Carroll model             which contains abilities like fluid reasoning  perceptual speed  verbal abilities  and others 
Intelligence is different from learning  Learning refers to the act of retaining facts and information or abilities and being able to recall them for future use  Intelligence  on the other hand  is the cognitive ability of someone to perform these and other processes  

Intelligence quotient  IQ  edit 
Main article  Intelligence quotient
There have been various attempts to quantify intelligence via psychometric testing  Prominent among these are the various Intelligence Quotient  IQ  tests  which were first developed in the early   th century to screen children for intellectual disability              Over time  IQ tests became more pervasive  being used to screen immigrants  military recruits  and job applicants              As the tests became more popular  belief that IQ tests measure a fundamental and unchanging attribute that all humans possess became widespread              
An influential theory that promoted the idea that IQ measures a fundamental quality possessed by every person is the theory of General Intelligence  or g factor              The g factor is a construct that summarizes the correlations observed between an individual s scores on a range of cognitive tests  
Today  most psychologists agree that IQ measures at least some aspects of human intelligence  particularly the ability to thrive in an academic context              However  many psychologists question the validity of IQ tests as a measure of intelligence as a whole                         
There is debate about the heritability of IQ  that is  what proportion of differences in IQ test performance between individuals are explained by genetic or environmental factors                          The scientific consensus is that genetics does not explain average differences in IQ test performance between racial groups                                     

Emotional edit 
Main article  Emotional intelligence
Emotional intelligence is thought to be the ability to convey emotion to others in an understandable way as well as to read the emotions of others accurately              Some theories imply that a heightened emotional intelligence could also lead to faster generating and processing of emotions in addition to the accuracy              In addition  higher emotional intelligence is thought to help us manage emotions  which is beneficial for our problem solving skills  Emotional intelligence is important to our mental health and has ties to social intelligence             

Social edit 
Main article  Social intelligence
Social intelligence is the ability to understand the social cues and motivations of others and oneself in social situations  It is thought to be distinct from other types of intelligence  but has relations to emotional intelligence  Social intelligence has coincided with other studies that focus on how we make judgements of others  the accuracy with which we do so  and why people would be viewed as having positive or negative social character  There is debate as to whether or not these studies and social intelligence come from the same theories or if there is a distinction between them  and they are generally thought to be of two different schools of thought             

Moral edit 
Main article  Moral intelligence
Moral intelligence is the capacity to understand right from wrong and to behave based on the value that is believed to be right              It is considered a distinct form of intelligence  independent to both emotional and cognitive intelligence             

Book smart and street smart edit 
Concepts of  book smarts  and  street smart  are contrasting views based on the premise that some people have knowledge gained through academic study  but may lack the experience to sensibly apply that knowledge  while others have knowledge gained through practical experience  but may lack accurate information usually gained through study by which to effectively apply that knowledge  Artificial intelligence researcher Hector Levesque has noted that 

Given the importance of learning through text in our own personal lives and in our culture  it is perhaps surprising how utterly dismissive we tend to be of it  It is sometimes derided as being merely  book knowledge   and having it is being  book smart   In contrast  knowledge acquired through direct experience and apprenticeship is called  street knowledge   and having it is being  street smart              
Nonhuman animal edit 
Main article  Animal cognition
A crab eating macaque using a stone
Although humans have been the primary focus of intelligence researchers  scientists have also attempted to investigate animal intelligence  or more broadly  animal cognition  These researchers are interested in studying both mental ability in a particular species  and comparing abilities between species  They study various measures of problem solving  as well as numerical and verbal reasoning abilities  Some challenges include defining intelligence so it has the same meaning across species  and operationalizing a measure that accurately compares mental ability across species and contexts             
Wolfgang K hler s research on the intelligence of apes is an example of research in this area  as is Stanley Coren s book  The Intelligence of Dogs              Non human animals particularly noted and studied for their intelligence include chimpanzees  bonobos  notably the language using Kanzi  and other great apes  dolphins  elephants and to some extent parrots  rats and ravens             
Cephalopod intelligence provides an important comparative study  Cephalopods appear to exhibit characteristics of significant intelligence  yet their nervous systems differ radically from those of backboned animals  Vertebrates such as mammals  birds  reptiles and fish have shown a fairly high degree of intellect that varies according to each species  The same is true with arthropods             

g factor in non humans edit 
Main article  g Factor in Non Humans
Evidence of a general factor of intelligence has been observed in non human animals  First described in humans  the g factor has since been identified in a number of non human species             
Cognitive ability and intelligence cannot be measured using the same  largely verbally dependent  scales developed for humans  Instead  intelligence is measured using a variety of interactive and observational tools focusing on innovation  habit reversal  social learning  and responses to novelty  Studies have shown that g is responsible for     of the individual variance in cognitive ability measures in primates             and between     and     of the variance in mice  Locurto  Locurto   These values are similar to the accepted variance in IQ explained by g in humans                      

Plant edit 
Main articles  Plant perception  physiology         Plant cognition  and Plant cognition
It has been argued that plants should also be classified as intelligent based on their ability to sense and model external and internal environments and adjust their morphology  physiology and phenotype accordingly to ensure self preservation and reproduction                         
A counter argument is that intelligence is commonly understood to involve the creation and use of persistent memories as opposed to computation that does not involve learning  If this is accepted as definitive of intelligence  then it includes the artificial intelligence of robots capable of  machine learning   but excludes those purely autonomic sense reaction responses that can be observed in many plants  Plants are not limited to automated sensory motor responses  however  they are capable of discriminating positive and negative experiences and of  learning   registering memories  from their past experiences  They are also capable of communication  accurately computing their circumstances  using sophisticated cost benefit analysis and taking tightly controlled actions to mitigate and control the diverse environmental stressors                                   

Artificial edit 
Main article  Artificial intelligence
Scholars studying artificial intelligence have proposed definitions of intelligence that include the intelligence demonstrated by machines  Some of these definitions are meant to be general enough to encompass human and other animal intelligence as well  An intelligent agent can be defined as a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success              Kaplan and Haenlein define artificial intelligence as  a system s ability to correctly interpret external data  to learn from such data  and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation               Progress in artificial intelligence can be demonstrated in benchmarks ranging from games to practical tasks such as protein folding              Existing AI lags humans in terms of general intelligence  which is sometimes defined as the  capacity to learn how to carry out a huge range of tasks              
Mathematician Olle H ggstr m defines intelligence in terms of  optimization power   an agent s capacity for efficient cross domain optimization of the world according to the agent s preferences  or more simply the ability to  steer the future into regions of possibility      ranked high in a preference ordering   In this optimization framework  Deep Blue has the power to  steer a chessboard s future into a subspace of possibility which it labels as  winning   despite attempts by Garry Kasparov to steer the future elsewhere               Hutter and Legg  after surveying the literature  define intelligence as  an agent s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments                           While cognitive ability is sometimes measured as a one dimensional parameter  it could also be represented as a  hypersurface in a multidimensional space  to compare systems that are good at different intellectual tasks              Some skeptics believe that there is no meaningful way to define intelligence  aside from  just pointing to ourselves
