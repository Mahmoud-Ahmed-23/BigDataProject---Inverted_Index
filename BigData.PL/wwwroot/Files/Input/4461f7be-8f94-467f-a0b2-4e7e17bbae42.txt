Causality is an influence by which one event  process  state  or object  a cause  contributes to the production of another event  process  state  or object  an effect  where the cause is at least partly responsible for the effect  and the effect is at least partly dependent on the cause             The cause of something may also be described as the reason for the event or process            
In general  a process can have multiple causes             which are also said to be causal factors for it  and all lie in its past  An effect can in turn be a cause of  or causal factor for  many other effects  which all lie in its future  Some writers have held that causality is metaphysically prior to notions of time and space                                   Causality is an abstraction that indicates how the world progresses             As such it is a basic concept  it is more apt to be an explanation of other concepts of progression than something to be explained by other more fundamental concepts  The concept is like those of agency and efficacy  For this reason  a leap of intuition may be needed to grasp it                        Accordingly  causality is implicit in the structure of ordinary language             as well as explicit in the language of scientific causal notation 
In English studies of Aristotelian philosophy  the word  cause  is used as a specialized technical term  the translation of Aristotle s term        by which Aristotle meant  explanation  or  answer to a  why  question   Aristotle categorized the four types of answers as material  formal  efficient  and final  causes   In this case  the  cause  is the explanans for the explanandum  and failure to recognize that different kinds of  cause  are being considered can lead to futile debate  Of Aristotle s four explanatory modes  the one nearest to the concerns of the present article is the  efficient  one 
David Hume  as part of his opposition to rationalism  argued that pure reason alone cannot prove the reality of efficient causality  instead  he appealed to custom and mental habit  observing that all human knowledge derives solely from experience 
The topic of causality remains a staple in contemporary philosophy 


Concept edit 
Metaphysics edit 
The nature of cause and effect is a concern of the subject known as metaphysics  Kant thought that time and space were notions prior to human understanding of the progress or evolution of the world  and he also recognized the priority of causality  But he did not have the understanding that came with knowledge of Minkowski geometry and the special theory of relativity  that the notion of causality can be used as a prior foundation from which to construct notions of time and space                                  

Ontology edit 
A general metaphysical question about cause and effect is   what kind of entity can be a cause  and what kind of entity can be an effect  
One viewpoint on this question is that cause and effect are of one and the same kind of entity  causality being an asymmetric relation between them  That is to say  it would make good sense grammatically to say either  A is the cause and B the effect  or  B is the cause and A the effect   though only one of those two can be actually true  In this view  one opinion  proposed as a metaphysical principle in process philosophy  is that every cause and every effect is respectively some process  event  becoming  or happening             An example is  his tripping over the step was the cause  and his breaking his ankle the effect   Another view is that causes and effects are  states of affairs   with the exact natures of those entities being more loosely defined than in process philosophy             
Another viewpoint on this question is the more classical one  that a cause and its effect can be of different kinds of entity  For example  in Aristotle s efficient causal explanation  an action can be a cause while an enduring object is its effect  For example  the generative actions of his parents can be regarded as the efficient cause  with Socrates being the effect  Socrates being regarded as an enduring object  in philosophical tradition called a  substance   as distinct from an action 

Epistemology edit 
Since causality is a subtle metaphysical notion  considerable intellectual effort  along with exhibition of evidence  is needed to establish knowledge of it in particular empirical circumstances  According to David Hume  the human mind is unable to perceive causal relations directly  On this ground  the scholar distinguished between the regularity view of causality and the counterfactual notion              According to the counterfactual view  X causes Y if and only if  without X  Y would not exist  Hume interpreted the latter as an ontological view  i e   as a description of the nature of causality but  given the limitations of the human mind  advised using the former  stating  roughly  that X causes Y if and only if the two events are spatiotemporally conjoined  and X precedes Y  as an epistemic definition of causality  We need an epistemic concept of causality in order to distinguish between causal and noncausal relations  The contemporary philosophical literature on causality can be divided into five big approaches to causality  These include the  mentioned above  regularity  probabilistic  counterfactual  mechanistic  and manipulationist views  The five approaches can be shown to be reductive  i e   define causality in terms of relations of other types              According to this reading  they define causality in terms of  respectively  empirical regularities  constant conjunctions of events   changes in conditional probabilities  counterfactual conditions  mechanisms underlying causal relations  and invariance under intervention 

Geometrical significance edit 
Causality has the properties of antecedence and contiguity                          These are topological  and are ingredients for space time geometry  As developed by Alfred Robb  these properties allow the derivation of the notions of time and space              Max Jammer writes  the Einstein postulate     opens the way to a straightforward construction of the causal topology     of Minkowski space               Causal efficacy propagates no faster than light             
Thus  the notion of causality is metaphysically prior to the notions of time and space  In practical terms  this is because use of the relation of causality is necessary for the interpretation of empirical experiments  Interpretation of experiments is needed to establish the physical and geometrical notions of time and space 

Volition edit 
The deterministic world view holds that the history of the universe can be exhaustively represented as a progression of events following one after the other as cause and effect              Incompatibilism holds that determinism is incompatible with free will  so if determinism is true   free will  does not exist  Compatibilism  on the other hand  holds that determinism is compatible with  or even necessary for  free will             

Necessary and sufficient causes edit 
A similar concept occurs in logic  for this see Necessary and sufficient conditions
Causes may sometimes be distinguished into two types  necessary and sufficient              A third type of causation  which requires neither necessity nor sufficiency  but which contributes to the effect  is called a  contributory cause  

Necessary causes
If x is a necessary cause of y  then the presence of y necessarily implies the prior occurrence of x  The presence of x  however  does not imply that y will occur             
Sufficient causes
If x is a sufficient cause of y  then the presence of x necessarily implies the subsequent occurrence of y  However  another cause z may alternatively cause y  Thus the presence of y does not imply the prior occurrence of x             
Contributory causes
For some specific effect  in a singular case  a factor that is a contributory cause is one among several co occurrent causes  It is implicit that all of them are contributory  For the specific effect  in general  there is no implication that a contributory cause is necessary  though it may be so  In general  a factor that is a contributory cause is not sufficient  because it is by definition accompanied by other causes  which would not count as causes if it were sufficient  For the specific effect  a factor that is on some occasions a contributory cause might on some other occasions be sufficient  but on those other occasions it would not be merely contributory             
J  L  Mackie argues that usual talk of  cause  in fact refers to INUS conditions  insufficient but non redundant parts of a condition which is itself unnecessary but sufficient for the occurrence of the effect               An example is a short circuit as a cause for a house burning down  Consider the collection of events  the short circuit  the proximity of flammable material  and the absence of firefighters  Together these are unnecessary but sufficient to the house s burning down  since many other collections of events certainly could have led to the house burning down  for example shooting the house with a flamethrower in the presence of oxygen and so forth   Within this collection  the short circuit is an insufficient  since the short circuit by itself would not have caused the fire  but non redundant  because the fire would not have happened without it  everything else being equal  part of a condition which is itself unnecessary but sufficient for the occurrence of the effect  So  the short circuit is an INUS condition for the occurrence of the house burning down

Conditional statements are not statements of causality  An important distinction is that statements of causality require the antecedent to precede or coincide with the consequent in time  whereas conditional statements do not require this temporal order  Confusion commonly arises since many different statements in English may be presented using  If      then      form  and  arguably  because this form is far more commonly used to make a statement of causality   The two types of statements are distinct  however 
For example  all of the following statements are true when interpreting  If      then      as the material conditional 

If Barack Obama is president of the United States in       then Germany is in Europe 
If George Washington is president of the United States in       then   x  e  arbitrary statement  x  e   
The first is true since both the antecedent and the consequent are true  The second is true in sentential logic and indeterminate in natural language  regardless of the consequent statement that follows  because the antecedent is false 
The ordinary indicative conditional has somewhat more structure than the material conditional  For instance  although the first is the closest  neither of the preceding two statements seems true as an ordinary indicative reading  But the sentence 

If Shakespeare of Stratford on Avon did not write Macbeth  then someone else did 
intuitively seems to be true  even though there is no straightforward causal relation in this hypothetical situation between Shakespeare s not writing Macbeth and someone else s actually writing it 
Another sort of conditional  the counterfactual conditional  has a stronger connection with causality  yet even counterfactual statements are not all examples of causality  Consider the following two statements 

If A were a triangle  then A would have three sides 
If switch S were thrown  then bulb B would light 
In the first case  it would be incorrect to say that A s being a triangle caused it to have three sides  since the relationship between triangularity and three sidedness is that of definition  The property of having three sides actually determines A s state as a triangle  Nonetheless  even when interpreted counterfactually  the first statement is true  An early version of Aristotle s  four cause  theory is described as recognizing  essential cause   In this version of the theory  that the closed polygon has three sides is said to be the  essential cause  of its being a triangle              This use of the word  cause  is of course now far obsolete  Nevertheless  it is within the scope of ordinary language to say that it is essential to a triangle that it has three sides 
A full grasp of the concept of conditionals is important to understanding the literature on causality  In everyday language  loose conditional statements are often enough made  and need to be interpreted carefully 

Questionable cause edit

Fallacies of questionable cause  also known as causal fallacies  non causa pro causa  Latin for  non cause for cause    or false cause  are informal fallacies where a cause is incorrectly identified 

Theories edit 
Main article  Causal model
Counterfactual theories edit 
Main article  Counterfactual conditional
Counterfactual theories define causation in terms of a counterfactual relation  and can often be seen as  floating  their account of causality on top of an account of the logic of counterfactual conditionals  Counterfactual theories reduce facts about causation to facts about what would have been true under counterfactual circumstances              The idea is that causal relations can be framed in the form of  Had C not occurred  E would not have occurred   This approach can be traced back to David Hume s definition of the causal relation as that  where  if the first object had not been  the second never had existed               More full fledged analysis of causation in terms of counterfactual conditionals only came in the   th century after development of the possible world semantics for the evaluation of counterfactual conditionals  In his      paper  Causation   David Lewis proposed the following definition of the notion of causal dependence             

An event E causally depends on C if  and only if   i  if C had occurred  then E would have occurred  and  ii  if C had not occurred  then E would not have occurred 
Causation is then analyzed in terms of counterfactual dependence  That is  C causes E if and only if there exists a sequence of events C  D   D       Dk  E such that each event in the sequence counterfactually depends on the previous  This chain of causal dependence may be called a mechanism 
Note that the analysis does not purport to explain how we make causal judgements or how we reason about causation  but rather to give a metaphysical account of what it is for there to be a causal relation between some pair of events  If correct  the analysis has the power to explain certain features of causation  Knowing that causation is a matter of counterfactual dependence  we may reflect on the nature of counterfactual dependence to account for the nature of causation  For example  in his paper  Counterfactual Dependence and Time s Arrow   Lewis sought to account for the time directedness of counterfactual dependence in terms of the semantics of the counterfactual conditional              If correct  this theory can serve to explain a fundamental part of our experience  which is that we can causally affect the future but not the past 
One challenge for the counterfactual account is overdetermination  whereby an effect has multiple causes  For instance  suppose Alice and Bob both throw bricks at a window and it breaks  If Alice hadn t thrown the brick  then it still would have broken  suggesting that Alice wasn t a cause  however  intuitively  Alice did cause the window to break  The Halpern Pearl definitions of causality take account of examples like these              The first and third Halpern Pearl conditions are easiest to understand  AC  requires that Alice threw the brick and the window broke in the actual work  AC  requires that Alice throwing the brick is a minimal cause  cf  blowing a kiss and throwing a brick   Taking the  updated  version of AC  a   the basic idea is that we have to find a set of variables and settings thereof such that preventing Alice from throwing a brick also stops the window from breaking  One way to do this is to stop Bob from throwing the brick  Finally  for AC  b   we have to hold things as per AC  a  and show that Alice throwing the brick breaks the window   The full definition is a little more involved  involving checking all subsets of variables  

Probabilistic causation edit 
Main article  Probabilistic causation
Interpreting causation as a deterministic relation means that if A causes B  then A must always be followed by B  In this sense  war does not cause deaths  nor does smoking cause cancer or emphysema  As a result  many turn to a notion of probabilistic causation  Informally  A   The person is a smoker   probabilistically causes B   The person has now or will have cancer at some time in the future    if the information that A occurred increases the likelihood of Bs occurrence  Formally  P B A   P B  where P B A  is the conditional probability that B will occur given the information that A occurred  and P B  is the probability that B will occur having no knowledge whether A did or did not occur  This intuitive condition is not adequate as a definition for probabilistic causation because of its being too general and thus not meeting our intuitive notion of cause and effect  For example  if A denotes the event  The person is a smoker   B denotes the event  The person now has or will have cancer at some time in the future  and C denotes the event  The person now has or will have emphysema some time in the future   then the following three relationships hold  P B A    P B   P C A    P C  and P B C    P B   The last relationship states that knowing that the person has emphysema increases the likelihood that he will have cancer  The reason for this is that having the information that the person has emphysema increases the likelihood that the person is a smoker  thus indirectly increasing the likelihood that the person will have cancer  However  we would not want to conclude that having emphysema causes cancer  Thus  we need additional conditions such as temporal relationship of A to B and a rational explanation as to the mechanism of action  It is hard to quantify this last requirement and thus different authors prefer somewhat different definitions      citation needed     

Causal calculus edit 
When experimental interventions are infeasible or illegal  the derivation of a cause and effect relationship from observational studies must rest on some qualitative theoretical assumptions  for example  that symptoms do not cause diseases  usually expressed in the form of missing arrows in causal graphs such as Bayesian networks or path diagrams  The theory underlying these derivations relies on the distinction between conditional probabilities  as in

  The former reads   the probability of finding cancer in a person known to smoke  having started  unforced by the experimenter  to do so at an unspecified time in the past   while the latter reads   the probability of finding cancer in a person forced by the experimenter to smoke at a specified time in the past   The former is a statistical notion that can be estimated by observation with negligible intervention by the experimenter  while the latter is a causal notion which is estimated in an experiment with an important controlled randomized intervention  It is specifically characteristic of quantal phenomena that observations defined by incompatible variables always involve important intervention by the experimenter  as described quantitatively by the observer effect      vague      In classical thermodynamics  processes are initiated by interventions called thermodynamic operations  In other branches of science  for example astronomy  the experimenter can often observe with negligible intervention

Structure learning edit 
While derivations in causal calculus rely on the structure of the causal graph  parts of the causal structure can  under certain assumptions  be learned from statistical data  The basic idea goes back to Sewall Wright s      work             on path analysis  A  recovery  algorithm was developed by Rebane and Pearl                    which rests on Wright s distinction between the three possible types of causal substructures allowed in a directed acyclic graph  DAG

 have common ancestors  except that one must first condition on those ancestors  Algorithms have been developed to systematically determine the skeleton of the underlying graph and  then  orient all arrows whose directionality is dictated by the conditional independencies observed                                                 
Alternative methods of structure learning search through the many possible causal structures among the variables  and remove ones which are strongly incompatible with the observed correlations  In general this leaves a set of possible causal relations  which should then be tested by analyzing time series data or  preferably  designing appropriately controlled experiments  In contrast with Bayesian Networks  path analysis  and its generalization  structural equation modeling   serve better to estimate a known causal effect or to test a causal model than to generate causal hypotheses 
For nonexperimental data  causal direction can often be inferred if information about time is available  This is because  according to many  though not all  theories  causes must precede their effects temporally  This can be determined by statistical time series models  for instance  or with a statistical test based on the idea of Granger causality  or by direct experimental manipulation  The use of temporal data can permit statistical tests of a pre existing theory of causal direction  For instance  our degree of confidence in the direction and nature of causality is much greater when supported by cross correlations  ARIMA models  or cross spectral analysis using vector time series data than by cross sectional data 

Derivation theories edit 
Nobel laureate Herbert A  Simon and philosopher Nicholas Rescher             claim that the asymmetry of the causal relation is unrelated to the asymmetry of any mode of implication that contraposes  Rather  a causal relation is not a relation between values of variables  but a function of one variable  the cause  on to another  the effect   So  given a system of equations  and a set of variables appearing in these equations  we can introduce an asymmetric relation among individual equations and variables that corresponds perfectly to our commonsense notion of a causal ordering  The system of equations must have certain properties  most importantly  if some values are chosen arbitrarily  the remaining values will be determined uniquely through a path of serial discovery that is perfectly causal  They postulate the inherent serialization of such a system of equations may correctly capture causation in all empirical fields  including physics and economics 

Manipulation theories edit 
Some theorists have equated causality with manipulability                                                  Under these theories  x causes y only in the case that one can change x in order to change y  This coincides with commonsense notions of causations  since often we ask causal questions in order to change some feature of the world  For instance  we are interested in knowing the causes of crime so that we might find ways of reducing it 
These theories have been criticized on two primary grounds  First  theorists complain that these accounts are circular  Attempting to reduce causal claims to manipulation requires that manipulation is more basic than causal interaction  But describing manipulations in non causal terms has provided a substantial difficulty 
The second criticism centers around concerns of anthropocentrism  It seems to many people that causality is some existing relationship in the world that we can harness for our desires  If causality is identified with our manipulation  then this intuition is lost  In this sense  it makes humans overly central to interactions in the world 
Some attempts to defend manipulability theories are recent accounts that do not claim to reduce causality to manipulation  These accounts use manipulation as a sign or feature in causation without claiming that manipulation is more fundamental than causation                         

Process theories edit 
Some theorists are interested in distinguishing between causal processes and non causal processes  Russell       Salmon                                These theorists often want to distinguish between a process and a pseudo process  As an example  a ball moving through the air  a process  is contrasted with the motion of a shadow  a pseudo process   The former is causal in nature while the latter is not 
Salmon                    claims that causal processes can be identified by their ability to transmit an alteration over space and time  An alteration of the ball  a mark by a pen  perhaps  is carried with it as the ball goes through the air  On the other hand  an alteration of the shadow  insofar as it is possible  will not be transmitted by the shadow as it moves along 
These theorists claim that the important concept for understanding causality is not causal relationships or causal interactions  but rather identifying causal processes  The former notions can then be defined in terms of causal processes 

Why because graph of the capsizing of the Herald of Free Enterprise  Click to see in detail  A subgroup of the process theories is the mechanistic view on causality  It states that causal relations supervene on mechanisms  While the notion of mechanism is understood differently  the definition put forward by the group of philosophers referred to as the  New Mechanists  dominate the literature             
Fields edit 
Science edit 
For the scientific investigation of efficient causality  the cause and effect are each best conceived of as temporally transient processes 
Within the conceptual frame of the scientific method  an investigator sets up several distinct and contrasting temporally transient material processes that have the structure of experiments  and records candidate material responses  normally intending to determine causality in the physical world              For instance  one may want to know whether a high intake of carrots causes humans to develop the bubonic plague  The quantity of carrot intake is a process that is varied from occasion to occasion  The occurrence or non occurrence of subsequent bubonic plague is recorded  To establish causality  the experiment must fulfill certain criteria  only one example of which is mentioned here  For example  instances of the hypothesized cause must be set up to occur at a time when the hypothesized effect is relatively unlikely in the absence of the hypothesized cause  such unlikelihood is to be established by empirical evidence  A mere observation of a correlation is not nearly adequate to establish causality  In nearly all cases  establishment of causality relies on repetition of experiments and probabilistic reasoning  Hardly ever is causality established more firmly than as more or less probable  It is most convenient for establishment of causality if the contrasting material states of affairs are precisely matched  except for only one variable factor  perhaps measured by a real number

One has to be careful in the use of the word cause in physics  Properly speaking  the hypothesized cause and the hypothesized effect are each temporally transient processes  For example  force is a useful concept for the explanation of acceleration  but force is not by itself a cause  More is needed  For example  a temporally transient process might be characterized by a definite change of force at a definite time  Such a process can be regarded as a cause  Causality is not inherently implied in equations of motion  but postulated as an additional constraint that needs to be satisfied  i e  a cause always precedes its effect   This constraint has mathematical implications             such as the Kramers Kronig relations 
Causality is one of the most fundamental and essential notions of physics              Causal efficacy cannot  propagate  faster than light  Otherwise  reference coordinate systems could be constructed  using the Lorentz transform of special relativity  in which an observer would see an effect precede its cause  i e  the postulate of causality would be violated  
Causal notions appear in the context of the flow of mass energy  Any actual process has causal efficacy that can propagate no faster than light  In contrast  an abstraction has no causal efficacy  Its mathematical expression does not propagate in the ordinary sense of the word  though it may refer to virtual or nominal  velocities  with magnitudes greater than that of light  For example  wave packets are mathematical objects that have group velocity and phase velocity  The energy of a wave packet travels at the group velocity  under normal circumstances   since energy has causal efficacy  the group velocity cannot be faster than the speed of light  The phase of a wave packet travels at the phase velocity  since phase is not causal  the phase velocity of a wave packet can be faster than light             
Causal notions are important in general relativity to the extent that the existence of an arrow of time demands that the universe s semi Riemannian manifold be orientable  so that  future  and  past  are globally definable quantities 

Engineering edit 
A causal system is a system with output and internal states that depends only on the current and previous input values  A system that has some dependence on input values from the future  in addition to possible past or current input values  is termed an acausal system  and a system that depends solely on future input values is an anticausal system  Acausal filters  for example  can only exist as postprocessing filters  because these filters can extract future values from a memory buffer or a file 
We have to be very careful with causality in physics and engineering  Cellier  Elmqvist  and Otter             describe causality forming the basis of physics as a misconception  because physics is essentially acausal  In their article they cite a simple example   The relationship between voltage across and current through an electrical resistor can be described by Ohm s law  V   IR  yet  whether it is the current flowing through the resistor that causes a voltage drop  or whether it is the difference between the electrical potentials on the two wires that causes current to flow is  from a physical perspective  a meaningless question   In fact  if we explain cause effect using the law  we need two explanations to describe an electrical resistor  as a voltage drop causer or as a current flow causer  There is no physical experiment in the world that can distinguish between action and reaction 

Biology  medicine and epidemiology edit 
Whereas a mediator is a factor in the causal chain  top   a confounder is a spurious factor incorrectly suggesting causation  bottom  
Austin Bradford Hill built upon the work of Hume and Popper and suggested in his paper  The Environment and Disease  Association or Causation   that aspects of an association such as strength  consistency  specificity  and temporality be considered in attempting to distinguish causal from noncausal associations in the epidemiological situation   See Bradford Hill criteria   He did not note however  that temporality is the only necessary criterion among those aspects  Directed acyclic graphs  DAGs  are increasingly used in epidemiology to help enlighten causal thinking             

Psychology edit 
Main article  Causal reasoning
Psychologists take an empirical approach to causality  investigating how people and non human animals detect or infer causation from sensory information  prior experience and innate knowledge 
Attribution 
Attribution theory is the theory concerning how people explain individual occurrences of causation  Attribution can be external  assigning causality to an outside agent or force claiming that some outside thing motivated the event  or internal  assigning causality to factors within the person taking personal responsibility or accountability for one s actions and claiming that the person was directly responsible for the event   Taking causation one step further  the type of attribution a person provides influences their future behavior 
The intention behind the cause or the effect can be covered by the subject of action  See also accident  blame  intent  and responsibility 

Causal powers
Whereas David Hume argued that causes are inferred from non causal observations  Immanuel Kant claimed that people have innate assumptions about causes  Within psychology  Patricia Cheng            attempted to reconcile the Humean and Kantian views  According to her power PC theory  people filter observations of events through an intuition that causes have the power to generate  or prevent  their effects  thereby inferring specific cause effect relations 

Causation and salience
Our view of causation depends on what we consider to be the relevant events  Another way to view the statement   Lightning causes thunder  is to see both lightning and thunder as two perceptions of the same event  viz   an electric discharge that we perceive first visually and then aurally 

Naming and causality
David Sobel and Alison Gopnik from the Psychology Department of UC Berkeley designed a device known as the blicket detector which would turn on when an object was placed on it  Their research suggests that  even young children will easily and swiftly learn about a new causal power of an object and spontaneously use that information in classifying and naming the object              

Perception of launching events
Some researchers such as Anjan Chatterjee at the University of Pennsylvania and Jonathan Fugelsang at the University of Waterloo are using neuroscience techniques to investigate the neural and psychological underpinnings of causal launching events in which one object causes another object to move  Both temporal and spatial factors can be manipulated

Statistics and economics edit

Statistics and economics usually employ pre existing data or experimental data to infer causality by regression methods  The body of statistical techniques involves substantial use of regression analysis  Typically a linear relationship such as

  then a change in 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            j
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle x  j  
  
 will result in a change in y unless some other causative variable s   either included in the regression or implicit in the error term  change in such a way as to exactly offset its effect  thus a change in 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            j
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle x  j  
  
 is not sufficient to change y  Likewise  a change in 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            j
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle x  j  
  
 is not necessary to change y  because a change in y could be caused by something implicit in the error term  or by some other causative explanatory variable included in the model  
The above way of testing for causality requires belief that there is no reverse causation  in which y would cause

            j
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle x  j  
  
  This belief can be established in one of several ways  First  the variable 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            j
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle x  j  
  
 may be a non economic variable  for example  if rainfall amount 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            j
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle x  j  
  
 is hypothesized to affect the futures price y of some agricultural commodity  it is impossible that in fact the futures price affects rainfall amount  provided that cloud seeding is never attempted   Second  the instrumental variables technique may be employed to remove any reverse causation by introducing a role for other variables  instruments  that are known to be unaffected by the dependent variable  Third  the principle that effects cannot precede causes can be invoked  by including on the right side of the regression only variables that precede in time the dependent variable  this principle is invoked  for example  in testing for Granger causality and in its multivariate analog  vector autoregression  both of which control for lagged values of the dependent variable while testing for causal effects of lagged independent variables 
Regression analysis controls for other relevant variables by including them as regressors  explanatory variables   This helps to avoid false inferences of causality due to the presence of a third  underlying  variable that influences both the potentially causative variable and the potentially caused variable  its effect on the potentially caused variable is captured by directly including it in the regression  so that effect will not be picked up as an indirect effect through the potentially causative variable of interest  Given the above procedures  coincidental  as opposed to causal  correlation can be probabilistically rejected if data samples are large and if regression results pass cross validation tests showing that the correlations hold even for data that were not used in the regression  Asserting with certitude that a common cause is absent and the regression represents the true causal structure is in principle impossible             
The problem of omitted variable bias  however  has to be balanced against the risk of inserting Causal colliders  in which the addition of a new variable 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            j
             
             
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle x  j    
  
 induces a correlation between 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            j

 via Berkson s paradox             
Apart from constructing statistical models of observational and experimental data  economists use axiomatic  mathematical  models to infer and represent causal mechanisms  Highly abstract theoretical models that isolate and idealize one mechanism dominate microeconomics  In macroeconomics  economists use broad mathematical models that are calibrated on historical data  A subgroup of calibrated models  dynamic stochastic general equilibrium  DSGE  models are employed to represent  in a simplified way  the whole economy and simulate changes in fiscal and monetary policy             

Management edit 
Used in management and engineering  an Ishikawa diagram shows the factors that cause the effect  Smaller arrows connect the sub causes to major causes 
For quality control in manufacturing in the     s  Kaoru Ishikawa developed a cause and effect diagram  known as an Ishikawa diagram or fishbone diagram  The diagram categorizes causes  such as into the six main categories shown here  These categories are then sub divided  Ishikawa s method identifies  causes  in brainstorming sessions conducted among various groups involved in the manufacturing process  These groups can then be labeled as categories in the diagrams  The use of these diagrams has now spread beyond quality control  and they are used in other areas of management and in design and engineering  Ishikawa diagrams have been criticized for failing to make the distinction between necessary conditions and sufficient conditions  It seems that Ishikawa was not even aware of this distinction             

Humanities edit 
History edit 
In the discussion of history  events are sometimes considered as if in some way being agents that can then bring about other historical events  Thus  the combination of poor harvests  the hardships of the peasants  high taxes  lack of representation of the people  and kingly ineptitude are among the causes of the French Revolution  This is a somewhat Platonic and Hegelian view that reifies causes as ontological entities  In Aristotelian terminology  this use approximates to the case of the efficient cause 
Some philosophers of history such as Arthur Danto have claimed that  explanations in history and elsewhere  describe  not simply an event something that happens but a change               Like many practicing historians  they treat causes as intersecting actions and sets of actions which bring about  larger changes   in Danto s words  to decide  what are the elements which persist through a change  is  rather simple  when treating an individual s  shift in attitude   but  it is considerably more complex and metaphysically challenging when we are interested in such a change as  say  the break up of feudalism or the emergence of nationalism              
Much of the historical debate about causes has focused on the relationship between communicative and other actions  between singular and repeated ones  and between actions  structures of action or group and institutional contexts and wider sets of conditions              John Gaddis has distinguished between exceptional and general causes  following Marc Bloch  and between  routine  and  distinctive links  in causal relationships   in accounting for what happened at Hiroshima on August          we attach greater importance to the fact that President Truman ordered the dropping of an atomic bomb than to the decision of the Army Air Force to carry out his orders               He has also pointed to the difference between immediate  intermediate and distant causes              For his part  Christopher Lloyd puts forward four  general concepts of causation  used in history  the  metaphysical idealist concept  which asserts that the phenomena of the universe are products of or emanations from an omnipotent being or such final cause    the empiricist  or Humean  regularity concept  which is based on the idea of causation being a matter of constant conjunctions of events    the functional teleological consequential concept   which is  goal directed  so that goals are causes   and the  realist  structurist and dispositional approach  which sees relational structures and internal dispositions as the causes of phenomena              

Law edit 
Main article  Causation  law 
According to law and jurisprudence  legal cause must be demonstrated to hold a defendant liable for a crime or a tort  i e  a civil wrong such as negligence or trespass   It must be proven that causality  or a  sufficient causal link  relates the defendant s actions to the criminal event or damage in question  Causation is also an essential legal element that must be proven to qualify for remedy measures under international trade law

Vedic period  c                 BCE  literature has karma s Eastern origins              Karma is the belief held by Sanatana Dharma and major religions that a person s actions cause certain effects in the current life and or in future life  positively or negatively  The various philosophical schools  darshanas  provide different accounts of the subject  The doctrine of satkaryavada affirms that the effect inheres in the cause in some way  The effect is thus either a real or apparent modification of the cause  The doctrine of asatkaryavada affirms that the effect does not inhere in the cause  but is a new arising  See Nyaya for some details of the theory of causation in the Nyaya school  In Brahma Samhita  Brahma describes Krishna as the prime cause of all causes             
Bhagavad g t        identifies five causes for any action  knowing which it can be perfected   the body  the individual soul  the senses  the efforts and the supersoul 
According to Monier Williams  in the Ny ya causation theory from Sutra I   I   in the Vaisheshika philosophy  from causal non existence is effectual non existence  but  not effectual non existence from causal non existence  A cause precedes an effect  With a threads and cloth metaphors  three causes are 

Co inherence cause  resulting from substantial contact   substantial causes   threads are substantial to cloth  corresponding to Aristotle s material cause 
Non substantial cause  Methods putting threads into cloth  corresponding to Aristotle s formal cause 
Instrumental cause  Tools to make the cloth  corresponding to Aristotle s efficient cause 
Monier Williams also proposed that Aristotle s and the Nyaya s causality are considered conditional aggregates necessary to man s productive work             

Buddhist philosophy edit 
See also  Prat tyasamutp da
Karma is the causality principle focusing on    causes     actions     effects  where it is the mind s phenomena that guide the actions that the actor performs  Buddhism trains the actor s actions for continued and uncontrived virtuous outcomes aimed at reducing suffering  This follows the Subject verb object structure      citation needed     
The general or universal definition of pratityasamutpada  or  dependent origination  or  dependent arising  or  interdependent co arising   is that everything arises in dependence upon multiple causes and conditions  nothing exists as a singular  independent entity  A traditional example in Buddhist texts is of three sticks standing upright and leaning against each other and supporting each other  If one stick is taken away  the other two will fall to the ground                         
Causality in the Chittamatrin Buddhist school approach  Asanga s  c            CE  mind only Buddhist school  asserts that objects cause consciousness in the mind s image  Because causes precede effects  which must be different entities  then subject and object are different  For this school  there are no objects which are entities external to a perceiving consciousness  The Chittamatrin and the Yogachara Svatantrika schools accept that there are no objects external to the observer s causality  This largely follows the Nikayas approach                                                 
The Vaibhashika  c            CE  is an early Buddhist school which favors direct object contact and accepts simultaneous cause and effects  This is based in the consciousness example which says  intentions and feelings are mutually accompanying mental factors that support each other like poles in tripod  In contrast  simultaneous cause and effect rejectors say that if the effect already exists  then it cannot effect the same way again  How past  present and future are accepted is a basis for various Buddhist school s causality viewpoints                                     
All the classic Buddhist schools teach karma   The law of karma is a special instance of the law of cause and effect  according to which all our actions of body  speech  and mind are causes and all our experiences are their effects              

Western philosophy edit 
Aristotelian edit 
Main articles  Four causes and Potentiality and actuality
Aristotle identified four kinds of answer or explanatory mode to various  Why   questions  He thought that  for any given topic  all four kinds of explanatory mode were important  each in its own right  As a result of traditional specialized philosophical peculiarities of language  with translations between ancient Greek  Latin  and English  the word  cause  is nowadays in specialized philosophical writings used to label Aristotle s four kinds                          In ordinary language  the word  cause  has a variety of meanings  the most common of which refers to efficient causation  which is the topic of the present article 

Material cause  the material whence a thing has come or that which persists while it changes  as for example  one s mother or the bronze of a statue  see also substance theory              
Formal cause  whereby a thing s dynamic form or static shape determines the thing s properties and function  as a human differs from a statue of a human or as a statue differs from a lump of bronze             
Efficient cause  which imparts the first relevant movement  as a human lifts a rock or raises a statue  This is the main topic of the present article 
Final cause  the criterion of completion  or the end  it may refer to an action or to an inanimate process  Examples  Socrates takes a walk after dinner for the sake of his health  earth falls to the lowest level because that is its nature 
Of Aristotle s four kinds or explanatory modes  only one  the  efficient cause  is a cause as defined in the leading paragraph of this present article  The other three explanatory modes might be rendered material composition  structure and dynamics  and  again  criterion of completion  The word that Aristotle used was        For the present purpose  that Greek word would be better translated as  explanation  than as  cause  as those words are most often used in current English  Another translation of Aristotle is that he meant  the four Becauses  as four kinds of answer to  why  questions             
Aristotle assumed efficient causality as referring to a basic fact of experience  not explicable by  or reducible to  anything more fundamental or basic 
In some works of Aristotle  the four causes are listed as     the essential cause      the logical ground      the moving cause  and     the final cause  In this listing  a statement of essential cause is a demonstration that an indicated object conforms to a definition of the word that refers to it  A statement of logical ground is an argument as to why an object statement is true  These are further examples of the idea that a  cause  in general in the context of Aristotle s usage is an  explanation              
The word  efficient  used here can also be translated from Aristotle as  moving  or  initiating              
Efficient causation was connected with Aristotelian physics  which recognized the four elements  earth  air  fire  water   and added the fifth element  aether   Water and earth by their intrinsic property gravitas or heaviness intrinsically fall toward  whereas air and fire by their intrinsic property levitas or lightness intrinsically rise away from  Earth s center the motionless center of the universe in a straight line while accelerating during the substance s approach to its natural place 
As air remained on Earth  however  and did not escape Earth while eventually achieving infinite speed an absurdity Aristotle inferred that the universe is finite in size and contains an invisible substance that holds planet Earth and its atmosphere  the sublunary sphere  centered in the universe  And since celestial bodies exhibit perpetual  unaccelerated motion orbiting planet Earth in unchanging relations  Aristotle inferred that the fifth element  aither  that fills space and composes celestial bodies intrinsically moves in perpetual circles  the only constant motion between two points   An object traveling a straight line from point A to B and back must stop at either point before returning to the other  
Left to itself  a thing exhibits natural motion  but can according to Aristotelian metaphysics exhibit enforced motion imparted by an efficient cause  The form of plants endows plants with the processes nutrition and reproduction  the form of animals adds locomotion  and the form of humankind adds reason atop these  A rock normally exhibits natural motion explained by the rock s material cause of being composed of the element earth but a living thing can lift the rock  an enforced motion diverting the rock from its natural place and natural motion  As a further kind of explanation  Aristotle identified the final cause  specifying a purpose or criterion of completion in light of which something should be understood 
Aristotle himself explained 

Cause means
 a  in one sense  that as the result of whose presence something comes into being e g   the bronze of a statue and the silver of a cup  and the classes which contain these  i e   the material cause  
 b  in another sense  the form or pattern  that is  the essential formula and the classes which contain it e g  the ratio     and number in general is the cause of the octave and the parts of the formula  i e   the formal cause  
 c  The source of the first beginning of change or rest  e g  the man who plans is a cause  and the father is the cause of the child  and in general that which produces is the cause of that which is produced  and that which changes of that which is changed  i e   the efficient cause  
 d  The same as  end   i e  the final cause  e g   as the  end  of walking is health  For why does a man walk   To be healthy   we say  and by saying this we consider that we have supplied the cause  the final cause  

 e  All those means towards the end which arise at the instigation of something else  as  e g   fat reducing  purging  drugs  and instruments are causes of health  for they all have the end as their object  although they differ from each other as being some instruments  others actions  i e   necessary conditions          Metaphysics  Book    section     a  translated by Hugh Tredennick            
Aristotle further discerned two modes of causation  proper  prior  causation and accidental  chance  causation  All causes  proper and accidental  can be spoken as potential or as actual  particular or generic  The same language refers to the effects of causes  so that generic effects are assigned to generic causes  particular effects to particular causes  and actual effects to operating causes 
Averting infinite regress  Aristotle inferred the first mover an unmoved mover  The first mover s motion  too  must have been caused  but  being an unmoved mover  must have moved only toward a particular goal or desire 

Pyrrhonism edit 
While the plausibility of causality was accepted in Pyrrhonism              it was equally accepted that it was plausible that nothing was the cause of anything             

Middle Ages edit 
In line with Aristotelian cosmology  Thomas Aquinas posed a hierarchy prioritizing Aristotle s four causes   final  gt  efficient  gt  material  gt  formal               Aquinas sought to identify the first efficient cause now simply first cause as everyone would agree  said Aquinas  to call it God  Later in the Middle Ages  many scholars conceded that the first cause was God  but explained that many earthly events occur within God s design or plan  and thereby scholars sought freedom to investigate the numerous secondary causes             

After the Middle Ages edit 
See also  Humean definition of causality
For Aristotelian philosophy before Aquinas  the word cause had a broad meaning  It meant  answer to a why question  or  explanation   and Aristotelian scholars recognized four kinds of such answers  With the end of the Middle Ages  in many philosophical usages  the meaning of the word  cause  narrowed  It often lost that broad meaning  and was restricted to just one of the four kinds  For authors such as Niccol  Machiavelli  in the field of political thinking  and Francis Bacon  concerning science more generally  Aristotle s moving cause was the focus of their interest  A widely used modern definition of causality in this newly narrowed sense was assumed by David Hume              He undertook an epistemological and metaphysical investigation of the notion of moving cause  He denied that we can ever perceive cause and effect  except by developing a habit or custom of mind where we come to associate two types of object or event  always contiguous and occurring one after the other              In Part III  section XV of his book A Treatise of Human Nature  Hume expanded this to a list of eight ways of judging whether two things might be cause and effect  The first three 

 The cause and effect must be contiguous in space and time  
 The cause must be prior to the effect  
 There must be a constant union betwixt the cause and effect   Tis chiefly this quality  that constitutes the relation  
And then additionally there are three connected criteria which come from our experience and which are  the source of most of our philosophical reasonings    The same cause always produces the same effect  and the same effect never arises but from the same cause  This principle we derive from experience  and is the source of most of our philosophical reasonings  Hanging upon the above  Hume says that  where several different objects produce the same effect  it must be by means of some quality  which we discover to be common amongst them  And  founded on the same reason    The difference in the effects of two resembling objects must proceed from that particular  in which they differ  
And then two more   When any object increases or diminishes with the increase or diminution of its cause   tis to be regarded as a compounded effect  deriv d from the union of the several different effects  which arise from the several different parts of the cause  An  object  which exists for any time in its full perfection without any effect  is not the sole cause of that effect  but requires to be assisted by some other principle  which may forward its influence and operation  
In       physicist Max Born distinguished determination from causality  For him  determination meant that actual events are so linked by laws of nature that certainly reliable predictions and retrodictions can be made from sufficient present data about them  He describes two kinds of causation  nomic or generic causation and singular causation  Nomic causality means that cause and effect are linked by more or less certain or probabilistic general laws covering many possible or potential instances  this can be recognized as a probabilized version of Hume s criterion    An occasion of singular causation is a particular occurrence of a definite complex of events that are physically linked by antecedence and contiguity  which may be recognized as criteria   and

  Falcon  Andrea         Edward N  Zalta  ed     Aristotle on Causality   The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  Winter           ed    In the Physics  Aristotle builds on his general account of the four causes by developing explanatory principles that are specific to the study of nature  Here Aristotle insists that all four modes of explanation are called for in the study of natural phenomena  and that the job of  the student of nature is to bring the why question back to them all in the way appropriate to the science of nature   Phys      a         The best way to understand this methodological recommendation is the following  the science of nature is concerned with natural bodies insofar as they are subject to change  and the job of the student of nature is to provide the explanation of their natural change  The factors that are involved in the explanation of natural change turn out to be matter  form  that which produces the change  and the end of this change  Note that Aristotle does not say that all four explanatory factors are involved in the explanation of each and every instance of natural change  Rather  he says that an adequate explanation of natural change may involve a reference to all of them  Aristotle goes on by adding a specification on his doctrine of the four causes  the form and the end often coincide  and they are formally the same as that which produces the change  Phys      a
