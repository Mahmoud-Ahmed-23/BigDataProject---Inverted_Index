Dozens of members of the Al Ghul family  a sub clan of the larger Al Fuwakhiria tribe of North Sinai  protested outside Sinai University preventing students from entering and taking their final exams for their first term 
Protestors demanded compensation worth the value of the land taken from them  which was then used to build the university in the tourist city of Sama Al Arish 
Sabri Al Ghul  a member of the sub clan  stated that they would use peaceful methods of resistance until they had their land returned to them 
Dr  Hasan Rateb  president of the board of directors for the  Sama  Companies  and proprietor of Sinai University  said that he had elicited the help of the army and the country s security services to address the issue of citizens breaking into the headquarters of the university  adding that the problem would be solved in a matter of hours  He said that Egypt is a nation of laws and that all problems will be solved through the nation s court system  not by  baltagia        
Rateb stated that he had purchased the land from a representative of the state in North Sinai in      at the price of EGP     per metre  which he noted was more expensive then the surrounding lands  He said he built the university and several tourist attractions to help benefit the people of Al Arish
