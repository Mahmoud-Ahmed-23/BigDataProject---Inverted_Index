Seymour Aubrey Papert    p p rt      February                July       was a South African born American mathematician  computer scientist  and educator  who spent most of his career teaching and researching at MIT                                   He was one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence  and of the constructionist movement in education             He was co inventor  with Wally Feurzeig and Cynthia Solomon  of the Logo programming language                                                        


Early years and education edit 
Born to a Jewish family              Papert attended the University of the Witwatersrand  receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy in      followed by a PhD in mathematics in                              He then went on to receive a second doctorate             also in mathematics  at the University of Cambridge                     supervised by Frank Smithies             

Career edit 
Papert worked as a researcher in a variety of places  including St  John s College  Cambridge  the Henri Poincar  Institute at the University of Paris  the University of Geneva  and the National Physical Laboratory in London before becoming a research associate at MIT in                   He held this position until       when he became professor of applied math and was made co director of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by its founding director Professor Marvin Minsky  until       he also served as Cecil and Ida Green professor of education at MIT from      to                  

Research edit 
Papert worked on learning theories  and was known for focusing on the impact of new technologies on learning in general  and in schools as learning organizations in particular 

Constructionism edit 
At MIT  Papert went on to create the Epistemology and Learning Research Group at the MIT Architecture Machine Group which later became the MIT Media Lab              Here  he was the developer of a theory on learning called constructionism  built upon the work of Jean Piaget in constructivist learning theories  Papert had worked with Piaget at the University of Geneva from      to                  and was one of Piaget s prot g s  Piaget himself once said that  no one understands my ideas as well as Papert               Papert has rethought how schools should work  based on these theories of learning 

Logo edit 
Papert used Piaget s work in his development of the Logo programming language while at MIT  He created Logo as a tool to improve the way children think and solve problems  A small mobile robot called the  Logo Turtle  was developed  and children were shown how to use it to solve simple problems in an environment of play  A main purpose of the Logo Foundation research group is to strengthen the ability to learn knowledge              Papert insisted a simple language or program that children can learn like Logo can also have advanced functionality for expert users            

Other work edit 
As part of his work with technology  Papert has been a proponent of the Knowledge Machine  He was one of the principals for the One Laptop Per Child initiative to manufacture and distribute The Children s Machine in developing nations 
Papert also collaborated with the construction toy manufacturer Lego on their Logo programmable Lego Mindstorms robotics kits              which were named after his groundbreaking      book            
A curated archive of Papert s articles  speeches  and interviews may be found on a website dedicated to Papert at  The Daily Papert 

Personal life edit 
Papert became a political and anti apartheid activist early in his life in South Africa  He subsequently chose self exile              He was a leading figure in the revolutionary socialist circle around Socialist Review while living in London in the     s              Papert was also a prominent activist against South African apartheid policies during his university education            
Papert was married to Dona Strauss  and later to Androula Christofides Henriques            
Papert s third wife was MIT professor Sherry Turkle  and together they wrote the influential paper  Epistemological Pluralism and the Revaluation of the Concrete              
In his final    years  Papert was married to Suzanne Massie  who was a Russian scholar and author of Pavlovsk  The Life of a Russian Palace and Land of the Firebird                        

Accident in Hanoi edit 
Papert  then aged      received a serious brain injury when struck by a motor scooter            on   December      while crossing the street with colleague Uri Wilensky when they were both attending the   th International Commission on Mathematical Instruction  ICMI  Study conference in Hanoi  Vietnam              He underwent emergency surgery to remove a blood clot at the French Hospital of Hanoi before being transferred in a complex operation by Swiss Air Ambulance  REGA Archived    July      at the Wayback Machine  Bombardier Challenger Jet             to Boston  Massachusetts  where he spent approximately four weeks in intensive care                          He was moved to a hospital closer to his home in January       but then developed sepsis which damaged a heart valve  which was later replaced 
By      he had returned home  could think and communicate clearly and walk  almost unaided   but still had  some complicated speech problems  and was in receipt of extensive rehabilitation support              His rehabilitation team used some of the very principles of experiential  hands on learning that he had pioneered             
Papert died at his home in Blue Hill  Maine  on    July                 

Awards  honours  and legacy edit 
Papert s work has been used by other researchers in the fields of education and computer science  He influenced the work of Uri Wilensky in the design of NetLogo and collaborated with him on the study of knowledge restructurations  as well as the work of Andrea diSessa and the development of  dynaturtles   In       Papert along with several others in the Logo group at MIT  started Logo Computer Systems Inc   LCSI   of which he was board chair for over    years  Working with LCSI  Papert designed a number of award winning programs  including LogoWriter             and Lego Logo  marketed as Lego Mindstorms    He also influenced the research of Idit Harel Caperton  coauthoring articles and the book Constructionism  and chairing the advisory board of the company MaMaMedia  He also influenced Alan Kay and the Dynabook concept  and worked with Kay on various projects 
Papert won a Guggenheim fellowship in       a Marconi International fellowship in                   the Software Publishers Association Lifetime Achievement Award in       and the Smithsonian Award from Computerworld in                   Papert has been called by Marvin Minsky  the greatest living mathematics educator                   citation needed     
MIT President L  Rafael Reif summarized Papert s lifetime of accomplishments   With a mind of extraordinary range and creativity  Seymour Papert helped revolutionize at least three fields  from the study of how children make sense of the world  to the development of artificial intelligence  to the rich intersection of technology and learning  The stamp he left on MIT is profound  Today  as MIT continues to expand its reach and deepen its work in digital learning  I am particularly grateful for Seymour s groundbreaking vision  and we hope to build on his ideas to open doors to learners of all ages  around the world                                                 
In      Papert s alma mater  University of Witwatersrand  awarded him the degree of Doctor of Science in Engineering  honoris causa
