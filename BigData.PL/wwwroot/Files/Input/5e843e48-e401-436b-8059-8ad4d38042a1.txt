Herbert Alexander Simon  June                 February          was an American scholar whose work influenced the fields of computer science  economics  and cognitive psychology  His primary research interest was decision making within organizations and he is best known for the theories of  bounded rationality  and  satisficing                         He received the Turing Award in      and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in                             His research was noted for its interdisciplinary nature  spanning the fields of cognitive science  computer science  public administration  management  and political science             He was at Carnegie Mellon University for most of his career  from      to                   where he helped found the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science  one of the first such departments in the world 
Notably  Simon was among the pioneers of several modern day scientific domains such as artificial intelligence  information processing  decision making  problem solving  organization theory  and complex systems  He was among the earliest to analyze the architecture of complexity and to propose a preferential attachment mechanism to explain power law distributions                         


Early life and education edit 
Herbert Alexander Simon was born in Milwaukee  Wisconsin on June           Simon s father  Arthur Simon              was a Jewish             electrical engineer who came to the United States from Germany in      after earning his engineering degree at Technische Hochschule Darmstadt              An inventor  Arthur also was an independent patent attorney              Simon s mother  Edna Marguerite Merkel              was an accomplished pianist whose Jewish  Lutheran  and Catholic ancestors came from Braunschweig  Prague and Cologne              Simon s European ancestors were piano makers  goldsmiths  and vintners 
Simon attended Milwaukee Public Schools  where he developed an interest in science and established himself as an atheist  While attending middle school  Simon wrote a letter to  the editor of the Milwaukee Journal defending the civil liberties of atheists               Simon s family introduced him to the idea that human behavior could be studied scientifically  his mother s younger brother  Harold Merkel              who studied economics at the University of Wisconsin Madison under John R  Commons  became one of his earliest influences  Through Harold s books on economics and psychology  Simon discovered social science  Among his earliest influences  Simon cited Norman Angell for his book The Great Illusion and Henry George for his book Progress and Poverty  While attending high school  Simon joined the debate team  where he argued  from conviction  rather than cussedness  in favor of George s single tax             
In       Simon entered the University of Chicago  and  following his early influences  decided to study social science and mathematics  Simon was interested in studying biology but chose not to pursue the field because of his  color blindness and awkwardness in the laboratory               At an early age  Simon learned he was color blind and discovered the external world is not the same as the perceived world  While in college  Simon focused on political science and economics  Simon s most important mentor was Henry Schultz  an econometrician and mathematical economist             Simon received both his B A         and his Ph D         in political science from the University of Chicago  where he studied under Harold Lasswell  Nicolas Rashevsky  Rudolf Carnap  Henry Schultz  and Charles Edward Merriam              After enrolling in a course on  Measuring Municipal Governments   Simon became a research assistant for Clarence Ridley  and the two co authored Measuring Municipal Activities  A Survey of Suggested Criteria for Appraising Administration in                   Simon s studies led him to the field of organizational decision making  which became the subject of his doctoral dissertation 

Career edit 
After receiving his undergraduate degree  Simon obtained a research assistantship in municipal administration that turned into the directorship of an operations research group at the University of California  Berkeley  where he worked from      to        By arrangement with the University of Chicago  during his years at Berkeley  he took his doctoral exams by mail and worked on his dissertation after hours 
From      to       Simon was a professor of political science and also served as department chairman at Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago  There  he began participating in the seminars held by the staff of the Cowles Commission who at that time included Trygve Haavelmo  Jacob Marschak  and Tjalling Koopmans  He thus began an in depth study of economics in the area of institutionalism  Marschak brought Simon in to assist in the study he was currently undertaking with Sam Schurr of the  prospective economic effects of atomic energy              

Simon  left  in a chess match against Allen Newell c            
From      to       Simon was a faculty member at Carnegie Mellon University  in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  In       Simon became a professor of administration and chairman of the Department of Industrial Management at Carnegie Institute of Technology   Carnegie Tech    which  in       became Carnegie Mellon University  Simon later also             taught psychology and computer science in the same university               occasionally visiting other universities              

Research edit 
Seeking to replace the highly simplified classical approach to economic modeling  Simon became best known for his theory of corporate decision in his book Administrative Behavior  In this book he based his concepts with an approach that recognized multiple factors that contribute to decision making  His organization and administration interest allowed him to not only serve three times as a university department chairman  but he also played a big part in the creation of the Economic Cooperation Administration in       administrative team that administered aid to the Marshall Plan for the U S  government  serving on President Lyndon Johnson s Science Advisory Committee  and also the National Academy of Sciences              Simon has made a great number of contributions to both economic analysis and applications  Because of this  his work can be found in a number of economic literary works  making contributions to areas such as mathematical economics including theorem proving  human rationality  behavioral study of firms  theory of casual ordering  and the analysis of the parameter identification problem in econometrics             

Decision making edit 
Main article  Administrative Behavior
Simon s three stages in Rational Decision Making  Intelligence  Design  Choice  IDC 
Administrative Behavior              first published in      and updated across the years  was based on Simon s doctoral dissertation              It served as the foundation for his life s work  The centerpiece of this book is the behavioral and cognitive processes of humans making rational decisions  By his definition  an operational administrative decision should be correct  efficient  and practical to implement with a set of coordinated means             
Simon recognized that a theory of administration is largely a theory of human decision making  and as such must be based on both economics and on psychology  He states 

 If  there were no limits to human rationality administrative theory would be barren  It would consist of the single precept  Always select that alternative  among those available  which will lead to the most complete achievement of your goals               p xxviii 
Contrary to the  homo economicus  model  Simon argued that alternatives and consequences may be partly known  and means and ends imperfectly differentiated  incompletely related  or poorly detailed             
Simon defined the task of rational decision making as selecting the alternative that results in the more preferred set of all the possible consequences  Correctness of administrative decisions was thus measured by 

Adequacy of achieving the desired objective
Efficiency with which the result was obtained
The task of choice was divided into three required steps             

Identifying and listing all the alternatives
Determining all consequences resulting from each of the alternatives 
Comparing the accuracy and efficiency of each of these sets of consequences
Any given individual or organization attempting to implement this model in a real situation would be unable to comply with the three requirements  Simon argued that knowledge of all alternatives  or all consequences that follow from each alternative is impossible in many realistic cases             
Simon attempted to determine the techniques or behavioral processes that a person or organization could bring to bear to achieve approximately the best result given limits on rational decision making              Simon writes 

The human being striving for rationality and restricted within the limits of his knowledge has developed some working procedures that partially overcome these difficulties  These procedures consist in assuming that he can isolate from the rest of the world a closed system containing a limited number of variables and a limited range of consequences             
Therefore  Simon describes work in terms of an economic framework  conditioned on human cognitive limitations  Economic man and Administrative man 
Administrative Behavior addresses a wide range of human behaviors  cognitive abilities  management techniques  personnel policies  training goals and procedures  specialized roles  criteria for evaluation of accuracy and efficiency  and all of the ramifications of communication processes  Simon is particularly interested in how these factors influence the making of decisions  both directly and indirectly             
Simon argued that the two outcomes of a choice require monitoring and that many members of the organization would be expected to focus on adequacy  but that administrative management must pay particular attention to the efficiency with which the desired result was obtained                   
Simon followed Chester Barnard  who stated  the decisions that an individual makes as a member of an organization are quite distinct from his personal decisions               Personal choices may be determined whether an individual joins a particular organization and continue to be made in his or her extra organizational private life  As a member of an organization  however  that individual makes decisions not in relationship to personal needs and results  but in an impersonal sense as part of the organizational intent  purpose  and effect  Organizational inducements  rewards  and sanctions are all designed to form  strengthen  and maintain this identification                
Simon             saw two universal elements of human social behavior as key to creating the possibility of organizational behavior in human individuals  Authority  addressed in Chapter VII The Role of Authority  and in Loyalties and Identification  Addressed in Chapter X  Loyalties  and Organizational Identification  
Authority is a well studied  primary mark of organizational behavior  straightforwardly defined in the organizational context as the ability and right of an individual of higher rank to guide the decisions of an individual of lower rank  The actions  attitudes  and relationships of the dominant and subordinate individuals constitute components of role behavior that may vary widely in form  style  and content  but do not vary in the expectation of obedience by the one of superior status  and willingness to obey from the subordinate             
Loyalty was defined by Simon as the  process whereby the individual substitutes organizational objectives  service objectives or conservation objectives  for his own aims as the value indices which determine his organizational decisions               This entailed evaluating alternative choices in terms of their consequences for the group rather than only for oneself or one s family             
Decisions can be complex admixtures of facts and values  Information about facts  especially empirically proven facts or facts derived from specialized experience  are more easily transmitted in the exercise of authority than are the expressions of values  Simon is primarily interested in seeking identification of the individual employee with the organizational goals and values  Following Lasswell              he states that  a person identifies himself with a group when  in making a decision  he evaluates the several alternatives of choice in terms of their consequences for the specified group              
Simon has been critical of traditional economics  elementary understanding of decision making  and argues it  is too quick to build an idealistic  unrealistic picture of the decision making process and then prescribe on the basis of such unrealistic picture              
Herbert Simon rediscovered path diagrams  which were originally invented by Sewall Wright around                  

Artificial intelligence edit 
Simon was a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence  creating with Allen Newell the Logic Theory Machine        and the General Problem Solver  GPS         programs  GPS may possibly be the first method developed for separating problem solving strategy from information about particular problems  Both programs were developed using the Information Processing Language  IPL         developed by Newell  Cliff Shaw  and Simon  Donald Knuth mentions the development of list processing in IPL  with the linked list originally called  NSS memory  for its inventors              In       Simon predicted that computer chess would surpass human chess abilities within  ten years  when  in reality  that transition took about forty years              He also predicted in      that  machines will be capable  within twenty years  of doing any work a man can do              
In the early     s psychologist Ulric Neisser asserted that while machines are capable of replicating  cold cognition  behaviors such as reasoning  planning  perceiving  and deciding  they would never be able to replicate  hot cognition  behaviors such as pain  pleasure  desire  and other emotions  Simon responded to Neisser s views in      by writing a paper on emotional cognition              which he updated in      and published in Psychological Review              Simon s work on emotional cognition was largely ignored by the artificial intelligence research community for several years  but subsequent work on emotions by Sloman and Picard helped refocus attention on Simon s paper and eventually  made it highly influential on the topic      citation needed     
Simon also collaborated with James G  March on several works in organization theory            
With Allen Newell  Simon developed a theory for the simulation of human problem solving behavior using production rules              The study of human problem solving required new kinds of human measurements and  with Anders Ericsson  Simon developed the experimental technique of verbal protocol analysis              Simon was interested in the role of knowledge in expertise  He said that to become an expert on a topic required about ten years of experience and he and colleagues estimated that expertise was the result of learning roughly        chunks of information  A chess expert was said to have learned about        chunks or chess position patterns             
He was awarded the ACM Turing Award  along with Allen Newell  in        In joint scientific efforts extending over twenty years  initially in collaboration with J  C   Cliff  Shaw at the RAND Corporation  and subsequentially          sic      with numerous faculty and student colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University  they have made basic contributions to artificial intelligence  the psychology of human cognition  and list processing             

Psychology edit 
Simon was interested in how humans learn and  with Edward Feigenbaum  he developed the EPAM  Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer  theory  one of the first theories of learning to be implemented as a computer program  EPAM was able to explain a large number of phenomena in the field of verbal learning              Later versions of the model were applied to concept formation and the acquisition of expertise  With Fernand Gobet  he has expanded the EPAM theory into the CHREST computational model              The theory explains how simple chunks of information form the building blocks of schemata  which are more complex structures  CHREST has been used predominantly  to simulate aspects of chess expertise             

Sociology and economics edit 
Simon has been credited for revolutionary changes in microeconomics  He is responsible for the concept of organizational decision making as it is known today  He was the first to rigorously examine how administrators made decisions when they did not have perfect and complete information  It was in this area that he was awarded the Nobel Prize in                  
At the Cowles Commission  Simon s main goal was to link economic theory to mathematics and statistics  His main contributions were to the fields of general equilibrium and econometrics  He was greatly influenced by the marginalist debate that began in the     s  The popular work of the time argued that it was not apparent empirically that entrepreneurs needed to follow the marginalist principles of profit maximization cost minimization in running organizations  The argument went on to note that profit maximization was not accomplished  in part  because of the lack of complete information  In decision making  Simon believed that agents face uncertainty about the future and costs in acquiring information in the present  These factors limit the extent to which agents may make a fully rational decision  thus they possess only  bounded rationality  and must make decisions by  satisficing   or choosing that which might not be optimal  but which will make them happy enough  Bounded rationality is a central theme in behavioral economics  It is concerned with the ways in which the process of decision making influences the decision itself  The term is used to designate rational choices that take into account the cognitive limitations of both knowledge and cognitive capacity 
Further  Simon emphasized that psychologists invoke a  procedural  definition of rationality  whereas economists employ a  substantive  definition  Gustavos Barros argued that the procedural rationality concept does not have a significant presence in the economics field and has never had nearly as much weight as the concept of bounded rationality              However  in an earlier article  Bhargava        noted the importance of Simon s arguments and emphasized that there are several applications of the  procedural  definition of rationality in econometric analyses of data on health  In particular  economists should employ  auxiliary assumptions  that reflect the knowledge in the relevant biomedical fields  and guide the specification of econometric models for health outcomes 
Simon was also known for his research on industrial organization              He determined that the internal organization of firms and the external business decisions thereof  did not conform to the neoclassical theories of  rational  decision making      citation needed      Simon wrote many articles on the topic over the course of his life  mainly focusing on the issue of decision making within the behavior of bounded rationality    Rational behavior  in economics  means that individuals maximize their utility function under the constraints they face  e g   their budget constraint  limited choices       in pursuit of their self interest  This is reflected in the theory of subjective expected utility  Theories of bounded rationality relax one or more assumptions of standard expected utility theory              
Simon determined that the best way to study these areas was through computer simulations  As such  he developed an interest in computer science  Simon s main interests in computer science were in artificial intelligence  human computer interaction  principles of the organization of humans and machines as information processing systems  the use of computers to study  by modeling  philosophical problems of the nature of intelligence and of epistemology  and the social implications of computer technology             
In his youth  Simon took an interest in land economics and Georgism  an idea known at the time as  single tax               The system is meant to redistribute unearned economic rent to the public and improve land use  In       Simon still maintained these ideas and argued that land value tax should replace taxes on wages             
Some of Simon s economic research was directed toward understanding technological change in general and the information processing revolution in particular             

Pedagogy edit 
Simon s work has strongly influenced John Mighton  developer of a program that has achieved significant success in improving mathematics performance among elementary and high school students              Mighton cites a      paper by Simon and two coauthors that counters arguments by French mathematics educator  Guy Brousseau  and others suggesting that excessive practice hampers children s understanding             

 The  criticism of practice  called  drill and kill   as if this phrase constituted empirical evaluation  is prominent in constructivist writings  Nothing flies more in the face of the last    years of research than the assertion that practice is bad  All evidence  from the laboratory and from extensive case studies of professionals  indicates that real competence only comes with extensive practice    In denying the critical role of practice one is denying children the very thing they need to achieve real competence  The instructional task is not to  kill  motivation by demanding drill  but to find tasks that provide practice while at the same time sustaining interest         John R  Anderson  Lynne M  Reder  and Herbert A  Simon   Applications and misapplications of cognitive psychology to mathematics education   Texas Educational Review

Personal life and interests edit 
Simon married Dorothea Pye in       Their marriage lasted    years until his death  They had three children  Katherine  Peter  and Barbara 
From      to       Simon studied mathematical economics and during this time  together with David Hawkins  discovered and proved the Hawkins Simon theorem on the  conditions for the existence of positive solution vectors for input output matrices   He also developed theorems on near decomposability and aggregation  Having begun to apply these theorems to organizations  by      Simon determined that the best way to study problem solving was to simulate it with computer programs  which led to his interest in computer simulation of human cognition  Founded during the     s  he was among the first members of the Society for General Systems Research      citation needed     
Simon was a pianist and had a keen interest in the arts  He was a friend of Robert Lepper             and Richard Rappaport              Rappaport also painted Simon s commissioned portrait at Carnegie Mellon University              He was also a keen mountain climber  As a testament to his wide interests  he at one point taught an undergraduate course on the French Revolution            
In January       Simon underwent surgery at UPMC Presbyterian to remove a cancerous tumor in his abdomen  Although the surgery was successful  Simon later died from the complications that followed  His wife died a year later in
