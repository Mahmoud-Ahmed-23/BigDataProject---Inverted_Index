							In the first part of her quest to understand Europe       s biggest economy  Kate Ferguson explores the German obsession with saving money and asks whether frugality should be considered a virtue or a vice Maybe you      ve been smoking thirty a day since you were a teenager  Or have bitten your nails since you were a child 
 You      ve tried patches and foul tasting nail varnish  but no matter what you do  your vices cling to you like a shameful odor 
Bad habits  we all know  are hard to break  But try quitting a good one and you      ll find the challenge far greater still 
Trust me  I      ve tried 
Read more    direct questions you should be prepared to answer in Germany
When I moved to Germany from Ireland six years ago  I quickly realized it wasn      t customary to thank the bus driver profusely for delivering me to my destination 
And yet I persist  leaning in for a perky  quot dankesch n quot  before I disembark  seemingly oblivious to the confusion and even contempt my gratitude provokes 
The more you get used to being virtuous  you see  the harder it is to stop 
A German obsession 
No case illustrates the point better than Germany      s centuries old obsession with saving money 
The habit  as deeply ingrained in the national psyche as beer and sausages  has weathered wars  hyperinflation and totalitarian regimes 
To find out how  I make my way to the German Historical Museum in the heart of Berlin to meet Robert Muschalla  the curator of an exhibition titled Saving  mdash  History of a German Virtue 
I      m expecting to have a conversation about economics  I even scrawled a few numbers down in advance so I wouldn      t come across uneducated  
One of them was      billion  the amount of spare cash Germany is likely to accumulate by the end of the year   quot The world      s largest current account surplus  quot  I was prepared to quip   quot Unlike the World Cup  a title it can retain  quot 
But if there      s one thing I learn from Muschalla  it      s that when it comes to the Germans and saving  it      s about a lot more than the economy  stupid

 quot For     years  saving was primarily a form of social control  quot  he says 
This  rather than any economic theory  is the basis of the exhibition  which spans the early   th century to the modern day and features an array of documents and objects attesting to the enduring German love affair with saving 
Industrialization a key factor
The story of institutionalized money hoarding  I      m told  begins with the process of industrialization  As the population increased and poverty became more widespread  banks were presented as benevolent entities designed to help the poor help themselves 
Workers who set aside their earnings weren      t only considered morally superior to those who gambled or drank it away  they were also less likely to revolt 
This is the starting point for Muschalla      s argument that the German habit of saving has its roots in a form of social control  If you think it sounds far fetched  consider what workers in neighboring France were doing while their German counterparts were filling out their bankbooks 
 quot In France they revolted and in Germany they saved  quot  Muschalla says  These national habits  he believes  have endured to this day 
 quot If you look at labor disputes  in France you see workers up in arms  In Germany  we      re proud if we have the two sides sitting across from each other at a table  quot  he says   quot It tells us a lot about the differences between countries in Europe today  quot 
As a business journalist  it can get tiring reporting on Germany      s bursting state coffers and its consistent trade surpluses  The idea  therefore  of saving as a form of social and political conditioning is an intriguing alternative to the existing narrative of sensible Germans resisting temptation

But it      s also a theory that reminds us of some of the darkest periods in the country      s history  Parts that many people would rather not associate with what is supposed to be a national virtue 
In the     s  when Germans found their savings decimated by hyperinflation  the Nazis pointed their fingers at Jewish moneylenders  blaming them  mdash  groundlessly  of course  mdash  for the country      s post war financial crisis 
In schools and workplaces  saving began to be promoted as an act of patriotism  Lending  mdash  or investing  mdash  became a vice  This form of twisted Nazi ideology was one way in which anti Semitism took hold across the country 
Saving in the Nazi era didn      t pay off  In       tens of thousands of Germans signed up for a savings scheme that promised to supply them with a Volkswagen as soon as it rolled off the assembly line in Wolfsburg 
It turned out to be a disastrous investment  When the war broke out  the men who were supposed to produce cars were sent to fight and those who remained in the factory produced military equipment instead  No one ever got their car 
While the exhibition has been well received  mdash  Muschalla has been fielding calls from as far away as Argentina and Canada  mdash  he says that here in Germany  many have been uncomfortable with the link he makes between the promotion of saving and the growth of anti Semitism

 quot There      s a reluctance to step outside a narrow economic definition  quot  he says   quot Because to do so means taking a much closer look at yourself  quot 
 It      s a fitting thought to leave me with as I continue on my quest to understand the German economy 
After all  what we do with our money reflects what we do to each other 
This  in turn  gets to the very core of who we are  mdash  a messy mixture of virtue and vice
