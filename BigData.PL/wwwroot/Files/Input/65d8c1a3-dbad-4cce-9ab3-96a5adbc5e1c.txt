							As we celebrate the International Day of the World       s Indigenous People on   August this year  the focus of attention for many of these most marginalized peoples will be the decision that is due to be taken in the next days by the United Nations General Assembly in relation to the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  
The Declaration establishes international human rights standards for the protection of the rights of indigenous peoples and was adopted in June      by the Human Rights Council  the principal human rights intergovernmental body of the United Nations  It has been    years in the making  Its contents are drawn from the experiences of thousands of indigenous representatives who have shared their anguish and their hopes  
As we stand at the brink of this historic decision by the General Assembly  it is the time to call upon member states of the United Nations to join as one and adopt the Declaration and thereby establish a universal framework for indigenous peoples        rights  social justice and reconciliation 
The adoption of the Declaration by the Human Rights Council should be seen as providing impetus for renewed efforts by the international community to address the pressing concerns of the world       s     million indigenous people  including perhaps the most urgent issue of all    poverty and marginalization 
World leaders committed themselves in the year      to realizing the Millennium Development Goals  MDGs   and in particular reducing poverty by half  by the year       There has been progress towards meeting these commitments but as we reach the mid point for the realization of these goals  there is increasing evidence that indigenous peoples are largely overlooked in these global efforts  They remain among the poorest of the poor  with little reference to them in the reports on implementation of the MDGs  
While the International Day of the World       s Indigenous People is a celebration of humankind       s diversity and richness  it needs also to serve as a reminder of the continuing exclusion indigenous peoples face  Halfway to the      deadline for the MDGs  and with the impending adoption of the Declaration by the General Assembly  it is time to call upon States and the international community to reach out to indigenous peoples and ensure that they also benefit from the pledge made by Heads of State at the turn of the millennium 
Louise Arbouris the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and Rodolfo Stavenhagen is Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people
