An unmanned aerial vehicle  UAV  or unmanned aircraft system  UAS   commonly known as a drone  is an aircraft with no human pilot  crew  or passengers onboard  but rather is controlled remotely or is autonomous                        UAVs were originally developed through the twentieth century for military missions too  dull  dirty or dangerous             for humans  and by the twenty first  they had become essential assets to most militaries  As control technologies improved and costs fell  their use expanded to many non military applications             These include aerial photography  area coverage             precision agriculture  forest fire monitoring             river monitoring                        environmental monitoring                                                 weather observation  policing and surveillance  infrastructure inspections  smuggling              product deliveries  entertainment  drone racing  and combat 


Terminology edit 
Many terms are used for aircraft which fly without any persons onboard 
The term drone has been used from the early days of aviation  some being applied to remotely flown target aircraft used for practice firing of a battleship s guns  such as the     s Fairey Queen and     s de Havilland Queen Bee  Later examples included the Airspeed Queen Wasp and Miles Queen Martinet  before ultimate replacement by the GAF Jindivik              The term remains in common use   In addition to the software  autonomous drones also employ a host of advanced technologies that allow them to carry out their missions without human intervention  such as cloud computing  computer vision  artificial intelligence  machine learning  deep learning  and thermal sensors              For recreational uses  an aerial photography drone is an aircraft that has first person video  autonomous capabilities  or both             
An unmanned aerial vehicle  UAV  is defined as a  powered  aerial vehicle that does not carry a human operator  uses aerodynamic forces to provide vehicle lift  can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely  can be expendable or recoverable  and can carry a lethal or nonlethal payload               UAV is a term that is commonly applied to military use cases              Missiles with warheads are generally not considered UAVs because the vehicle itself is a munition  but certain types of propeller based missile are often called  kamikaze drones  by the public and media  Also  the relation of UAVs to remote controlled model aircraft is unclear in some jurisdictions   The US FAA now defines any unmanned flying craft as a UAV regardless of weight               A similar term is remotely piloted aerial vehicle  RPAV  
UAVs or RPAVs can also be seen as a component of an unmanned aircraft system  UAS   which also includes a ground based controller and a system of communications with the aircraft             
The term UAS was adopted by the United States Department of Defense  DoD  and the United States Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  in      according to their Unmanned Aircraft System Roadmap                        The International Civil Aviation Organization  ICAO  and the British Civil Aviation Authority adopted this term  also used in the European Union s Single European Sky  SES  Air Traffic Management  ATM  Research  SESAR Joint Undertaking  roadmap for                   This term emphasizes the importance of elements other than the aircraft  It includes elements such as ground control stations  data links and other support equipment  Similar terms are unmanned aircraft vehicle system  UAVS  and remotely piloted aircraft system  RPAS               Many similar terms are in use  Under new regulations which came into effect   June       the term RPAS has been adopted by the Canadian Government to mean  a set of configurable elements consisting of a remotely piloted aircraft  its control station  the command and control links and any other system elements required during flight operation              
 Uncrewed  is sometimes used rather than  Unmanned                                      

Classification types edit 
UAVs may be classified like any other aircraft  according to design configuration such as weight or engine type  maximum flight altitude  degree of operational autonomy  operational role  etc  According to the United States Department of Defense  UAVs are classified into five categories below

Degree of autonomy edit 
Drones can also be classified based on the degree of autonomy in their flight operations  ICAO classifies unmanned aircraft as either remotely piloted aircraft or fully autonomous              Some UAVs offer intermediate degrees of autonomy  For example  a vehicle may be remotely piloted in most contexts but have an autonomous return to base operation  Some aircraft types may optionally fly manned or as UAVs  which may include manned aircraft transformed into manned or Optionally Piloted UAVs  OPVs   The flight of UAVs may operate under remote control by a human operator  as remotely piloted aircraft  RPA   or with various degrees of autonomy  such as autopilot assistance  up to fully autonomous aircraft that have no provision for human intervention                         

Altitude edit 
Based on the altitude  the following UAV classifications have been used at industry events such as ParcAberporth Unmanned Systems forum 

Hand held            ft           m  altitude  about        km range
Close            ft             m  altitude  up to         km range

Composite criteria edit 
An example of classification based on the composite criteria is U S  Military s unmanned aerial systems  UAS  classification of UAVs based on weight  maximum altitude and speed of the UAV component 

Power sources edit 
UAVs can be classified based on their power or energy source  which significantly impacts their flight duration  range  and environmental impact  The main categories include 

Battery powered  electric   These UAVs use rechargeable batteries  offering quiet operation and lower maintenance but potentially limited flight times  The reduced noise levels make them suitable for urban environments and sensitive operations             
Fuel powered  internal combustion   Utilizing traditional fuels like gasoline or diesel  these UAVs often have longer flight times but may be noisier and require more maintenance  They are typically used for applications requiring extended endurance or heavy payload capacity             
Hybrid  Combining electric and fuel power sources  hybrid UAVs aim to balance the benefits of both systems for improved performance and efficiency  This configuration could allow for versatility in mission profiles and adaptability to different operational requirements             
Hydrogen fuel cell  hydrogen fuel cells offer the potential for longer flight times than batteries yet stealthier  no heat signature  operation than combustion engines              The high energy density of hydrogen makes it a promising option for future UAV propulsion systems             
Solar powered  Equipped with solar panels  these UAVs can potentially achieve extended flight times by harnessing solar energy  especially at high altitudes  Solar powered UAVs may be particularly suited for long endurance missions and environmental monitoring applications             
Nuclear powered  While nuclear power has been explored for larger aircraft  its application in UAVs remains largely theoretical due to safety concerns and regulatory challenges  Research in this area is ongoing but faces significant hurdles before practical implementation

Early drones edit 
The earliest recorded use of an unmanned aerial vehicle for warfighting occurred in July                   with a balloon carrier  the precursor to the aircraft carrier              in the first offensive use of air power in naval aviation                                      Austrian forces besieging Venice attempted to launch some     incendiary balloons at the besieged city  The balloons were launched mainly from land  however  some were also launched from the Austrian ship SMS      Vulcano  At least one bomb fell in the city  however  due to the wind changing after launch  most of the balloons missed their target  and some drifted back over Austrian lines and the launching ship Vulcano                                     
The Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres Quevedo introduced a radio based control system called the Telekino             at the Paris Academy of Science in       as a way of testing airships without risking human life                                     
Significant development of drones started in the     s  and originally focused on providing practice targets for training military personnel  The earliest attempt at a powered UAV was A  M  Low s  Aerial Target  in                   Low confirmed that Geoffrey de Havilland s monoplane was the one that flew under control on    March      using his radio system              Following this successful demonstration in the spring of      Low was transferred to develop aircraft controlled fast motor launches D C B s with the Royal Navy in      intended to attack shipping and port installations and he also assisted Wing Commander Brock in preparations for the Zeebrugge Raid  Other British unmanned developments followed  leading to the fleet of over     de Havilland    Queen Bee aerial targets that went into service in      
Nikola Tesla described a fleet of uncrewed aerial combat vehicles in                   These developments also inspired the construction of the Kettering Bug by Charles Kettering from Dayton  Ohio and the Hewitt Sperry Automatic Airplane   initially meant as an uncrewed plane that would carry an explosive payload to a predetermined target  Development continued during World War I  when the Dayton Wright Airplane Company invented a pilotless aerial torpedo that would explode at a preset time             
The film star and model airplane enthusiast Reginald Denny developed the first scaled remote piloted vehicle in                  
Soviet researchers experimented with controlling Tupolev TB   bombers remotely in the late     s             

World War II edit 
In       Denny started the Radioplane Company and more models emerged during World War II                   used both to train antiaircraft gunners and to fly attack missions  Nazi Germany produced and used various UAV aircraft during the war  like the Argus As     and the V   flying bomb with a jet engine  Fascist Italy developed a specialised drone version of the Savoia Marchetti SM    flown by remote control  although the Armistice with Italy was enacted prior to any operational deployment             

Postwar period edit 
After World War II development continued in vehicles such as the American JB    using television radio command guidance   the Australian GAF Jindivik and Teledyne Ryan Firebee I of       while companies like Beechcraft offered their Model      for the U S  Navy in                   Nevertheless  they were little more than remote controlled airplanes until the Vietnam War  In       the U S  Air Force  concerned about losing pilots over hostile territory  began planning for the use of uncrewed aircraft              Planning intensified after the Soviet Union shot down a U   in       Within days  a highly classified UAV program started under the code name of  Red Wagon               The August      clash in the Tonkin Gulf between naval units of the U S  and the North Vietnamese Navy initiated America s highly classified UAVs  Ryan Model      Ryan AQM    Firefly  Lockheed D     into their first combat missions of the Vietnam War              When the Chinese government             showed photographs of downed U S  UAVs via Wide World Photos              the official U S  response was  no comment  
During the War of Attrition             in the Middle East  Israeli intelligence tested the first tactical UAVs installed with reconnaissance cameras  which successfully returned photos from across the Suez Canal  This was the first time that tactical UAVs that could be launched and landed on any short runway  unlike the heavier jet based UAVs  were developed and tested in battle             
In the      Yom Kippur War  Israel used UAVs as decoys to spur opposing forces into wasting expensive anti aircraft missiles              After the      Yom Kippur War  a few key people from the team that developed this early UAV joined a small startup company that aimed to develop UAVs into a commercial product  eventually purchased by Tadiran and leading to the development of the first Israeli UAV                  pages      needed     
In       the U S  military officially confirmed that they had been using UAVs in Southeast Asia  Vietnam               Over       U S  airmen had been killed and over       more were missing or captured  The USAF    th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing flew about       UAV missions during the war             at a cost of about     UAVs lost to all causes  In the words of USAF General George S  Brown  Commander  Air Force Systems Command  in        The only reason we need  UAVs  is that we don t want to needlessly expend the man in the cockpit               Later that year  General John C  Meyer  Commander in Chief  Strategic Air Command  stated   we let the drone do the high risk flying          the loss rate is high  but we are willing to risk more of them         they save lives              
During the      Yom Kippur War  Soviet supplied surface to air missile batteries in Egypt and Syria caused heavy damage to Israeli fighter jets  As a result  Israel developed the IAI Scout as the first UAV with real time surveillance                                      The images and radar decoys provided by these UAVs helped Israel to completely neutralize the Syrian air defenses at the start of the      Lebanon War  resulting in no pilots downed              In Israel in       UAVs were first used as proof of concept of super agility  post stall controlled flight in combat flight simulations that involved tailless  stealth technology based  three dimensional thrust vectoring flight control  and jet steering             

Modern UAVs edit 
The Turkish STM Kargu was the first lethal autonomous weapon to attack enemy combatants in warfare 
With the maturing and miniaturization of applicable technologies in the     s and     s  interest in UAVs grew within the higher echelons of the U S  military  The U S  funded the Counterterrorism Center  CTC  within the CIA  which sought to fight terrorism with the aid of modernized drone technology              In the     s  the U S  DoD gave a contract to AAI Corporation along with Israeli company Malat  The U S  Navy bought the AAI Pioneer UAV that AAI and Malat developed jointly  Many of these UAVs saw service in the      Gulf War  UAVs demonstrated the possibility of cheaper  more capable fighting machines  deployable without risk to aircrews  Initial generations primarily involved surveillance aircraft  but some carried armaments  such as the General Atomics MQ   Predator  that launched AGM     Hellfire air to ground missiles 
CAPECON  a European Union project to develop UAVs              ran from   May      to    December                  
As of          update       the United States Air Force  USAF  employed       UAVs                   almost one in three USAF aircraft                          The Central Intelligence Agency also operated UAVs              By      at least    countries used UAVs  China  Iran  Israel  Pakistan  Turkey  and others designed and built their own varieties  The use of drones has continued to increase              Due to their wide proliferation  no comprehensive list of UAV systems exists                         
The development of smart technologies and improved electrical power systems led to a parallel increase in the use of drones for consumer and general aviation activities  As of          update       quadcopter drones exemplify the widespread popularity of hobby radio controlled aircraft and toys  but the use of UAVs in commercial and general aviation is limited by a lack of autonomy     clarification needed      and by new regulatory environments which require line of sight contact with the pilot      citation needed     
In       a Kargu   drone hunted down and attacked a human target in Libya  according to a report from the UN Security Council s Panel of Experts on Libya  published in March       This may have been the first time an autonomous killer robot armed with lethal weaponry attacked human beings             
Superior drone technology  specifically the Turkish Bayraktar TB   played a role in Azerbaijan s successes in the      Nagorno Karabakh war against Armenia             

Artist s concept of Ingenuity landing on Mars
UAVs are also used in NASA missions  The Ingenuity helicopter is an autonomous UAV that operated on Mars from      to       As of          update      the Dragonfly spacecraft is being developed  and is aiming to reach and examine Saturn s moon Titan  Its primary goal is to roam around the surface  expanding the amount of area to be researched previously seen by landers  As a UAV  Dragonfly allows examination of potentially diverse types of soil  The drone is set to launch in       and is estimated to take seven more years to reach the Saturnian system 
Miniaturization is also supporting the development of small UAVs which can be used as individual system or in a fleet offering the possibility to survey large areas  in a relatively small amount of time             
According to data from GlobalData  the global military uncrewed aerial systems  UAS  market  which forms a significant part of the UAV industry  is projected to experience a compound annual growth rate of      over the next decade  This represents a near doubling in market size  from       billion in      to an estimated     billion by                  

Design edit 
General physical structure of a UAV
Crewed and uncrewed aircraft of the same type generally have recognizably similar physical components  The main exceptions are the cockpit and environmental control system or life support systems  Some UAVs carry payloads  such as a camera  that weigh considerably less than an adult human  and as a result  can be considerably smaller  Though they carry heavy payloads  weaponized military UAVs are lighter than their crewed counterparts with comparable armaments 
Small civilian UAVs have no life critical systems  and can thus be built out of lighter but less sturdy materials and shapes  and can use less robustly tested electronic control systems  For small UAVs  the quadcopter design has become popular  though this layout is rarely used for crewed aircraft  Miniaturization means that less powerful propulsion technologies can be used that are not feasible for crewed aircraft  such as small electric motors and batteries 
Control systems for UAVs are often different from crewed craft  For remote human control  a camera and video link almost always replace the cockpit windows  radio transmitted digital commands replace physical cockpit controls  Autopilot software is used on both crewed and uncrewed aircraft  with varying feature sets                                     

Aircraft configuration edit 
UAVs can be designed in different configurations than manned aircraft both because there is no need for a cockpit and its windows  and there is no need to optimize for human comfort  although some UAVs are adapted from piloted examples  or are designed for optionally piloted modes  Air safety is also less of a critical requirement for unmanned aircraft  allowing the designer greater freedom to experiment  Instead  UAVs are typically designed around their onboard payloads and their ground equipment  These factors have led to a great variety of airframe and motor configurations in UAVs 
For conventional flight the flying wing and blended wing body offer light weight combined with low drag and stealth  and are popular configurations for many use cases  Larger types which carry a variable payload are more likely to feature a distinct fuselage with a tail for stability  control and trim  although the wing configurations in use vary widely 
For uses that require vertical flight or hovering  the tailless quadcopter requires a relatively simple control system and is common for smaller UAVs  Multirotor designs with   or more rotors is more common with larger UAVs  where redundancy is prioritized                         

Propulsion edit 
Traditional internal combustion and jet engines remain in use for drones requiring long range  However  for shorter range missions electric power has almost entirely taken over  The distance record for a UAV  built from balsa wood and mylar skin  across the North Atlantic Ocean is held by a gasoline model airplane or UAV  Manard Hill  in      when one of his creations flew       miles across the Atlantic Ocean on less than a gallon of fuel  holds this record             
Besides the traditional piston engine  the Wankel rotary engine is used by some drones  This type offers high power output for lower weight  with quieter and more vibration free running  Claims have also been made for improved reliability and greater range      citation needed     
Small drones mostly use lithium polymer batteries  Li Po   while some larger vehicles have adopted the hydrogen fuel cell                                      Hydrogen fueled proton exchange membrane fuel cells for UAVs have the advantages of longer flight duration than rechargeable lithium ion batteries  of lower total cost of ownership than primary lithium metal batteries and of better stealth than heat engines             
The energy density of modern Li Po batteries is far less than gasoline or hydrogen  However electric motors are cheaper  lighter and quieter  Complex multi engine  multi propeller installations are under development with the goal of improving aerodynamic and propulsive efficiency  For such complex power installations  battery elimination circuitry  BEC  may be used to centralize power distribution and minimize heating  under the control of a microcontroller unit  MCU  

Ornithopters   wing propulsion edit 
Flapping wing ornithopters  imitating birds or insects  have been flown as microUAVs  Their inherent stealth recommends them for spy missions 
Sub  g microUAVs inspired by flies  albeit using a power tether  have been able to  land  on vertical surfaces              Other projects mimic the flight of beetles and other insects             

Computer control systems edit 
A flight controller run on either CleanFlight or BaseFlight firmware for multirotor UAVs
UAV computing capability followed the advances of computing technology  beginning with analog controls and evolving into microcontrollers  then system on a chip  SOC  and single board computers  SBC  
Modern system hardware for UAV control is often called the flight controller  FC   flight controller board  FCB  or autopilot  Common UAV systems control hardware typically incorporate a primary microprocessor  a secondary or failsafe processor  and sensors such as accelerometers  gyroscopes  magnetometers  and barometers into a single module 
In      EASA agreed on the first certification basis for a UAV flight controller in compliance with the ETSO C    for Embention s autopilot  The certification of the UAV flight control systems aims to facilitate the integration of UAVs within the airspace and the operation of drones in critical areas             

Architecture edit 
Sensors edit 
Position and movement sensors give information about the aircraft state  Exteroceptive sensors deal with external information like distance measurements  while exproprioceptive ones correlate internal and external states              
Non cooperative sensors are able to detect targets autonomously so they are used for separation assurance and collision avoidance              
Degrees of freedom  DOF  refers to both the amount and quality of onboard sensors    DOF implies   axis gyroscopes and accelerometers  a typical inertial measurement unit                   IMU     DOF refers to an IMU plus a compass     DOF adds a barometer and    DOF usually adds a GPS receiver              
In addition to the navigation sensors  the UAV  or UAS  can be also equipped with monitoring devices such as  RGB  multispectral  hyper spectral cameras or LiDAR  which may allow providing specific measurements or observations              

Actuators edit 
UAV actuators include digital electronic speed controllers  which control the RPM of the motors  linked to motors engines and propellers  servomotors  for planes and helicopters mostly   weapons  payload actuators  LEDs and speakers 

Software edit 
Modern UAVs run a software stack that ranges from low level firmware that directly controls actuators  to high level flight planning  At the lowest level  firmware directly controls reading from sensors such as an IMU              and commanding actuators such as motors  Control software  often referred to as an autopilot  is responsible for computing actuator speeds given desired vehicle velocity  Due to its direct interaction with hardware  this software is time critical and may run on microcontrollers  This software may also handle radio communications  in the case of UAVs that are not autonomous  One popular example is the PX  autopilot 
At the next level  autonomy algorithms compute the desired velocity given higher level goals  For example  trajectory optimization              may be used to calculate a flight trajectory given a desired goal location  This software is not necessarily time critical  and can often run on a single board computer running an operating system such as Linux with relaxed time constraints 

Loop principles edit 
Typical flight control loops for a multirotor
UAVs employ open loop  closed loop or hybrid control architectures 

Open loop                   This type provides a positive control signal  faster  slower  left  right  up  down  without incorporating feedback from sensor data 
Closed loop                   This type incorporates sensor feedback to adjust behavior  reduce speed to reflect tailwind  move to altitude     feet   The PID controller is common  Sometimes  feedforward is employed  transferring the need to close the loop further              
Communications edit 
UAVs use a radio for control and exchange of video and other data  Early UAVs had only narrowband uplink  Downlinks came later  These bi directional narrowband radio links carried command and control  C amp C  and telemetry data about the status of aircraft systems to the remote operator 
In most modern UAV applications  video transmission is required  So instead of having separate links for C amp C  telemetry and video traffic  a broadband link is used to carry all types of data  These broadband links can leverage quality of service techniques and carry TCP IP traffic that can be routed over the internet 
The radio signal from the operator side can be issued from either 

Ground control   a human operating a radio transmitter receiver  a smartphone  a tablet  a computer  or the original meaning of a military ground control station  GCS  
Remote network system  such as satellite duplex data links for some military powers  Downstream digital video over mobile networks has also entered consumer markets  while direct UAV control uplink over the cellular mesh and LTE have been demonstrated and are in trials              
Another aircraft  serving as a relay or mobile control station                   military manned unmanned teaming  MUM T               
Modern networking standards have explicitly considered drones and therefore include optimizations  The  G standard has mandated reduced user plane latency to  ms while using ultra reliable and low latency communications              
UAV to UAV coordination supported by Remote ID communication technology  Remote ID messages  containing the UAV coordinates  are broadcast and can be used for collision free navigation              

Autonomy edit 
Main article  Autonomous aircraft
UAV s degrees of autonomy
The level of autonomy in UAVs varies widely  UAV manufacturers often build in specific autonomous operations  such as              

Self level  attitude stabilization on the pitch and roll axes 
Altitude hold  The aircraft maintains its altitude using barometric pressure and or GPS data 
Hover position hold  Keep level pitch and roll  stable yaw heading and altitude while maintaining position using GNSS or inertial sensors 
Headless mode  Pitch control relative to the position of the pilot rather than relative to the vehicle s axes 
Care free  automatic roll and yaw control while moving horizontally
Takeoff and landing  using a variety of aircraft or ground based sensors and systems  see also  autoland  
Failsafe  automatic landing or return to home upon loss of control signal
Return to home  Fly back to the point of takeoff  often gaining altitude first to avoid possible intervening obstructions such as trees or buildings  
Follow me  Maintain relative position to a moving pilot or other object using GNSS  image recognition or homing beacon 
GPS waypoint navigation  Using GNSS to navigate to an intermediate location on a travel path 
Orbit around an object  Similar to Follow me but continuously circle a target 
Pre programmed aerobatics  such as rolls and loops 
Pre programmed delivery  delivery drones 
One approach to quantifying autonomous capabilities is based on OODA terminology  as suggested by a      US Air Force Research Laboratory report  and used in the table on the right

Full autonomy is available for specific tasks  such as airborne refueling              or ground based battery switching 
Other functions available or under development include  collective flight  real time collision avoidance  wall following  corridor centring  simultaneous localization and mapping and swarming               cognitive radio  and machine learning  In this context  computer vision can play an important role for automatically ensuring flight safety 

Performance considerations edit 
Flight envelope edit 
UAVs can be programmed to perform aggressive maneuvers or landing perching on inclined surfaces               and then to climb toward better communication spots               Some UAVs can control flight with varying flight modelisation                            such as VTOL designs 
UAVs can also implement perching on a flat vertical surface              

Endurance edit 
UEL UAV     Wankel engine for UAV operations  used on AAI RQ   Shadow
Flight time against mass of small  less than        kg  drones             
UAV endurance is not constrained by the physiological capabilities of a human pilot 
Because of their small size  low weight  low vibration and high power to weight ratio  Wankel rotary engines are used in many large UAVs  Their engine rotors cannot seize  the engine is not susceptible to shock cooling during descent and it does not require an enriched fuel mixture for cooling at high power  These attributes reduce fuel usage  increasing range or payload 
Proper drone cooling is essential for long term drone endurance  Overheating and subsequent engine failure is the most common cause of drone failure              
Hydrogen fuel cells  using hydrogen power  may be able to extend the endurance of small UAVs  up to several hours                           
Micro air vehicles endurance is so far best achieved with flapping wing UAVs  followed by planes and multirotors standing last  due to lower Reynolds number              
Solar electric UAVs  a concept originally championed by the AstroFlight Sunrise in       have achieved flight times of several weeks 
Solar powered atmospheric satellites   atmosats   designed for operating at altitudes exceeding         km     miles  or        feet  for as long as five years could potentially perform duties more economically and with more versatility than low Earth orbit satellites  Likely applications include weather drones for weather monitoring  disaster recovery  Earth imaging and communications 
Electric UAVs powered by microwave power transmission or laser power beaming are other potential endurance solutions              
Another application for a high endurance UAV would be to  stare  at a battlefield for a long interval  ARGUS IS  Gorgon Stare  Integrated Sensor Is Structure  to record events that could then be played backwards to track battlefield activities

Reliability edit 
Reliability improvements target all aspects of UAV systems  using resilience engineering and fault tolerance techniques 
Individual reliability covers robustness of flight controllers  to ensure safety without excessive redundancy to minimize cost and weight               Besides  dynamic assessment of flight envelope allows damage resilient UAVs  using non linear analysis with ad hoc designed loops or neural networks               UAV software liability is bending toward the design and certifications of crewed avionics software              
Swarm resilience involves maintaining operational capabilities and reconfiguring tasks given unit failures              

Applications edit 
Main article  List of unmanned aerial vehicle applications
In recent years  autonomous drones have begun to transform various application areas as they can fly beyond visual line of sight  BVLOS               while maximizing production  reducing costs and risks  ensuring site safety  security and regulatory compliance               and protecting the human workforce in times of a pandemic               They can also be used for consumer related missions like package delivery  as demonstrated by Amazon Prime Air  and critical deliveries of health supplies 
There are numerous civilian  commercial  military  and aerospace applications for UAVs             These include

As of       seventeen countries have armed UAVs  and more than     countries use UAVs in a military capacity               The first five countries producing domestic UAV designs are the United States  China  Israel  Iran and Turkey                                                       Top military UAV manufactures are including General Atomics  Lockheed Martin  Northrop Grumman  Boeing  Baykar                            TAI  IAIO  CASC and CAIG               China has established and expanded its presence in military UAV market              since       In the early     s  Turkey also established and expanded its presence in the military UAV market                                                     
In the early     s  Israeli companies mainly focused on small surveillance UAV systems  and by the number of drones  Israel exported              of UAVs on the market while the United States exported                            Between      and       there were     drones exchanged compared to     in the five years previous to that  among these only small fraction of overall trade   just           of the     are armed drones               The US alone operated over       military UAVs in       among them more than      are RQ    Raven miniature UAVs               Since       Chinese drone companies have begun to export large quantities of drones to the global military market  Of the    countries that are known to have received military drones between      and       the top    all purchased their drones from China                            The shift accelerated in the     s due to China s advancement in drone technologies and manufacturing  compounded by market demand from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel Gaza conflict                                                     
For intelligence and reconnaissance missions  the inherent stealth of micro UAV flapping wing ornithopters  imitating birds or insects  offers potential for covert surveillance and makes them difficult targets to bring down

The civilian  commercial and general  drone market is dominated by Chinese companies  Chinese manufacturer DJI alone had     of the civil market share in       with no other company accounting for more than                  The companies continue to hold over     of global market share by       despite under increasing scrutinies and sanctions from the United States               The US Interior Department grounded its fleet of DJI drones in       while the Justice Department prohibited the use of federal funds for the purchase of DJI and other foreign made UAVs                            
DJI is followed by American company  D Robotics  Chinese company Yuneec  Autel Robotics  and French company Parrot                           
As of May               UAVs had been registered with the US FAA  of which     were categorized as commercial and     as recreational                    NPD point to consumers increasingly purchasing drones with more advanced features with    percent growth in both the       and        market segments              
The civil UAV market is relatively new compared to the military one  Companies are emerging in both developed and developing nations at the same time  Many early stage startups have received support and funding from investors  as is the case in the United States  and from government agencies  as is the case in India               Some universities offer research and training programs or degrees               Private entities also provide online and in person training programs for both recreational and commercial UAV use              
Consumer drones are widely used by police and military organizations worldwide because of the cost effective nature of consumer products  Since       the Israeli military have used DJI UAVs for light reconnaissance missions                                         DJI drones have been used by Chinese police in Xinjiang since                                and American police departments nationwide since                                 Both Ukraine and Russia used commercial DJI drones extensively during the Russian invasion of Ukraine               These civilian DJI drones were sourced by governments  hobbyists  international donations to Ukraine and Russia to support each side on the battlefield  and were often flown by drone hobbyists recruited by the armed forces  The prevalence of DJI drones was attributable to their market dominance  affordability  high performance  and reliability              

Entertainment edit

Drones are also used in nighttime displays for artistic and advertising purposes with the main benefits are that they are safer  quieter and better for the environment than fireworks  They can replace or be an adjunct for fireworks displays to reduce the financial burden of festivals  In addition they can complement fireworks due to the ability for drones to carry them  creating new forms of artwork in the process                                        
Drones can also be used for racing  either with or without VR functionality 

Aerial photography edit

Drones are ideally suited to capturing aerial shots in photography and cinematography  and are widely used for this purpose               Small drones avoid the need for precise coordination between pilot and cameraman  with the same person taking on both roles  Big drones with professional cine cameras usually have a drone pilot and a camera operator who controls camera angle and lens  For example  the AERIGON cinema drone  used in film production  is operated by two people                   full citation needed      Drones provide access to dangerous  remote or otherwise inaccessible sites 

Environmental monitoring edit 
UASs or UAVs offer the great advantage for environmental monitoring to generate a new generation of survey at very high or ultra high resolution both in space and time               This gives the opportunity to bridge the existing gap between satellite data and field monitoring  This has stimulated a huge number of activities in order to enhance the description of natural and agricultural ecosystems  Most common applications are 

Topographic surveys              for the production of orthomosaics  digital surface models and  D models 
Monitoring of natural ecosystems for biodiversity monitoring               habitat mapping               detection of invasive alien species              and study of ecosystem degradation due to invasive species or disturbances 
Precision agriculture              which exploits all available technologies including UAV in order to produce more with less  e g   optimisation of fertilizers  pesticides  irrigation  
River monitoring several methods have been developed to perform flow monitoring using image velocimetry methods which allow to properly describe the  D flow velocity fields              
Structural integrity of any type of structure whether it be a dam  railway or other dangerous  inaccessible or massive locations for building monitoring              
Mineral detection for acid mine drainage using UAVs and hyperspectral cameras can produce detailed maps of proxy minerals  e g  goethite  jarosite  for certain pH values in natural  mining and post mining environments  such as remediated sites                           
These activities can be completed with different measurements  such as photogrammetry  thermography  multispectral images   D field scanning  and normalized difference vegetation index maps 

Geological hazards edit 
UAVs have become a widely used tool for studying geohazards such as landslides               Various sensors  including radar  optical  and thermal  can be mounted on UAVs to monitor different properties  UAVs enable the capture of images of various landslide features  such as transverse  radial  and longitudinal cracks  ridges  scarps  and surfaces of rupture  even in inaccessible areas of the sliding mass                            Moreover  processing the optical images captured by UAVs also allows for the creation of point clouds and  D models  from which these properties can be derived               Comparing point clouds obtained at different times allows for the detection of changes caused by landslide deformation                           

Mineral exploration edit 
UAVs may help in the discovery of new or reevaluation of known mineral deposits to meet the demand for raw materials such as critical raw metals  e g  cobalt  nickel   rare earths and battery minerals  By employing a suite of sensors  e g  spectral imaging  Lidar  magnetics  gamma ray spectroscopy                             and similar to those used in environmental monitoring  UAV based data can produce maps of geological surface and subsurface features  contributing to more efficient and targeted mineral exploration                           

Agriculture  forestry and environmental studies edit

Agricultural drone on trailer setup
As global demand for food production grows exponentially  resources are depleted  farmland is reduced  and agricultural labor is increasingly in short supply  there is an urgent need for more convenient and smarter agricultural solutions than traditional methods  and the agricultural drone and robotics industry is expected to make progress               Agricultural drones have been used to help build sustainable agriculture all over the world leading to a new generation of agriculture               In this context  there is a proliferation of innovations in both tools and methodologies which allow precise description of vegetation state and also may help to precisely distribute nutrients  pesticides or seeds over a field            
The use of UAVs is also being investigated to help detect and fight wildfires  whether through observation or launching pyrotechnic devices to start backfires              
UAVs are also now widely used to survey wildlife such as nesting seabirds  seals and even wombat burrows

Threats edit 
Nuisance edit 
UAVs can threaten airspace security in numerous ways  including unintentional collisions or other interference with other aircraft  deliberate attacks or by distracting pilots or flight controllers  The first incident of a drone airplane collision occurred in mid October      in Quebec City  Canada               The first recorded instance of a drone collision with a hot air balloon occurred on    August      in Driggs  Idaho  United States  although there was no significant damage to the balloon nor any injuries to its   occupants  the balloon pilot reported the incident to the National Transportation Safety Board  stating that  I hope this incident helps create a conversation of respect for nature  the airspace  and rules and regulations                Unauthorized UAV flights into or near major airports have prompted extended shutdowns of commercial flights              
Drones caused significant disruption at Gatwick Airport during December       needing the deployment of the British Army                           
In the United States  flying close to a wildfire is punishable by a maximum         fine  Nonetheless  in      and       firefighting air support in California was hindered on several occasions  including at the Lake Fire              and the North Fire                            In response  California legislators introduced a bill that would allow firefighters to disable UAVs which invaded restricted airspace               The FAA later required registration of most UAVs 

Security vulnerabilities edit 
By       drones were being used to drop contraband into prisons              
The interest in UAVs cybersecurity has been raised greatly after the Predator UAV video stream hijacking incident in                    where Islamic militants used cheap  off the shelf equipment to stream video feeds from a UAV  Another risk is the possibility of hijacking or jamming a UAV in flight  Several security researchers have made public some vulnerabilities in commercial UAVs  in some cases even providing full source code or tools to reproduce their attacks               At a workshop on UAVs and privacy in October       researchers from the Federal Trade Commission showed they were able to hack into three different consumer quadcopters and noted that UAV manufacturers can make their UAVs more secure by the basic security measures of encrypting the Wi Fi signal and adding password protection              

Aggression edit 
Many UAVs have been loaded with dangerous payloads  and or crashed into targets  Payloads have included or could include explosives  chemical  radiological or biological hazards  UAVs with generally non lethal payloads could possibly be hacked and put to malicious purposes  Counter UAV systems  C UAS   from detection to electronic warfare to UAVs designed to destroy other UAVs  are in development and being deployed by states to counter this threat 
Such developments have occurred despite the difficulties  As J  Rogers stated in a      interview to A amp T   There is a big debate out there at the moment about what the best way is to counter these small UAVs  whether they are used by hobbyists causing a bit of a nuisance or in a more sinister manner by a terrorist actor               

Countermeasures edit

The malicious use of UAVs has led to the development of counter unmanned air system  C UAS  technologies  Automatic tracking and detection of UAVs from commercial cameras have become accurate thanks to the development of deep learning based machine learning algorithms               It is also possible to automatically identify UAVs across different cameras with different viewpoints and hardware specification with re identification methods                Commercial systems such as the Aaronia AARTOS have been installed on major international airports                            Once a UAV is detected  it can be countered with kinetic force  missiles  projectiles or another UAV  or by non kinetic force  laser  microwaves  communications jamming                Anti aircraft missile systems such as the Iron Dome are also being enhanced with C UAS technologies  Utilising a smart UAV swarm to counter one or more hostile UAVs is also proposed              

Regulation edit 
Main article  Regulation of unmanned aerial vehicles
Regulatory bodies around the world are developing unmanned aircraft system traffic management solutions to better integrate UAVs into airspace              
The use of unmanned aerial vehicles is becoming increasingly regulated by the civil aviation authorities of individual countries  Regulatory regimes can differ significantly according to drone size and use  The International Civil Aviation Organization  ICAO  began exploring the use of drone technology as far back as       which resulted in a      report               France was among the first countries to set a national framework based on this report and larger aviation bodies such as the FAA and the EASA quickly followed suit               In       the FAA published a rule requiring all commercially used UAVs and all UAVs regardless of intent weighing     g or more to participate in Remote ID  which makes drone locations  controller locations  and other information public from takeoff to shutdown  this rule has since been challenged in the pending federal lawsuit RaceDayQuads v  FAA                           

EU Drone Certification   Class Identification Label edit 
The implementation of the Class Identification Label serves a crucial purpose in the regulation and operation of drones                The label is a verification mechanism designed to confirm that drones within a specific class meet the rigorous standards set by administrations for design and manufacturing               These standards are necessary to ensure the safety and reliability of drones in various industries and applications 
By providing this assurance to customers  the Class Identification Label helps to increase confidence in drone technology and encourages wider adoption across industries  This  in turn  contributes to the growth and development of the drone industry and supports the integration of drones into society 

Export controls edit 
The export of UAVs or technology capable of carrying a          kg payload at least          km is restricted in many countries by the Missile Technology Control Regime
