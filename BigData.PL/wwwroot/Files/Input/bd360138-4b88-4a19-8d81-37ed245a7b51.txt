efficiently  Backend Development refers to the server side development of the web application  It is the part of the application where the server and database reside and the logics is build to perform operations  It includes the main features and functionalities of the application on the server  Programming languages for the backend are mainly Node  JS  for JavaScript   Django  for Python   Spring  Java   etc Backend Developer Roadmap        Knowledge of Web ServerThe web server runs websites  it stores  processes  and delivers  response  web pages to the user s request  When the user makes a request by the web server  it is accepted by an HTTP server which finds and sends back the content to the browser through HTTP  Some examples of web servers are Apache and NGINX which are open source platforms used to deliver content as per requests made  nbsp    Programming Languages and Their FrameworksChoose and Learn any of the Programming languages and its frameworks JS   NodeJS   nbsp With JavaScript being the most demanding programming language  you can explore various new concepts and build a very amazing website  It is used to build interactive and dynamic websites  For JS  we have a runtime environment which is NodeJS  which allows you to run JavaScript on the server  nbsp  We also have a framework like Express JS built on on Node JS  Python   Django   Python is the easiest of all programming languages and with Django  it plays a perfect combination to build a website  With less code  you can build better and more easy web applications  Python is most commonly used for developing websites and it performs quicker implementations  Django is the most secure and scalable framework one should work with  PHP   Laravel   PHP  HyperText Preprocessor  is a general purpose scripting language well suited for web development  It is a fast  flexible  and pragmatic language which powers everything from blogs to the most popular websites  Laravel is an open source framework used to build a wide range of web applications  It is purely a server side framework that manages data and uses MVC  Model View Controller  to break an application s back end architecture into logical parts making it easier to build     Version Control System  Git Version control system nbsp helps in maintaining and tracking changes in code changes to be used for future implementations  They are software tools that help in managing changes in source code over time  nbsp Git nbsp which is free and open source can be the best choice as a version control system because of its secure  flexible  and easy to edit features Why Git  nbsp It is the most commonly used version control systemIt tracks changes made in files Git branches are cheap and easy to merge You can move to specific versions whenever you want to    Knowledge of Web Security nbsp Various threats can attack a website which could result in its poor performance  Web security refers to the protective measures and protocols developers should follow to build an optimized and effective website  nbsp It includes scanning a website for vulnerabilities to defend against thefts or loss that occurs due to digital hackers Types of Risks developers face could be malware  backlisting  buffer overflow  and sensitive data exposure  Various techniques can be followed to avoid such issues Using HTTPS  nbsp HTTPS is a secured HTTP  When data is sent using HTTPS  it is protected via the Transport Layer Security nbsp protocol  nbsp which has three layers of protection Encryption   Way of securing data along with a password or  key  which is used to decrypt the information  Data Integrity  When data integrity is secure  information stored in a database is complete  accurate  and reliable for a lifetime  Authentication   This method protects against attacks and builds user trust which response to business growth  Implementing secure backup and recovery  nbsp Data loss could be the major threat that could lead to security breaches  To avoid this  make sure to implement a backup process  This could be implemented in many ways  nbsp Protecting media and content from theft or destruction Periodically testing the backups Apply a two person rule so that one person cannot access the content or media without the permission of another article and various other methods include XSS Attacks  Software updates  and SQL Injection  nbsp    nbsp APIs  Application Programming Interface An API  Application Programming Interface  is a set of functions that perform accessing data and interacting with external software components  microservices  and OS  In short  it delivers users  responses to the system and sends responses back to the user  It is because of APIs  which act as a software intermediary  that two applications talk to each other  APIs are used by backend developers to create connections between services or applications to initiate communication to improve user experience  Express is a good choice for a server to create and expose APIs to have client server communication  Some of the APIs you should know about are RESTJSONSOAPGSONXML RPCAES   Containerization  amp  TestingContainerization is the process of packaging software code with all the necessary elements like frameworks  libraries  and other dependencies  to make services isolated from each other in a container  nbsp This process is done by the backend developers to run a container easily  Docker and Kubernetes are the most used containers  Docker is an open source containerization platform  that enables developers to package applications into containers  It is similar to a virtual machine but much more efficient  Its basic use of it is it allows the applications to run in different environments  Kubernetes often abbreviated as  K s   automates deploying and managing cloud native applications using public cloud platforms     DeploymentWhen the testing passes  developers move to the deployment where they can see the working of their application  It can also be referred to as a live environment  This process includes   steps  Planning  development  testing  deploying  and monitoring  nbsp Planning  When multiple developers are working on the same project  a deployment plan is a necessity  Using this step  you avoid conflicts between changes made making sure the deployment process is as smooth and easy  This could lead to the quicker and more efficient development of the application  Development  Once  the planning is done  actual development takes place  This is the step where you gather ideas and prioritization requirements  Then  the management of the complete application can be moved to testing  Testing  Testing is a crucial step to ensure there are no bugs before moving it to the production level  Testing is possible only when you deploy it to various environments to check whether it fits in or not  Check for the bugs and if any  make sure to remove them and then move to the deployment process  Deploying  Seeing your application working live  with no bugs  and nbsp in an optimized way gives satisfaction to the effort made  It means pushing changes or updates from one environment to another  Monitoring  Constant monitoring is required to check whether the website is working well or not  There might be a chance that issues may occur after deploying as well  so keep an eye out for the proper functioning  and the time for release should be planned so that minimum users would have viewed and changes can be made to see the optimized web application     Cloud ProvidersEverything is making its way to the cloud  be it software  applications  services  or products  Cloud computing  It is Web based computing that nbsp permits businesses and individuals to consume computing resources such as virtual machines  databases  processing  services  storage  and events  and gives you a pay as you go service  Cloud computing can be divided into three major categories  Software as a Service  SaaS   Platform as a Service  PaaS   and Infrastructure as a Service  IaaS  The most used Cloud Services are Amazon Web Services  AWS Microsoft AzureGoogle CloudAlibaba CloudIBM Cloud Backend Development Frameworks TechnologiesLaravel   Laravel is a PHP framework for web applications  created by  Taylor Otwell  in       It follows the Model View Controller  MVC  architectural pattern  Node JS   Node JS nbsp is an open source and cross platform runtime environment built on Chrome s V  JavaScript engine for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser  Django   Django is a Python based web framework that allows you to quickly create efficient web applications  It provides built in features for everything including Django Admin Interface  default database   SQLlite   etc  Spring Boot   Spring Boot is a Java framework that makes it easier to create and run Java applications  It simplifies the configuration and setup process  allowing developers to focus more on writing code for their applications  Flask   Flask is an API of Python that allows us to build up web applications  It was developed by Armin Ronacher
