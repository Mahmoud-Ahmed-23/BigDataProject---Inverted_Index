Throughout the past decade in the field of tissue engineering  novel cell sources  engineering materials  and tissue architecture techniques have provided engineering tissues that better restore  maintain  improve  or replace biological tissues 
Tissue engineering is a biomedical engineering discipline that uses a combination of cells  engineering  materials methods  and suitable biochemical and physicochemical factors to restore  maintain  improve  or replace different types of biological tissues  Tissue engineering often involves the use of cells placed on tissue scaffolds in the formation of new viable tissue for a medical purpose  but is not limited to applications involving cells and tissue scaffolds  While it was once categorized as a sub field of biomaterials  having grown in scope and importance  it can be considered as a field of its own            

What tissue engineering is and how it works
While most definitions of tissue engineering cover a broad range of applications  in practice  the term is closely associated with applications that repair or replace portions of or whole tissues  i e  organs  bone  cartilage             blood vessels  bladder  skin  muscle etc    Often  the tissues involved require certain mechanical and structural properties for proper functioning  The term has also been applied to efforts to perform specific biochemical functions using cells within an artificially created support system  e g  an artificial pancreas  or a bio artificial liver   The term regenerative medicine is often used synonymously with tissue engineering  although those involved in regenerative medicine place more emphasis on the use of stem cells or progenitor cells to produce tissues 


Overview edit

A commonly applied definition of tissue engineering  as stated by Langer            and Vacanti             is  an interdisciplinary field that applies the principles of engineering and life sciences toward the development of biological substitutes that restore  maintain  or improve  Biological tissue  function or a whole organ              In addition  Langer and Vacanti also state that there are three main types of tissue engineering  cells  tissue inducing substances  and a cells   matrix approach  often referred to as a scaffold   Tissue engineering has also been defined as  understanding the principles of tissue growth  and applying this to produce functional replacement tissue for clinical use              A further description goes on to say that an  underlying supposition of tissue engineering is that the employment of natural biology of the system will allow for greater success in developing therapeutic strategies aimed at the replacement  repair  maintenance  or enhancement of tissue function             
Developments in the multidisciplinary field of tissue engineering have yielded a novel set of tissue replacement parts and implementation strategies  Scientific advances in biomaterials  stem cells  growth and differentiation factors  and biomimetic environments have created unique opportunities to fabricate or improve existing tissues in the laboratory from combinations of engineered extracellular matrices   scaffolds    cells  and biologically active molecules  Among the major challenges now facing tissue engineering is the need for more complex functionality  biomechanical stability  and vascularization in laboratory grown tissues destined for transplantation            

Etymology edit 
The historical origin of the term is unclear as the definition of the word has changed throughout the past few decades  The term first appeared in a      publication that described the organization of an endothelium like membrane on the surface of a long implanted  synthetic ophthalmic prosthesis            
The first modern use of the term as recognized today was in      by the researcher  physiologist and bioengineer Yuan Cheng Fung of the Engineering Research Center  He proposed the joining of the terms tissue  in reference to the fundamental relationship between cells and organs  and engineering  in reference to the field of modification of said tissues   The term was officially adopted in

Ancient era  pre   th century  edit 
A rudimentary understanding of the inner workings of human tissues may date back further than most would expect  As early as the Neolithic period  sutures were being used to close wounds and aid in healing  Later on  societies such as ancient Egypt developed better materials for sewing up wounds such as linen sutures  Around      BC in ancient India  skin grafts were developed by cutting skin from the buttock and suturing it to wound sites in the ear  nose  or lips  Ancient Egyptians often would graft skin from corpses onto living humans and even attempted to use honey as a type of antibiotic and grease as a protective barrier to prevent infection  In the  st and  nd centuries AD  Gallo Romans developed wrought iron implants and dental implants could be found in ancient Mayans 

Enlightenment    th century   th century  edit 
While these ancient societies had developed techniques that were way ahead of their time  they still lacked a mechanistic understanding of how the body was reacting to these procedures  This mechanistic approach came along in tandem with the development of the empirical method of science pioneered by Ren  Descartes  Sir Isaac Newton began to describe the body as a  physiochemical machine  and postured that disease was a breakdown in the machine 
In the   th century  Robert Hooke discovered the cell and a letter from Benedict de Spinoza brought forward the idea of the homeostasis between the dynamic processes in the body  Hydra experiments performed by Abraham Trembley in the   th century began to delve into the regenerative capabilities of cells  During the   th century  a better understanding of how different metals reacted with the body led to the development of better sutures and a shift towards screw and plate implants in bone fixation  Further  it was first hypothesized in the mid     s that cell environment interactions and cell proliferation were vital for tissue regeneration 

Modern era    th and   st centuries  edit 
As time progresses and technology advances  there is a constant need for change in the approach researchers take in their studies  Tissue engineering has continued to evolve over centuries  In the beginning people used to look at and use samples directly from human or animal cadavers  Now  tissue engineers have the ability to remake many of the tissues in the body through the use of modern techniques such as microfabrication and three dimensional bioprinting in conjunction with native tissue cells stem cells  These advances have allowed researchers to generate new tissues in a much more efficient manner  For example  these techniques allow for more personalization which allow for better biocompatibility  decreased immune response  cellular integration  and longevity  There is no doubt that these techniques will continue to evolve  as we have continued to see microfabrication and bioprinting evolve over the past decade 
In       Wichterle and Lim were the first to publish experiments on hydrogels for biomedical applications by using them in contact lens construction  Work on the field developed slowly over the next two decades  but later found traction when hydrogels were repurposed for drug delivery  In       Charles Hull developed bioprinting by converting a Hewlett Packard inkjet printer into a device capable of depositing cells in   D  Three dimensional    D  printing is a type of additive manufacturing which has since found various applications in medical engineering  due to its high precision and efficiency  With biologist James Thompson s development of first human stem cell lines in      followed by transplantation of first laboratory grown internal organs in      and creation of the first bioprinter in      by the University of Missouri when they printed spheroids without the need of scaffolds    D bioprinting became more conventionally used in medical field than ever before  So far  scientists have been able to print mini organoids and organs on chips that have rendered practical insights into the functions of a human body  Pharmaceutical companies are using these models to test drugs before moving on to animal studies  However  a fully functional and structurally similar organ has not been printed yet  A team at University of Utah has reportedly printed ears and successfully transplanted those onto children born with defects that left their ears partially developed 
Today hydrogels are considered the preferred choice of bio inks for   D bioprinting since they mimic cells  natural ECM while also containing strong mechanical properties capable of sustaining   D structures  Furthermore  hydrogels in conjunction with   D bioprinting allow researchers to produce different scaffolds which can be used to form new tissues or organs    D printed tissues still face many challenges such as adding vasculature  Meanwhile    D printing parts of tissues definitely will improve our understanding of the human body  thus accelerating both basic and clinical research 

Examples edit

Tissue engineered blood vessels              Blood vessels that have been grown in a lab and can be used to repair damaged blood vessels without eliciting an immune response   Tissue engineered blood vessels have been developed by many different approaches        They could be implanted as pre seeded cellularized blood vessels              as acellular vascular grafts made with decellularized vessels or synthetic vascular grafts

Cells as building blocks edit 
Stained cells in culture
Cells are one of the main components for the success of tissue engineering approaches  Tissue engineering uses cells as strategies for creation replacement of new tissue  Examples include fibroblasts used for skin repair or renewal              chondrocytes used for cartilage repair  MACI FDA approved product   and hepatocytes used in liver support systems
Cells can be used alone or with support matrices for tissue engineering applications  An adequate environment for promoting cell growth  differentiation  and integration with the existing tissue is a critical factor for cell based building blocks              Manipulation of any of these cell processes create alternative avenues for the development of new tissue  e g   cell reprogramming   somatic cells  vascularization       citation needed     

Isolation edit 
Techniques for cell isolation depend on the cell source  Centrifugation and apheresis are techniques used for extracting cells from biofluids  e g   blood   Whereas digestion processes  typically using enzymes to remove the extracellular matrix  ECM   are required prior to centrifugation or apheresis techniques to extract cells from tissues organs  Trypsin and collagenase are the most common enzymes used for tissue digestion  While trypsin is temperature dependent  collagenase is less sensitive to changes in temperature      citation needed     

Cell sources edit 
Mouse embryonic stem cells
Primary cells are those directly isolated from host tissue  These cells provide an ex vivo model of cell behavior without any genetic  epigenetic  or developmental changes  making them a closer replication of in vivo conditions than cells derived from other methods              This constraint however  can also make studying them difficult  These are mature cells  often terminally differentiated  meaning that for many cell types proliferation is difficult or impossible  Additionally  the microenvironments these cells exist in are highly specialized  often making replication of these conditions difficult             
Secondary cells A portion of cells from a primary culture is moved to a new repository vessel to continue being cultured  Medium from the primary culture is removed  the cells that are desired to be transferred are obtained  and then cultured in a new vessel with fresh growth medium               A secondary cell culture is useful in order to ensure that cells have both the room and nutrients that they require to grow  Secondary cultures are most notably used in any scenario in which a larger quantity of cells than can be found in the primary culture is desired  Secondary cells share the constraints of primary cells  see above  but have an added risk of contamination when transferring to a new vessel      citation needed     

Genetic classifications of cells edit 
Autologous  The donor and the recipient of the cells are the same individual  Cells are harvested  cultured or stored  and then reintroduced to the host  As a result of the host s own cells being reintroduced  an antigenic response is not elicited  The body s immune system recognizes these re implanted cells as its own  and does not target them for attack  Autologous cell dependence on host cell health and donor site morbidity may be deterrents to their use  Adipose derived and bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells are commonly autologous in nature  and can be used in a myriad of ways  from helping repair skeletal tissue to replenishing beta cells in diabetic patients                                                 
Allogenic  Cells are obtained from the body of a donor of the same species as the recipient  While there are some ethical constraints to the use of human cells for in vitro studies  i e  human brain tissue chimera development               the employment of dermal fibroblasts from human foreskin demonstrates an immunologically safe and thus a viable choice for allogenic tissue engineering of the skin 
Xenogenic  These cells are derived isolated cells from alternate species from the recipient  A notable example of xenogeneic tissue utilization is cardiovascular implant construction via animal cells  Chimeric human animal farming raises ethical concerns around the potential for improved consciousness from implanting human organs in animals             
Syngeneic or isogenic  These cells describe those borne from identical genetic code  This imparts an immunologic benefit similar to autologous cell lines  see above               Autologous cells can be considered syngenic  but the classification also extends to non autologously derived cells such as those from an identical twin  from genetically identical  cloned  research models  or induced stem cells  iSC              as related to the donor 

Stem cells edit

Stem cells are undifferentiated cells with the ability to divide in culture and give rise to different forms of specialized cells  Stem cells are divided into  adult  and  embryonic  stem cells according to their source  While there is still a large ethical debate related to the use of embryonic stem cells  it is thought that another alternative source   induced pluripotent stem cells                  may be useful for the repair of diseased or damaged tissues  or may be used to grow new organs 
Totipotent cells are stem cells which can divide into further stem cells or differentiate into any cell type in the body  including extra embryonic tissue 
Pluripotent cells are stem cells which can differentiate into any cell type in the body except extra embryonic tissue  induced pluripotent stem cells  iPSCs  are subclass of pluripotent stem cells resembling embryonic stem cells  ESCs  that have been derived from adult differentiated cells  iPSCs are created by altering the expression of transcriptional factors in adult cells until they become like embryonic stem cells 
Multipotent stem cells can be differentiated into any cell within the same class  such as blood or bone  A common example of multipotent cells is Mesenchymal stem cells  MSCs  

Scaffolds edit 
Scaffolds are materials that have been engineered to cause desirable cellular interactions to contribute to the formation of new functional tissues for medical purposes  Cells are often  seeded  into these structures capable of supporting three dimensional tissue formation  Scaffolds mimic the extracellular matrix of the native tissue  recapitulating the in vivo milieu and allowing cells to influence their own microenvironments  They usually serve at least one of the following purposes  allowing cell attachment and migration  delivering and retaining cells and biochemical factors  enabling diffusion of vital cell nutrients and expressed products  and exerting certain mechanical and biological influences to modify the behaviour of the cell phase      citation needed     
In       an interdisciplinary team led by the thoracic surgeon Thorsten Walles implanted the first bioartificial transplant that provides an innate vascular network for post transplant graft supply successfully into a patient awaiting tracheal reconstruction             

This animation of a rotating carbon nanotube shows its  D structure  Carbon nanotubes are among the numerous candidates for tissue engineering scaffolds since they are biocompatible  resistant to biodegradation and can be functionalized with biomolecules  However  the possibility of toxicity with non biodegradable nano materials is not fully understood             
To achieve the goal of tissue reconstruction  scaffolds must meet some specific requirements  High porosity and adequate pore size are necessary to facilitate cell seeding and diffusion throughout the whole structure of both cells and nutrients  Biodegradability is often an essential factor since scaffolds should preferably be absorbed by the surrounding tissues without the necessity of surgical removal  The rate at which degradation occurs has to coincide as much as possible with the rate of tissue formation  this means that while cells are fabricating their own natural matrix structure around themselves  the scaffold is able to provide structural integrity within the body and eventually it will break down leaving the newly formed tissue which will take over the mechanical load  Injectability is also important for clinical uses 
Recent research on organ printing is showing how crucial a good control of the  D environment is to ensure reproducibility of experiments and offer better results      citation needed     

Materials edit 
Material selection is an essential aspect of producing a scaffold        The materials utilized can be natural or synthetic and can be biodegradable or non biodegradable  Additionally  they must be biocompatible  meaning that they do not cause any adverse effects to cells              Silicone  for example  is a synthetic  non biodegradable material commonly used as a drug delivery material                          while gelatin is a biodegradable  natural material commonly used in cell culture scaffolds                                    
The material needed for each application is different  and dependent on the desired mechanical properties of the material  Tissue engineering of long bone defects for example  will require a rigid scaffold with a compressive strength similar to that of cortical bone          MPa   which is much higher compared to a scaffold for skin regeneration                         
There are a few versatile synthetic materials used for many different scaffold applications  One of these commonly used materials is polylactic acid  PLA   a synthetic polymer  PLA   polylactic acid  This is a polyester which degrades within the human body to form lactic acid  a naturally occurring chemical which is easily removed from the body  Similar materials are polyglycolic acid  PGA  and polycaprolactone  PCL   their degradation mechanism is similar to that of PLA        but PCL degrades slower and PGA degrades faster      citation needed      PLA is commonly combined with PGA to create poly lactic co glycolic acid  PLGA   This is especially useful because the degradation of PLGA can be tailored by altering the weight percentages of PLA and PGA  More PLA   slower degradation  more PGA   faster degradation  This tunability  along with its biocompatibility  makes it an extremely useful material for scaffold creation             
Scaffolds may also be constructed from natural materials  in particular different derivatives of the extracellular matrix have been studied to evaluate their ability to support cell growth  Protein based materials   such as collagen  or fibrin  and polysaccharidic materials  like chitosan             or glycosaminoglycans  GAGs   have all proved suitable in terms of cell compatibility  Among GAGs  hyaluronic acid  possibly in combination with cross linking agents  e g  glutaraldehyde  water soluble carbodiimide  etc    is one of the possible choices as scaffold material 
Due to the covalent attachment of thiol groups to these polymers  they can crosslink via disulfide bond formation              The use of thiolated polymers  thiomers  as scaffold material for tissue engineering was initially introduced at the  th Central European Symposium on Pharmaceutical Technology in Vienna                   As thiomers are biocompatible  exhibit cellular mimicking properties and efficiently support proliferation and differentiation of various cell types  they are extensively used as scaffolds for tissue engineering                                      Furthermore thiomers such as thiolated hyaluronic acid             and thiolated chitosan             were shown to exhibit wound healing properties and are subject of numerous clinical trials              Additionally  a fragment of an extracellular matrix protein  such as the RGD peptide  can be coupled to a non bioactive material to promote cell attachment              Another form of scaffold is decellularized tissue  This is a process where chemicals are used to extracts cells from tissues  leaving just the extracellular matrix  This has the benefit of a fully formed matrix specific to the desired tissue type  However  the decellurised scaffold may present immune problems with future introduced cells      citation needed

Tissue engineered vascular graft
Tissue engineered heart valve
A number of different methods have been described in the literature for preparing porous structures to be employed as tissue engineering scaffolds  Each of these techniques presents its own advantages  but none are free of drawbacks 

Nanofiber self assembly edit 
Molecular self assembly is one of the few methods for creating biomaterials with properties similar in scale and chemistry to that of the natural in vivo extracellular matrix  ECM   a crucial step toward tissue engineering of complex tissues              Moreover  these hydrogel scaffolds have shown superiority in in vivo toxicology and biocompatibility compared to traditional macro scaffolds and animal derived materials 

Textile technologies edit 
These techniques include all the approaches that have been successfully employed for the preparation of non woven meshes of different polymers  In particular  non woven polyglycolide structures have been tested for tissue engineering applications  such fibrous structures have been found useful to grow different types of cells  The principal drawbacks are related to the difficulties in obtaining high porosity and regular pore size 

Solvent casting and particulate leaching edit 
Solvent casting and particulate leaching  SCPL  allows for the preparation of structures with regular porosity  but with limited thickness  First  the polymer is dissolved into a suitable organic solvent  e g  polylactic acid could be dissolved into dichloromethane   then the solution is cast into a mold filled with porogen particles  Such porogen can be an inorganic salt like sodium chloride  crystals of saccharose  gelatin spheres or paraffin spheres  The size of the porogen particles will affect the size of the scaffold pores  while the polymer to porogen ratio is directly correlated to the amount of porosity of the final structure  After the polymer solution has been cast the solvent is allowed to fully evaporate  then the composite structure in the mold is immersed in a bath of a liquid suitable for dissolving the porogen  water in the case of sodium chloride  saccharose and gelatin or an aliphatic solvent like hexane for use with paraffin  Once the porogen has been fully dissolved  a porous structure is obtained  Other than the small thickness range that can be obtained  another drawback of SCPL lies in its use of organic solvents which must be fully removed to avoid any possible damage to the cells seeded on the scaffold 

Gas foaming edit 
To overcome the need to use organic solvents and solid porogens  a technique using gas as a porogen has been developed  First  disc shaped structures made of the desired polymer are prepared by means of compression molding using a heated mold  The discs are then placed in a chamber where they are exposed to high pressure CO  for several days  The pressure inside the chamber is gradually restored to atmospheric levels  During this procedure the pores are formed by the carbon dioxide molecules that abandon the polymer  resulting in a sponge like structure  The main problems resulting from such a technique are caused by the excessive heat used during compression molding  which prohibits the incorporation of any temperature labile material into the polymer matrix  and by the fact that the pores do not form an interconnected structure 

Emulsification freeze drying edit 
This technique does not require the use of a solid porogen like SCPL  First  a synthetic polymer is dissolved into a suitable solvent  e g  polylactic acid in dichloromethane  then water is added to the polymeric solution and the two liquids are mixed in order to obtain an emulsion  Before the two phases can separate  the emulsion is cast into a mold and quickly frozen by means of immersion into liquid nitrogen  The frozen emulsion is subsequently freeze dried to remove the dispersed water and the solvent  thus leaving a solidified  porous polymeric structure  While emulsification and freeze drying allow for a faster preparation when compared to SCPL  since it does not require a time consuming leaching step   it still requires the use of solvents  Moreover  pore size is relatively small and porosity is often irregular  Freeze drying by itself is also a commonly employed technique for the fabrication of scaffolds  In particular  it is used to prepare collagen sponges  collagen is dissolved into acidic solutions of acetic acid or hydrochloric acid that are cast into a mold  frozen with liquid nitrogen and then lyophilized 

Thermally induced phase separation edit 
Similar to the previous technique  the TIPS phase separation procedure requires the use of a solvent with a low melting point that is easy to sublime  For example  dioxane could be used to dissolve polylactic acid  then phase separation is induced through the addition of a small quantity of water  a polymer rich and a polymer poor phase are formed  Following cooling below the solvent melting point and some days of vacuum drying to sublime the solvent  a porous scaffold is obtained  Liquid liquid phase separation presents the same drawbacks of emulsification freeze drying             

Electrospinning edit 
Electrospinning is a highly versatile technique that can be used to produce continuous fibers ranging in diameter from a few microns to a few nanometers  In a typical electrospinning set up  the desired scaffold material is dissolved within a solvent and placed within a syringe  This solution is fed through a needle and a high voltage is applied to the tip and to a conductive collection surface  The buildup of electrostatic forces within the solution causes it to eject a thin fibrous stream towards the oppositely charged or grounded collection surface  During this process the solvent evaporates  leaving solid fibers leaving a highly porous network  This technique is highly tunable  with variation to solvent  voltage  working distance  distance from the needle to collection surface   flow rate of solution  solute concentration  and collection surface  This allows for precise control of fiber morphology 
On a commercial level however  due to scalability reasons  there are    or sometimes    needles involved operating at once  The bottle necks in such set ups are     Maintaining the aforementioned variables uniformly for all of the needles and    formation of  beads  in single fibers that we as engineers  want to be of a uniform diameter  By modifying variables such as the distance to collector  magnitude of applied voltage  or solution flow rate                  researchers can dramatically change the overall scaffold architecture 
Historically  research on electrospun fibrous scaffolds dates back to at least the late     s when Simon showed that electrospinning could be used to produce nano  and submicron scale fibrous scaffolds from polymer solutions specifically intended for use as in vitro cell and tissue substrates  This early use of electrospun lattices for cell culture and tissue engineering showed that various cell types would adhere to and proliferate upon polycarbonate fibers  It was noted that as opposed to the flattened morphology typically seen in  D culture  cells grown on the electrospun fibers exhibited a more rounded   dimensional morphology generally observed of tissues in vivo             

CAD CAM technologies edit 
Because most of the above techniques are limited when it comes to the control of porosity and pore size  computer assisted design and manufacturing techniques have been introduced to tissue engineering  First  a three dimensional structure is designed using CAD software  The porosity can be tailored using algorithms within the software              The scaffold is then realized by using ink jet printing of polymer powders or through Fused Deposition Modeling of a polymer melt             
A      study by El Ayoubi et al  investigated   D plotting technique to produce  biocompatible and biodegradable  poly L Lactide macroporous scaffolds with two different pore sizes  via solid free form fabrication  SSF  with computer aided design  CAD   to explore therapeutic articular cartilage replacement as an  alternative to conventional tissue repair               The study found the smaller the pore size paired with mechanical stress in a bioreactor  to induce in vivo like conditions   the higher the cell viability in potential therapeutic functionality via decreasing recovery time and increasing transplant effectiveness             

Laser assisted bioprinting edit 
In a      study              Koch et al  focused on whether Laser assisted BioPrinting  LaBP  can be used to build multicellular  D patterns in natural matrix  and whether the generated constructs are functioning and forming tissue  LaBP arranges small volumes of living cell suspensions in set high resolution patterns              The investigation was successful  the researchers foresee that  generated tissue constructs might be used for in vivo testing by implanting them into animal models        As of this study  only human skin tissue has been synthesized  though researchers project that  by integrating further cell types  e g  melanocytes  Schwann cells  hair follicle cells  into the printed cell construct  the behavior of these cells in a  D in vitro microenvironment similar to their natural one can be analyzed   which is useful for drug discovery and toxicology studies             

Self assembled recombinant spider silk nanomembranes edit 
Gustafsson et al              demonstrated free standing  bioactive membranes of cm sized area  but only          nm thin  that were formed by self assembly of spider silk at the interface of an aqueous solution  The membranes uniquely combine nanoscale thickness  biodegradability  ultrahigh strain and strength  permeability to proteins and promote rapid cell adherence and proliferation  They demonstrated growing a coherent layer of keratinocytes  These spider silk nanomembranes have also been used to create a static in vitro model of a blood vessel             

Tissue engineering in situ edit 
In situ tissue regeneration is defined as the implantation of biomaterials  alone or in combination with cells and or biomolecules  into the tissue defect  using the surrounding microenvironment of the organism as a natural bioreactor              This approach has found application in bone regeneration              allowing the formation of cell seeded constructs directly in the operating room             

Assembly methods edit 
A persistent problem within tissue engineering is mass transport limitations  Engineered tissues generally lack an initial blood supply  thus making it difficult for any implanted cells to obtain sufficient oxygen and nutrients to survive  or function properly      citation needed     

Self assembly edit 
Self assembly methods have been shown to be promising methods for tissue engineering  Self assembly methods have the advantage of allowing tissues to develop their own extracellular matrix  resulting in tissue that better recapitulates biochemical and biomechanical properties of native tissue  Self assembling engineered articular cartilage was introduced by Jerry Hu and Kyriacos A  Athanasiou in                  and applications of the process have resulted in engineered cartilage approaching the strength of native tissue              Self assembly is a prime technology to get cells grown in a lab to assemble into three dimensional shapes  To break down tissues into cells  researchers first have to dissolve the extracellular matrix that normally binds them together  Once cells are isolated  they must form the complex structures that make up our natural tissues      citation needed

The air liquid surface established by Faraday waves is explored as a template to assemble biological entities for bottom up tissue engineering  This liquid based template can be dynamically reconfigured in a few seconds  and the assembly on the template can be achieved in a scalable and parallel manner  Assembly of microscale hydrogels  cells  neuron seeded micro carrier beads  cell spheroids into various symmetrical and periodic structures was demonstrated with good cell viability  Formation of   D neural network was achieved after    day tissue culture             

Additive manufacturing edit 
Main article  Organ printing
It might be possible to print organs  or possibly entire organisms using additive manufacturing techniques  A recent innovative method of construction uses an ink jet mechanism to print precise layers of cells in a matrix of thermo reversible gel  Endothelial cells  the cells that line blood vessels  have been printed in a set of stacked rings  When incubated  these fused into a tube                          This technique has been referred to as  bioprinting  within the field as it involves the printing of biological components in a structure resembling the organ of focus      citation needed     
The field of three dimensional and highly accurate models of biological systems is pioneered by multiple projects and technologies including a rapid method for creating tissues and even whole organs involve a   D printer that can bio print the scaffolding and cells layer by layer into a working tissue sample or organ  The device is presented in a TED talk by Dr  Anthony Atala  M D  the Director of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine  and the W H  Boyce Professor and Chair of the Department of Urology at Wake Forest University  in which a kidney is printed on stage during the seminar and then presented to the crowd                                      It is anticipated that this technology will enable the production of livers in the future for transplantation and theoretically for toxicology and other biological studies as well      citation needed     
In      Multi Photon Processing  MPP  was employed for in vivo experiments by engineering artificial cartilage constructs  An ex vivo histological examination showed that certain pore geometry and the pre growing of chondrocytes  Cho  prior to implantation significantly improves the performance of the created   D scaffolds  The achieved biocompatibility was comparable to the commercially available collagen membranes  The successful outcome of this study supports the idea that hexagonal pore shaped hybrid organic inorganic micro structured scaffolds in combination with Cho seeding may be successfully implemented for cartilage tissue engineering             
Recently  tissue engineering has advanced with a focus on vascularization  Using Two Photon Polymerization based additive manufacturing  synthetic  D microvessel networks are created from tubular hydrogel structures  These networks can perfuse tissues several cubic millimeters in size  enabling long term viability and cell growth in vitro  This innovation marks a significant step forward in tissue engineering  facilitating the development of complex human tissue models             

Scaffolding edit 
In       using a   D scaffolding of Matrigel in various configurations  substantial pancreatic organoids was produced in vitro  Clusters of small numbers of cells proliferated into        cells within one week  The clusters transform into cells that make either digestive enzymes or hormones like insulin  self organizing into branched pancreatic organoids that resemble the pancreas             
The cells are sensitive to the environment  such as gel stiffness and contact with other cells  Individual cells do not thrive  a minimum of four proximate cells was required for subsequent organoid development  Modifications to the medium composition produced either hollow spheres mainly composed of pancreatic progenitors  or complex organoids that spontaneously undergo pancreatic morphogenesis and differentiation  Maintenance and expansion of pancreatic progenitors require active Notch and FGF signaling  recapitulating in vivo niche signaling interactions             
The organoids were seen as potentially offering mini organs for drug testing and for spare insulin producing cells             
Aside from Matrigel   D scaffolds  other collagen gel systems have been developed  Collagen hyaluronic acid scaffolds have been used for modeling the mammary gland In Vitro while co coculturing epithelial and adipocyte cells  The HyStem kit is another   D platform containing ECM components and hyaluronic acid that has been used for cancer research  Additionally  hydrogel constituents can be chemically modified to assist in crosslinking and enhance their mechanical properties      citation needed     

Tissue culture edit 
In many cases  creation of functional tissues and biological structures in vitro requires extensive culturing to promote survival  growth and inducement of functionality  In general  the basic requirements of cells must be maintained in culture  which include oxygen  pH  humidity  temperature  nutrients and osmotic pressure maintenance      citation needed     
Tissue engineered cultures also present additional problems in maintaining culture conditions  In standard cell culture  diffusion is often the sole means of nutrient and metabolite transport  However  as a culture becomes larger and more complex  such as the case with engineered organs and whole tissues  other mechanisms must be employed to maintain the culture  such as the creation of capillary networks within the tissue      citation needed     

Bioreactor for cultivation of vascular grafts
Another issue with tissue culture is introducing the proper factors or stimuli required to induce functionality  In many cases  simple maintenance culture is not sufficient  Growth factors  hormones  specific metabolites or nutrients  chemical and physical stimuli are sometimes required  For example  certain cells respond to changes in oxygen tension as part of their normal development  such as chondrocytes  which must adapt to low oxygen conditions or hypoxia during skeletal development  Others  such as endothelial cells  respond to shear stress from fluid flow  which is encountered in blood vessels  Mechanical stimuli  such as pressure pulses seem to be beneficial to all kind of cardiovascular tissue such as heart valves  blood vessels or pericardium      citation needed     

Bioreactors edit 
Main article  Bioreactor
In tissue engineering  a bioreactor is a device that attempts to simulate a physiological environment in order to promote cell or tissue growth in vitro  A physiological environment can consist of many different parameters such as temperature  pressure  oxygen or carbon dioxide concentration  or osmolality of fluid environment  and it can extend to all kinds of biological  chemical or mechanical stimuli  Therefore  there are systems that may include the application of forces such as electromagnetic forces  mechanical pressures  or fluid pressures to the tissue  These systems can be two  or three dimensional setups  Bioreactors can be used in both academic and industry applications  General use and application specific bioreactors are also commercially available  which may provide static chemical stimulation or a combination of chemical and mechanical stimulation      citation needed     
Cell proliferation and differentiation are largely influenced by mechanical             and biochemical             cues in the surrounding extracellular matrix environment  Bioreactors are typically developed to replicate the specific physiological environment of the tissue being grown  e g   flex and fluid shearing for heart tissue growth               This can allow specialized cell lines to thrive in cultures replicating their native environments  but it also makes bioreactors attractive tools for culturing stem cells  A successful stem cell based bioreactor is effective at expanding stem cells with uniform properties and or promoting controlled  reproducible differentiation into selected mature cell types             
There are a variety of bioreactors designed for  D cell cultures  There are small plastic cylindrical chambers  as well as glass chambers  with regulated internal humidity and moisture specifically engineered for the purpose of growing cells in three dimensions              The bioreactor uses bioactive synthetic materials such as polyethylene terephthalate membranes to surround the spheroid cells in an environment that maintains high levels of nutrients                          They are easy to open and close  so that cell spheroids can be removed for testing  yet the chamber is able to maintain      humidity throughout              This humidity is important to achieve maximum cell growth and function  The bioreactor chamber is part of a larger device that rotates to ensure equal cell growth in each direction across three dimensions             
QuinXell Technologies now under Quintech Life Sciences from Singapore has developed a bioreactor known as the TisXell Biaxial Bioreactor which is specially designed for the purpose of tissue engineering  It is the first bioreactor in the world to have a spherical glass chamber with biaxial rotation  specifically to mimic the rotation of the fetus in the womb  which provides a conducive environment for the growth of tissues             
Multiple forms of mechanical stimulation have also been combined into a single bioreactor  Using gene expression analysis  one academic study found that applying a combination of cyclic strain and ultrasound stimulation to pre osteoblast cells in a bioreactor accelerated matrix maturation and differentiation              The technology of this combined stimulation bioreactor could be used to grow bone cells more quickly and effectively in future clinical stem cell therapies             
MC  Biotek has also developed a bioreactor known as ProtoTissue             that uses gas exchange to maintain high oxygen levels within the cell chamber  improving upon previous bioreactors  since the higher oxygen levels help the cell grow and undergo normal cell respiration             
Active areas of research on bioreactors includes increasing production scale and refining the physiological environment  both of which could improve the efficiency and efficacy of bioreactors in research or clinical use  Bioreactors are currently used to study  among other things  cell and tissue level therapies  cell and tissue response to specific physiological environment changes  and development of disease and injury      citation needed     

Long fiber generation edit 
In       a group from the University of Tokyo developed cell laden fibers up to a meter in length and on the order of           m in size              These fibers were created using a microfluidic device that forms a double coaxial laminar flow  Each  layer  of the microfluidic device  cells seeded in ECM  a hydrogel sheath  and finally a calcium chloride solution   The seeded cells culture within the hydrogel sheath for several days  and then the sheath is removed with viable cell fibers  Various cell types were inserted into the ECM core  including myocytes  endothelial cells  nerve cell fibers  and epithelial cell fibers  This group then showed that these fibers can be woven together to fabricate tissues or organs in a mechanism similar to textile weaving  Fibrous morphologies are advantageous in that they provide an alternative to traditional scaffold design  and many organs  such as muscle  are composed of fibrous cells 

Bioartificial organs edit 
Main article  Bioartificial organ
An artificial organ is an engineered device that can be extra corporeal or implanted to support impaired or failing organ systems              Bioartificial organs are typically created with the intent to restore critical biological functions like in the replacement of diseased hearts and lungs  or provide drastic quality of life improvements like in the use of engineered skin on burn victims              While some examples of bioartificial organs are still in the research stage of development due to the limitations involved with creating functional organs  others are currently being used in clinical settings experimentally and commercially             

Lung edit 
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation  ECMO  machines  otherwise known as heart and lung machines  are an adaptation of cardiopulmonary bypass techniques that provide heart and lung support              It is used primarily to support the lungs for a prolonged but still temporary timeframe       days  and allow for recovery from reversible diseases              Robert Bartlett is known as the father of ECMO and performed the first treatment of a newborn using an ECMO machine in                  
Skin
Tissue engineered skin is a type of bioartificial organ that is often used to treat burns  diabetic foot ulcers  or other large wounds that cannot heal well on their own  Artificial skin can be made from autografts  allografts  and xenografts  Autografted skin comes from a patient s own skin  which allows the dermis to have a faster healing rate  and the donor site can be re harvested a few times  Allograft skin often comes from cadaver skin and is mostly used to treat burn victims  Lastly  xenografted skin comes from animals and provides a temporary healing structure for the skin  They assist in dermal regeneration  but cannot become part of the host skin              Tissue engineered skin is now available in commercial products  Integra  originally used to only treat burns  consists of a collagen matrix and chondroitin sulfate that can be used as a skin replacement  The chondroitin sulfate functions as a component of proteoglycans  which helps to form the extracellular matrix              Integra can be repopulated and revascularized while maintaining its dermal collagen architecture  making it a bioartificial organ             Dermagraft  another commercial made tissue engineered skin product  is made out of living fibroblasts  These fibroblasts proliferate and produce growth factors  collagen  and ECM proteins  that help build granulation tissue             

Heart edit 
Since the number of patients awaiting a heart transplant is continuously increasing over time  and the number of patients on the waiting list surpasses the organ availability              artificial organs used as replacement therapy for terminal heart failure would help alleviate this difficulty   Artificial hearts are usually used to bridge the heart transplantation or can be applied as replacement therapy for terminal heart malfunction               The total artificial heart  TAH   first introduced by Dr  Vladimir P  Demikhov in                    emerged as an ideal alternative  Since then it has been developed and improved as a mechanical pump that provides long term circulatory support and replaces diseased or damaged heart ventricles that cannot properly pump the blood  restoring thus the pulmonary and systemic flow               Some of the current TAHs include AbioCor  an FDA approved device that comprises two artificial ventricles and their valves  and does not require subcutaneous connections  and is indicated for patients with biventricular heart failure  In      SynCardia released the portable freedom driver that allows patients to have a portable device without being confined to the hospital              

Kidney edit 
While kidney transplants are possible  renal failure is more often treated using an artificial kidney               The first artificial kidneys and the majority of those currently in use are extracorporeal  such as with hemodialysis  which filters blood directly  or peritoneal dialysis  which filters via a fluid in the abdomen                            In order to contribute to the biological functions of a kidney such as producing metabolic factors or hormones  some artificial kidneys incorporate renal cells                            There has been progress in the way of making these devices smaller and more transportable  or even implantable   One challenge still to be faced in these smaller devices is countering the limited volume and therefore limited filtering capabilities              
Bioscaffolds have also been introduced to provide a framework upon which normal kidney tissue can be regenerated  These scaffolds encompass natural scaffolds  e g   decellularized kidneys               collagen hydrogel                            or silk fibroin                synthetic scaffolds  e g   poly lactic co glycolic acid                            or other polymers   or a combination of two or more natural and synthetic scaffolds  These scaffolds can be implanted into the body either without cell treatment or after a period of stem cell seeding and incubation  In vitro and In vivo studies are  being conducted to compare and optimize the type of scaffold and to assess whether cell seeding prior to implantation adds to the viability  regeneration and effective function of the kidneys  A recent systematic review and meta analysis compared the results of published animal studies and identified that improved outcomes are reported with the use of hybrid  mixed  scaffolds and cell seeding               however  the meta analysis of these results were not in agreement with the evaluation of descriptive results from the review  Therefore  further studies involving larger animals and novel scaffolds  and more transparent reproduction of previous studies are advisable 

Biomimetics edit 
Main article  Biomimetics
This section s tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on Wikipedia  See Wikipedia s guide to writing better articles for suggestions    December        Learn how and when to remove this message 
Biomimetics is a field that aims to produce materials and systems that replicate those present in nature               In the context of tissue engineering  this is a common approach used by engineers to create materials for these applications that are comparable to native tissues in terms of their structure  properties  and biocompatibility  Material properties are largely dependent on physical  structural  and chemical characteristics of that material  Subsequently  a biomimetic approach to system design will become significant in material integration  and a sufficient understanding of biological processes and interactions will be necessary  Replication of biological systems and processes may also be used in the synthesis of bio inspired materials to achieve conditions that produce the desired biological material  Therefore  if a material is synthesized having the same characteristics of biological tissues both structurally and chemically  then ideally the synthesized material will have similar properties  This technique has an extensive history originating from the idea of using natural phenomenon as design inspiration for solutions to human problems  Many modern advancements in technology have been inspired by nature and natural systems  including aircraft  automobiles  architecture  and even industrial systems  Advancements in nanotechnology initiated the application of this technique to micro  and nano scale problems  including tissue engineering  This technique has been used to develop synthetic bone tissues  vascular technologies  scaffolding materials and integration techniques  and functionalized nanoparticles              

Constructing neural networks in soft material edit 
In       scientists at Brandeis University reported their research on soft material embedded with chemical networks which can mimic the smooth and coordinated behavior of neural tissue  This research was funded by the U S  Army Research Laboratory               The researchers presented an experimental system of neural networks  theoretically modeled as reaction diffusion systems  Within the networks was an array of patterned reactors  each performing the Belousov Zhabotinsky  BZ  reaction  These reactors could function on a nanoliter scale              
The researchers state that the inspiration for their project was the movement of the blue ribbon eel  The eel s movements are controlled by electrical impulses determined by a class of neural networks called the central pattern generator        Central Pattern Generators function within the autonomic nervous system to control bodily functions such as respiration  movement  and peristalsis              
Qualities of the reactor that were designed were the network topology  boundary conditions  initial conditions  reactor volume  coupling strength  and the synaptic polarity of the reactor  whether its behavior is inhibitory or excitatory                A BZ emulsion system with a solid elastomer polydimethylsiloxane  PDMS  was designed  Both light and bromine permeable PDMS have been reported as viable methods to create a pacemaker for neural networks              

Market edit 
The history of the tissue engineering market can be divided into three major parts  The time before the crash of the biotech market in the early     s  the crash and the time afterward 

Beginning edit 
Most early progress in tissue engineering research was done in the US  This is due to less strict regulations regarding stem cell research and more available funding than in other countries  This leads to the creation of academic startups many of them coming from Harvard or MIT  Examples are BioHybrid Technologies whose founder  Bill Chick  went to Harvard Medical School and focused on the creation of artificial pancreas  Another example would be Organogenesis Inc  whose founder went to MIT and worked on skin engineering products  Other companies with links to the MIT are TEI Biosciences  Therics and Guilford Pharmaceuticals             The renewed interest in biotechnologies in the     s leads to many private investors investing in these new technologies even though the business models of these early startups were often not very clear and did not present a path to long term profitability               Government sponsors were more restrained in their funding as tissue engineering was considered a high risk investment            
In the UK the market got off to a slower start even though the regulations on stem cell research were not strict as well  This is mainly due to more investors being less willing to invest in these new technologies which were considered to be high risk investments               Another problem faced by British companies was getting the NHS to pay for their products  This especially because the NHS runs a cost effectiveness analysis on all supported products  Novel technologies often do not do well in this respect              
In Japan  the regulatory situation was quite different  First cell cultivation was only allowed in a hospital setting and second academic scientists employed by state owned universities were not allowed outside employment until       Moreover  the Japanese authorities took longer to approve new drugs and treatments than there US and European counterparts              
For these reasons in the early days of the Japanese market  the focus was mainly on getting products that were already approved elsewhere in Japan and selling them  Contrary to the US market the early actors in Japan were mainly big firms or sub companies of such big firms  such as J TEC  Menicon and Terumo  and not small startups               After regulatory changes in       which allowed cell cultivation outside of a hospital setting  the speed of research in Japan increased and Japanese companies also started to develop their own products              

Crash edit 
Soon after the big boom  the first problems started to appear  There were problems getting products approved by the FDA and if they got approved there were often difficulties in getting insurance providers to pay for the products and getting it accepted by health care providers                           
For example  organogenesis ran into problems marketing its product and integrating its product in the health system  This partially due to the difficulties of handling living cells and the increased difficulties faced by physicians in using these products over conventional methods              
Another example would be Advanced Tissue Sciences Dermagraft skin product which could not create a high enough demand without reimbursements from insurance providers  Reasons for this were       price tag and the circumstance that Additionally Advanced Tissue Sciences struggled to get their product known by physicians              
The above examples demonstrate how companies struggled to make profit  This  in turn  lead investors to lose patience and stopping further funding  In consequence  several Tissue Engineering companies such as Organogenesis and Advanced Tissue Sciences filed for bankruptcy in the early     s  At this time  these were the only ones having commercial skin products on the market              

Reemergence edit 
The technologies of the bankrupt or struggling companies were often bought by other companies which continued the development under more conservative business models               Examples of companies who sold their products after folding were Curis              and Intercytex              
Many of the companies abandoned their long term goals of developing fully functional organs in favor of products and technologies that could turn a profit in the short run               Examples of these kinds of products are products in the cosmetic and testing industry 
In other cases such as in the case of Advanced Tissue Sciences  the founders started new companies              
In the     s the regulatory framework also started to facilitate faster time to market especially in the US as new centres and pathways were created by the FDA specifically aimed at products coming from living cells such as the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research              
The first tissue engineering products started to get commercially profitable in the     s              

Regulation edit 
In Europe  regulation is currently split into three areas of regulation  medical devices  medicinal products  and biologics  Tissue engineering products are often of hybrid nature  as they are often composed of cells and a supporting structure  While some products can be approved as medicinal products  others need to gain approval as medical devices               Derksen explains in her thesis that tissue engineering researchers are sometimes confronted with regulation that does not fit the characteristics of tissue engineering              
New regulatory regimes have been observed in Europe that tackle these issues               An explanation for the difficulties in finding regulatory consensus in this matter is given by a survey conducted in the UK               The authors attribute these problems to the close relatedness and overlap with other technologies such as xenotransplantation  It can therefore not be handled separately by regulatory bodies               Regulation is further complicated by the ethical controversies associated with this and related fields of research  e g  stem cells controversy  ethics of organ transplantation   The same survey as mentioned above              shows on the example of autologous cartilage transplantation that a specific technology can be regarded as  pure  or  polluted  by the same social actor 
Two regulatory movements are most relevant to tissue engineering in the European Union  These are Directive         EC on standards of quality and safety for the sourcing and processing of human tissues              which was adopted by the European Parliament in      and a proposed Human Tissue Engineered Products regulation  The latter was developed under the auspices of the European Commission DG Enterprise and presented in Brussels in
