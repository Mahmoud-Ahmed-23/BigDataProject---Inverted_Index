Joseph Weizenbaum    January          March       was a German American computer scientist and a professor at MIT  The Weizenbaum Award and the Weizenbaum Institute are named after him 


Life and career edit 
Born in Berlin  Germany to Jewish parents  he escaped Nazi Germany in January       immigrating with his family to the United States  He started studying mathematics in      at Wayne State University  in Detroit  Michigan  In       he interrupted his studies to serve in the U S  Army Air Corps as a meteorologist  having been turned down for cryptology work because of his  enemy alien  status  After the war  in       he returned to Wayne State  obtaining his B S  in Mathematics in       and his M S  in                            
Around       as a research assistant at Wayne  Weizenbaum worked on analog computers and helped create a digital computer  In       he worked for General Electric on ERMA  a computer system that introduced the use of the magnetically encoded fonts imprinted on the bottom border of checks  allowing automated check processing via magnetic ink character recognition  MICR   He published a short paper in Datamation in      entitled  How to Make a Computer Appear Intelligent  that described the strategy used in a Gomoku program that could beat novice players  
In      he took a position of associate professor at MIT on the strength of his SLIP  Symmetric List Processing  software   Within four years  he had been awarded tenure and a full professorship in computer science and engineering  in                   In addition to working at MIT  Weizenbaum held academic appointments at Harvard  Stanford  the University of Bremen  and other universities            

Psychology simulation at MIT edit 
In       he published a comparatively simple program called ELIZA  named after the ing nue in George Bernard Shaw s Pygmalion  which could chat to the user             ELIZA was written in the SLIP programming language of Weizenbaum s own creation  The program applied pattern matching rules to statements to figure out its replies   Programs like this are now called chatbots   Driven by a script named DOCTOR  it was capable of engaging humans in a conversation which bore a striking resemblance to one with an empathic psychologist  Weizenbaum modeled its conversational style after Carl Rogers  who introduced the use of open ended questions to encourage patients to communicate more effectively with therapists  He was shocked that his program was taken seriously by many users  who would open their hearts to it              Famously  when he was observing his secretary using the software   who was aware that it was a simulation   she asked Weizenbaum   would you mind leaving the room please              Many hailed the program as a forerunner of thinking machines  a misguided interpretation that Weizenbaum s later writing would attempt to correct            

Apprehensions about computers and artificial intelligence edit 
He started to think philosophically about the implications of artificial intelligence and later became one of its leading critics             In an interview with MIT s The Tech  Weizenbaum elaborated on his fears  expanding them beyond the realm of mere artificial intelligence  explaining that his fears for society and the future of society were largely because of the computer itself  His belief was that the computer  at its most base level  is a fundamentally conservative force and that despite being a technological innovation  it would end up hindering social progress  Weizenbaum used his experience working with Bank of America as justification for his reasoning  saying that the computer allowed banks to deal with an ever expanding number of checks in play that otherwise would have forced drastic changes to banking organization such as decentralization  As such  although the computer allowed the industry to become more efficient  it prevented a fundamental re haul of the system            
Weizenbaum also worried about the negative effects computers would have with regards to the military  calling the computer  a child of the military   

Position on the military edit 
When asked about his belief that a computer science professional would more often than not end up working with defense  Weizenbaum detailed his position on the effect of rhetoric  specifically euphemism  on public viewpoints  He believed that the terms  the military  and  defense  did not accurately represent the organizations and their actions  He made it clear that he did not think of himself as a pacifist  believing that there are certainly times where arms are necessary  but by referring to defense as killings and bombings  humanity as a whole would be less inclined to embrace violent reactions so quickly            

Difference between deciding and choosing edit 
His influential      book Computer Power and Human Reason displays his ambivalence towards computer technology and lays out his case  the possibility of programming computers to perform one task or another that humans also perform  i e   whether Artificial Intelligence is achievable or not  is irrelevant to the question of whether computers can be put to a given task  Instead  Weizenbaum asserts that the definition of tasks and the selection of criteria for their completion is a creative act that relies on human values  which cannot come from computers             Weizenbaum makes the crucial distinction between deciding and choosing  Deciding is a computational activity  something that can ultimately be programmed  Choice  however  is the product of judgement  not calculation             In deploying computers to make decisions that humans once made  the agent doing so has made a choice based on their values that will have particular  non neutral consequences for the subjects who will experience the outcomes of the computerized decisions that the agent has instituted             

Personal life edit 
As of       Weizenbaum had five children  one son from his first marriage and four daughters from his second                         
In       Weizenbaum moved to Berlin and lived in the vicinity of his childhood neighborhood                        
Weizenbaum was buried at the Wei ensee Jewish cemetery in Berlin              A memorial service was held in Berlin on    March      

Legacy edit 
A German documentary film on Weizenbaum   Weizenbaum  Rebel at Work    was released in      and later dubbed in English              The documentary film Plug  amp  Pray on Weizenbaum and the ethics of artificial intelligence was released in                  
The interdisciplinary German Internet Institute  Weizenbaum Institute for the Networked Society  was named after Joseph Weizenbaum
