Edge detection includes a variety of mathematical methods that aim at identifying edges  defined as curves in a digital image at which the image brightness changes sharply or  more formally  has discontinuities  The same problem of finding discontinuities in one dimensional signals is known as step detection and the problem of finding signal discontinuities over time is known as change detection  Edge detection is a fundamental tool in image processing  machine vision and computer vision  particularly in the areas of feature detection and feature extraction            


Motivations edit 
Canny edge detection applied to a photograph
The purpose of detecting sharp changes in image brightness is to capture important events and changes in properties of the world 
It can be shown that under rather general assumptions for an image formation model  discontinuities in image brightness are likely to correspond to                       

discontinuities in depth 
discontinuities in surface orientation 
changes in material properties and
variations in scene illumination 
In the ideal case  the result of applying an edge detector to an image may lead to a set of connected curves that indicate the boundaries of objects  the boundaries of surface markings as well as curves that correspond to discontinuities in surface orientation 
Thus  applying an edge detection algorithm to an image may significantly reduce the amount of data to be processed and may therefore filter out information that may be regarded as less relevant  while preserving the important structural properties of an image 
If the edge detection step is successful  the subsequent task of interpreting the information contents in the original image may therefore be substantially simplified 
However  it is not always possible to obtain such ideal edges from real life images of moderate complexity 
Edges extracted from non trivial images are often hampered by fragmentation  meaning that the edge curves are not connected  missing edge segments as well as false edges not corresponding to interesting phenomena in the image   thus complicating the subsequent task of interpreting the image data            
Edge detection is one of the fundamental steps in image processing  image analysis  image pattern recognition  and computer vision techniques 

Edge properties edit 
The edges extracted from a two dimensional image of a three dimensional scene can be classified as either viewpoint dependent or viewpoint independent 
A viewpoint independent edge typically reflects inherent properties of the three dimensional objects  such as surface markings and surface shape 
A viewpoint dependent edge may change as the viewpoint changes  and typically reflects the geometry of the scene  such as objects occluding one another 
A typical edge might for instance be the border between a block of red color and a block of yellow  In contrast a line  as can be extracted by a ridge detector  can be a small number of pixels of a different color on an otherwise unchanging background  For a line  there may therefore usually be one edge on each side of the line 

A simple edge model edit 
Although certain literature has considered the detection of ideal step edges  the edges obtained from natural images are usually not at all ideal step edges  Instead they are normally affected by one or several of the following effects 

focal blur caused by a finite depth of field and finite point spread function 
penumbral blur caused by shadows created by light sources of non zero radius 
shading at a smooth object
A number of researchers have used a Gaussian smoothed step edge  an error function  as the simplest extension of the ideal step edge model for modeling the effects of edge blur in practical applications                       
Thus  a one dimensional image

Difficulty edit 
Outside of images with simple objects or featuring well controlled lighting  edge detection is not a trivial task  since it can be difficult to determine what threshold should be used to define an edge between two pixels             For example  in the following one dimensional signal  most would intuitively say there is an edge between the  th and  th pixels 




 

 

 

 

   

   

   
















However  if the intensity difference between the  th and the  th pixels were smaller  it would not be as easy to say that there should be an edge in the corresponding region  Similarly  if the intensity differences between the adjacent neighboring pixels were higher  one could argue that more than one edge should be considered to exist  or even none at all 




 

 

 

  

   

   

   
















Approaches edit 
There are many methods for edge detection  but most of them can be grouped into two categories  search based and zero crossing based 
The search based methods detect edges by first computing a measure of edge strength  usually a first order derivative expression such as the gradient magnitude  and then searching for local directional maxima of the gradient magnitude using a computed estimate of the local orientation of the edge  usually the gradient direction 
The zero crossing based methods search for zero crossings in a second order derivative expression computed from the image in order to find edges  usually the zero crossings of the Laplacian or the zero crossings of a non linear differential expression  As a pre processing step to edge detection  a smoothing stage  typically Gaussian smoothing  is almost always applied  see also noise reduction  
The edge detection methods that have been published mainly differ in the types of smoothing filters that are applied and the way the measures of edge strength are computed  As many edge detection methods rely on the computation of image gradients  they also differ in the types of filters used for computing gradient estimates in the x  and y directions 
A survey of a number of different edge detection methods can be found in  Ziou and Tabbone                   see also the encyclopedia articles on edge detection in Encyclopedia of Mathematics            and Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Engineering            

Canny edit 
Main article  Canny edge detector
John Canny considered the mathematical problem of deriving an optimal smoothing filter  given the criteria of detection  localization and minimizing multiple responses to a single edge             He showed that the optimal filter  given these assumptions  is a sum of four exponential terms  He also showed that this filter can be well approximated by first order derivatives of Gaussians 
Canny also introduced the notion of non maximum suppression  which means that  given the presmoothing filters  edge points are defined as points where the gradient magnitude assumes a local maximum in the gradient direction 
Looking for the zero crossing of the  nd derivative along the gradient direction was first proposed by Haralick            
It took less than two decades to find a modern geometric variational meaning for that operator  that links it to the Marr Hildreth  zero crossing of the Laplacian  edge detector 
That observation was presented by Ron Kimmel and Alfred Bruckstein             
Although his work was done in the early days of computer vision  the Canny edge detector  including its variations  is still a state of the art edge detector              Edge detectors that perform better than the Canny usually require longer computation times or a greater number of parameters 

Kovalevsky edit 
Vladimir A  Kovalevsky             has suggested a quite different approach  He uses a preprocessing of the image with the Sigma filter             and with a special filter for the dilution of the ramps  This method uses no brightness of the image but only the intensities of the color channels which is important for detecting an edge between two adjacent pixels of equal brightness but different colors  The method scans the image two times  first along the horizontal lines and second along the vertical columns  In each horizontal line six consequent adjacent pixels are considered and five color difference between each two adjacent pixels are calculated  Each color difference is the sum of absolute differences of the intensities of the color channels Red  Green  and Blue of the corresponding adjacent pixels  If this sum is greater than a given threshold  then the sign of the color difference is set equal to the sign of the difference of the green intensities  If the green difference is zero  then the sign of the color difference is set equal to the sign of the difference of the red intensities  If  however  both the green and the red differences are zero  then the sign of the color difference is set equal to the sign of the blue difference which in this case cannot be zero since the sum is greater than the threshold  
Certain conditions for the values and signs of the five color differences are specified in such way that if the conditions are fulfilled  then a short vertical stroke is put between the third and the fourth of the six pixels as the label of the edge 
Similar calculations are performed for the vertical columns  In this case a short horizontal stroke is put between the third and the fourth of the six subsequent pixels  The vertical and horizontal strokes  being the one dimensional cells of an abstract cell complex corresponding to the image  mostly compose a connected sequence representing the edge 
This method is robust and very fast and  what is more important  it can detect edges between adjacent pixels of equal brightness s if the color difference between these pixels is greater than the threshold 
The Canny Deriche detector was derived from similar mathematical criteria as the Canny edge detector  although starting from a discrete viewpoint and then leading to a set of recursive filters for image smoothing instead of exponential filters or Gaussian filters             
The differential edge detector described below can be seen as a reformulation of Canny s method from the viewpoint of differential invariants computed from a scale space representation leading to a number of advantages in terms of both theoretical analysis and sub pixel implementation  In that aspect  Log Gabor filter have been shown to be a good choice to extract boundaries in natural scenes             

Other first order methods edit 
Different gradient operators can be applied to estimate image gradients from the input image or a smoothed version of it  The simplest approach is to use central differences

Given such estimates of first order image derivatives  the gradient magnitude is then computed as

while the gradient orientation can be estimated as

Other first order difference operators for estimating image gradient have been proposed in the Prewitt operator  Roberts cross  Kayyali             operator and Frei Chen operator 
It is possible to extend filters dimension to avoid the issue of recognizing edge in low SNR image  The cost of this operation is loss in terms of resolution  Examples are Extended Prewitt     

Thresholding and linking edit 
Once we have computed a measure of edge strength  typically the gradient magnitude   the next stage is to apply a threshold  to decide whether edges are present or not at an image point  The lower the threshold  the more edges will be detected  and the result will be increasingly susceptible to noise and detecting edges of irrelevant features in the image   Conversely a high threshold may miss subtle edges  or result in fragmented edges 
If the edge is applied to just the gradient magnitude image  the resulting edges will in general be thick and some type of edge thinning post processing is necessary  For edges detected with non maximum suppression however  the edge curves are thin by definition and the edge pixels can be linked into edge polygon by an edge linking  edge tracking  procedure  On a discrete grid  the non maximum suppression stage can be implemented by estimating the gradient direction using first order derivatives  then rounding off the gradient direction to multiples of    degrees  and finally comparing the values of the gradient magnitude in the estimated gradient direction 
A commonly used approach to handle the problem of appropriate thresholds for thresholding is by using thresholding with hysteresis   This method uses multiple thresholds to find edges  We begin by using the upper threshold to find the start of an edge  Once we have a start point  we then trace the path of the edge through the image pixel by pixel  marking an edge whenever we are above the lower threshold   We stop marking our edge only when the value falls below our lower threshold  This approach makes the assumption that edges are likely to be in continuous curves  and allows us to follow a faint section of an edge we have previously seen  without meaning that every noisy pixel in the image is marked down as an edge  Still  however  we have the problem of choosing appropriate thresholding parameters  and suitable thresholding values may vary over the image 

Connectivity of gradients without using  high  magnitude thresholds edit 
This method finds connected set of pixels having a directional derivative magnitude larger than a fairly small threshold              It considers only presence of gradients instead of strength of gradients  After applying a dramatically small threshold  i e      a binary image is obtained  The morphological opening operation and the morphological closing operation are applied to the binary image to close gaps  Then  the distance transform operation is applied to the binary image to clear the pixels far from the background  so blob like shapes or other false labeled regions are deleted from the edge map  

Edge thinning edit 
Edge thinning is a technique used to remove the unwanted spurious points on the edges in an image  This technique is employed after the image has been filtered for noise  using median  Gaussian filter etc    the edge operator has been applied  like the ones described above  Canny or Sobel  to detect the edges and after the edges have been smoothed using an appropriate threshold value 
This removes all the unwanted points  and if applied carefully  results in one pixel thick edge elements 
Advantages 

Sharp and thin edges lead to greater efficiency in object recognition 
If Hough transforms are used to detect lines and ellipses  then thinning could give much better results 
If the edge happens to be the boundary of a region  then thinning could easily give the image parameters like perimeter without much algebra 
There are many popular algorithms used to do this  one such is described below 

Choose a type of connectivity  like      or   
  connectivity is preferred  where all the immediate pixels surrounding a particular pixel are considered 
Remove points from North  south  east and west 
Do this in multiple passes  i e  after the north pass  use the same semi processed image in the other passes and so on 
Remove a point if The point has no neighbors in the North  if you are in the north pass  and respective directions for other passes  The point is not the end of a line The point is isolated Removing the points will not cause to disconnect its neighbors in any way 
Otherwise  keep the point 
The number of passes across direction should be chosen according to the level of accuracy desired 

Second order approaches edit 
Some edge detection operators are instead based upon second order derivatives of the intensity   This essentially captures the rate of change in the intensity gradient  Thus  in the ideal continuous case  detection of zero crossings in the second derivative captures local maxima in the gradient 
The early Marr Hildreth operator is based on the detection of zero crossings of the Laplacian operator applied to a Gaussian smoothed image  It can be shown  however  that this operator will also return false edges corresponding to local minima of the gradient magnitude  Moreover  this operator will give poor localization at curved edges  Hence  this operator is today mainly of historical interest 

Differential edit 
A more refined second order edge detection approach which automatically detects edges with sub pixel accuracy  uses the following differential approach of detecting zero crossings of the second order directional derivative in the gradient direction 
Following the differential geometric way of expressing the requirement of non maximum suppression proposed by Lindeberg                         let us introduce at every image point a local coordinate system

Higher order derivatives for the third order sign condition can be obtained in an analogous fashion 

Phase congruency based edit 
A recent development in edge detection techniques takes a frequency domain approach to finding edge locations   Phase congruency  also known as phase coherence  methods attempt to find locations in an image where all sinusoids in the frequency domain are in phase   These locations will generally correspond to the location of a perceived edge  regardless of whether the edge is represented by a large change in intensity in the spatial domain   A key benefit of this technique is that it responds strongly to Mach bands  and avoids false positives typically found around roof edges  A roof edge  is a discontinuity in the first order derivative of a grey level profile             

Phase Stretch Transform  PST  edit 
 Feature enhancement in an image  St Paul s Cathedral  London  using Phase Stretch Transform  PST   Left panel shows the original image and the right panel shows the detected features using PST 
The phase stretch transform or PST is a physics inspired computational approach to signal and image processing  One of its utilities is for feature detection and classification                          PST is a spin off from research on the time stretch dispersive Fourier transform  PST transforms the image by emulating propagation through a diffractive medium with engineered  D dispersive property  refractive index   The operation relies on symmetry of the dispersion profile and can be understood in terms of dispersive eigenfunctions or stretch modes              PST performs similar functionality as phase contrast microscopy but on digital images  PST is also applicable to digital images as well as temporal  time series  data 

Subpixel edit 
To increase the precision of edge detection  several subpixel techniques had been proposed  including curve fitting  moment based                          reconstructive  and partial area effect methods              These methods have different characteristics  Curve fitting methods are computationally simple but are easily affected by noise  Moment based methods use an integral based approach to reduce the effect of noise  but may require more computations in some cases  Reconstructive methods use horizontal gradients or vertical gradients to build a curve and find the peak of the curve as the sub pixel edge  Partial area effect methods are based on the hypothesis that each pixel value depends on the area at both sides of the edge inside that pixel  producing accurate individual estimation for every edge pixel  Certain variants of the moment based technique have been shown to be the most accurate for isolated edges             Edge detection on an angiographic image  On the left  edge detection is made at a pixel level  On the right  subpixel edge detection locates the edge inside the pixel precisely 
The Marr Hildreth Edge Detector edit 
The Marr Hildreth edge detector             is distinguished by its use of the Laplacian of Gaussian  LoG  operator for edge detection in digital images  Unlike other edge detection methods  the LoG approach combines Gaussian smoothing with second derivative operations  allowing for simultaneous noise reduction and edge enhancement  The key advantage of this method lies in its ability to detect edges at various scales by adjusting the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel  enabling detection of fine details as well as broader transitions  Moreover  the technique leverages zero crossing detection on the LoG response to precisely locate edges  offering robustness against noise and maintaining edge continuity  This approach is particularly effective for detecting edges with clear boundaries in images while minimizing false positives due to noise  making it a valuable tool in computer vision applications where accurate edge localization is crucial
