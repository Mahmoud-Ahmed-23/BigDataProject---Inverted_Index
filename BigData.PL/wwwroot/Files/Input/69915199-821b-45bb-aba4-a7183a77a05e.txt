							DUBAI  Governments in Muslim nations in the Middle East and Asia are increasingly turning to Islamic finance to raise funds  giving a necessary but perhaps not sufficient shot in the arm for the    trillion industry  
Deeper liquidity is essential to winning investors back to the market after the credit crisis sapped demand and issuance and triggered the first ever major defaults of Islamic bonds  or sukuk  this year  
While government backing would allow international investors to gain exposure in the fast growing region via safer debt  it would highlight the risk of owning non sovereign sukuk from firms with weaker balance sheets in an industry where regulation is less advanced than in the conventional bond marketplace  Sukuk are structured as profit sharing or rental agreements and returns are derived from underlying assets because Islamic laws prohibit paying or earning interest  
Government involvement is just what the industry needs to avoid cutting off inflows from international investors after some defaults and a series of debt restructurings  
Dubai s state owned developer Nakheel is currently undergoing a restructuring of its      billion sukuk  due to mature in December  Prices had taken a hit last week on speculation its owner and government conglomerate Dubai World might offer equity to its Nakheel bond holders  
 I think without greater government help it s doomed anyway  Risk is just too high  But there is a lot more risk appetite from investors and definitely the government implication is a huge help   said Nathalia Barazal  fund manager at Lombard Odier Darier Hentsch  amp amp  Cie in Geneva  
 I wouldn t buy it unless it s a big company  good balance sheet   she said  adding that more government issuance might drive people away from debt from firms with weak fundamentals  
Barazal  who sold Nakheel s December sukuk less than a fortnight ago  said she would consider an exposure if it were from a safer issuer and the type of sukuk which was attractive  for example  exchangeable convertible bonds  
 I would definitely get involved in the region  I don t want to start with real estate        probably with exchangeable convertible bonds   she said  
So far this year  four out of five sukuk deals have been issued by sovereign or quasi sovereign entities  
Jordan is considering issuing its first ever sukuk this year to help fund its spiraling budget deficit  Indonesia s finance ministry is raising around      million from sukuk next week  while the Dubai government is kicking off a roadshow in London on Thursday to test investor appetite for bonds including sukuk  
Malaysia s sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional plans to sell US dollar exchangeable sukuk next year  It has raised some      million by issuing sukuk that were exchangeable into the shares of Hong Kong listed Parkson Retail Group  
Regulation 
Despite its earlier billing as a safer alternative to traditional banking due to its requirement for assets to underpin deals  Islamic bondholders have found they may not have any more legal safeguards than conventional counterparts in case of default  
The lack of a single regulatory framework and consensus on investment ratings as well as the debate over the definition of sukuk have prevented more investors from participating  
Scholars say the majority of sukuk adhere to Islamic principles only in form but not in substance as ownership rights are typically not transferred to sukuk investors  
Sheikh Muhammad Taqi Usmani  one of the prominent scholars who decides whether investment products adhere to Sharia law  ruled in late      that most sukuk did not comply with Islamic law as their repurchasing agreements at maturity violated the principle of sharing risks and returns  
 We cannot piggyback on the old system  you have to be courageous enough in quantifying the risk of Islamic assets   leading scholar Mohd Daud Bakar told Reuters last week  
Still  the Islamic finance industry is expected to grow       percent in the next three years  Standard  amp amp  Poor s estimates new sukuk issuance topped      billion in the first   months of      compared with       billion during the same period in       It says the issuance fell    percent to       billion in       
Governments  which themselves also want to promote the Islamic finance industry  are increasingly under pressure to raise debt to fund budget deficits or pay for infrastructure  For example  Saudi Arabia  the Gulf s biggest economy  is spending around      billion in the next five years mainly in infrastructure  
 It helps keep the market alive  International investors are still interested in sukuk and they still like the risk from the region  In diversifying the portfolio they need emerging markets   said Hussein Hassan  head of Islamic Finance at Deutsche Bank  
 However  the industry will not grow just on the back of sovereign issues  It s not sustainable  We will need to see corporates issuance back
