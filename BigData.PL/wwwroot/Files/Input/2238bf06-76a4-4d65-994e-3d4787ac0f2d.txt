Algorithmic transparency is the principle that the factors that influence the decisions made by algorithms should be visible  or transparent  to the people who use  regulate  and are affected by systems that employ those algorithms  Although the phrase was coined in      by Nicholas Diakopoulos and Michael Koliska about the role of algorithms in deciding the content of digital journalism services             the underlying principle dates back to the     s and the rise of automated systems for scoring consumer credit 
The phrases  algorithmic transparency  and  algorithmic accountability             are sometimes used interchangeably   especially since they were coined by the same people   but they have subtly different meanings  Specifically   algorithmic transparency  states that the inputs to the algorithm and the algorithm s use itself must be known  but they need not be fair    Algorithmic accountability  implies that the organizations that use algorithms must be accountable for the decisions made by those algorithms  even though the decisions are being made by a machine  and not by a human being            
Current research around algorithmic transparency interested in both societal effects of accessing remote services running algorithms              as well as mathematical and computer science approaches that can be used to achieve algorithmic transparency            In the United States  the Federal Trade Commission s Bureau of Consumer Protection studies how algorithms are used by consumers by conducting its own research on algorithmic transparency and by funding external research             In the European Union  the data protection laws that came into effect in May      include a  right to explanation  of decisions made by algorithms  though it is unclear what this means             Furthermore  the European Union founded The European Center for Algorithmic Transparency  ECAT
