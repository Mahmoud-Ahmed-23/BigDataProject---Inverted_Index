Lethal autonomous weapons  LAWs  are a type of autonomous military system that can independently search for and engage targets based on programmed constraints and descriptions  LAWs are also known as lethal autonomous weapon systems  LAWS   autonomous weapon systems  AWS   robotic weapons or killer robots  LAWs may operate in the air  on land  on water  underwater  or in space  The autonomy of systems as of          update      was restricted in the sense that a human gives the final command to attack though there are exceptions with certain  defensive  systems 


Being autonomous as a weapon edit 
Being  autonomous   has different meanings in different fields of study  In terms of military weapon development  the identification of a weapon as autonomous is not as clear as in other areas              The specific standard entailed in the concept of being autonomous can vary hugely between different scholars  nations and organizations 
The official United States Department of Defense Policy on Autonomy in Weapon Systems  defines an Autonomous Weapons Systems as   A weapon system that  once activated  can select and engage targets without further intervention by a human operator              Heather Roff  a writer for Case Western Reserve University School of Law  describes autonomous weapon systems as  armed weapons systems  capable of learning and adapting their  functioning in response to changing circumstances in the environment in which  they are  deployed   as well as capable of making firing decisions on their own             
The British Ministry of Defence defines autonomous weapon systems as  systems that are capable of understanding higher level intent and direction  From this understanding and its perception of its environment  such a system is able to take appropriate action to bring about a desired state  It is capable of deciding a course of action  from a number of alternatives  without depending on human oversight and control   such human engagement with the system may still be present  though  While the overall activity of an autonomous unmanned aircraft will be predictable  individual actions may not be             



An artificial agent which  at the very minimum  is able to change its own internal states to achieve a given goal  or set of goals  within its dynamic operating environment and without the direct intervention of another agent and may also be endowed with some abilities for changing its own transition rules without the intervention of another agent  and which is deployed with the purpose of exerting kinetic force against a physical entity  whether an object or a human being  and to this end is able to identify  select or attack the target without the intervention of another agent is an AWS  Once deployed  AWS can be operated with or without some forms of human control  in  on or out the loop   A lethal AWS is specific subset of an AWS with the goal of exerting kinetic force against human beings            



Scholars such as Peter Asaro and Mark Gubrud believe that any weapon system that is capable of releasing a lethal force without the operation  decision  or confirmation of a human supervisor can be deemed autonomous                       
As a result  the composition of a treaty between states requires a commonly accepted labeling of what exactly constitutes an autonomous weapon            

Automatic defensive systems edit 
The oldest automatically triggered lethal weapon is the land mine  used since at least the     s  and naval mines  used since at least the     s   Anti personnel mines are banned in many countries by the      Ottawa Treaty  not including the United States  Russia  and much of Asia and the Middle East 
Some current examples of LAWs are automated  hardkill  active protection systems  such as a radar guided CIWS systems used to defend ships that have been in use since the     s  e g   the US Phalanx CIWS   Such systems can autonomously identify and attack oncoming missiles  rockets  artillery fire  aircraft and surface vessels according to criteria set by the human operator  Similar systems exist for tanks  such as the Russian Arena  the Israeli Trophy  and the German AMAP ADS  Several types of stationary sentry guns  which can fire at humans and vehicles  are used in South Korea and Israel  Many missile defence systems  such as Iron Dome  also have autonomous targeting capabilities 
The main reason for not having a  human in the loop  in these systems is the need for rapid response  They have generally been used to protect personnel and installations against incoming projectiles 

Autonomous offensive systems edit 
According to The Economist  as technology advances  future applications of unmanned undersea vehicles might include mine clearance  mine laying  anti submarine sensor networking in contested waters  patrolling with active sonar  resupplying manned submarines  and becoming low cost missile platforms             In       the U S  Nuclear Posture Review alleged that Russia was developing a  new intercontinental  nuclear armed  nuclear powered  undersea autonomous torpedo  named  Status                
The Russian Federation is currently developing artificially intelligent missiles              drones              unmanned vehicles  military robots and medic robots                                                 
Israeli Minister Ayoob Kara stated in      that Israel is developing military robots  including ones as small as flies             
In October       Zeng Yi  a senior executive at the Chinese defense firm Norinco  gave a speech in which he said that  In future battlegrounds  there will be no people fighting   and that the use of lethal autonomous weapons in warfare is  inevitable               In       US Defense Secretary Mark Esper lashed out at China for selling drones capable of taking life with no human oversight             
The British Army deployed new unmanned vehicles and military robots in                  
The US Navy is developing  ghost  fleets of unmanned ships             

An STM Kargu drone
In      a Kargu   drone hunted down and attacked a human target in Libya  according to a report from the UN Security Council s Panel of Experts on Libya  published in March       This may have been the first time an autonomous killer robot armed with lethal weaponry attacked human beings                         
In May      Israel conducted an AI guided combat drone swarm attack in Gaza             
Since then there have been numerous reports of swarms and other autonomous weapons systems being used on battlefields around the world             
In addition  DARPA is working on making swarms of     autonomous lethal drones available to the American Military             

Ethical and legal issues edit 
Degree of human control edit 
Three classifications of the degree of human control of autonomous weapon systems were laid out by Bonnie Docherty in a      Human Rights Watch report             

human in the loop  a human must instigate the action of the weapon  in other words not fully autonomous  
human on the loop  a human may abort an action 
human out of the loop  no human action is involved 
Standard used in US policy edit 
Current US policy states   Autonomous   weapons systems shall be designed to allow commanders and operators to exercise appropriate levels of human judgment over the use of force                However  the policy requires that autonomous weapon systems that kill people or use kinetic force  selecting and engaging targets without further human intervention  be certified as compliant with  appropriate levels  and other standards  not that such weapon systems cannot meet these standards and are therefore forbidden               Semi autonomous  hunter killers that autonomously identify and attack targets do not even require certification               Deputy Defense Secretary Robert O  Work said in      that the Defense Department would  not delegate lethal authority to a machine to make a decision   but might need to reconsider this since  authoritarian regimes  may do so              In October      President Barack Obama stated that early in his career he was wary of a future in which a US president making use of drone warfare could  carry on perpetual wars all over the world  and a lot of them covert  without any accountability or democratic debate                           In the US  security related AI has fallen under the purview of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence since                               On October           the United States Department of Defense s Defense Innovation Board published the draft of a report outlining five principles for weaponized AI and making    recommendations for the ethical use of artificial intelligence by the Department of Defense that would ensure a human operator would always be able to look into the  black box  and understand the kill chain process  A major concern is how the report will be implemented             

Possible violations of ethics and international acts edit 
Stuart Russell  professor of computer science from University of California  Berkeley stated the concern he has with LAWs is that his view is that it is unethical and inhumane  The main issue with this system is it is hard to distinguish between combatants and non combatants             
There is concern by some economists             and legal scholars about whether LAWs would violate International Humanitarian Law  especially the principle of distinction  which requires the ability to discriminate combatants from non combatants  and the principle of proportionality  which requires that damage to civilians be proportional to the military aim              This concern is often invoked as a reason to ban  killer robots  altogether   but it is doubtful that this concern can be an argument against LAWs that do not violate International Humanitarian Law                                     
A      report by the American Congressional Research Service states that  there are no domestic or international legal prohibitions on the development of use of LAWs   although it acknowledges ongoing talks at the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons  CCW              
LAWs are said by some to blur the boundaries of who is responsible for a particular killing                          Philosopher Robert Sparrow argues that autonomous weapons are causally but not morally responsible  similar to child soldiers  In each case  he argues there is a risk of atrocities occurring without an appropriate subject to hold responsible  which violates jus in bello              Thomas Simpson and Vincent M ller argue that they may make it easier to record who gave which command              Potential IHL violations by LAWs are   by definition   only applicable in conflict settings that involve the need to distinguish between combatants and civilians  As such  any conflict scenario devoid of civilians  presence   i e  in space or the deep seas   would not run into the obstacles posed by IHL             

Campaigns to ban LAWs edit 
Rally on the steps of San Francisco City Hall  protesting against a vote to authorize police use of deadly force robots
The possibility of LAWs has generated significant debate  especially about the risk of  killer robots  roaming the earth   in the near or far future  The group Campaign to Stop Killer Robots formed in       In July       over       experts in artificial intelligence signed a letter warning of the threat of an artificial intelligence arms race and calling for a ban on autonomous weapons  The letter was presented in Buenos Aires at the   th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence  IJCAI     and was co signed by Stephen Hawking  Elon Musk  Steve Wozniak  Noam Chomsky  Skype co founder Jaan Tallinn and Google DeepMind co founder Demis Hassabis  among others                         
According to PAX For Peace  one of the founding organisations of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots   fully automated weapons  FAWs  will lower the threshold of going to war as soldiers are removed from the battlefield and the public is distanced from experiencing war  giving politicians and other decision makers more space in deciding when and how to go to war              They warn that once deployed  FAWs will make democratic control of war more difficult  something that author of Kill Decision  a novel on the topic  and IT specialist Daniel Suarez also warned about  according to him it might recentralize power into very few hands by requiring very few people to go to war             
There are websites     clarification needed      protesting the development of LAWs by presenting undesirable ramifications if research into the appliance of artificial intelligence to designation of weapons continues  On these websites  news about ethical and legal issues are constantly updated for visitors to recap with recent news about international meetings and research articles concerning LAWs             
The Holy See has called for the international community to ban the use of LAWs on several occasions  In November       Archbishop Ivan Jurkovic  the permanent observer of the Holy See to the United Nations  stated that  In order to prevent an arms race and the increase of inequalities and instability  it is an imperative duty to act promptly  now is the time to prevent LAWs from becoming the reality of tomorrow s warfare   The Church worries that these weapons systems have the capability to irreversibly alter the nature of warfare  create detachment from human agency and put in question the humanity of societies             
As of         March               update       the majority of governments represented at a UN meeting to discuss the matter favoured a ban on LAWs              A minority of governments  including those of Australia  Israel  Russia  the UK  and the US  opposed a ban              The United States has stated that autonomous weapons have helped prevent the killing of civilians             
In December       a vote of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors to authorize San Francisco Police Department use of LAWs drew national attention and protests                          The Board reversed this vote in a subsequent meeting             

No ban  but regulation edit 
A third approach focuses on regulating the use of autonomous weapon systems in lieu of a ban              Military AI arms control will likely require the institutionalization of new international norms embodied in effective technical specifications combined with active monitoring and informal   Track II   diplomacy by communities of experts  together with a legal and political verification process                                                  In       the United States Department of Defense requested a dialogue with the Chinese People s Liberation Army on AI enabled autonomous weapons but was refused             
A summit of    countries was held in      on the responsible use of AI in the military             
On    December       a United Nations General Assembly resolution was adopted to support international discussion regarding concerns about LAWs  The vote was     in favor  four against  and    abstentions
