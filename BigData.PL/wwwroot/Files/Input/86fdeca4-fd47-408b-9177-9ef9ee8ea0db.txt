Intel Corporation     note        is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara  California  and incorporated in Delaware             Intel designs  manufactures  and sells computer components such as CPUs and related products for business and consumer markets  It is considered one of the world s largest semiconductor chip manufacturers by revenue                       and ranked in the Fortune     list of the largest United States corporations by revenue for nearly a decade  from      to      fiscal years  until it was removed from the ranking in                  In       it was reinstated and ranked   th  being the  th largest technology company in the ranking  It was the first company listed on Nasdaq 
Intel supplies microprocessors for most manufacturers of computer systems  and is one of the developers of the x   series of instruction sets found in most personal computers  PCs   It also manufactures chipsets  network interface controllers  flash memory  graphics processing units  GPUs   field programmable gate arrays  FPGAs   and other devices related to communications and computing  Intel has a strong presence in the high performance general purpose and gaming PC market with its Intel Core line of CPUs  whose high end models are among the fastest consumer CPUs  as well as its Intel Arc series of GPUs  The Open Source Technology Center at Intel hosts PowerTOP and LatencyTOP  and supports other open source projects such as Wayland  Mesa  Threading Building Blocks  TBB   and Xen            
Intel was founded on July           by semiconductor pioneers Gordon Moore  of Moore s law  and Robert Noyce  along with investor Arthur Rock  and is associated with the executive leadership and vision of Andrew Grove             The company was a key component of the rise of Silicon Valley as a high tech center             as well as being an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips  which represented the majority of its business until       Although Intel created the world s first commercial microprocessor chip the Intel      in       it was not until the success of the PC in the early     s that this became its primary business 
During the     s  the partnership between Microsoft Windows and Intel  known as  Wintel   became instrumental in shaping the PC landscape                         and solidified Intel s position on the market  As a result  Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs in the mid to late     s  fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry  During this period  it became the dominant supplier of PC microprocessors  with a market share of                  and was known for aggressive and anti competitive tactics in defense of its market position  particularly against AMD  as well as a struggle with Microsoft for control over the direction of the PC industry                         

Since the     s and especially since the late     s  Intel has faced increasing competition  which has led to a reduction in Intel s dominance and market share in the PC market              Nevertheless  with a       market share as of       Intel still leads the x   market by a wide margin              In addition  Intel s ability to design and manufacture its own chips is considered a rarity in the semiconductor industry              as most chip designers do not have their own production facilities and instead rely on contract manufacturers  e g  TSMC  Foxconn and Samsung   as AMD and Nvidia do

Origins edit 
Andy Grove  Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore in     
Intel was incorporated in Mountain View  California  on July           by Gordon E  Moore  known for  Moore s law    a chemist  Robert Noyce  a physicist and co inventor of the integrated circuit  and Arthur Rock  an investor and venture capitalist                                      Moore and Noyce had left Fairchild Semiconductor  where they were part of the  traitorous eight  who founded it  There were originally         shares outstanding of which Noyce bought         shares  Moore         shares  and Rock        shares  all at    per share  Rock offered            of convertible debentures to a limited group of private investors  equivalent to     million in        convertible at    per share                          Just   years later  Intel became a public company via an initial public offering  IPO   raising      million         per share   Intel was the very first company to be listed on the then newly established National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System  NASDAQ               Intel s third employee was Andy Grove      note        a chemical engineer  who later ran the company through much of the     s and the high growth     s 
In deciding on a name  Moore and Noyce quickly rejected  Moore Noyce               near homophone for  more noise         an ill suited name for an electronics company  since noise in electronics is usually undesirable and typically associated with bad interference  Instead  they founded the company as NM Electronics on July           but by the end of the month had changed the name to Intel  which stood for Integrated Electronics      note        Since  Intel  was already trademarked by the hotel chain Intelco  they had to buy the rights for the name                         

Early history edit 
At its founding  Intel was distinguished by its ability to make logic circuits using semiconductor devices  The founders  goal was the semiconductor memory market  widely predicted to replace magnetic core memory  Its first product  a quick entry into the small  high speed memory market in       was the      Schottky TTL bipolar    bit static random access memory  SRAM   which was nearly twice as fast as earlier Schottky diode implementations by Fairchild and the Electrotechnical Laboratory in Tsukuba  Japan                          In the same year  Intel also produced the      Schottky bipolar      bit read only memory  ROM              and the first commercial metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor  MOSFET  silicon gate SRAM chip  the     bit                                          
While the      was a significant advance  its complex static cell structure made it too slow and costly for mainframe memories  The three transistor cell implemented in the first commercially available dynamic random access memory  DRAM   the      released in       solved these issues  The      was the bestselling semiconductor memory chip in the world by       as it replaced core memory in many applications                          Intel s business grew during the     s as it expanded and improved its manufacturing processes and produced a wider range of products  still dominated by various memory devices 

Federico Faggin  designer of the Intel     
Intel created the first commercially available microprocessor  the Intel       in                   The microprocessor represented a notable advance in the technology of integrated circuitry  as it miniaturized the central processing unit of a computer  which then made it possible for small machines to perform calculations that in the past only very large machines could do  Considerable technological innovation was needed before the microprocessor could become the basis of what was first known as a  mini computer  and then a  personal computer               Intel also created one of the first microcomputers in                              
Intel opened its first international manufacturing facility in       in Malaysia  which would host multiple Intel operations  before opening assembly facilities and semiconductor plants in Singapore and Jerusalem in the early     s  and manufacturing and development centers in China  India  and Costa Rica in the     s              By the early     s  its business was dominated by DRAM chips  However  increased competition from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers had  by       dramatically reduced the profitability of this market  The growing success of the IBM personal computer  based on an Intel microprocessor  was among factors that convinced Gordon Moore  CEO since       to shift the company s focus to microprocessors and to change fundamental aspects of that business model  Moore s decision to sole source Intel s     chip played into the company s continuing success 
By the end of the     s  buoyed by its fortuitous position as microprocessor supplier to IBM and IBM s competitors within the rapidly growing personal computer market  Intel embarked on    years of unprecedented growth as the primary and most profitable hardware supplier to the PC industry  part of the winning  Wintel  combination  Moore handed over his position as CEO to Andy Grove in       By launching its Intel Inside marketing campaign in       Intel was able to associate brand loyalty with consumer selection  so that by the end of the     s  its line of Pentium processors had become a household name 

Challenges to dominance      s  edit 
After       growth in demand for high end microprocessors slowed  Competitors  most notably AMD  Intel s largest competitor in its primary x   architecture market   garnered significant market share  initially in low end and mid range processors but ultimately across the product range  Intel s dominant position in its core market was greatly reduced              mostly due to the controversial NetBurst microarchitecture  In the early     s  then CEO  Craig Barrett attempted to diversify the company s business beyond semiconductors  but few of these activities were ultimately successful 

Litigation edit 
Bob had also been embroiled in litigation for several years  U S  law did not initially recognize intellectual property rights related to microprocessor topology  circuit layouts   until the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of       a law sought by Intel and the Semiconductor Industry Association  SIA               During the late     s and     s  after this law was passed   Intel also sued companies that tried to develop competitor chips to the       CPU              The lawsuits were noted to significantly burden the competition with legal bills  even if Intel lost the suits              Antitrust allegations had been simmering since the early     s and had been the cause of one lawsuit against Intel in       In      and       AMD brought further claims against Intel related to unfair competition 

Reorganization and success with Intel Core             edit 
In       CEO Paul Otellini reorganized the company to refocus its core processor and chipset business on platforms  enterprise  digital home  digital health  and mobility  
On June          Steve Jobs  then CEO of Apple  announced that Apple would be using Intel s x   processors for its Macintosh computers  switching from the PowerPC architecture developed by the AIM alliance              This was seen as a win for Intel              an analyst called the move  risky  and  foolish   as Intel s current offerings at the time were considered to be behind those of AMD and IBM             
In       Intel unveiled its Core microarchitecture to widespread critical acclaim  the product range was perceived as an exceptional leap in processor performance that at a stroke regained much of its leadership of the field                          In       Intel had another  tick  when it introduced the Penryn microarchitecture  fabricated using the         nm process node  Later that year  Intel released a processor with the Nehalem architecture to positive reception             
On June           the sale of Intel s XScale assets was announced  Intel agreed to sell the XScale processor business to Marvell Technology Group for an estimated           million and the assumption of unspecified liabilities  The move was intended to permit Intel to focus its resources on its core x   and server businesses  and the acquisition completed on November                     
In       Intel spun off key assets of a solar startup business effort to form an independent company  SpectraWatt Inc  In       SpectraWatt filed for bankruptcy             
In February       Intel began to build a new microprocessor manufacturing facility in Chandler  Arizona  completed in      at a cost of         billion              The building is now the         nm certified Fab    and is connected to the other Fabs              on Ocotillo Campus via an enclosed bridge known as the Link                                                  The company produces three quarters of its products in the United States  although three quarters of its revenue come from overseas             
The Alliance for Affordable Internet  A AI  was launched in October      and Intel is part of the coalition of public and private organizations that also includes Facebook  Google  and Microsoft  Led by Sir Tim Berners Lee  the A AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable to broaden access in the developing world  where only     of people are online  Google will help to decrease Internet access prices so that they fall below the UN Broadband Commission s worldwide target of    of monthly income             

Attempts at entering the smartphone market edit 
In April       Intel began a pilot project with ZTE Corporation to produce smartphones using the Intel Atom processor for China s domestic market  In December       Intel announced that it reorganized several of its business units into a new mobile and communications group             that would be responsible for the company s smartphone  tablet  and wireless efforts  Intel planned to introduce Medfield   a processor for tablets and smartphones   to the market in       as an effort to compete with Arm              As a    nanometer processor  Medfield is designed to be energy efficient  one of Arm s chips  core features             
Intel s partnership with Google was announced at the Intel Developers Forum  IDF       in San Francisco  In January       Google announced Android      supporting Intel s Atom microprocessor                                      In       Intel s Kirk Skaugen said that Intel s exclusive focus on Microsoft platforms was a thing of the past and that they would now support all  tier one operating systems  such as Linux  Android  iOS  and Chrome             
In       Intel cut thousands of employees in response to  evolving market trends               and offered to subsidize manufacturers for the extra costs involved in using Intel chips in their tablets  In April       Intel cancelled the SoFIA platform and the Broxton Atom SoC for smartphones                                                  effectively leaving the smartphone market                         

Intel custom foundry edit 
Finding itself with excess fab capacity after the failure of the Ultrabook to gain market traction and with PC sales declining  in      Intel reached a foundry agreement to produce chips for Altera using a         nm process  General Manager of Intel s custom foundry division Sunit Rikhi indicated that Intel would pursue further such deals in the future              This was after poor sales of Windows   hardware caused a major retrenchment for most of the major semiconductor manufacturers  except for Qualcomm  which continued to see healthy purchases from its largest customer  Apple             
As of July       five companies were using Intel s fabs via the Intel Custom Foundry division  Achronix  Tabula  Netronome  Microsemi  and Panasonic                  most are field programmable gate array  FPGA  makers  but Netronome designs network processors  Only Achronix began shipping chips made by Intel using the         nm Tri Gate process                          Several other customers also exist but were not announced at the time             
The foundry business was closed in      due to Intel s issues with its manufacturing                         

Security and manufacturing challenges             edit 
Intel continued its tick tock model of a microarchitecture change followed by a die shrink until the  th generation Core family based on the Skylake microarchitecture  This model was deprecated in       with the release of the  th generation Core family  codenamed Kaby Lake   ushering in the process architecture optimization model  As Intel struggled to shrink their process node from    nm to    nm  processor development slowed down and the company continued to use the Skylake microarchitecture until       albeit with optimizations             

   nm process node issues edit 
While Intel originally planned to introduce         nm products in       it later became apparent that there were manufacturing issues with the node              The first microprocessor under that node  Cannon Lake  marketed as  th generation Core   was released in small quantities in                               The company first delayed the mass production of their         nm products to                               They later delayed mass production to                   and then to       Despite rumors of the process being cancelled              Intel finally introduced mass produced         nm   th generation Intel Core mobile processors  codenamed  Ice Lake   in September                  
Intel later acknowledged that their strategy to shrink to         nm was too aggressive                          While other foundries used up to four steps in         nm or        nm processes  the company s         nm process required up to five or six multi pattern steps              In addition  Intel s         nm process is denser than its counterpart processes from other foundries                          Since Intel s microarchitecture and process node development were coupled  processor development stagnated             

Security flaws edit 
This section is an excerpt from Transient execution CPU vulnerability  edit 
Transient execution CPU vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities in which instructions  most often optimized using speculative execution  are executed temporarily by a microprocessor  without committing their results due to a misprediction or error  resulting in leaking secret data to an unauthorized party  The archetype is Spectre  and transient execution attacks like Spectre belong to the cache attack category  one of several categories of side channel attacks  Since January      many different cache attack vulnerabilities have been identified  In early January       it was reported that all Intel processors made since                               besides Intel Itanium and pre      Intel Atom  had been subject to two security flaws dubbed Meltdown and Spectre                         
Renewed competition and other developments       present  edit 
Due to Intel s issues with its         nm process node and the company s slow processor development              the company now found itself in a market with intense competition              The company s main competitor  AMD  introduced the Zen microarchitecture and a new chiplet based design to critical acclaim  Since its introduction  AMD  once unable to compete with Intel in the high end CPU market  has undergone a resurgence              and Intel s dominance and market share have considerably decreased               In addition  Apple began to transition away from the x   architecture and Intel processors to their own Apple silicon for their Macintosh computers in       The transition is expected to affect Intel minimally  however  it might prompt other PC manufacturers to reevaluate their reliance on Intel and the x   architecture                           

 IDM      strategy edit 
On March           CEO Pat Gelsinger laid out new plans for the company               These include a new strategy  called IDM      that includes investments in manufacturing facilities  use of both internal and external foundries  and a new foundry business called Intel Foundry Services  IFS   a standalone business unit                            Unlike Intel Custom Foundry  IFS will offer a combination of packaging and process technology  and Intel s IP portfolio including x   cores  Other plans for the company include a partnership with IBM and a new event for developers and engineers  called  Intel ON               Gelsinger also confirmed that Intel s        nm process is on track  and that the first products using their        nm process  also known as Intel    are Ponte Vecchio and Meteor Lake             
In January       Intel reportedly selected New Albany  Ohio  near Columbus  Ohio  as the site for a major new manufacturing facility               The facility will cost at least     billion               The company expects the facility to begin producing chips by                    The same year Intel also choose Magdeburg  Germany  as a site for two new chip mega factories for     billion  topping Tesla s investment in Brandenburg   The start of the construction was initially planned for       but this has been postponed to late       while the production start is scheduled for                    Including subcontractors  this would create        new jobs              
In August       Intel signed a          billion partnership with Brookfield Asset Management to fund its recent factory expansions  As part of the deal  Intel would have a controlling stake by funding     of the cost of building new chip making facilities in Chandler  Brookfield owns the remaining     stake  allowing the companies to split the revenue from those facilities                           
On January           as part of    billion in cost reductions  Intel announced pay cuts affecting employees above midlevel  ranging from    upwards  It also suspended bonuses and merit pay increases  reducing retirement plan matching  These cost reductions followed layoffs announced in the fall of                   
In October       Intel confirmed it would be the first commercial user of high NA EUV lithography tool  as part of its plan to regain process leadership from TSMC              
In December       Intel unveiled Gaudi   an artificial intelligence  AI  chip for generative AI software which will launch in          needs update      and compete with rival chips from Nvidia and AMD               On June          Intel announced AI chips for data centers  the Xeon   processor  aiming for better performance and power efficiency compared to its predecessor  Intel s Gaudi   and Gaudi   AI accelerators were revealed to be more cost effective than competitors  offerings  Additionally  Intel disclosed architecture details for its Lunar Lake processors for AI PCs               which were released on September           
In August       after posting      billion in losses for Q   Intel announced that it intends to cut        jobs to save     billion in                    In order to reach this goal  the company will offer early retirement and voluntary departure options              
On November          it was announced that Intel will drop out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average on November   prior to the stock market open  with Nvidia taking its place                           
In December       Intel s CEO Pat Gelsinger was ousted amid ongoing struggles to revitalize the company  which has seen a significant decline in stock value during his tenure  Gelsinger s resignation  effective December    followed a board meeting where directors expressed dissatisfaction with the slow progress of his ambitious turnaround strategy  Despite efforts to enhance Intel s manufacturing capabilities and compete with rivals like AMD and Nvidia  the company faced mounting challenges  including a       billion loss and a     drop in share prices since Gelsinger s appointment in       After his departure  Intel appointed David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus interim co CEOs while searching for a permanent successor  Gelsinger s exit underscored the turmoil at Intel as it grappled with its identity crisis and sought to regain its semiconductor industry position                                         
On March           Intel announced the appointment of Lip Bu Tan as their new CEO  effective March     after   months of having interim co CEOs

SRAMs  DRAMs  and the microprocessor edit 
Intel s first products were shift register memory and random access memory integrated circuits  and Intel grew to be a leader in the fiercely competitive DRAM  SRAM  and ROM markets throughout the     s  Concurrently  Intel engineers Marcian Hoff  Federico Faggin  Stanley Mazor  and Masatoshi Shima invented Intel s first microprocessor  Originally developed for the Japanese company Busicom to replace a number of ASICs in a calculator already produced by Busicom  the Intel      was introduced to the mass market on November           though the microprocessor did not become the core of Intel s business until the mid     s   Note  Intel is usually given credit with Texas Instruments for the almost simultaneous invention of the microprocessor  
In       at the dawn of the personal computer era  Intel s profits came under increased pressure from Japanese memory chip manufacturers  and then president Andy Grove focused the company on microprocessors  Grove described this transition in the book Only the Paranoid Survive  A key element of his plan was the notion  then considered radical  of becoming the single source for successors to the popular      microprocessor 
Until then  the manufacture of complex integrated circuits was not reliable enough for customers to depend on a single supplier  but Grove began producing processors in three geographically distinct factories      which       and ceased licensing the chip designs to competitors such as AMD               When the PC industry boomed in the late     s and     s  Intel was one of the primary beneficiaries 

Early x   processors and the IBM PC edit 
The die from an Intel       an   bit microcontroller that includes a CPU running at         MHz      bytes of RAM       bytes of EPROM  and I O in the same chip
Despite the ultimate importance of the microprocessor  the      and its successors the      and the      were never major revenue contributors at Intel 
In       the company had started a project to develop a highly advanced    bit microprocessor  finally released in      as the Intel iAPX      The project was too ambitious and the processor was never able to meet its performance objectives  and it failed in the marketplace   Intel eventually extended the x   architecture to    bits instead                            
As the next processor  the       and its variant the       was completed in       Intel embarked on a major marketing and sales campaign for that chip nicknamed  Operation Crush   and intended to win as many customers for the processor as possible  One design win was the newly created IBM PC division  though the importance of this was not fully realized at the time 
IBM introduced its personal computer in       and it was rapidly successful  In       Intel created the       microprocessor  which  two years later  was used in the IBM PC AT  Compaq  the first IBM PC  clone  manufacturer  produced a desktop system based on the faster       processor in      and in      quickly followed with the first       based system  beating IBM and establishing a competitive market for PC compatible systems and setting up Intel as a key component supplier 

    microprocessor edit 
During this period Andrew Grove dramatically redirected the company  closing much of its DRAM business and directing resources to the microprocessor business  Of perhaps greater importance was his decision to  single source  the     microprocessor  Prior to this  microprocessor manufacturing was in its infancy  and manufacturing problems frequently reduced or stopped production  interrupting supplies to customers  To mitigate this risk  these customers typically insisted that multiple manufacturers produce chips they could use to ensure a consistent supply  The      and      series microprocessors were produced by several companies  notably AMD  with which Intel had a technology sharing contract 

The     with the optional     co processor
Grove made the decision not to license the     design to other manufacturers  instead  producing it in three geographically distinct factories  Santa Clara  California  Hillsboro  Oregon  and Chandler  a suburb of Phoenix  Arizona  He convinced customers that this would ensure consistent delivery  In doing this  Intel breached its contract with AMD  which sued and was paid millions of dollars in damages but could not manufacture new Intel CPU designs any longer   Instead  AMD started to develop and manufacture its own competing x   designs  
As the success of Compaq s Deskpro     established the     as the dominant CPU choice  Intel achieved a position of near exclusive dominance as its supplier  Profits from this funded rapid development of both higher performance chip designs and higher performance manufacturing capabilities  propelling Intel to a position of unquestioned leadership by the early     s 

     Pentium  and Itanium edit 
Intel introduced the     microprocessor in       and in      established a second design team  designing the processors code named  P   and  P   in parallel and committing to a major new processor every two years  versus the four or more years such designs had previously taken  The P  project was earlier known as  Operation Bicycle   referring to the cycles of the processor through two parallel execution pipelines  The P  was introduced in      as the Intel Pentium  substituting a registered trademark name for the former part number   Numbers  such as      cannot be legally registered as trademarks in the United States   The P  followed in      as the Pentium Pro and improved into the Pentium II in       New architectures were developed alternately in Santa Clara  California and Hillsboro  Oregon 
The Santa Clara design team embarked in      on a successor to the x   architecture  codenamed  P    The first attempt was dropped a year later but quickly revived in a cooperative program with Hewlett Packard engineers  though Intel soon took over primary design responsibility  The resulting implementation of the IA       bit architecture was the Itanium  finally introduced in June       The Itanium s performance running legacy x   code did not meet expectations  and it failed to compete effectively with x       which was AMD s    bit extension of the    bit x   architecture  Intel uses the name Intel     previously EM  T   In       Intel announced that the Itanium      series  Kittson  would be the last Itanium chips produced                           
The Hillsboro team designed the Willamette processors  initially code named P     which were marketed as the Pentium   
During this period  Intel undertook two major supporting advertising campaigns  The first campaign  the       Intel Inside  marketing and branding campaign  is widely known and has become synonymous with Intel itself  The idea of  ingredient branding  was new at the time  with only NutraSweet and a few others making attempts to do so               One of the key architects of the marketing team was the head of the microprocessor division  David House               He coined the slogan  Intel Inside                This campaign established Intel  which had been a component supplier little known outside the PC industry  as a household name 
The second campaign  Intel s Systems Group  which began in the early     s  showcased manufacturing of PC motherboards  the main board component of a personal computer  and the one into which the processor  CPU  and memory  RAM  chips are plugged               The Systems Group campaign was lesser known than the Intel Inside campaign 
Shortly after  Intel began manufacturing fully configured  white box  systems for the dozens of PC clone companies that rapidly sprang up               At its peak in the mid     s  Intel manufactured over     of all PCs  making it the third largest supplier at the time      citation needed     
During the     s  Intel Architecture Labs  IAL  was responsible for many of the hardware innovations for the PC  including the PCI Bus  the PCI Express  PCIe  bus  and Universal Serial Bus  USB   IAL s software efforts met with a more mixed fate  its video and graphics software was important in the development of software digital video      citation needed      but later its efforts were largely overshadowed by competition from Microsoft  The competition between Intel and Microsoft was revealed in testimony by then IAL Vice president Steven McGeady at the Microsoft antitrust trial  United States v  Microsoft Corp   

Pentium flaw edit 
Main article  Pentium FDIV bug
In June       Intel engineers discovered a flaw in the floating point math subsection of the P  Pentium microprocessor  Under certain data dependent conditions  the low order bits of the result of a floating point division would be incorrect  The error could compound in subsequent calculations  Intel corrected the error in a future chip revision  and under public pressure it issued a total recall and replaced the defective Pentium CPUs  which were limited to some                 and          MHz models  on customer request 
The bug was discovered independently in October      by Thomas Nicely  Professor of Mathematics at Lynchburg College  He contacted Intel but received no response  On October     he posted a message about his finding on the Internet               Word of the bug spread quickly and reached the industry press  The bug was easy to replicate  a user could enter specific numbers into the calculator on the operating system  Consequently  many users did not accept Intel s statements that the error was minor and  not even an erratum   During Thanksgiving  in       The New York Times ran a piece by journalist John Markoff spotlighting the error  Intel changed its position and offered to replace every chip  quickly putting in place a large end user support organization  This resulted in a      million charge against Intel s      revenue               Nicely later learned that Intel had discovered the FDIV bug in its own testing a few months before him  but had decided not to inform customers               
The  Pentium flaw  incident  Intel s response to it  and the surrounding media coverage propelled Intel from being a technology supplier generally unknown to most computer users to a household name  Dovetailing with an uptick in the  Intel Inside  campaign  the episode is considered to have been a positive event for Intel  changing some of its business practices to be more end user focused and generating substantial public awareness  while avoiding a lasting negative impression              

Intel Core edit 
Main article  Intel Core
The Intel Core line originated from the original Core brand  with the release of the    bit Yonah CPU  Intel s first dual core mobile  low power  processor  Derived from the Pentium M  the processor family used an enhanced version of the P  microarchitecture  Its successor  the Core   family  was released on July           This was based on the Intel Core microarchitecture  and was a    bit design               Instead of focusing on higher clock rates  the Core microarchitecture emphasized power efficiency and a return to lower clock speeds               It also provided more efficient decoding stages  execution units  caches  and buses  reducing the power consumption of Core   branded CPUs while increasing their processing capacity 
In November       Intel released the  st generation Core processors based on the Nehalem microarchitecture  Intel also introduced a new naming scheme  with the three variants now named Core i   i   and i   as well as i  from  th generation onwards   Unlike the previous naming scheme  these names no longer correspond to specific technical features  It was succeeded by the Westmere microarchitecture in       with a die shrink to         nm and included Intel HD Graphics 
In       Intel released the Sandy Bridge based  nd generation Core processor family  This generation featured an     performance increase over Nehalem               It was succeeded by Ivy Bridge based  rd generation Core  introduced at the      Intel Developer Forum               Ivy Bridge featured a die shrink to    nm  and supported both DDR  memory and DDR L chips 
Intel continued its tick tock model of a microarchitecture change followed by a die shrink until the  th generation Core family based on the Skylake microarchitecture  This model was deprecated in       with the release of the  th generation Core family based on Kaby Lake  ushering in the process architecture optimization model               From      until       Intel later released more optimizations on the Skylake microarchitecture with Kaby Lake R  Amber Lake  Whiskey Lake  Coffee Lake  Coffee Lake R  and Comet Lake                                                      Intel struggled to shrink their process node from    nm to    nm  with the first microarchitecture under that node  Cannon Lake  marketed as  th generation Core   only being released in small quantities in                              
In       Intel released the   th generation of Core processors  codenamed  Amber Lake    Comet Lake   and  Ice Lake   Ice Lake  based on the Sunny Cove microarchitecture  was produced on the         nm process and was limited to low power mobile processors  Both Amber Lake and Comet Lake were based on a refined         nm node  with the latter being used for desktop and high performance mobile products and the former used for low power mobile products 
In September         th generation Core mobile processors  codenamed Tiger Lake  were launched               Tiger Lake is based on the Willow Cove microarchitecture and a refined         nm node               Intel later released   th generation Core desktop processors  codenamed  Rocket Lake    fabricated using Intel s         nm process and based on the Cypress Cove microarchitecture               on March                        It replaced Comet Lake desktop processors  All   th generation Core processors feature new integrated graphics based on the Intel Xe microarchitecture              
Both desktop and mobile products were unified under a single process node with the release of   th generation Intel Core processors  codenamed  Alder Lake   in late                                 This generation will be fabricated using Intel s         nm process  called Intel    for both desktop and mobile processors  and is based on a hybrid architecture utilizing high performance Golden Cove cores and high efficiency Gracemont  Atom  cores              

Transient execution CPU vulnerability edit 
This section is an excerpt from Transient execution CPU vulnerability  edit 
Transient execution CPU vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities in which instructions  most often optimized using speculative execution  are executed temporarily by a microprocessor  without committing their results due to a misprediction or error  resulting in leaking secret data to an unauthorized party  The archetype is Spectre  and transient execution attacks like Spectre belong to the cache attack category  one of several categories of side channel attacks  Since January      many different cache attack vulnerabilities have been identified

Further information  Mac transition to Intel processors
On June          Steve Jobs  then CEO of Apple  announced that Apple would be transitioning the Macintosh from its long favored PowerPC architecture to the Intel x   architecture because the future PowerPC road map was unable to satisfy Apple s needs                           This was seen as a win for Intel              although an analyst called the move  risky  and  foolish   as Intel s current offerings at the time were considered to be behind those of AMD and IBM              The first Mac computers containing Intel CPUs were announced on January           and Apple had its entire line of consumer Macs running on Intel processors by early August       The Apple Xserve server was updated to Intel Xeon processors from November      and was offered in a configuration similar to Apple s Mac Pro              
Despite Apple s use of Intel products  relations between the two companies were strained at times               Rumors of Apple switching from Intel processors to their own designs began circulating as early as                    On June           during Apple s annual WWDC  Tim Cook  Apple s CEO  announced that it would be transitioning the company s entire Mac line from Intel CPUs to custom Apple designed processors based on the Arm architecture over the course of the next two years  In the short term  this transition was estimated to have minimal effects on Intel  as Apple only accounted for    to    of its revenue  However  at the time it was believed that Apple s shift to its own chips might prompt other PC manufacturers to reassess their reliance on Intel and the x   architecture                            By November       Apple unveiled the M   its processor custom designed for the Mac

An Intel mSATA SSD
In       Intel began shipping mainstream solid state drives  SSDs  with up to          GB storage capacities               As with their CPUs  Intel develops SSD chips using ever smaller nanometer processes  These SSDs make use of industry standards such as NAND flash               mSATA               PCIe  and NVMe  In       Intel introduced SSDs based on  D XPoint technology under the Optane brand name              
In       SK Hynix acquired most of Intel s NAND memory business              for    billion  with a remaining transaction worth    billion expected in                    Intel also discontinued its consumer Optane products in                    In July       Intel disclosed in its Q  earnings report that it would cease future product development within its Optane business  which in turn effectively discontinued the development of  D XPoint as a whole              

Supercomputers edit 
The Intel Scientific Computers division was founded in      by Justin Rattner  to design and produce parallel computers based on Intel microprocessors connected in hypercube internetwork topology               In       the name was changed to the Intel Supercomputing Systems Division  and development of the iWarp architecture was also subsumed               The division designed several supercomputer systems  including the Intel iPSC    iPSC    iPSC      Paragon and ASCI Red  In November       Intel stated that it was planning to use optical fibers to improve networking within supercomputers              

Fog computing edit 
On November           Intel  alongside Arm  Dell  Cisco Systems  Microsoft  and Princeton University  founded the OpenFog Consortium  to promote interests and development in fog computing               Intel s Chief Strategist for the IoT Strategy and Technology Office  Jeff Fedders  became the consortium s first president              

Self driving cars edit 
Intel is one of the biggest stakeholders in the self driving car industry  having joined the race in mid                   after joining forces with Mobileye               The company is also one of the first in the sector to research consumer acceptance  after an AAA report quoted a     nonacceptance rate of the technology in the U S              
Safety levels of autonomous driving technology  the thought of abandoning control to a machine  and psychological comfort of passengers in such situations were the major discussion topics initially  The commuters also stated that they did not want to see everything the car was doing  This was primarily a referral to the auto steering wheel with no one sitting in the driving seat  Intel also learned that voice control regulator is vital  and the interface between the humans and machine eases the discomfort condition  and brings some sense of control back               It is important to mention that Intel included only    people in this study  which makes the study less credible               In a video posted on YouTube               Intel accepted this fact and called for further testing 

Programmable devices edit 
Intel formed a new business unit called the Programmable Solutions Group  PSG  on completion of its Altera acquisition               Intel has since sold Stratix  Arria  and Cyclone FPGAs  In       Intel released Agilex FPGAs  chips aimed at data centers   G applications  and other uses              
In October       Intel announced it would be spinning off PSG into a separate company at the start of       while maintaining majority ownership

By the end of the     s  microprocessor performance had outstripped software demand for that CPU power      citation needed      Aside from high end server systems and software  whose demand dropped with the end of the  dot com bubble                consumer systems ran effectively on increasingly low cost systems after      
Intel s strategy was to develop processors with better performance in a short time  from the appearance of one to the other  as seen with the appearance of the Pentium II in May       the Pentium III in February       and the Pentium   in the fall of       making the strategy ineffective since the consumer did not see the innovation as essential               and leaving an opportunity for rapid gains by competitors  notably AMD  This  in turn  lowered the profitability     citation needed      of the processor line and ended an era of unprecedented dominance of the PC hardware by Intel      citation needed     
Intel s dominance in the x   microprocessor market led to numerous charges of antitrust violations over the years  including FTC investigations in both the late     s and in       and civil actions such as the      suit by Digital Equipment Corporation  DEC  and a patent suit by Intergraph  Intel s market dominance  at one time     when       it controlled over     of the market for    bit x   microprocessors  combined with Intel s own hardball legal tactics  such as its infamous     patent suit versus PC manufacturers               made it an attractive target for litigation  culminating in Intel agreeing to pay AMD       billion and grant them a perpetual patent cross license in      as well as several anti trust judgements in Europe  Korea  and Japan              
A case of industrial espionage arose in      that involved both Intel and AMD  Bill Gaede  an Argentine formerly employed both at AMD and at Intel s Arizona plant  was arrested for attempting in      to sell the i    and P  Pentium designs to AMD and to certain foreign powers               Gaede videotaped data from his computer screen at Intel and mailed it to AMD  which immediately alerted Intel and authorities  resulting in Gaede s arrest  Gaede was convicted and sentenced to    months in prison in June

In       Dell accounted for about     of Intel s total revenues  Lenovo accounted for     of total revenues  and HP Inc  accounted for     of total revenues               As of May       the U S  Department of Defense is another large customer for Intel                                                      In September       Intel reportedly qualified for as much as      billion in federal grants to make semiconductors for the Defense Department              

Market share edit 
According to IDC  while Intel enjoyed the biggest market share in both the overall worldwide PC microprocessor market         and the mobile PC microprocessor         in the second quarter of       the numbers decreased by      and      compared to the first quarter of                                
Intel s market share decreased significantly in the enthusiast market as of                    and they have faced delays for their         nm products  According to former Intel CEO Bob Swan  the delay was caused by the company s overly aggressive strategy for moving to its next node             

Historical market share edit 
In the     s  Intel was among the world s top ten sellers of semiconductors    th in                     Along with Microsoft Windows  it was part of the  Wintel  personal computer domination in the     s and early     s  In       Intel became the biggest semiconductor chip maker by revenue and held the position until      when Samsung Electronics surpassed it  but Intel returned to its former position the year after                            Other major semiconductor companies include TSMC  GlobalFoundries  Texas Instruments  ASML  STMicroelectronics  United Microelectronics Corporation  UMC   Micron  SK Hynix  Kioxia  and SMIC 

Major competitors edit 
Intel s competitors in PC chipsets included AMD  VIA Technologies  Silicon Integrated Systems  and Nvidia  Intel s competitors in networking include NXP Semiconductors  Infineon      needs update      Broadcom Limited  Marvell Technology Group and Applied Micro Circuits Corporation  and competitors in flash memory included Spansion  Samsung Electronics  Qimonda  Kioxia  STMicroelectronics  Micron  SK Hynix  and IBM 
The only major competitor in the x   processor market is AMD  with which Intel has had full cross licensing agreements since       each partner can use the other s patented technological innovations without charge after a certain time               However  the cross licensing agreement is canceled in the event of an AMD bankruptcy or takeover              
Some smaller competitors  such as VIA Technologies  produce low power x   processors for small factor computers and portable equipment  However  the advent of such mobile computing devices  in particular  smartphones  has led to a decline in PC sales               Since over     of the world s smartphones currently use processors cores designed by Arm  using the Arm instruction set  Arm has become a major competitor for Intel s processor market  Arm is also planning to make attempts at setting foot into the PC and server market  with Ampere and IBM each individually designing CPUs for servers and supercomputers               The only other major competitor in processor instruction sets is RISC V  which is an open source CPU instruction set  The major Chinese phone and telecommunications manufacturer Huawei has released chips based on the RISC V instruction set due to US sanctions against China              
Intel has been involved in several disputes regarding the violation of antitrust laws  which are noted below

Open source support edit 
Intel has a significant participation in the open source communities since                        self published source      For example  in      Intel released MIT licensed X org drivers for their integrated graphic cards of the i    family of chipsets  Intel released FreeBSD drivers for some networking cards               available under a BSD compatible license               which were also ported to OpenBSD               Binary firmware files for non wireless Ethernet devices were also released under a BSD licence allowing free redistribution               Intel ran the Moblin project until April           when they handed the project over to the Linux Foundation  Intel also runs the LessWatts org campaigns              
However  after the release of the wireless products called Intel Pro Wireless           BG     BG     ABG and     ABG in       Intel was criticized for not granting free redistribution rights for the firmware that must be included in the operating system for the wireless devices to operate               As a result of this  Intel became a target of campaigns to allow free operating systems to include binary firmware on terms acceptable to the open source community  Linspire Linux creator Michael Robertson outlined the difficult position that Intel was in releasing to open source  as Intel did not want to upset their large customer Microsoft               Theo de Raadt of OpenBSD also claimed that Intel is being  an Open Source fraud  after an Intel employee presented a distorted view of the situation at an open source conference               In spite of the significant negative attention Intel received as a result of the wireless dealings  the binary firmware  still has not gained a license compatible with free software principles              
Intel has also supported other open source projects such as Blender              and Open  D Engine              

Corporate identity edit 
Logo edit 
Logo historyApril      January        January         September        September         present
Throughout its history  Intel has had three logos 
The first Intel logo  introduced in April       featured the company s name stylized in all lowercase  with the letter  e  dropped below the other letters  The second logo  introduced on January          was inspired by the  Intel Inside  campaign  featuring a swirl around the Intel brand name               The third logo  introduced on September          was inspired by the previous logos  It removes the swirl  redesign the style of the letters to form a refined symmetry  balance  and proportion  The dot on the  i  is the new visual identity  represents the potential and power of their processor                           

Intel Inside edit 
The  Intel Inside  logo used from      to     The  Intel Inside  logo used from      to     The  Intel Inside  logo used from      to     The  Intel Inside  logo used from      to     The current  Intel Inside  badge used since       also used as the umbrella branding to promote Intel s low end processors since     
Intel has become one of the world s most recognizable computer brands following its long running Intel Inside campaign               The idea for  Intel Inside  came out of a meeting between Intel and one of the major computer resellers  MicroAge              
In the late     s  Intel s market share was being seriously eroded by upstart competitors such as AMD  Zilog  and others who had started to sell their less expensive microprocessors to computer manufacturers  This was because  by using cheaper processors  manufacturers could make cheaper computers and gain more market share in an increasingly price sensitive market  In       Intel s Dennis Carter visited MicroAge s headquarters in Tempe  Arizona  to meet with MicroAge s VP of Marketing  Ron Mion  MicroAge had become one of the largest distributors of Compaq  IBM  HP  and others and thus was a primary                  although indirect                  driver of demand for microprocessors  Intel wanted MicroAge to petition its computer suppliers to favor Intel chips  However  Mion felt that the marketplace should decide which processors they wanted  Intel s counterargument was that it would be too difficult to educate PC buyers on why Intel microprocessors were worth paying more for              
Mion felt that the public did not really need to fully understand why Intel chips were better  they just needed to feel they were better  So Mion proposed a market test  Intel would pay for a MicroAge billboard somewhere saying   If you re buying a personal computer  make sure it has Intel inside   In turn  MicroAge would put  Intel Inside  stickers on the Intel based computers in their stores in that area  To make the test easier to monitor  Mion decided to do the test in Boulder  Colorado  where it had a single store  Virtually overnight  the sales of personal computers in that store dramatically shifted to Intel based PCs  Intel very quickly adopted  Intel Inside  as its primary branding and rolled it out worldwide               As is often the case with computer lore  other tidbits have been combined to explain how things evolved   Intel Inside  has not escaped that tendency and there are other  explanations  that had been floating around 
Intel s branding campaign started with  The Computer Inside  tagline in      in the U S  and Europe  The Japan chapter of Intel proposed an  Intel in it  tagline and kicked off the Japanese campaign by hosting EKI KON  meaning  Station Concert  in Japanese  at the Tokyo railway station dome on Christmas Day  December           Several months later   The Computer Inside  incorporated the Japan idea to become  Intel Inside  which eventually elevated to the worldwide branding campaign in       by Intel marketing manager Dennis Carter               A case study   Inside Intel Inside   was put together by Harvard Business School               The five note jingle was introduced in      and by its tenth anniversary was being heard in     countries around the world  The initial branding agency for the  Intel Inside  campaign was DahlinSmithWhite Advertising of Salt Lake City               The Intel swirl logo was the work of DahlinSmithWhite art director Steve Grigg under the direction of Intel president and CEO Andy Grove                   better      source      needed     
The Intel Inside advertising campaign sought public brand loyalty and awareness of Intel processors in consumer computers               Intel paid some of the advertiser s costs for an ad that used the Intel Inside logo and xylo marimba jingle              
In       Intel planned to shift the emphasis of its Intel Inside campaign from traditional media such as television and print to newer media such as the Internet               Intel required that a minimum of     of the money it provided to the companies in its co op program be used for online marketing               The Intel      annual financial report indicated that      billion     of the gross margin and nearly     of the total net income  was allocated to all advertising with Intel Inside being part of that              
In April       chief marketing officer Brett Hannath announced a new marketing campaign  That s the power of Intel Inside  to highlight the usage of Intel products across different markets and industries

In mid January       Intel announced that they were dropping the long running Pentium name from their processors  The Pentium name was first used to refer to the P  core Intel processors and was done to comply with court rulings that prevent the trademarking of a string of numbers  so competitors could not just call their processor the same name  as had been done with the prior     and     processors  both of which had copies manufactured by IBM and AMD   They phased out the Pentium names from mobile processors first  when the new Yonah chips  branded Core Solo and Core Duo  were released  The desktop processors changed when the Core   line of processors were released  By       Intel was using a good better best strategy with Celeron being good  Pentium better  and the Intel Core family representing the best the company has to offer              
According to spokesman Bill Calder  Intel has maintained only the Celeron brand  the Atom brand for netbooks and the vPro lineup for businesses  Since late       Intel s mainstream processors have been called Celeron  Pentium  Core i   Core i   Core i   and Core i  in order of performance from lowest to highest  The  st generation Core products carry a   digit name  such as i       and the  nd generation products carry a   digit name  such as the i        and from   th generation onwards  Intel processors will have a   digit name  such as i       K for desktop  In all cases  a  K  at the end of it shows that it is an unlocked processor  enabling additional overclocking abilities  for instance      K   vPro products will carry the Intel Core i  vPro processor or the Intel Core i  vPro processor name               In October       Intel started to sell its Core i      K  Sandy Bridge  chip to customers worldwide              
Since        Centrino  is only being applied to Intel s WiMAX and Wi Fi technologies              
In       Intel announced that they are dropping the Pentium and Celeron naming schemes for their desktop and laptop entry level processors  The  Intel Processor  branding will be replacing the old Pentium and Celeron naming schemes starting in                                

The since      batches of the Intel Core   and the higher end Intel Core Ultra   markings  They are direct successors to what has been known as the once flagship Intel Core i  
In       Intel announced that they will be dropping the  i  in their future processor markings  For example  products such as Core i   will now be called Core    Ultra will be added to the endings of processors that are in the higher end  such as Core Ultra

This section is an excerpt from Pentium FDIV bug  edit 
   MHz Intel Pentium  sSpec SX     with the FDIV bug
The Pentium FDIV bug is a hardware bug affecting the floating point unit  FPU  of the early Intel Pentium processors  Because of the bug  the processor would return incorrect binary floating point results when dividing certain pairs of high precision numbers  The bug was discovered in      by Thomas R  Nicely  a professor of mathematics at Lynchburg College  Missing values in a lookup table used by the FPU s floating point division algorithm led to calculations acquiring small errors  In certain circumstances the errors can occur frequently and lead to significant deviations 
Security vulnerabilities edit 
Transient execution CPU vulnerability edit 
This section is an excerpt from Transient execution CPU vulnerability  edit 
Transient execution CPU vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities in which instructions  most often optimized using speculative execution  are executed temporarily by a microprocessor  without committing their results due to a misprediction or error  resulting in leaking secret data to an unauthorized party  The archetype is Spectre  and transient execution attacks like Spectre belong to the cache attack category  one of several categories of side channel attacks  Since January      many different cache attack vulnerabilities have been identified 
Instability issues edit
