paired with step by step procedures  or algorithms  to solve problems effectively  Data structures manage how data is stored and accessed  while algorithms focus on processing this data  Why to Learn DSA Learning DSA boosts your problem solving abilities and make you a stronger programmer DSA is foundation for almost every software like GPS  Search Engines  AI ChatBots  Gaming Apps  Databases  Web Applications  etcTop Companies like Google  Microsoft  Amazon  Apple  Meta and many other heavily focus on DSA in interviews  Do you know the basics already and looking to prepare in limited time   Try our free course GfG     where we have     most asked problems along with well written editorials and video explanations  The course also has    bonus problems How to learn DSA Learn at least one programming language  C    Java  Python or JavaScript  and build your basic logic Learn about Time and Space complexitiesLearn Data Structures  Arrays  Linked List  etc  and Algorithms  Searching  Sorting  etc  Once you learn main topics  it is important to solve coding problems against some predefined test cases Solve problems daily using GfG POTD  weekly using GfG Weekly Contest and monthly using  GfG Job A Thon  Hoping you have learned a programming language of your choice  here comes the next stage of the roadmap   Learn about Time and Space Complexities    Logic BuildingOnce you have learned basics of a programming language  it is recommended that you learn basic logic buildingLogic Building Guide Quiz on Logic Building   Learn about ComplexitiesTo analyze algorithms  we mainly measure order of growth of time or space taken in terms of input size   We do this in the worst case scenario in most of the cases  Please refer the below links for a clear understanding of these concepts Complexity Analysis Guide  Quiz on Complexity Analysis   ArrayArray is a linear data structure where elements are allocated contiguous memory  allowing for constant time access  Array Data Structure GuideQuiz on Arrays   Searching AlgorithmsSearching algorithms are used to locate specific data within a large set of data  It helps find a target value within the data  There are various types of searching algorithms  each with its own approach and efficiency Searching Algorithms Guide Quiz on Searching   Sorting AlgorithmSorting algorithms are used to arrange the elements of a list in a specific order  such as numerical or alphabetical  It organizes the items in a systematic way  making it easier to search for and access specific elements Sorting Algorithms Guide Quiz on Sorting    HashingHashing is a technique that generates a fixed size output  hash value  from an input of variable size using mathematical formulas called hash functions  Hashing is commonly used in data structures for efficient searching  insertion and deletion Hashing Guide Quiz on Hashing   Two Pointer TechniqueIn Two Pointer Technique  we typically use two index variables from two corners of an array  We use the two pointer technique for searching a required point or value in an array Two Pointer TechniqueQuiz on Two Pointer Technique    Window Sliding TechniqueIn Window Sliding Technique  we use the result of previous subarray to quickly compute the result of current Window Sliding TechniqueQuiz on Sliding Window    Prefix Sum TechniqueIn Prefix Sum Technique  we compute prefix sums of an array to quickly find results for a subarray Prefix Sum Technique  Quiz on Prefix Sum    StringString is a sequence of characters  typically immutable and have limited set of elements  lower case or all English alphabets  Strings GuideQuiz on Strings    RecursionRecursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself within its own definition  It is usually used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem  Recursive Algorithms GuideQuiz on Recursion    Matrix GridMatrix is a two dimensional array of elements  arranged in rows and columns  It is represented as a rectangular grid  with each element at the intersection of a row and column Matrix GuideQuiz on Matrix Grid     Linked ListLinked list is a linear data structure that stores data in nodes  which are connected by pointers  Unlike arrays  nodes of linked lists are not stored in contiguous memory locations and can only be accessed sequentially  starting from the head of list Linked List GuideQuiz on Linked List    StackStack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In  First Out  LIFO  principle  Stacks play an important role in managing function calls  memory  and are widely used in algorithms like stock span problem  next greater element and largest area in a histogram Stack GuideQuiz on Stack    QueueQueue is a linear data structure that follows the First In  First Out  FIFO  principle  Queues play an important role in managing tasks or data in order  scheduling and message handling systems Queue GuideQuiz on Queue    DequeA deque  double ended queue  is a data structure that allows elements to be added or removed from both ends efficiently   Deque Guide Quiz on Deque    TreeTree is a non linear  hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges  with a top node called the root and nodes having child nodes  It is widely used in file systems  databases  decision making algorithms  etc Tree Data Structure GuideQuiz on Tree    HeapHeap is a complete binary tree data structure that satisfies the heap property  Heaps are usually used to implement priority queues  where the smallest or largest element is always at the root of the tree Heap GuideQuiz on Heap    GraphGraph is a non linear data structure consisting of a finite set of vertices or nodes  and a set of edges or links that connect a pair of nodes  Graphs are widely used to represent relationships between entities Graph Guide Quiz on Graph    Greedy AlgorithmGreedy Algorithm builds up the solution one piece at a time and chooses the next piece which gives the most obvious and immediate benefit i e   which is the most optimal choice at that moment  So the problems where choosing locally optimal also leads to the global solutions are best fit for Greedy Greedy Algorithms GuideQuiz on Greedy    Dynamic ProgrammingDynamic Programming is a method used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems  By solving each subproblem only once and storing the results  it avoids redundant computations  leading to more efficient solutions for a wide range of problems  Dynamic Programming GuideQuiz on DP    Other AlgorithmsBitwise Algorithms  Operate on individual bits of numbers Bitwise Algorithms Guide Quiz on Bit MagicBacktracking Algorithm   Follow Recursion  with the option to revert and traces back if the solution from current point is not feasible Backtracking Guide Quiz on BacktrackingDivide and conquer   A strategy to solve problems by dividing them into smaller subproblems  solving those subproblems  and combining the solutions to obtain the final solution Divide and Conquer GuideQuiz on Divide and ConquerBranch and Bound   Used in combinatorial optimization problems to systematically search for the best solution  It works by dividing the problem into smaller subproblems  or branches  and then eliminating certain branches based on bounds on the optimal solution  This process continues until the best solution is found or all branches have been explored Branch and Bound AlgorithmGeometric algorithms are a set of algorithms that solve problems related to shapes  points  lines and polygons Geometric AlgorithmsPractice Geometric AlgorithmsRandomized algorithms are algorithms that use randomness to solve problems  They make use of random input to achieve their goals  often leading to simpler and more efficient solutions  These algorithms may not product same result but are particularly useful in situations when a probabilistic approach is acceptable Randomized
