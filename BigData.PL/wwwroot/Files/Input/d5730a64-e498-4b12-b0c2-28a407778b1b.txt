Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interactions             It has applications in many fields of social science  and is used extensively in economics  logic  systems science and computer science             Initially  game theory addressed two person zero sum games  in which a participant s gains or losses are exactly balanced by the losses and gains of the other participant  In the     s  it was extended to the study of non zero sum games  and was eventually applied to a wide range of behavioral relations  It is now an umbrella term for the science of rational decision making in humans  animals  and computers 
Modern game theory began with the idea of mixed strategy equilibria in two person zero sum games and its proof by John von Neumann  Von Neumann s original proof used the Brouwer fixed point theorem on continuous mappings into compact convex sets  which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics  His paper was followed by Theory of Games and Economic Behavior         co written with Oskar Morgenstern  which considered cooperative games of several players             The second edition provided an axiomatic theory of expected utility  which allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision making under uncertainty 
Game theory was developed extensively in the     s  and was explicitly applied to evolution in the     s  although similar developments go back at least as far as the     s  Game theory has been widely recognized as an important tool in many fields  John Maynard Smith was awarded the Crafoord Prize for his application of evolutionary game theory in       and fifteen game theorists have won the Nobel Prize in economics as of       including most recently Paul Milgrom and Robert B  Wilson 


History edit 
Earliest results edit 
In       a letter attributed to Charles Waldegrave  an active Jacobite and uncle to British diplomat James Waldegrave  analyzed a game called  le her   Waldegrave provided a minimax mixed strategy solution to a two person version of the card game  and the problem is now known as the Waldegrave problem                       
In       Antoine Augustin Cournot provided a model of competition in oligopolies  Though he did not refer to it as such  he presented a solution that is the Nash equilibrium of the game in his Recherches sur les principes math matiques de la th orie des richesses  Researches into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth   In       Joseph Bertrand critiqued Cournot s model as unrealistic  providing an alternative model of price competition            which would later be formalized by Francis Ysidro Edgeworth            
In       Ernst Zermelo published  ber eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachspiels  On an Application of Set Theory to the Theory of the Game of Chess   which proved that the optimal chess strategy is strictly determined            

Foundation edit 
John von Neumann
The work of John von Neumann established game theory as its own independent field in the early to mid   th century  with von Neumann publishing his paper On the Theory of Games of Strategy in                              Von Neumann s original proof used Brouwer s fixed point theorem on continuous mappings into compact convex sets  which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics  Von Neumann s work in game theory culminated in his      book Theory of Games and Economic Behavior  co authored with Oskar Morgenstern              The second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory of utility  which reincarnated Daniel Bernoulli s old theory of utility  of money  as an independent discipline  This foundational work contains the method for finding mutually consistent solutions for two person zero sum games  Subsequent work focused primarily on cooperative game theory  which analyzes optimal strategies for groups of individuals  presuming that they can enforce agreements between them about proper strategies             
In his      book Applications aux Jeux de Hasard and earlier notes   mile Borel proved a minimax theorem for two person zero sum matrix games only when the pay off matrix is symmetric and provided a solution to a non trivial infinite game  known in English as Blotto game   Borel conjectured the non existence of mixed strategy equilibria in finite two person zero sum games  a conjecture that was proved false by von Neumann             

John Nash
In       John Nash developed a criterion for mutual consistency of players  strategies known as the Nash equilibrium  applicable to a wider variety of games than the criterion proposed by von Neumann and Morgenstern  Nash proved that every finite n player  non zero sum  not just two player zero sum  non cooperative game has what is now known as a Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies 
Game theory experienced a flurry of activity in the     s  during which the concepts of the core  the extensive form game  fictitious play  repeated games  and the Shapley value were developed  The     s also saw the first applications of game theory to philosophy and political science  The first mathematical discussion of the prisoner s dilemma appeared  and an experiment was undertaken by mathematicians Merrill M  Flood and Melvin Dresher  as part of the RAND Corporation s investigations into game theory  RAND pursued the studies because of possible applications to global nuclear strategy             

Prize winning achievements edit 
In       Reinhard Selten introduced his solution concept of subgame perfect equilibria  which further refined the Nash equilibrium  Later he would introduce trembling hand perfection as well  In      Nash  Selten and Harsanyi became Economics Nobel Laureates for their contributions to economic game theory 
In the     s  game theory was extensively applied in biology  largely as a result of the work of John Maynard Smith and his evolutionarily stable strategy  In addition  the concepts of correlated equilibrium  trembling hand perfection and common knowledge     a      were introduced and analyzed 
In       John Nash was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in the Economic Sciences for his contribution to game theory  Nash s most famous contribution to game theory is the concept of the Nash equilibrium  which is a solution concept for non cooperative games  published in       A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies  one for each player  such that no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy 
In       game theorists Thomas Schelling and Robert Aumann followed Nash  Selten  and Harsanyi as Nobel Laureates  Schelling worked on dynamic models  early examples of evolutionary game theory  Aumann contributed more to the equilibrium school  introducing equilibrium coarsening and correlated equilibria  and developing an extensive formal analysis of the assumption of common knowledge and of its consequences 
In       Leonid Hurwicz  Eric Maskin  and Roger Myerson were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics  for having laid the foundations of mechanism design theory   Myerson s contributions include the notion of proper equilibrium  and an important graduate text  Game Theory  Analysis of Conflict             Hurwicz introduced and formalized the concept of incentive compatibility 
In       Alvin E  Roth and Lloyd S  Shapley were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics  for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design   In       the Nobel went to game theorist Jean Tirole 

Different types of games edit 
See also  List of games in game theory
Cooperative   non cooperative edit 
Main articles  Cooperative game theory and Non cooperative game
A game is cooperative if the players are able to form binding commitments externally enforced  e g  through contract law   A game is non cooperative if players cannot form alliances or if all agreements need to be self enforcing  e g  through credible threats              
Cooperative games are often analyzed through the framework of cooperative game theory  which focuses on predicting which coalitions will form  the joint actions that groups take  and the resulting collective payoffs  It is different from non cooperative game theory which focuses on predicting individual players  actions and payoffs by analyzing Nash equilibria                         
Cooperative game theory provides a high level approach as it describes only the structure and payoffs of coalitions  whereas non cooperative game theory also looks at how strategic interaction will affect the distribution of payoffs  As non cooperative game theory is more general  cooperative games can be analyzed through the approach of non cooperative game theory  the converse does not hold  provided that sufficient assumptions are made to encompass all the possible strategies available to players due to the possibility of external enforcement of cooperation

An asymmetric game

Main article  Symmetric game
A symmetric game is a game where each player earns the same payoff when making the same choice  In other words  the identity of the player does not change the resulting game facing the other player              Many of the commonly studied     games are symmetric  The standard representations of chicken  the prisoner s dilemma  and the stag hunt are all symmetric games 
The most commonly studied asymmetric games are games where there are not identical strategy sets for both players  For instance  the ultimatum game and similarly the dictator game have different strategies for each player  It is possible  however  for a game to have identical strategies for both players  yet be asymmetric  For example  the game pictured in this section s graphic is asymmetric despite having identical strategy sets for both players

A zero sum game

Main article  Zero sum game
Zero sum games  more generally  constant sum games  are games in which choices by players can neither increase nor decrease the available resources  In zero sum games  the total benefit goes to all players in a game  for every combination of strategies  and always adds to zero  more informally  a player benefits only at the equal expense of others               Poker exemplifies a zero sum game  ignoring the possibility of the house s cut   because one wins exactly the amount one s opponents lose  Other zero sum games include matching pennies and most classical board games including Go and chess 
Many games studied by game theorists  including the famed prisoner s dilemma  are non zero sum games  because the outcome has net results greater or less than zero  Informally  in non zero sum games  a gain by one player does not necessarily correspond with a loss by another 
Furthermore  constant sum games correspond to activities like theft and gambling  but not to the fundamental economic situation in which there are potential gains from trade  It is possible to transform any constant sum game into a  possibly asymmetric  zero sum game by adding a dummy player  often called  the board   whose losses compensate the players  net winnings 

Simultaneous   sequential edit 
Main articles  Simultaneous game and Sequential game
Simultaneous games are games where both players move simultaneously  or instead the later players are unaware of the earlier players  actions  making them effectively simultaneous   Sequential games  a type of dynamic games  are games where players do not make decisions simultaneously  and player s earlier actions affect the outcome and decisions of other players              This need not be perfect information about every action of earlier players  it might be very little knowledge  For instance  a player may know that an earlier player did not perform one particular action  while they do not know which of the other available actions the first player actually performed 
The difference between simultaneous and sequential games is captured in the different representations discussed above  Often  normal form is used to represent simultaneous games  while extensive form is used to represent sequential ones  The transformation of extensive to normal form is one way  meaning that multiple extensive form games correspond to the same normal form  Consequently  notions of equilibrium for simultaneous games are insufficient for reasoning about sequential games  see subgame perfection 
In short  the differences between sequential and simultaneous games are as follows

Perfect information and imperfect information edit 
Main article  Perfect information
A game of imperfect information  The dotted line represents ignorance on the part of player    formally called an information set 
An important subset of sequential games consists of games of perfect information  A game with perfect information means that all players  at every move in the game  know the previous history of the game and the moves previously made by all other players  An imperfect information game is played when the players do not know all moves already made by the opponent such as a simultaneous move game              Examples of perfect information games include tic tac toe  checkers  chess  and Go                                     
Many card games are games of imperfect information  such as poker and bridge              Perfect information is often confused with complete information  which is a similar concept pertaining to the common knowledge of each player s sequence  strategies  and payoffs throughout gameplay              Complete information requires that every player know the strategies and payoffs available to the other players but not necessarily the actions taken  whereas perfect information is knowledge of all aspects of the game and players              Games of incomplete information can be reduced  however  to games of imperfect information by introducing  moves by nature              

Bayesian game edit 
Main article  Bayesian game
One of the assumptions of the Nash equilibrium is that every player has correct beliefs about the actions of the other players  However  there are many situations in game theory where participants do not fully understand the characteristics of their opponents  Negotiators may be unaware of their opponent s valuation of the object of negotiation  companies may be unaware of their opponent s cost functions  combatants may be unaware of their opponent s strengths  and jurors may be unaware of their colleague s interpretation of the evidence at trial  In some cases  participants may know the character of their opponent well  but may not know how well their opponent knows his or her own character             
Bayesian game means a strategic game with incomplete information  For a strategic game  decision makers are players  and every player has a group of actions  A core part of the imperfect information specification is the set of states  Every state completely describes a collection of characteristics relevant to the player such as their preferences and details about them  There must be a state for every set of features that some player believes may exist             

Example of a Bayesian game
For example  where Player   is unsure whether Player   would rather date her or get away from her  while Player   understands Player   s preferences as before  To be specific  supposing that Player   believes that Player   wants to date her under a probability of     and get away from her under a probability of      this evaluation comes from Player   s experience probably  she faces players who want to date her half of the time in such a case and players who want to avoid her half of the time   Due to the probability involved  the analysis  of this situation requires to understand the player s preference for the draw  even though people are only interested in pure strategic equilibrium 

Combinatorial games edit 
Games in which the difficulty of finding an optimal strategy stems from the multiplicity of possible moves are called combinatorial games  Examples include chess and Go  Games that involve imperfect information may also have a strong combinatorial character  for instance backgammon  There is no unified theory addressing combinatorial elements in games  There are  however  mathematical tools that can solve some particular problems and answer some general questions             
Games of perfect information have been studied in combinatorial game theory  which has developed novel representations  e g  surreal numbers  as well as combinatorial and algebraic  and sometimes non constructive  proof methods to solve games of certain types  including  loopy  games that may result in infinitely long sequences of moves  These methods address games with higher combinatorial complexity than those usually considered in traditional  or  economic   game theory                          A typical game that has been solved this way is Hex  A related field of study  drawing from computational complexity theory  is game complexity  which is concerned with estimating the computational difficulty of finding optimal strategies             
Research in artificial intelligence has addressed both perfect and imperfect information games that have very complex combinatorial structures  like chess  go  or backgammon  for which no provable optimal strategies have been found  The practical solutions involve computational heuristics  like alpha beta pruning or use of artificial neural networks trained by reinforcement learning  which make games more tractable in computing practice                         

Discrete and continuous games edit 
Much of game theory is concerned with finite  discrete games that have a finite number of players  moves  events  outcomes  etc  Many concepts can be extended  however  Continuous games allow players to choose a strategy from a continuous strategy set  For instance  Cournot competition is typically modeled with players  strategies being any non negative quantities  including fractional quantities 

Differential games edit 
Main article  Differential game
Differential games such as the continuous pursuit and evasion game are continuous games where the evolution of the players  state variables is governed by differential equations  The problem of finding an optimal strategy in a differential game is closely related to the optimal control theory  In particular  there are two types of strategies  the open loop strategies are found using the Pontryagin maximum principle while the closed loop strategies are found using Bellman s Dynamic Programming method 
A particular case of differential games are the games with a random time horizon              In such games  the terminal time is a random variable with a given probability distribution function  Therefore  the players maximize the mathematical expectation of the cost function  It was shown that the modified optimization problem can be reformulated as a discounted differential game over an infinite time interval 

Evolutionary game theory edit 
Main article  Evolutionary game theory
Evolutionary game theory studies players who adjust their strategies over time according to rules that are not necessarily rational or farsighted               In general  the evolution of strategies over time according to such rules is modeled as a Markov chain with a state variable such as the current strategy profile or how the game has been played in the recent past  Such rules may feature imitation  optimization  or survival of the fittest 
In biology  such models can represent evolution  in which offspring adopt their parents  strategies and parents who play more successful strategies  i e  corresponding to higher payoffs  have a greater number of offspring  In the social sciences  such models typically represent strategic adjustment by players who play a game many times within their lifetime and  consciously or unconsciously  occasionally adjust their strategies             

Stochastic outcomes  and relation to other fields  edit 
Individual decision problems with stochastic outcomes are sometimes considered  one player games   They may be modeled using similar tools within the related disciplines of decision theory  operations research  and areas of artificial intelligence  particularly AI planning  with uncertainty  and multi agent system  Although these fields may have different motivators  the mathematics involved are substantially the same  e g  using Markov decision processes  MDP              
Stochastic outcomes can also be modeled in terms of game theory by adding a randomly acting player who makes  chance moves    moves by nature                This player is not typically considered a third player in what is otherwise a two player game  but merely serves to provide a roll of the dice where required by the game 
For some problems  different approaches to modeling stochastic outcomes may lead to different solutions  For example  the difference in approach between MDPs and the minimax solution is that the latter considers the worst case over a set of adversarial moves  rather than reasoning in expectation about these moves given a fixed probability distribution  The minimax approach may be advantageous where stochastic models of uncertainty are not available  but may also be overestimating extremely unlikely  but costly  events  dramatically swaying the strategy in such scenarios if it is assumed that an adversary can force such an event to happen               See Black swan theory for more discussion on this kind of modeling issue  particularly as it relates to predicting and limiting losses in investment banking  
General models that include all elements of stochastic outcomes  adversaries  and partial or noisy observability  of moves by other players  have also been studied  The  gold standard  is considered to be partially observable stochastic game  POSG   but few realistic problems are computationally feasible in POSG representation             

Metagames edit 
These are games the play of which is the development of the rules for another game  the target or subject game  Metagames seek to maximize the utility value of the rule set developed  The theory of metagames is related to mechanism design theory 
The term metagame analysis is also used to refer to a practical approach developed by Nigel Howard              whereby a situation is framed as a strategic game in which stakeholders try to realize their objectives by means of the options available to them  Subsequent developments have led to the formulation of confrontation analysis 

Mean field game theory edit 
Main article  Mean field game theory
Mean field game theory is the study of strategic decision making in very large populations of small interacting agents  This class of problems was considered in the economics literature by Boyan Jovanovic and Robert W  Rosenthal  in the engineering literature by Peter E  Caines  and by mathematicians Pierre Louis Lions and Jean Michel Lasry 

Representation of games edit 
The games studied in game theory are well defined mathematical objects  To be fully defined  a game must specify the following elements  the players of the game  the information and actions available to each player at each decision point  and the payoffs for each outcome   Eric Rasmusen refers to these four  essential elements  by the acronym  PAPI                                                    A game theorist typically uses these elements  along with a solution concept of their choosing  to deduce a set of equilibrium strategies for each player such that  when these strategies are employed  no player can profit by unilaterally deviating from their strategy  These equilibrium strategies determine an equilibrium to the game a stable state in which either one outcome occurs or a set of outcomes occur with known probability 
Most cooperative games are presented in the characteristic function form  while the extensive and the normal forms are used to define noncooperative games 

Extensive form edit 
Main article  Extensive form game
An extensive form game
The extensive form can be used to formalize games with a time sequencing of moves  Extensive form games can be visualized using game trees  as pictured here   Here each vertex  or node  represents a point of choice for a player  The player is specified by a number listed by the vertex  The lines out of the vertex represent a possible action for that player  The payoffs are specified at the bottom of the tree  The extensive form can be viewed as a multi player generalization of a decision tree              To solve any extensive form game  backward induction must be used  It involves working backward up the game tree to determine what a rational player would do at the last vertex of the tree  what the player with the previous move would do given that the player with the last move is rational  and so on until the first vertex of the tree is reached             
The game pictured consists of two players   The way this particular game is structured  i e   with sequential decision making and perfect information   Player    moves  first by choosing either F or U  fair or unfair   Next in the sequence  Player    who has now observed Player       s move  can choose to play either A or R   accept or reject   Once Player   has made their choice  the game is considered finished and each player gets their respective payoff  represented in the image as two numbers  where the first number represents Player   s payoff  and the second number represents Player   s payoff   Suppose that Player   chooses U and then Player   chooses A  Player   then gets a payoff of  eight   which in real world terms can be interpreted in many ways  the simplest of which is in terms of money but could mean things such as eight days of vacation or eight countries conquered or even eight more opportunities to play the same game against other players  and Player   gets a payoff of  two  
The extensive form can also capture simultaneous move games and games with imperfect information  To represent it  either a dotted line connects different vertices to represent them as being part of the same information set  i e  the players do not know at which point they are   or a closed line is drawn around them   See example in the imperfect information section  

Normal form edit

Normal form or payoff matrix of a   player    strategy game

Main article  Normal form game
The normal  or strategic form  game is usually represented by a matrix which shows the players  strategies  and payoffs  see the example to the right   More generally it can be represented by any function that associates a payoff for each player with every possible combination of actions  In the accompanying example there are two players  one chooses the row and the other chooses the column  Each player has two strategies  which are specified by the number of rows and the number of columns  The payoffs are provided in the interior  The first number is the payoff received by the row player  Player   in our example   the second is the payoff for the column player  Player   in our example   Suppose that Player   plays Up and that Player   plays Left  Then Player   gets a payoff of    and Player   gets   
When a game is presented in normal form  it is presumed that each player acts simultaneously or  at least  without knowing the actions of the other  If players have some information about the choices of other players  the game is usually presented in extensive form 
Every extensive form game has an equivalent normal form game  however  the transformation to normal form may result in an exponential blowup in the size of the representation  making it computationally impractical             

Characteristic function form edit 
Main article  Cooperative game theory
In cooperative game theory the characteristic function lists the payoff of each coalition  The origin of this formulation is in John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern s book             
Formally  a characteristic function is a function 
  
    
      
        v
         
        
           
          
            N
          
        
          x     
        
          R
        
      
    
      displaystyle v    N  to  mathbb  R   
  
             from the set of all possible coalitions of players to a set of payments  and also satisfies 
  
    
      
        v
         
          x     
         
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle v  emptyset     
  
  The function describes how much collective payoff a set of players can gain by forming a coalition 

Alternative game representations edit 
See also  Succinct game
Alternative game representation forms are used for some subclasses of games or adjusted to the needs of interdisciplinary research              In addition to classical game representations  some of the alternative representations also encode time related aspects

As a method of applied mathematics  game theory has been used to study a wide variety of human and animal behaviors  It was initially developed in economics to understand a large collection of economic behaviors  including behaviors of firms  markets  and consumers  The first use of game theoretic analysis was by Antoine Augustin Cournot in      with his solution of the Cournot duopoly  The use of game theory in the social sciences has expanded  and game theory has been applied to political  sociological  and psychological behaviors as well             
Although pre twentieth century naturalists such as Charles Darwin made game theoretic kinds of statements  the use of game theoretic analysis in biology began with Ronald Fisher s studies of animal behavior during the     s  This work predates the name  game theory   but it shares many important features with this field  The developments in economics were later applied to biology largely by John Maynard Smith in his      book Evolution and the Theory of Games             
In addition to being used to describe  predict  and explain behavior  game theory has also been used to develop theories of ethical or normative behavior and to prescribe such behavior              In economics and philosophy  scholars have applied game theory to help in the understanding of good or proper behavior  Game theoretic approaches have also been suggested in the philosophy of language and philosophy of science              Game theoretic arguments of this type can be found as far back as Plato              An alternative version of game theory  called chemical game theory  represents the player s choices as metaphorical chemical reactant molecules called  knowlecules                     Chemical game theory then calculates the outcomes as equilibrium solutions to a system of chemical reactions 

Description and modeling edit 
A four stage centipede game
The primary use of game theory is to describe and model how human populations behave      citation needed      Some     who       scholars believe that by finding the equilibria of games they can predict how actual human populations will behave when confronted with situations analogous to the game being studied  This particular view of game theory has been criticized  It is argued that the assumptions made by game theorists are often violated when applied to real world situations  Game theorists usually assume players act rationally  but in practice  human rationality and or behavior often deviates from the model of rationality as used in game theory  Game theorists respond by comparing their assumptions to those used in physics  Thus while their assumptions do not always hold  they can treat game theory as a reasonable scientific ideal akin to the models used by physicists  However  empirical work has shown that in some classic games  such as the centipede game  guess     of the average game  and the dictator game  people regularly do not play Nash equilibria  There is an ongoing debate regarding the importance of these experiments and whether the analysis of the experiments fully captures all aspects of the relevant situation      b     
Some game theorists  following the work of John Maynard Smith and George R  Price  have turned to evolutionary game theory in order to resolve these issues  These models presume either no rationality or bounded rationality on the part of players  Despite the name  evolutionary game theory does not necessarily presume natural selection in the biological sense  Evolutionary game theory includes both biological as well as cultural evolution and also models of individual learning  for example  fictitious play dynamics

The prisoner s dilemma

Some scholars see game theory not as a predictive tool for the behavior of human beings  but as a suggestion for how people ought to behave  Since a strategy  corresponding to a Nash equilibrium of a game constitutes one s best response to the actions of the other players   provided they are in  the same  Nash equilibrium   playing a strategy that is part of a Nash equilibrium seems appropriate  This normative use of game theory has also come under criticism             


Economics edit 
Game theory is a major method used in mathematical economics and business for modeling competing behaviors of interacting agents      c                                          Applications include a wide array of economic phenomena and approaches  such as auctions  bargaining  mergers and acquisitions pricing              fair division  duopolies  oligopolies  social network formation  agent based computational economics                          general equilibrium  mechanism design                                                              and voting systems              and across such broad areas as experimental economics                                                              behavioral economics                                                                          information economics                                                  industrial organization                                                    and political economy                                                    
This research usually focuses on particular sets of strategies known as  solution concepts  or  equilibria   A common assumption is that players act rationally  In non cooperative games  the most famous of these is the Nash equilibrium  A set of strategies is a Nash equilibrium if each represents a best response to the other strategies  If all the players are playing the strategies in a Nash equilibrium  they have no unilateral incentive to deviate  since their strategy is the best they can do given what others are doing                           
The payoffs of the game are generally taken to represent the utility of individual players 
A prototypical paper on game theory in economics begins by presenting a game that is an abstraction of a particular economic situation  One or more solution concepts are chosen  and the author demonstrates which strategy sets in the presented game are equilibria of the appropriate type  Economists and business professors suggest two primary uses  noted above   descriptive and prescriptive             

Managerial economics edit 
Game theory also has an extensive use in a specific branch or stream of economics   Managerial Economics  One important usage of it in the field of managerial economics is in analyzing strategic interactions between firms               For example  firms may be competing in a market with limited resources  and game theory can help managers understand how their decisions impact their competitors and the overall market outcomes  Game theory can also be used to analyze cooperation between firms  such as in forming strategic alliances or joint ventures  Another use of game theory in managerial economics is in analyzing pricing strategies  For example  firms may use game theory to determine the optimal pricing strategy based on how they expect their competitors to respond to their pricing decisions  Overall  game theory serves as a useful tool for analyzing strategic interactions and decision making in the context of managerial economics 

Business edit 
The Chartered Institute of Procurement  amp  Supply  CIPS  promotes knowledge and use of game theory within the context of business procurement               CIPS and TWS Partners have conducted a series of surveys designed to explore the understanding  awareness and application of game theory among procurement professionals  Some of the main findings in their third annual survey        include 

application of game theory to procurement activity has increased   at the time it was at     across all survey respondents
    of participants predict that use of game theory applications will grow
    of respondents say that they have  only a basic or a below basic understanding  of game theory
    of participants had undertaken on the job training in game theory
    of respondents said that new or improved software solutions were desirable
    of respondents said that they do not have the software they need for their work              
Project management edit 
Sensible decision making is critical for the success of projects   In project management  game theory is used to model the decision making process of players  such as investors  project managers  contractors  sub contractors  governments and customers   Quite often  these players have competing interests  and sometimes their interests are directly detrimental to other players  making project management scenarios well suited to be modeled by game theory 
Piraveenan                     in his review provides several examples where game theory is used to model project management scenarios  For instance  an investor typically has several investment options  and each option will likely result in a different project  and thus one of the investment options has to be chosen before the project charter can be produced  Similarly  any large project involving subcontractors  for instance  a construction project  has a complex interplay between the main contractor  the project manager  and subcontractors  or among the subcontractors themselves  which typically has several decision points  For example  if there is an ambiguity in the contract between the contractor and subcontractor  each must decide how hard to push their case without jeopardizing the whole project  and thus their own stake in it  Similarly  when projects from competing organizations are launched  the marketing personnel have to decide what is the best timing and strategy to market the project  or its resultant product or service  so that it can gain maximum traction in the face of competition  In each of these scenarios  the required decisions depend on the decisions of other players who  in some way  have competing interests to the interests of the decision maker  and thus can ideally be modeled using game theory 
Piraveenan              summarizes that two player games are predominantly used to model project management scenarios  and based on the identity of these players  five distinct types of games are used in project management 

Government sector private sector games  games that model public private partnerships 
Contractor contractor games
Contractor subcontractor games
Subcontractor subcontractor games
Games involving other players
In terms of types of games  both cooperative as well as non cooperative  normal form as well as extensive form  and zero sum as well as non zero sum  are used to model various project management scenarios

The application of game theory to political science is focused in the overlapping areas of fair division  political economy  public choice  war bargaining  positive political theory  and social choice theory  In each of these areas  researchers have developed game theoretic models in which the players are often voters  states  special interest groups  and politicians              
Early examples of game theory applied to political science are provided by Anthony Downs  In his      book An Economic Theory of Democracy               he applies the Hotelling firm location model to the political process  In the Downsian model  political candidates commit to ideologies on a one dimensional policy space  Downs first shows how the political candidates will converge to the ideology preferred by the median voter if voters are fully informed  but then argues that voters choose to remain rationally ignorant which allows for candidate divergence  Game theory was applied in      to the Cuban Missile Crisis during the presidency of John F  Kennedy              
It has also been proposed that game theory explains the stability of any form of political government   Taking the simplest case of a monarchy  for example  the king  being only one person  does not and cannot maintain his authority by personally exercising physical control over all or even any significant number of his subjects   Sovereign control is instead explained by the recognition by each citizen that all other citizens expect each other to view the king  or other established government  as the person whose orders will be followed   Coordinating communication among citizens to replace the sovereign is effectively barred  since conspiracy to replace the sovereign is generally punishable as a crime                Thus  in a process that can be modeled by variants of the prisoner s dilemma  during periods of stability no citizen will find it rational to move to replace the sovereign  even if all the citizens know they would be better off if they were all to act collectively      citation needed     
A game theoretic explanation for democratic peace is that public and open debate in democracies sends clear and reliable information regarding their intentions to other states  In contrast  it is difficult to know the intentions of nondemocratic leaders  what effect concessions will have  and if promises will be kept  Thus there will be mistrust and unwillingness to make concessions if at least one of the parties in a dispute is a non democracy              
However  game theory predicts that two countries may still go to war even if their leaders are cognizant of the costs of fighting  War may result from asymmetric information  two countries may have incentives to mis represent the amount of military resources they have on hand  rendering them unable to settle disputes agreeably without resorting to fighting  Moreover  war may arise because of commitment problems  if two countries wish to settle a dispute via peaceful means  but each wishes to go back on the terms of that settlement  they may have no choice but to resort to warfare  Finally  war may result from issue indivisibilities              
Game theory could also help predict a nation s responses when there is a new rule or law to be applied to that nation  One example is Peter John Wood s        research looking into what nations could do to help reduce climate change  Wood thought this could be accomplished by making treaties with other nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  However  he concluded that this idea could not work because it would create a prisoner s dilemma for the nations              

Defence science and technology edit 
Game theory has been used extensively to model decision making scenarios relevant to defence applications                Most studies that has applied game theory in defence settings are concerned with Command and Control Warfare  and can be further classified into studies dealing with  i  Resource Allocation Warfare  ii  Information Warfare  iii  Weapons Control Warfare  and  iv  Adversary Monitoring Warfare                Many of the problems studied are concerned with sensing and tracking  for example a surface ship trying to track a hostile submarine and the submarine trying to evade being tracked  and the interdependent decision making that takes place with regards to bearing  speed  and the sensor technology activated by both vessels 
The tool               for example  automates the transformation of public vulnerability data into models  allowing defenders to synthesize optimal defence strategies through Stackelberg equilibrium analysis  This approach enhances cyber resilience by enabling defenders to anticipate and counteract attackers  best responses  making game theory increasingly relevant in adversarial cybersecurity environments 
Ho et al  provide a broad summary of game theory applications in defence  highlighting its advantages and limitations across both physical and cyber domains

Main article  Evolutionary game theory
Unlike those in economics  the payoffs for games in biology are often interpreted as corresponding to fitness  In addition  the focus has been less on equilibria that correspond to a notion of rationality and more on ones that would be maintained by evolutionary forces  The best known equilibrium in biology is known as the evolutionarily stable strategy  ESS   first introduced in  Maynard Smith  amp  Price        Although its initial motivation did not involve any of the mental requirements of the Nash equilibrium  every ESS is a Nash equilibrium 
In biology  game theory has been used as a model to understand many different phenomena  It was first used to explain the evolution  and stability  of the approximate     sex ratios   Fisher       suggested that the     sex ratios are a result of evolutionary forces acting on individuals who could be seen as trying to maximize their number of grandchildren 
Additionally  biologists have used evolutionary game theory and the ESS to explain the emergence of animal communication               The analysis of signaling games and other communication games has provided insight into the evolution of communication among animals  For example  the mobbing behavior of many species  in which a large number of prey animals attack a larger predator  seems to be an example of spontaneous emergent organization  Ants have also been shown to exhibit feed forward behavior akin to fashion  see Paul Ormerod s Butterfly Economics  
Biologists have used the game of chicken to analyze fighting behavior and territoriality              
According to Maynard Smith  in the preface to Evolution and the Theory of Games   paradoxically  it has turned out that game theory is more readily applied to biology than to the field of economic behaviour for which it was originally designed   Evolutionary game theory has been used to explain many seemingly incongruous phenomena in nature              
One such phenomenon is known as biological altruism  This is a situation in which an organism appears to act in a way that benefits other organisms and is detrimental to itself  This is distinct from traditional notions of altruism because such actions are not conscious  but appear to be evolutionary adaptations to increase overall fitness  Examples can be found in species ranging from vampire bats that regurgitate blood they have obtained from a night s hunting and give it to group members who have failed to feed  to worker bees that care for the queen bee for their entire lives and never mate  to vervet monkeys that warn group members of a predator s approach  even when it endangers that individual s chance of survival               All of these actions increase the overall fitness of a group  but occur at a cost to the individual 
Evolutionary game theory explains this altruism with the idea of kin selection  Altruists discriminate between the individuals they help and favor relatives  Hamilton s rule explains the evolutionary rationale behind this selection with the equation c  lt  b        r  where the cost c to the altruist must be less than the benefit b to the recipient multiplied by the coefficient of relatedness r  The more closely related two organisms are causes the incidences of altruism to increase because they share many of the same alleles  This means that the altruistic individual  by ensuring that the alleles of its close relative are passed on through survival of its offspring  can forgo the option of having offspring itself because the same number of alleles are passed on  For example  helping a sibling  in diploid animals  has a coefficient of            because  on average  an individual shares half of the alleles in its sibling s offspring  Ensuring that enough of a sibling s offspring survive to adulthood precludes the necessity of the altruistic individual producing offspring               The coefficient values depend heavily on the scope of the playing field  for example if the choice of whom to favor includes all genetic living things  not just all relatives  we assume the discrepancy between all humans only accounts for approximately    of the diversity in the playing field  a coefficient that was           in the smaller field becomes        Similarly if it is considered that information other than that of a genetic nature  e g  epigenetics  religion  science  etc   persisted through time the playing field becomes larger still  and the discrepancies smaller 

Computer science and logic edit 
Game theory has come to play an increasingly important role in logic and in computer science  Several logical theories have a basis in game semantics  In addition  computer scientists have used games to model interactive computations  Also  game theory provides a theoretical basis to the field of multi agent systems              
Separately  game theory has played a role in online algorithms  in particular  the k server problem  which has in the past been referred to as games with moving costs and request answer games               Yao s principle is a game theoretic technique for proving lower bounds on the computational complexity of randomized algorithms  especially online algorithms 
The emergence of the Internet has motivated the development of algorithms for finding equilibria in games  markets  computational auctions  peer to peer systems  and security and information markets  Algorithmic game theory             and within it algorithmic mechanism design             combine computational algorithm design and analysis of complex systems with economic theory                                        
Game theory has multiple applications in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning  It is often used in developing autonomous systems that can make complex decisions in uncertain environment               Some other areas of application of game theory in AI ML context are as follows   multi agent system formation  reinforcement learning               mechanism design etc               By using game theory to model the behavior of other agents and anticipate their actions  AI ML systems can make better decisions and operate more effectively

Game theory has been put to several uses in philosophy  Responding to two papers by W V O      Quine                    Lewis        used game theory to develop a philosophical account of convention  In so doing  he provided the first analysis of common knowledge and employed it in analyzing play in coordination games  In addition  he first suggested that one can understand meaning in terms of signaling games  This later suggestion has been pursued by several philosophers since Lewis                            Following Lewis        game theoretic account of conventions  Edna Ullmann Margalit        and Bicchieri        have developed theories of social norms that define them as Nash equilibria that result from transforming a mixed motive game into a coordination game                           
Game theory has also challenged philosophers to think in terms of interactive epistemology  what it means for a collective to have common beliefs or knowledge  and what are the consequences of this knowledge for the social outcomes resulting from the interactions of agents  Philosophers who have worked in this area include Bicchieri                                         Skyrms                      and Stalnaker                     
The synthesis of game theory with ethics was championed by R  B  Braithwaite               The hope was that rigorous mathematical analysis of game theory might help formalize the more imprecise philosophical discussions  However  this expectation was only materialized to a limited extent              
In ethics  some  most notably David Gauthier  Gregory Kavka  and Jean Hampton       who       authors have attempted to pursue Thomas Hobbes  project of deriving morality from self interest  Since games like the prisoner s dilemma present an apparent conflict between morality and self interest  explaining why cooperation is required by self interest is an important component of this project  This general strategy is a component of the general social contract view in political philosophy  for examples  see Gauthier        and Kavka              d     
Other authors have attempted to use evolutionary game theory in order to explain the emergence of human attitudes about morality and corresponding animal behaviors  These authors look at several games including the prisoner s dilemma  stag hunt  and the Nash bargaining game as providing an explanation for the emergence of attitudes about morality  see  e g   Skyrms                   and Sober     and     Wilson              

Epidemiology edit 
Since the decision to take a vaccine for a particular disease is often made by individuals  who may consider a range of factors and parameters in making this decision  such as the incidence and prevalence of the disease  perceived and real risks associated with contracting the disease   mortality rate  perceived and real risks associated with vaccination  and financial cost of vaccination   game theory has been used to model and predict vaccination uptake in a society

William Poundstone described the game in his      book Prisoner s Dilemma              
Two members of a criminal gang  A and B  are arrested and imprisoned  Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communication with their partner  The principal charge would lead to a sentence of ten years in prison  however  the police do not have the evidence for a conviction  They plan to sentence both to two years in prison on a lesser charge but offer each prisoner a Faustian bargain  If one of them confesses to the crime of the principal charge  betraying the other  they will be pardoned and free to leave while the other must serve the entirety of the sentence instead of just two years for the lesser charge 
The dominant strategy  and therefore the best response to any possible opponent strategy   is to betray the other  which aligns with the sure thing principle               However  both prisoners staying silent would yield a greater reward for both of them than mutual betrayal 

Battle of the sexes edit 
Main article  Battle of the sexes  game theory 
The  battle of the sexes  is a term used to describe the perceived conflict between men and women in various areas of life  such as relationships  careers  and social roles  This conflict is often portrayed in popular culture  such as movies and television shows  as a humorous or dramatic competition between the genders  This conflict can be depicted in a game theory framework  This is an example of non cooperative games 
An example of the  battle of the sexes  can be seen in the portrayal of relationships in popular media  where men and women are often depicted as being fundamentally different and in conflict with each other  For instance  in some romantic comedies  the male and female protagonists are shown as having opposing views on love and relationships  and they have to overcome these differences in order to be together              
In this game  there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria  one where both the players choose the same strategy and the other where the players choose different options  If the game is played in mixed strategies  where each player chooses their strategy randomly  then there is an infinite number of Nash equilibria  However  in the context of the  battle of the sexes  game  the assumption is usually made that the game is played in pure strategies              

Ultimatum game edit 
Main article  Ultimatum game
The ultimatum game is a game that has become a popular instrument of economic experiments  An early description is by Nobel laureate John Harsanyi in                   
One player  the proposer  is endowed with a sum of money  The proposer is tasked with splitting it with another player  the responder  who knows what the total sum is   Once the proposer communicates his decision  the responder may accept it or reject it  If the responder accepts  the money is split per the proposal  if the responder rejects  both players receive nothing   Both players know in advance the consequences of the responder accepting or rejecting the offer  The game demonstrates how social acceptance  fairness  and generosity influence the players decisions              
Ultimatum game has a variant  that is the dictator game  They are mostly identical  except in dictator game the responder has no power to reject the proposer s offer 

Trust game edit 
The Trust Game is an experiment designed to measure trust in economic decisions  It is also called  the investment game  and is designed to investigate trust and demonstrate its importance rather than  rationality  of self interest  The game was designed by Berg Joyce  John Dickhaut and Kevin McCabe in                   
In the game  one player  the investor  is given a sum of money and must decide how much of it to give to another player  the trustee   The amount given is then tripled by the experimenter  The trustee then decides how much of the tripled amount to return to the investor  If the recipient is completely self interested  then he she should return nothing  However that is not true as the experiment conduct  The outcome suggest that people are willing to place a trust  by risking some amount of money  in the belief that there would be reciprocity              

Cournot Competition edit 
Main article  Cournot competition
The Cournot competition model involves players choosing quantity of a homogenous product to produce independently and simultaneously  where marginal cost can be different for each firm and the firm s payoff is profit  The production costs are public information and the firm aims to find their profit maximizing quantity based on what they believe the other firm will produce and behave like monopolies  In this game firms want to produce at the monopoly quantity but there is a high incentive to deviate and produce more  which decreases the market clearing price              For example  firms may be tempted to deviate from the monopoly quantity if there is a low monopoly quantity and high price  with the aim of increasing production to maximize  profit              However this option does not provide the highest payoff  as a firm s ability to maximize profits depends on its market share and the elasticity of the market demand               The Cournot equilibrium is reached when each firm operates on their reaction function with no incentive to deviate  as they have the best response based on the other firms output              Within the game  firms reach the Nash equilibrium when the Cournot equilibrium is achieved    

Equilibrium for Cournot quantity competition
Bertrand Competition edit 
Main article  Bertrand competition
The Bertrand competition assumes homogenous products and a constant marginal cost and players choose the prices              The equilibrium of price competition is where the price is equal to marginal costs  assuming complete information about the competitors  costs  Therefore  the firms have an incentive to deviate from the equilibrium because a homogenous product with a lower price will gain all of the market share  known as a cost advantage              

In popular culture edit 
Based on the      book by Sylvia Nasar               the life story of game theorist and mathematician John Nash was turned into the      biopic A Beautiful Mind  starring Russell Crowe as Nash              
The      military science fiction novel Starship Troopers by Robert A  Heinlein mentioned  games theory  and  theory of games                In the      film of the same name  the character Carl Jenkins referred to his military intelligence assignment as being assigned to  games and theory  
The      film Dr  Strangelove satirizes game theoretic ideas about deterrence theory  For example  nuclear deterrence depends on the threat to retaliate catastrophically if a nuclear attack is detected  A game theorist might argue that such threats can fail to be credible  in the sense that they can lead to subgame imperfect equilibria  The movie takes this idea one step further  with the Soviet Union irrevocably committing to a catastrophic nuclear response without making the threat public              
The     s power pop band Game Theory was founded by singer songwriter Scott Miller  who described the band s name as alluding to  the study of calculating the most appropriate action given an adversary          to give yourself the minimum amount of failure
