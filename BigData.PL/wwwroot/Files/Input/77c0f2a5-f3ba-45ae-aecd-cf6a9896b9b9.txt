Marketing and customer service tool

Sentiment analysis  also known as opinion mining or emotion AI  is the use of natural language processing  text analysis  computational linguistics  and biometrics to systematically identify  extract  quantify  and study affective states and subjective information  Sentiment analysis is widely applied to voice of the customer materials such as reviews and survey responses  online and social media  and healthcare materials for applications that range from marketing to customer service to clinical medicine  With the rise of deep language models  such as RoBERTa  also more difficult data domains can be analyzed  e g   news texts where authors typically express their opinion sentiment less explicitly

Types edit 
A basic task in sentiment analysis is classifying the polarity of a given text at the document  sentence  or feature aspect level whether the expressed opinion in a document  a sentence or an entity feature aspect is positive  negative  or neutral  Advanced   beyond polarity  sentiment classification looks  for instance  at emotional states such as enjoyment  anger  disgust  sadness  fear  and surprise            
Precursors to sentimental analysis include the General Inquirer             which provided hints toward quantifying patterns in text and  separately  psychological research that examined a person s psychological state based on analysis of their verbal behavior            
Subsequently  the method described in a patent by Volcani and Fogel             looked specifically at sentiment and identified individual words and phrases in text with respect to different emotional scales  A current system based on their work  called EffectCheck  presents synonyms that can be used to increase or decrease the level of evoked emotion in each scale 
Many other subsequent efforts were less sophisticated  using a mere polar view of sentiment  from positive to negative  such as work by Turney             and Pang            who applied different methods for detecting the polarity of product reviews and movie reviews respectively  This work is at the document level  One can also classify a document s polarity on a multi way scale  which was attempted by Pang            and Snyder            among others  Pang and Lee            expanded the basic task of classifying a movie review as either positive or negative to predict star ratings on either a    or a   star scale  while Snyder            performed an in depth analysis of restaurant reviews  predicting ratings for various aspects of the given restaurant  such as the food and atmosphere  on a five star scale  
First steps to bringing together various approaches learning  lexical  knowledge based  etc  were taken in the      AAAI Spring Symposium where linguists  computer scientists  and other interested researchers first aligned interests and proposed shared tasks and benchmark data sets for the systematic computational research on affect  appeal  subjectivity  and sentiment in text             
Even though in most statistical classification methods  the neutral class is ignored under the assumption that neutral texts lie near the boundary of the binary classifier  several researchers suggest that  as in every polarity problem  three categories must be identified  Moreover  it can be proven that specific classifiers such as the Max Entropy             and SVMs             can benefit from the introduction of a neutral class and improve the overall accuracy of the classification  There are in principle two ways for operating with a neutral class  Either  the algorithm proceeds by first identifying the neutral language  filtering it out and then assessing the rest in terms of positive and negative sentiments  or it builds a three way classification in one step              This second approach often involves estimating a probability distribution over all categories  e g  naive Bayes classifiers as implemented by the NLTK   Whether and how to use a neutral class depends on the nature of the data  if the data is clearly clustered into neutral  negative and positive language  it makes sense to filter the neutral language out and focus on the polarity between positive and negative sentiments  If  in contrast  the data are mostly neutral with small deviations towards positive and negative affect  this strategy would make it harder to clearly distinguish between the two poles 
A different method for determining sentiment is the use of a scaling system whereby words commonly associated with having a negative  neutral  or positive sentiment  are given an associated number on a     to     scale  most negative up to most positive  or simply from   to a positive upper limit such as     This makes it possible to adjust the sentiment of a given term relative to its environment  usually on the level of the sentence   When a piece of unstructured text is analyzed using natural language processing  each concept in the specified environment is given a score based on the way sentiment words relate to the concept and its associated score                          This allows movement to a more sophisticated understanding of sentiment  because it is now possible to adjust the sentiment value of a concept relative to modifications that may surround it  Words  for example  that intensify  relax or negate the sentiment expressed by the concept can affect its score  Alternatively  texts can be given a positive and negative sentiment strength score if the goal is to determine the sentiment in a text rather than the overall polarity and strength of the text             
There are various other types of sentiment analysis  such as aspect based sentiment analysis  grading sentiment analysis  positive  negative  neutral   multilingual sentiment analysis and detection of emotions 

Subjectivity objectivity identification edit 
This task is commonly defined as classifying a given text  usually a sentence  into one of two classes  objective or subjective              This problem can sometimes be more difficult than polarity classification              The subjectivity of words and phrases may depend on their context and an objective document may contain subjective sentences  e g   a news article quoting people s opinions   Moreover  as mentioned by Su              results are largely dependent on the definition of subjectivity used when annotating texts  However  Pang             showed that removing objective sentences from a document before classifying its polarity helped improve performance 
Subjective and objective identification  emerging subtasks of sentiment analysis to use syntactic  semantic features  and machine learning knowledge to identify if a sentence or document contains facts or opinions  Awareness of recognizing factual and opinions is not recent  having possibly first presented by Carbonell at Yale University in           clarify     
The term objective refers to the incident carrying factual information             

Example of an objective sentence   To be elected president of the United States  a candidate must be at least thirty five years of age  
The term subjective describes the incident contains non factual information in various forms  such as personal opinions  judgment  and predictions  also known as  private states               In the example down below  it reflects a private states  We Americans   Moreover  the target entity commented by the opinions can take several forms from tangible product to intangible topic matters stated in Liu                     Furthermore  three types of attitudes were observed by Liu            positive opinions      neutral opinions  and    negative opinions             

Example of a subjective sentence   We Americans need to elect a president who is mature and who is able to make wise decisions  
This analysis is a classification problem             
Each class s collections of words or phrase indicators are defined for to locate desirable patterns on unannotated text  For subjective expression  a different word list has been created  Lists of subjective indicators in words or phrases have been developed by multiple researchers in the linguist and natural language processing field states in Riloff et al                      A dictionary of extraction rules has to be created for measuring given expressions  Over the years  in subjective detection  the features extraction progression from curating features by hand to automated features learning  At the moment  automated learning methods can further separate into supervised and unsupervised machine learning  Patterns extraction with machine learning process annotated and unannotated text have been explored extensively by academic researchers 
However  researchers recognized several challenges in developing fixed sets of rules for expressions respectably  Much of the challenges in rule development stems from the nature of textual information  Six challenges have been recognized by several researchers     metaphorical expressions     discrepancies in writings     context sensitive     represented words with fewer usages     time sensitive  and    ever growing volume 

Metaphorical expressions  The text contains metaphoric expression may impact on the performance on the extraction              Besides  metaphors take in different forms  which may have been contributed to the increase in detection 
Discrepancies in writings  For the text obtained from the Internet  the discrepancies in the writing style of targeted text data involve distinct writing genres and styles 
Context sensitive  Classification may vary based on the subjectiveness or objectiveness of previous and following sentences             
Time sensitive attribute  The task is challenged by some textual data s time sensitive attribute  If a group of researchers wants to confirm a piece of fact in the news  they need a longer time for cross validation  than the news becomes outdated 
Cue words with fewer usages 
Ever growing volume  The task is also challenged by the sheer volume of textual data  The textual data s ever growing nature makes the task overwhelmingly difficult for the researchers to complete the task on time 
Previously  the research mainly focused on document level classification  However  classifying a document level suffers less accuracy  as an article may have diverse types of expressions involved  Researching evidence suggests a set of news articles that are expected to dominate by the objective expression  whereas the results show that it consisted of over     of subjective expression             
To overcome those challenges  researchers conclude that classifier efficacy depends on the precisions of patterns learner  And the learner feeds with large volumes of annotated training data outperformed those trained on less comprehensive subjective features  However  one of the main obstacles to executing this type of work is to generate a big dataset of annotated sentences manually       The manual annotation method has been less favored than automatic learning for three reasons 

Variations in comprehensions  In the manual annotation task  disagreement of whether one instance is subjective or objective may occur among annotators because of languages  ambiguity 
Human errors  Manual annotation task is a meticulous assignment  it require intense concentration to finish 
Time consuming  Manual annotation task is an assiduous work  Riloff        show that a     texts cost   hours for one annotator to finish             
All these mentioned reasons can impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of subjective and objective classification  Accordingly  two bootstrapping methods were designed to learning linguistic patterns from unannotated text data  Both methods are starting with a handful of seed words and unannotated textual data 

Meta Bootstrapping by Riloff and Jones in                       Level One  Generate extraction patterns based on the pre defined rules and the extracted patterns by the number of seed words each pattern holds   Level Two  Top   words will be marked and add to the dictionary    Repeat 
Basilisk  Bootstrapping Approach to Semantic Lexicon Induction using Semantic Knowledge  by Thelen and Riloff               Step One  Generate extraction patterns  Step Two  Move best patterns from Pattern Pool to Candidate Word Pool  Step Three  Top    words will be marked and add to the dictionary  Repeat 
Overall  these algorithms highlight the need for automatic pattern recognition and extraction in subjective and objective task 
Subjective and object classifier can enhance the several applications of natural language processing  One of the classifier s primary benefits is that it popularized the practice of data driven decision making processes in various industries  According to Liu  the applications of subjective and objective identification have been implemented in business  advertising  sports  and social science             

Online review classification  In the business industry  the classifier helps the company better understand the feedbacks on product and reasonings behind the reviews 
Actionable insights  Emotions  sarcasm  tone and other nuances previously difficult to parse via legacy NLP  outside of  positive   negative  or  neutral    are more accurately explicated from consumer feedback  This makes the unstructured review data increasingly actionable in terms of customer service  product service improvements  industry specific trend identification and competitive analysis             
Stock price prediction  In the finance industry  the classifier aids the prediction model by process auxiliary information from social media and other textual information from the Internet    Previous studies on Japanese stock price conducted by Dong et al  indicates that model with subjective and objective module may perform better than those without this part             
Social media analysis 
Students  feedback classification             
Document summarising  The classifier can extract target specified comments and gathering opinions made by one particular entity 
Complex question answering  The classifier can dissect the complex questions by classing the language subject or objective and focused target  In the research Yu et al         the researcher developed a sentence and document level clustered that identity opinion pieces             
Domain specific applications 
Email analysis  The subjective and objective classifier detects spam by tracing language patterns with target words 
Feature aspect based edit 
It refers to determining the opinions or sentiments expressed on different features or aspects of entities  e g   of a cell phone  a digital camera  or a bank              A feature or aspect is an attribute or component of an entity  e g   the screen of a cell phone  the service for a restaurant  or the picture quality of a camera  The advantage of feature based sentiment analysis is the possibility to capture nuances about objects of interest  Different features can generate different sentiment responses  for example a hotel can have a convenient location  but mediocre food              This problem involves several sub problems  e g   identifying relevant entities  extracting their features aspects  and determining whether an opinion expressed on each feature aspect is positive  negative or neutral              The automatic identification of features can be performed with syntactic methods  with topic modeling                          or with deep learning                          More detailed discussions about this level of sentiment analysis can be found in Liu s work             

Intensity ranking edit 
Emotions and sentiments are subjective in nature  The degree of emotions sentiments expressed in a given text at the document  sentence  or feature aspect level to what degree of intensity is expressed in the opinion of a document  a sentence or an entity differs on a case to case basis              However  predicting only the emotion and sentiment does not always convey complete information  The degree or level of emotions and sentiments often plays a crucial role in understanding the exact feeling within a single class  e g    good  versus  awesome    Some methods leverage a stacked ensemble method             for predicting intensity for emotion and sentiment by combining the outputs obtained and using deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks              long short term memory networks and gated recurrent units             

Methods and features edit 
Existing approaches to sentiment analysis can be grouped into three main categories  knowledge based techniques  statistical methods  and hybrid approaches              Knowledge based techniques classify text by affect categories based on the presence of unambiguous affect words such as happy  sad  afraid  and bored              Some knowledge bases not only list obvious affect words  but also assign arbitrary words a probable  affinity  to particular emotions              Statistical methods leverage elements from machine learning such as latent semantic analysis  support vector machines   bag of words    Pointwise Mutual Information  for Semantic Orientation             semantic space models or word embedding models              and deep learning  More sophisticated methods try to detect the holder of a sentiment  i e   the person who maintains that affective state  and the target  i e   the entity about which the affect is felt               To mine the opinion in context and get the feature about which the speaker has opined  the grammatical relationships of words are used  Grammatical dependency relations are obtained by deep parsing of the text              Hybrid approaches leverage both machine learning and elements from knowledge representation such as ontologies and semantic networks in order to detect semantics that are expressed in a subtle manner  e g   through the analysis of concepts that do not explicitly convey relevant information  but which are implicitly linked to other concepts that do so             
Open source software tools as well as range of free and paid sentiment analysis tools deploy machine learning  statistics  and natural language processing techniques to automate sentiment analysis on large collections of texts  including web pages  online news  internet discussion groups  online reviews  web blogs  and social media              Knowledge based systems  on the other hand  make use of publicly available resources  to extract the semantic and affective information associated with natural language concepts  The system can help perform affective commonsense reasoning              Sentiment analysis can also be performed on visual content  i e   images and videos  see Multimodal sentiment analysis   One of the first approaches in this direction is SentiBank             utilizing an adjective noun pair representation of visual content  In addition  the vast majority of sentiment classification approaches rely on the bag of words model  which disregards context  grammar and even word order  Approaches that analyses the sentiment based on how words compose the meaning of longer phrases have shown better result              but they incur an additional annotation overhead 
A human analysis component is required in sentiment analysis  as automated systems are not able to analyze historical tendencies of the individual commenter  or the platform and are often classified incorrectly in their expressed sentiment  Automation impacts approximately     of comments that are correctly classified by humans              However  humans often disagree  and it is argued that the inter human agreement provides an upper bound that automated sentiment classifiers can eventually reach             

Evaluation edit 
The accuracy of a sentiment analysis system is  in principle  how well it agrees with human judgments  This is usually measured by variant measures based on precision and recall over the two target categories of negative and positive texts  However  according to research human raters typically only agree about                 of the time  see Inter rater reliability   Thus  a program that achieves     accuracy in classifying sentiment is doing nearly as well as humans  even though such accuracy may not sound impressive  If a program were  right       of the time  humans would still disagree with it about     of the time  since they disagree that much about any answer      citation needed     
On the other hand  computer systems will make very different errors than human assessors  and thus the figures are not entirely comparable  For instance  a computer system will have trouble with negations  exaggerations  jokes  or sarcasm  which typically are easy to handle for a human reader  some errors a computer system makes will seem overly naive to a human  In general  the utility for practical commercial tasks of sentiment analysis as it is defined in academic research has been called into question  mostly since the simple one dimensional model of sentiment from negative to positive yields rather little actionable information for a client worrying about the effect of public discourse on e g  brand or corporate reputation                                     
To better fit market needs  evaluation of sentiment analysis has moved to more task based measures  formulated together with representatives from PR agencies and market research professionals  The focus in e g  the RepLab evaluation data set is less on the content of the text under consideration and more on the effect of the text in question on brand reputation                                     
Because evaluation of sentiment analysis is becoming more and more task based  each implementation needs a separate training model to get a more accurate representation of sentiment for a given data set 

Web     edit

The rise of social media such as blogs and social networks has fueled interest in sentiment analysis   With the proliferation of reviews  ratings  recommendations and other forms of online expression  online opinion has turned into a kind of virtual currency for businesses looking to market their products  identify new opportunities and manage their reputations   As businesses look to automate the process of filtering out the noise  understanding the conversations  identifying the relevant content and actioning it appropriately  many are now looking to the field of sentiment analysis              Further complicating the matter  is the rise of anonymous social media platforms such as  chan and Reddit              If web     was all about democratizing publishing  then the next stage of the web may well be based on democratizing data mining of all the content that is getting published             
One step towards this aim is accomplished in research  Several research teams in universities around the world currently focus on understanding the dynamics of sentiment in e communities through sentiment analysis             
The problem is that most sentiment analysis algorithms use simple terms to express sentiment about a product or service   However  cultural factors  linguistic nuances  and differing contexts make it extremely difficult to turn a string of written text into a simple pro or con sentiment               The fact that humans often disagree on the sentiment of text illustrates how big a task it is for computers to get this right   The shorter the string of text  the harder it becomes 
Even though short text strings might be a problem  sentiment analysis within microblogging has shown that Twitter can be seen as a valid online indicator of political sentiment  Tweets  political sentiment demonstrates close correspondence to parties  and politicians  political positions  indicating that the content of Twitter messages plausibly reflects the offline political landscape              Furthermore  sentiment analysis on Twitter has also been shown to capture the public mood behind human reproduction cycles globally              as well as other problems of public health relevance such as adverse drug reactions             
While sentiment analysis has been popular for domains where authors express their opinion rather explicitly   the movie is awesome    such as social media and product reviews  only recently robust methods were devised for other domains where sentiment is strongly implicit or indirect  For example  in news articles   mostly due to the expected journalistic objectivity   journalists often describe actions or events rather than directly stating the polarity of a piece of information  Earlier approaches using dictionaries or shallow machine learning features were unable to catch the  meaning between the lines   but recently researchers have proposed a deep learning based approach and dataset that is able to analyze sentiment in news articles            
Scholars have utilized sentiment analysis to analyse the construction health and safety Tweets  which is called X now   The research revealed that there is a positive correlation between favorites and retweets in terms of sentiment valence  Others have examined the impact of YouTube on the dissemination of construction health and safety knowledge  They investigated how emotions influence users  behaviors in terms of viewing and commenting through semantic analysis  In another study  positive sentiment accounted for an overwhelming figure of     in knowledge sharing of construction safety and health via Instagram             

Application in recommender systems edit 
See also  Recommender system
For a recommender system  sentiment analysis has been proven to be a valuable technique  A recommender system aims to predict the preference for an item of a target user  Mainstream recommender systems work on explicit data set  For example  collaborative filtering works on the rating matrix  and content based filtering works on the meta data of the items 
In many social networking services or e commerce websites  users can provide text review  comment or feedback to the items  These user generated text provide a rich source of user s sentiment opinions about numerous products and items  Potentially  for an item  such text can reveal both the related feature aspects of the item and the users  sentiments on each feature              The item s feature aspects described in the text play the same role with the meta data in content based filtering  but the former are more valuable for the recommender system  Since these features are broadly mentioned by users in their reviews  they can be seen as the most crucial features that can significantly influence the user s experience on the item  while the meta data of the item  usually provided by the producers instead of consumers  may ignore features that are concerned by the users  For different items with common features  a user may give different sentiments  Also  a feature of the same item may receive different sentiments from different users  Users  sentiments on the features can be regarded as a multi dimensional rating score  reflecting their preference on the items 
Based on the feature aspects and the sentiments extracted from the user generated text  a hybrid recommender system can be constructed              There are two types of motivation to recommend a candidate item to a user  The first motivation is the candidate item have numerous common features with the user s preferred items              while the second motivation is that the candidate item receives a high sentiment on its features  For a preferred item  it is reasonable to believe that items with the same features will have a similar function or utility  So  these items will also likely to be preferred by the user  On the other hand  for a shared feature of two candidate items  other users may give positive sentiment to one of them while giving negative sentiment to another  Clearly  the high evaluated item should be recommended to the user  Based on these two motivations  a combination ranking score of similarity and sentiment rating can be constructed for each candidate item             
Except for the difficulty of the sentiment analysis itself  applying sentiment analysis on reviews or feedback also faces the challenge of spam and biased reviews  One direction of work is focused on evaluating the helpfulness of each review              Review or feedback poorly written is hardly helpful for recommender system  Besides  a review can be designed to hinder sales of a target product  thus be harmful to the recommender system even it is well written 
Researchers also found that long and short forms of user generated text should be treated differently  An interesting result shows that short form reviews are sometimes more helpful than long form              because it is easier to filter out the noise in a short form text  For the long form text  the growing length of the text does not always bring a proportionate increase in the number of features or sentiments in the text 
Lamba  amp  Madhusudhan             introduce a nascent way to cater the information needs of today s library users by repackaging the results from sentiment analysis of social media platforms like Twitter and provide it as a consolidated time based service in different formats  Further  they propose a new way of conducting marketing in libraries using social media mining and sentiment analysis 

Ethical Considerations edit 
Issues such as privacy  consent  and bias are crucial since sentiment analysis regularly analyzes personal data without explicit user consent  The potential for misinterpretation and misuse of sentiment data can significantly impact societal norms  Furthermore  the development of ethical frameworks  as seen in projects like SEWA  where Ethical and Industrial Valorisation Advisory Boards are established  is essential for addressing these challenges  These boards help ensure that sentiment analysis technologies are used responsibly  especially in applications involving the recognition of human emotions and behaviors  Such frameworks are vital for guiding the responsible use of sentiment analysis tools  ensuring they promote equity and respect user autonomy  and effectively address both routine and complex ethical issues
