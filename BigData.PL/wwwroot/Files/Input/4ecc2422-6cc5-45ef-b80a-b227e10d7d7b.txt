							In Ramadan  diabetics are faced with the grueling challenge of coordinating their diet without endangering their health or disrupting their calculated daily routine  
The Egyptian Society for Child Care Assistance to Young Diabetics  AYD          in association with the international Pharmaceuticals Corporation Roche  the Diabetes International Advisory Board  Diab  and the French organization AJD         organized a forum last week at the Greater Cairo Library of Zamalek to discuss the methods of handling diabetes during Ramadan 
An estimated five million people have diabetes in Egypt  The United Nations have recently declared it one of the main global problems affecting every country in the world  
Physician Zakaria El Baz opened the forum by warning both diabetics and non diabetics to watch their weight carefully and avoid the typical excessive eating that is always connected with the holy month  
 Studies have indicated that an average of     kg is usually gained during Ramdan   El Baz said   Serious problems could ensue unless a controlled diet is planned   
Islamic scholar Nasser Abdel Razek stressed that children  and young adolescents  aren t obliged by Sharia  Islamic religious law  to fast 
 Parents are required to train their children to fast  pray and perform the Islamic rituals   he said   They re absolutely not accountable to any rules at such a young age though  
Abdel Razek added that some kids  and their mothers  feel the need to fast in order not to appear inferior to their peers or family members  
Several participating parents hinted that the chief reasons their children insist on fasting are traditions  peer pressure and fear of misperception from others  
 We re still living in an age where traditions and heritage dominate the way we live   Abdel Razek said  
The solution  according to Abdel Razek  is for the parents to find alternatives methods that suppress this inferiority like helping the poor or praying at the mosque after iftar 
As for diabetic adults  Abdel Razek stated that physicians have the final word in deciding whether a certain patient should fast or not 
 Hurting yourself is a bigger sin than not fasting   Abdel Razek said   Treating your neighbors with compassion  being good to others and committing to carrying out good deeds is even worthier than fasting  
Dr  Isis Ghaly  on the other hand  asserted strongly that diabetics of all ages  must not fast   Ghaly said that it s almost impossible to maintain the necessary insulin balance in the patients  blood with Ramadan s food regimen 
Ghaly also advised the young diabetics  parents against denying the children particular heavy Ramadan desserts like Basbosa or Konafa   A little sport would quickly undo any mischief these dishes might inflict   she said   Mothers should treat their diabetic children normally and avoid regarding them as patients  
Psychologist Fatma El Soghayar agrees with Ghaly and adds that  parents should stop being paranoid about their children and never overlook the fact that they re kids with little understanding of the concepts of responsibility and duty  
Nutritionist Mohamed El Hofy said that if diabetic patients eventually choose to fast  they must condense the amount of food they consume on ordinary days into three primary  separate meals in Ramadan  
El Hofy cautioned strongly against exerting vigorous  energy draining activities before breakfast  He said that patients should immediately break their fasting the moment they feel any sort of exhaustion  
El Hofy also advised diabetics to use the low glycemic indexed sugar fructose when baking the Ramadan desserts  Fruits and juices are highly important as well but dried fruits  with large concentrated amount of sugar  should be avoided 
In addition  El Baz warned against using vitamin pills since  according to the latest American studies  they ve proved to cause severe damage to the body  Dr  El Hofy disagreed though  stating that the food currently available in the market contains few vitamins  
 Packed milk is heated at a very high temperature that causes milk to lose a high percentage of its calcium and vitamins   he said   Vitamins  with calculated  adequate quantities  should not instigate any harmful effect  
 The only way to treat diabetes is through education  education and education   El Baz commented 
Laila El Sioufi  AYD president concurs   We should teach people how to eat  how to live  how to be psychologically alert in order to cope with a disease   she told Daily News Egypt 
El Sioufi believes that communicators are required to convey their messages to the public via a subtle  perceptive and informative manner especially since the repercussions of chronic diseases are not instantaneous and people should learn how to prevent them  
AYD       s recent activities include a magazine and a hotline to be launched in about a month that will offer free consultations with a variety of physicians
