Poker is a family of comparing card games in which players wager over which hand is best according to that specific game s rules  It is played worldwide  but in some places the rules may vary  While the earliest known form of the game was played with just    cards  today it is usually played with a standard    card deck  although in countries where short packs are common  it may be played with        or    cards             Thus poker games vary in deck configuration  the number of cards in play  the number dealt face up or face down and the number shared by all players  but all have rules that involve one or more rounds of betting 
In most modern poker games  the first round of betting begins with one or more of the players making some form of a forced bet  the blind or ante   In standard poker  each player bets according to the rank they believe their hand is worth as compared to the other players  The action then proceeds clockwise as each player in turn must either match  or  call   the maximum previous bet  or fold  losing the amount bet so far and all further involvement in the hand  A player who matches a bet may also  raise   increase  the bet  The betting round ends when all players have either called the last bet or folded  If all but one player folds on any round  the remaining player collects the pot without being required to reveal their hand  If more than one player remains in contention after the final betting round  a showdown takes place where the hands are revealed  and the player with the winning hand takes the pot 
With the exception of initial forced bets  money is only placed into the pot voluntarily by a player who either believes the bet has a positive expected value or who is trying to bluff other players for various strategic reasons  Thus  while the outcome of any particular hand significantly involves chance  the long run expectations of the players are determined by their actions chosen on the basis of probability  psychology and game theory 
Poker has increased in popularity since the beginning of the   st century  and has gone from being primarily a recreational activity confined to small groups of enthusiasts to a widely popular activity  both for participants and spectators  including online  with many professional players and multimillion dollar tournament prizes

Main article  History of poker
While poker s exact origin is the subject of debate  many game scholars point to the French game Poque and the Iranian game As Nas as possible early inspirations             For example  in the      edition of Foster s Complete Hoyle  R  F  Foster wrote that  the game of poker  as first played in the United States  five cards to each player from a twenty card pack  is undoubtedly the Persian game of As Nas   However  in the     s the notion that poker is a direct derivative of As Nas began to be challenged by gaming historians including David Parlett  What is certain  however  is that poker was popularized in the American South in the early   th century  as gambling riverboats in the Mississippi River and around New Orleans during the     s helped spread the game  One early description of poker was played on a steamboat in      is recorded by the English actor  Joe Cowell  The game was played with twenty cards ranking from Ace  high  to Ten  low             
In contrast to this version of poker  seven card stud only appeared in the middle of the   th century  and was largely spread by the US military             It became a staple in many casinos following World War II and grew in popularity with the advent of the World Series of Poker in the     s            
Texas hold  em and other community card games began to dominate the gambling scenes over the next couple of decades  The televising of poker was a particularly strong influence increasing the popularity of the game during the turn of the millennium  resulting in the poker boom a few years later between      and       Today the game has grown to become an extremely popular pastime worldwide

Straight flush


Four of a kindExamples of top poker hand categories
In casual play  the right to deal a hand typically rotates among the players and is marked by a token called a dealer button  or buck   In a casino  a house dealer handles the cards for each hand  but the button  typically a white plastic disk  is rotated clockwise among the players to indicate a nominal dealer to determine the order of betting  The cards are dealt clockwise around the poker table  one at a time 
One or more players are usually required to make forced bets  usually either an ante or a blind bet  sometimes both   The dealer shuffles the cards  the player on the chair to their right cuts  and the dealer deals the appropriate number of cards to the players one at a time  beginning with the player to their left  Cards may be dealt either face up or face down  depending on the variant of poker being played  After the initial deal  the first of what may be several betting rounds begins  Between rounds  the players  hands develop in some way  often by being dealt additional cards or replacing cards previously dealt  At the end of each round  all bets are gathered into the central pot 
At any time during a betting round  if one player bets  no opponents choose to call  match  the bet  and all opponents instead fold  the hand ends immediately  the bettor is awarded the pot  no cards are required to be shown  and the next hand begins  This is what makes bluffing possible  Bluffing is a primary feature of poker  distinguishing it from other vying games and from other games that use poker hand rankings 
At the end of the last betting round  if more than one player remains  there is a showdown  in which the players reveal their previously hidden cards and evaluate their hands  The player with the best hand according to the poker variant being played wins the pot  A poker hand comprises five cards  in variants where a player has more than five cards available to them  only the best five card combination counts  There are    different kinds of poker hands  such as straight flush and four of a kind 

Variants edit 
Main article  List of poker variants
     WSOP Main Event table
Poker has many variations                        all following a similar pattern of play            and generally using the same hand ranking hierarchy  There are four main families of variants  largely grouped by the protocol of card dealing and betting 

Straight
A complete hand is dealt to each player  and players bet in one round  with raising and re raising allowed  This is the oldest poker family  the root of the game as now played was a game known as Primero  which evolved into the game three card brag  a very popular gentleman s game around the time of the American Revolutionary War and still enjoyed in the U K  today  Straight hands of five cards are sometimes used as a final showdown  but poker is almost always played in a more complex form to allow for additional strategy 
Stud poker
Cards are dealt in a prearranged combination of face down and face up rounds  or streets  with a round of betting following each  This is the next oldest family  as poker progressed from three to five card hands  they were often dealt one card at a time  either face down or face up  with a betting round between each  The most popular stud variant today  seven card stud  deals two extra cards to each player  three face down  four face up  from which they must make the best possible   card hand 
Draw poker
Five card draw  A complete hand is dealt to each player  face down  Then each player must place an ante to the pot  They can then see their cards and bet accordingly  After betting  players can discard up to three cards and take new ones from the top of the deck  Then  another round of betting takes place  Finally  each player must show their cards and the player with the best hand wins 
Community card poker
Also known as  flop poker   community card poker is a variation of stud poker   Players are dealt an incomplete hand of face down cards  and then a number of face up community cards are dealt to the center of the table  each of which can be used by one or more of the players to make a   card hand  Texas hold  em and Omaha are two well known variants of the community card family 
There are several methods for defining the structure of betting during a hand of poker  The three most common structures are known as  fixed limit    pot limit   and  no limit   In fixed limit poker  betting and raising must be done by standardized amounts  For instance  if the required bet is X  an initial bettor may only bet X  if a player wishes to raise a bet  they may only raise by X  In pot limit poker  a player may bet or raise any amount up to the size of the pot  When calculating the maximum raise allowed  all previous bets and calls  including the intending raiser s call  are first added to the pot  The raiser may then raise the previous bet by the full amount of the pot  In no limit poker  a player may wager their entire betting stack at any point that they are allowed to make a bet  In all games  if a player does not have enough betting chips to fully match a bet  they may go  all in   allowing them to show down their hand for the number of chips they have remaining

While typical poker games award the pot to the highest hand as per the standard ranking of poker hands  there are variations where the lowest ranked hand wins  In such games the best hand contains the lowest cards rather than the highest cards  some variations may be further complicated by whether or not hands such as flushes and straights are considered in the hand rankings  There are also games where the highest and lowest hands divide the pot between them  known as  high low split  games 
Other games that use poker hand rankings may likewise be referred to as poker  Video poker is a single player video game that functions much like a slot machine  most video poker machines play draw poker  where the player bets  a hand is dealt  and the player can discard and replace cards  Payout is dependent on the hand resulting after the draw and the player s initial bet 
Strip poker is a traditional poker variation where players remove clothing when they lose bets  Since it depends only on the basic mechanic of betting in rounds  strip poker can be played with any form of poker  however  it is usually based on simple variants with few betting rounds  like five card draw 
Another game with the poker name  but with a vastly different mode of play  is called Acey Deucey or Red Dog poker  This game is more similar to Blackjack in its layout and betting  each player bets against the house  and then is dealt two cards  For the player to win  the third card dealt  after an opportunity to raise the bet  must have a value in between the first two  Payout is based on the odds that this is possible  based on the difference in values of the first two cards  Other poker like games played at casinos against the house include three card poker and pai gow poker 

Computer programs edit 
A variety of computer poker players have been developed by researchers at the University of Alberta  Carnegie Mellon University  and the University of Auckland amongst others 
In a January      article             published in Science  a group of researchers mostly from the University of Alberta announced that they  essentially weakly solved  heads up limit Texas Hold  em with their development of their Cepheus poker bot  The authors claimed that Cepheus would lose at most       big blinds per game on average against its worst case opponent  and the strategy is thus so  close to optimal  that  it can t be beaten with statistical significance within a lifetime of human poker playing
