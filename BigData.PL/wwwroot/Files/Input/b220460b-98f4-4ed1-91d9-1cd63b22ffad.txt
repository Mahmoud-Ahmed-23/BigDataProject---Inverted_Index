Software testing techniques  And in this Tutorial  we will see the important parts of the Software testing topics which we are discussing here in detail For those who want a thorough  hands on approach on Software testing  kindly explore our nbsp dedicated course Manual to Automation Testing nbsp which covers both theoretical and practical aspects and can be invaluable in mastering these techniques  Software Testing Tutorial Table of ContentWhat is Software Testing Manual Testing Automation Testing Software Testing Principles Software Testing TutorialImportance of Software TestingWhy Learn Software Testing   Objectives of Software Testing What is Software Testing Software Testing nbsp is a method to assess the functionality of the software program  The process checks whether the actual software matches the expected requirements and ensures the software is bug free  The purpose of software testing is to identify the errors  faults  or missing requirements in contrast to actual requirements  It mainly aims at measuring the specification  functionality  and performance of a software program or application Software Testing nbsp is an important part of the nbsp Software Development Lifecycle  which includes many more nbsp Types of Software Testing Manual Testing Manual testing nbsp is a technique to test the software that is carried out using the functions and features of an application  nbsp Which means manual testing will be check the defect manually with trying one by one function is working as expected Automation Testing Automated Testing nbsp is a technique where the Tester writes scripts independently and uses suitable Software or nbsp Automation Tools nbsp to test the software  It is an Automation Process of a Manual Process  It allows for executing repetitive tasks without the use of a Manual Tester Software Testing Principles Software testing is putting software or an application to use to find errors or faults  We must go by certain guidelines while testing software or applications to ensure that the final result is free of flaws  This saves the test engineers  time and effort as they can more efficiently test the program  We will learn about the seven fundamental tenets of software testing in this part  Here are the Seven Different Testing Principles  one by one   Testing shows the presence of defects  Exhaustive Testing is not possible  Early Testing  Defect Clustering  Pesticide Paradox  Testing is context dependent  Absence of errors fallacy Software Testing TutorialIn these tutorial we are covering the Basic level

because if there are any bugs they can be identified early and can be fixed before the delivery of the software Improves Quality of Software  nbsp Software Testing uncovers the defects in the software  and fixing them improves the quality of the software Increased Customer Satisfaction  nbsp Software testing ensures reliability  security  and high performance which results in saving time  costs  and customer satisfaction Helps with Scalability  nbsp Software testing type non functional testing helps to identify the scalability issues and the point where an application might stop working Why Learn Software Testing   Here are the following that it is important to learn Software Testing   Helps to create reliable software   Software testing is compulsory to provide facilities to the customers like the delivery of software applications which require maintenance costs  and need to be more accurate  consistent  and reliable   Helps to deliver quality products   It is very important to check the quality of the product  Quality products delivered to the customers help in gaining their profitable and effective output this can be done by using software testing methods   Helps to achieve effective performance   Software testing is required for the effective performance of the software application or software product   Ensures application is failure free   Software testing ensures that the application should not result in any failures because the cost of fixing is larger in the later stage of the development of software   Helps to detect bugs   Software testing points out the defects and errors made during the development phase which helps individuals receive quality products  Here are read more about the  Why Software Testing is Important   Objectives of Software Testing  The objectives of software testing are to   Enhance software reliability and stability through rigorous testing   Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize software efficiency   Validate software compatibility across different platforms and environments   Verify proper handling of edge cases and exceptional scenarios   Detect and address security vulnerabilities to protect user data   Ensure smooth integration with external systems or APIs   Validate proper functioning of user interfaces and user experience   Optimize software usability and accessibility for end users   Confirm compliance with industry standards and regulations   Mitigate risks associated with software failures or malfunctions  Conclusion In Software Testing Tutorial we learned the Basic to Advance Topics
