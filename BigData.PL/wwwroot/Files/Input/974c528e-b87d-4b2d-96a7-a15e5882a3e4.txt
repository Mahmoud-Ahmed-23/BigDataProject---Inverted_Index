Fictional supercomputer by Isaac Asimov

Multivac is a fictional supercomputer appearing in over a dozen science fiction stories by American writer Isaac Asimov  Asimov s depiction of Multivac  a mainframe computer accessible by terminal  originally by specialists using machine code and later by any user  and used for directing the global economy and humanity s development  has been seen as the defining conceptualization of the genre of computers for the period      s     s   Multivac has been described as the direct ancestor of HAL      


Description edit 
Like most of the technologies Asimov describes in his fiction  Multivac s exact specifications vary among appearances  In all cases  it is a government run computer that answers questions posed using natural language             and it is usually buried deep underground for security purposes  According to his autobiography In Memory Yet Green  Asimov coined the name in imitation of UNIVAC  an early mainframe computer  Asimov had assumed the name  Univac  denoted a computer with a single vacuum tube  it actually is an acronym for  Universal Automatic Computer    and on the basis that a computer with many such tubes would be more powerful  called his fictional  computer  Multivac               His later short story  The Last Question   however  expands the AC suffix to be  analog computer   However  Asimov never settles on a particular size for the computer  except for mentioning it is very large                or the supporting facilities around it  In the short story  Franchise  it is described as half a mile long       meters  and three stories high  at least as far as the general public knows  while  All the Troubles of the World  states it fills all of Washington D C   There are frequent mentions of corridors and people inside Multivac  Unlike the artificial intelligences portrayed in his Robot series  Multivac s early interface is mechanized and impersonal  consisting of complex command consoles few humans can operate             In  The Last Question   Multivac is shown as having a life of many thousands of years  growing ever more enormous with each section of the story  which can explain its different reported sizes as occurring further down the internal timeline of the overarching story               

Storylines edit 
Multivac appeared in over a dozen science fiction stories by American writer Isaac Asimov  some of which have entered the popular imagination                                   In the early Multivac story   Franchise   Multivac chooses a single  most representative  person from the population of the United States  whom the computer then interrogates to determine the country s overall orientation  All elected offices are then filled by the candidates the computer calculates as acceptable to the populace  Asimov wrote this story as the logical culmination   and or possibly the reductio ad absurdum   of UNIVAC s ability to forecast election results from small samples                       
In possibly the most famous Multivac story   The Last Question   two slightly drunken technicians ask Multivac if humanity can reverse the increase of entropy  Multivac fails  displaying the error message  INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER   The story continues through many iterations of computer technology  each more powerful and ethereal than the last  Each of these computers is asked the question  and each returns the same response until finally the universe dies  At that point Multivac s final successor  the Cosmic AC  which exists entirely in hyperspace  has collected all the data it can  and so poses the question to itself  As the universe died  Cosmic AC drew all of humanity into hyperspace in order to preserve them until it could finally answer the Last Question  Ultimately  Cosmic AC did decipher the answer  announcing  Let there be light   and essentially ascending to the state of the God of the Old Testament               Asimov claimed this to be the favorite of his stories             
In  All the Troubles of the World   the version of Multivac depicted reveals a very unexpected problem  Having had the weight of the whole of humanity s problems on its figurative shoulders for ages it has grown tired  and it sets plans in motion to cause its own death             

Significance edit 
Asimov s depiction of Multivac has been seen as the defining conceptualization of the genre of computers for the period  just as his development of robots defined a subsequent generation of thinking machines              and Multivac has been described as the direct ancestor of HAL                   Though the technology initially depended on bulky vacuum tubes  the concept   that all information could be contained on computer s  and accessed from a domestic terminal   constitutes an early reference to the possibility of the Internet  as in  Anniversary                Multivac has been considered within the context of public access information systems            and used in teaching computer science              as well as with regard to the nature of an electoral democracy  as its influence over global democracy and the directed economy increased   Franchise                                      Asimov stories featuring Multivac have also been taught in literature classes                          In AI control terms  Multivac has been described as both an  oracle  and a  nanny
