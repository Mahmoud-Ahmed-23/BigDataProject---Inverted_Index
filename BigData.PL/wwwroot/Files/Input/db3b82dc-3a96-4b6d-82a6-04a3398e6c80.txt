In artificial intelligence and operations research  constraint satisfaction is the process of finding a solution through 
a set of constraints that impose conditions that the variables must satisfy              A solution is therefore an assignment of values to the variables that satisfies all constraints       that is  a point in the feasible region 
The techniques used in constraint satisfaction depend on the kind of constraints being considered  Often used are constraints on a finite domain  to the point that constraint satisfaction problems are typically identified with problems based on constraints on a finite domain  Such problems are usually solved via search  in particular a form of backtracking or local search  Constraint propagation is another family of methods used on such problems  most of them are incomplete in general  that is  they may solve the problem or prove it unsatisfiable  but not always  Constraint propagation methods are also used in conjunction with search to make a given problem simpler to solve  Other considered kinds of constraints are on real or rational numbers  solving problems on these constraints is done via variable elimination or the simplex algorithm 
Constraint satisfaction as a general problem originated in the field of artificial intelligence in the     s  see for example  Lauri re         However  when the constraints are expressed as multivariate linear equations defining  in equalities  the field goes back to Joseph Fourier in the   th century  George Dantzig s invention of the simplex algorithm for linear programming  a special case of mathematical optimization  in      has allowed determining feasible solutions to problems containing hundreds of variables 
During the     s and     s  embedding of constraints into a programming language was developed  The first language devised expressly with intrinsic support for constraint programming was Prolog  Since then  constraint programming libraries have become available in other languages  such as  C   or Java  e g   Choco for Java             


Constraint satisfaction problem edit 
Main article  Constraint satisfaction problem
As originally defined in artificial intelligence  constraints enumerate the possible values a set of variables may take in a given world  A possible world is a total assignment of values to variables representing a way the world  real or imaginary  could be             Informally  a finite domain is a finite set of arbitrary elements  A constraint satisfaction problem on such domain contains a set of variables whose values can only be taken from the domain  and a set of constraints  each constraint specifying the allowed values for a group of variables  A solution to this problem is an evaluation of the variables that satisfies all constraints  In other words  a solution is a way for assigning a value to each variable in such a way that all constraints are satisfied by these values 
In some circumstances  there may exist additional requirements  one may be interested not only in the solution  and in the fastest or most computationally efficient way to reach it  but in how it was reached  e g  one may want the  simplest  solution   simplest  in a logical  non computational sense that has to be precisely defined   This is often the case in logic games such as Sudoku 
In practice  constraints are often expressed in compact form  rather than enumerating all the values of the variables that would satisfy the constraint  One  of the most used constraints is the  obvious  one establishing that the values of the affected variables must be all different 
Problems that can be expressed as constraint satisfaction problems are the eight queens puzzle  the Sudoku solving problem and many other logic puzzles  the Boolean satisfiability problem  scheduling problems  bounded error estimation problems and various problems on graphs such as the graph coloring problem 
While usually not included in the above definition of a constraint satisfaction problem  arithmetic equations and inequalities bound the values of the variables they contain and can therefore be considered a form of constraints  Their domain is the set of numbers  either integer  rational  or real   which is infinite  therefore  the relations of these constraints may be infinite as well  for example  
  
    
      
        X
         
        Y
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle X Y   
  
 has an infinite number of pairs of satisfying values  Arithmetic equations and inequalities are often not considered within the definition of a  constraint satisfaction problem   which is limited to finite domains  They are however used often in constraint programming 
It can be shown that the arithmetic inequalities or equations present in some types of finite logic puzzles such as Futoshiki or Kakuro  also known as Cross Sums  can be dealt with as non arithmetic constraints  see Pattern Based Constraint Satisfaction and Logic Puzzles             

Solving edit 
Constraint satisfaction problems on finite domains are typically solved using a form of search  The most used techniques are variants of backtracking  constraint propagation  and local search  These techniques are used on problems with nonlinear constraints 
Variable elimination and the simplex algorithm are used for solving linear and polynomial equations and inequalities  and problems containing variables with infinite domain  These are typically solved as optimization problems in which the optimized function is the number of violated constraints 

Complexity edit 
Main article  Complexity of constraint satisfaction
Solving a constraint satisfaction problem on a finite domain is an NP complete problem with respect to the domain size  Research has shown a number of tractable subcases  some limiting the allowed constraint relations  some requiring the scopes of constraints to form a tree  possibly in a reformulated version of the problem  Research has also established relationships of the constraint satisfaction problem with problems in other areas such as finite model theory 

Constraint programming edit 
Main article  Constraint programming
Constraint programming is the use of constraints as a programming language to encode and solve problems  This is often done by embedding constraints into a programming language  which is called the host language  Constraint programming originated from a formalization of equalities of terms in Prolog II  leading to a general framework for embedding constraints into a logic programming language  The most common host languages are Prolog  C    and Java  but other languages have been used as well 

Constraint logic programming edit 
Main article  Constraint logic programming
A constraint logic program is a logic program that contains constraints in the bodies of clauses  As an example  the clause A X   X gt   B X  is a clause containing the constraint X gt   in the body  Constraints can also be present in the goal  The constraints in the goal and in the clauses used to prove the goal are accumulated into a set called constraint store  This set contains the constraints the interpreter has assumed satisfiable in order to proceed in the evaluation  As a result  if this set is detected unsatisfiable  the interpreter backtracks  Equations of terms  as used in logic programming  are considered a particular form of constraints  which can be simplified using unification  As a result  the constraint store can be considered an extension of the concept of substitution that is used in regular logic programming  The most common kinds of constraints used in constraint logic programming are constraints over integers rational real numbers and constraints over finite domains 
Concurrent constraint logic programming languages have also been developed  They significantly differ from non concurrent constraint logic programming in that they are aimed at programming concurrent processes that may not terminate  Constraint handling rules can be seen as a form of concurrent constraint logic programming  but are also sometimes used within a non concurrent constraint logic programming language  They allow for rewriting constraints or to infer new ones based on the truth of conditions

Other constraint programming languages edit 
Constraint toolkits are a way for embedding constraints into an imperative programming language  However  they are only used as external libraries for encoding and solving problems  An approach in which constraints are integrated into an imperative programming language is taken in the Kaleidoscope programming language 
Constraints have also been embedded into functional programming languages
