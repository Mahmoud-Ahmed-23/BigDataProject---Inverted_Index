Immediately after the acquisition  Musk fired several top Twitter executives including CEO Parag Agrawal                            Musk became the CEO instead               Under Elon Musk  Twitter instituted monthly subscriptions for a  blue check                                          and laid off a significant portion of the company s staff                            Musk lessened content moderation and hate speech also increased on the platform after his takeover                                                      In late       Musk released internal documents relating to Twitter s moderation of Hunter Biden s laptop controversy in the lead up to the      presidential election               Musk also promised to step down as CEO after a Twitter poll                            and five months later  Musk stepped down from chief executive officer  CEO   and transitioned his role to executive chairman and chief technology officer  CTO
