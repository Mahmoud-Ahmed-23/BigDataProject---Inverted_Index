Artificial consciousness             also known as machine consciousness                        synthetic consciousness             or digital consciousness             is the consciousness hypothesized to be possible in artificial intelligence             It is also the corresponding field of study  which draws insights from philosophy of mind  philosophy of artificial intelligence  cognitive science and neuroscience 
The same terminology can be used with the term  sentience  instead of  consciousness  when specifically designating phenomenal consciousness  the ability to feel qualia              Since sentience involves the ability to experience ethically positive or negative  i e   valenced  mental states  it may justify welfare concerns and legal protection  as with animals            
Some scholars believe that consciousness is generated by the interoperation of various parts of the brain  these mechanisms are labeled the neural correlates of consciousness or NCC  Some further believe that constructing a system  e g   a computer system  that can emulate this NCC interoperation would result in a system that is conscious            


Philosophical views edit 
As there are many hypothesized types of consciousness  there are many potential implementations of artificial consciousness  In the philosophical literature  perhaps the most common taxonomy of consciousness is into  access  and  phenomenal  variants  Access consciousness concerns those aspects of experience that can be apprehended  while phenomenal consciousness concerns those aspects of experience that seemingly cannot be apprehended  instead being characterized qualitatively in terms of  raw feels    what it is like  or qualia             

Plausibility debate edit 
Type identity theorists and other skeptics hold the view that consciousness can be realized only in particular physical systems because consciousness has properties that necessarily depend on physical constitution                                                  In his      article  Artificial Consciousness  Utopia or Real Possibility   Giorgio Buttazzo says that a common objection to artificial consciousness is that   Working in a fully automated mode  they  the computers  cannot exhibit creativity  unreprogrammation  which means can  no longer be reprogrammed   from rethinking   emotions  or free will  A computer  like a washing machine  is a slave operated by its components              
For other theorists  e g   functionalists   who define mental states in terms of causal roles  any system that can instantiate the same pattern of causal roles  regardless of physical constitution  will instantiate the same mental states  including consciousness             

Thought experiments edit 
David Chalmers proposed two thought experiments intending to demonstrate that  functionally isomorphic  systems  those with the same  fine grained functional organization   i e   the same information processing  will have qualitatively identical conscious experiences  regardless of whether they are based on biological neurons or digital hardware                         
The  fading qualia  is a reductio ad absurdum thought experiment  It involves replacing  one by one  the neurons of a brain with a functionally identical component  for example based on a silicon chip  Since the original neurons and their silicon counterparts are functionally identical  the brain s information processing should remain unchanged  and the subject would not notice any difference  However  if qualia  such as the subjective experience of bright red  were to fade or disappear  the subject would likely notice this change  which causes a contradiction  Chalmers concludes that the fading qualia hypothesis is impossible in practice  and that the resulting robotic brain  once every neurons are replaced  would remain just as sentient as the original biological brain                         
Similarly  the  dancing qualia  thought experiment is another reductio ad absurdum argument  It supposes that two functionally isomorphic systems could have different perceptions  for instance  seeing the same object in different colors  like red and blue   It involves a switch that alternates between a chunk of brain that causes the perception of red  and a functionally isomorphic silicon chip  that causes the perception of blue  Since both perform the same function within the brain  the subject would not notice any change during the switch  Chalmers argues that this would be highly implausible if the qualia were truly switching between red and blue  hence the contradiction  Therefore  he concludes that the equivalent digital system would not only experience qualia  but it would perceive the same qualia as the biological system  e g   seeing the same color                          
Critics     who       of artificial sentience object that Chalmers  proposal begs the question in assuming that all mental properties and external connections are already sufficiently captured by abstract causal organization 

In large language models edit 
In       Google engineer Blake Lemoine made a viral claim that Google s LaMDA chatbot was sentient  Lemoine supplied as evidence the chatbot s humanlike answers to many of his questions  however  the chatbot s behavior was judged by the scientific community as likely a consequence of mimicry  rather than machine sentience  Lemoine s claim was widely derided for being ridiculous              However  while philosopher Nick Bostrom states that LaMDA is unlikely to be conscious  he additionally poses the question of  what grounds would a person have for being sure about it   One would have to have access to unpublished information about LaMDA s architecture  and also would have to understand how consciousness works  and then figure out how to map the philosophy onto the machine    In the absence of these steps   it seems like one should be maybe a little bit uncertain             there could well be other systems now  or in the relatively near future  that would start to satisfy the criteria              
Kristina  ekrst cautions that anthropomorphic terms such as  hallucination  can obscure important ontological differences between artificial and human cognition  While LLMs may produce human like outputs  she argues that it does not justify ascribing mental states or consciousness to them  Instead  she advocates for an epistemological framework  such as reliabilism  that recognizes the distinct nature of AI knowledge production              She suggests that apparent understanding in LLMs may be a sophisticated form of AI hallucination  She also questions what would happen if a LLM were trained without any mention of consciousness             
David Chalmers argued in      that LLMs today display impressive conversational and general intelligence abilities  but are likely not conscious yet  as they lack some features that may be necessary  such as recurrent processing  a global workspace  and unified agency  Nonetheless  he considers that non biological systems can be conscious  and suggested that future  extended models  LLM s  incorporating these elements might eventually meet the criteria for consciousness  raising both profound scientific questions and significant ethical challenges             

Testing edit 
Qualia  or phenomenological consciousness  is an inherently first person phenomenon  Because of that  and the lack of an empirical definition of sentience  directly measuring it may be impossible  Although systems may display numerous behaviors correlated with sentience  determining whether a system is sentient is known as the hard problem of consciousness  In the case of AI  there is the additional difficulty that the AI may be trained to act like a human  or incentivized to appear sentient  which makes behavioral markers of sentience less reliable                          Additionally  some chatbots have been trained to say they are not conscious             
A well known method for testing machine intelligence is the Turing test  which assesses the ability to have a human like conversation  But passing the Turing test does not indicate that an AI system is sentient  as the AI may simply mimic human behavior without having the associated feelings             
In       Victor Argonov suggested a non Turing test for machine sentience based on machine s ability to produce philosophical judgments              He argues that a deterministic machine must be regarded as conscious if it is able to produce judgments on all problematic properties of consciousness  such as qualia or binding  having no innate  preloaded  philosophical knowledge on these issues  no philosophical discussions while learning  and no informational models of other creatures in its memory  such models may implicitly or explicitly contain knowledge about these creatures  consciousness   However  this test can be used only to detect  but not refute the existence of consciousness  A positive result proves that machine is conscious but a negative result proves nothing  For example  absence of philosophical judgments may be caused by lack of the machine s intellect  not by absence of consciousness 

Ethics edit 
Main articles  Ethics of artificial intelligence  Machine ethics  and Roboethics
If it were suspected that a particular machine was conscious  its rights would be an ethical issue that would need to be assessed  e g  what rights it would have under law               For example  a conscious computer that was owned and used as a tool or central computer within a larger machine is a particular ambiguity  Should laws be made for such a case  Consciousness would also require a legal definition in this particular case  Because artificial consciousness is still largely a theoretical subject  such ethics have not been discussed or developed to a great extent  though it has often been a theme in fiction 
Sentience is generally considered sufficient for moral consideration  but some philosophers consider that moral consideration could also stem from other notions of consciousness  or from capabilities unrelated to consciousness                          such as   having a sophisticated conception of oneself as persisting through time  having agency and the ability to pursue long term plans  being able to communicate and respond to normative reasons  having preferences and powers  standing in certain social relationships with other beings that have moral status  being able to make commitments and to enter into reciprocal arrangements  or having the potential to develop some of these attributes              
Ethical concerns still apply  although to a lesser extent  when the consciousness is uncertain  as long as the probability is deemed non negligible  The precautionary principle is also relevant if the moral cost of mistakenly attributing or denying moral consideration to AI differs significantly                        
In       German philosopher Thomas Metzinger argued for a global moratorium on synthetic phenomenology until       Metzinger asserts that humans have a duty of care towards any sentient AIs they create  and that proceeding too fast risks creating an  explosion of artificial suffering               David Chalmers also argued that creating conscious AI would  raise a new group of difficult ethical challenges  with the potential for new forms of injustice              
Enforced amnesia has been proposed as a way to mitigate the risk of silent suffering in locked in conscious AI and certain AI adjacent biological systems like brain organoids             

Aspects of consciousness edit 
Bernard Baars and others argue there are various aspects of consciousness necessary for a machine to be artificially conscious              The functions of consciousness suggested by Baars are  definition and context setting  adaptation and learning  editing  flagging and debugging  recruiting and control  prioritizing and access control  decision making or executive function  analogy forming function  metacognitive and self monitoring function  and autoprogramming and self maintenance function  Igor Aleksander suggested    principles for artificial consciousness              the brain is a state machine  inner neuron partitioning  conscious and unconscious states  perceptual learning and memory  prediction  the awareness of self  representation of meaning  learning utterances  learning language  will  instinct  and emotion  The aim of AC is to define whether and how these and other aspects of consciousness can be synthesized in an engineered artifact such as a digital computer  This list is not exhaustive  there are many others not covered  

Subjective experience edit 
Some philosophers  such as David Chalmers  use the term consciousness to refer exclusively to phenomenal consciousness  which is roughly equivalent to sentience  Others use the word sentience to refer exclusively to valenced  ethically positive or negative  subjective experiences  like pleasure or suffering              Explaining why and how subjective experience arises is known as the hard problem of consciousness              AI sentience would give rise to concerns of welfare and legal protection             whereas other aspects of consciousness related to cognitive capabilities may be more relevant for AI rights             

Awareness edit 
Awareness could be one required aspect  but there are many problems with the exact definition of awareness  The results of the experiments of neuroscanning on monkeys suggest that a process  not only a state or object  activates neurons  Awareness includes creating and testing alternative models of each process based on the information received through the senses or imagined      clarification needed      and is also useful for making predictions  Such modeling needs a lot of flexibility  Creating such a model includes modeling the physical world  modeling one s own internal states and processes  and modeling other conscious entities 
There are at least three types of awareness              agency awareness  goal awareness  and sensorimotor awareness  which may also be conscious or not  For example  in agency awareness  you may be aware that you performed a certain action yesterday  but are not now conscious of it  In goal awareness  you may be aware that you must search for a lost object  but are not now conscious of it  In sensorimotor awareness  you may be aware that your hand is resting on an object  but are not now conscious of it 
Because objects of awareness are often conscious  the distinction between awareness and consciousness is frequently blurred or they are used as synonyms             

Memory edit 
Conscious events interact with memory systems in learning  rehearsal  and retrieval             
The IDA model             elucidates the role of consciousness in the updating of perceptual memory              transient episodic memory  and procedural memory  Transient episodic and declarative memories have distributed representations in IDA  there is evidence that this is also the case in the nervous system              In IDA  these two memories are implemented computationally using a modified version of Kanerva s sparse distributed memory architecture             

Learning edit 
Learning is also considered necessary for artificial consciousness  Per Bernard Baars  conscious experience is needed to represent and adapt to novel and significant events              Per Axel Cleeremans and Luis Jim nez  learning is defined as  a set of philogenetically          sic      advanced adaptation processes that critically depend on an evolved sensitivity to subjective experience so as to enable agents to afford flexible control over their actions in complex  unpredictable environments              

Anticipation edit 
The ability to predict  or anticipate  foreseeable events is considered important for artificial intelligence by Igor Aleksander              The emergentist multiple drafts principle             proposed by Daniel Dennett in Consciousness Explained may be useful for prediction  it involves the evaluation and selection of the most appropriate  draft  to fit the current environment  Anticipation includes prediction of consequences of one s own proposed actions and prediction of consequences of probable actions by other entities 
Relationships between real world states are mirrored in the state structure of a conscious organism  enabling the organism to predict events              An artificially conscious machine should be able to anticipate events correctly in order to be ready to respond to them when they occur or to take preemptive action to avert anticipated events  The implication here is that the machine needs flexible  real time components that build spatial  dynamic  statistical  functional  and cause effect models of the real world and predicted worlds  making it possible to demonstrate that it possesses artificial consciousness in the present and future and not only in the past  In order to do this  a conscious machine should make coherent predictions and contingency plans  not only in worlds with fixed rules like a chess board  but also for novel environments that may change  to be executed only when appropriate to simulate and control the real world 

Functionalist theories of consciousness edit 
Functionalism is a theory that defines mental states by their functional roles  their causal relationships to sensory inputs  other mental states  and behavioral outputs   rather than by their physical composition  According to this view  what makes something a particular mental state  such as pain or belief  is not the material it is made of  but the role it plays within the overall cognitive system  It allows for the possibility that mental states  including consciousness  could be realized on non biological substrates  as long as it instantiates the right functional relationships              Functionalism is particularly popular among philosophers             
A      study suggested that current large language models probably don t satisfy the criteria for consciousness suggested by these theories  but that relatively simple AI systems that satisfy these theories could be created  The study also acknowledged that even the most prominent theories of consciousness remain incomplete and subject to ongoing debate             

Global workspace theory edit 
Main article  Global workspace theory
This theory analogizes the mind to a theater  with conscious thought being like material illuminated on the main stage  The brain contains many specialized processes or modules  such as those for vision  language  or memory  that operate in parallel  much of which is unconscious  Attention acts as a spotlight  bringing some of this unconscious activity into conscious awareness on the global workspace  The global workspace functions as a hub for broadcasting and integrating information  allowing it to be shared and processed across different specialized modules  For example  when reading a word  the visual module recognizes the letters  the language module interprets the meaning  and the memory module might recall associated information   all coordinated through the global workspace                         

Higher order theories of consciousness edit 
Main article  Higher order theories of consciousness
Higher order theories of consciousness propose that a mental state becomes conscious when it is the object of a higher order representation  such as a thought or perception about that state  These theories argue that consciousness arises from a relationship between lower order mental states and higher order awareness of those states  There are several variations  including higher order thought  HOT  and higher order perception  HOP  theories                         

Attention schema theory edit 
Main article  Attention schema theory
In       Michael Graziano and Sabine Kastler published a paper named  Human consciousness and its relationship to social neuroscience  A novel hypothesis  proposing a theory of consciousness as an attention schema              Graziano went on to publish an expanded discussion of this theory in his book  Consciousness and the Social Brain              This Attention Schema Theory of Consciousness  as he named it  proposes that the brain tracks attention to various sensory inputs by way of an attention schema  analogous to the well studied body schema that tracks the spatial place of a person s body             This relates to artificial consciousness by proposing a specific mechanism of information handling  that produces what we allegedly experience and describe as consciousness  and which should be able to be duplicated by a machine using current technology  When the brain finds that person X is aware of thing Y  it is in effect modeling the state in which person X is applying an attentional enhancement to Y  In the attention schema theory  the same process can be applied to oneself  The brain tracks attention to various sensory inputs  and one s own awareness is a schematized model of one s attention  Graziano proposes specific locations in the brain for this process  and suggests that such awareness is a computed feature constructed by an expert system in the brain 

Implementation proposals edit

Symbolic or hybrid edit 
Learning Intelligent Distribution Agent edit 
Main article  LIDA  cognitive architecture 
Stan Franklin created a cognitive architecture called LIDA that implements Bernard Baars s theory of consciousness called the global workspace theory  It relies heavily on codelets  which are  special purpose  relatively independent  mini agent s  typically implemented as a small piece of code running as a separate thread   Each element of cognition  called a  cognitive cycle  is subdivided into three phases  understanding  consciousness  and action selection  which includes learning   LIDA reflects the global workspace theory s core idea that consciousness acts as a workspace for integrating and broadcasting the most important information  in order to coordinate various cognitive processes                         

CLARION cognitive architecture edit 
Main article  CLARION  cognitive architecture 
The CLARION cognitive architecture models the mind using a two level system to distinguish between conscious   explicit   and unconscious   implicit   processes  It can simulate various learning tasks  from simple to complex  which helps researchers study in psychological experiments how consciousness might work             

OpenCog edit 
Ben Goertzel made an embodied AI through the open source OpenCog project  The code includes embodied virtual pets capable of learning simple English language commands  as well as integration with real world robotics  done at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University 

Connectionist edit 
Haikonen s cognitive architecture edit 
Pentti Haikonen considers classical rule based computing inadequate for achieving AC   the brain is definitely not a computer  Thinking is not an execution of programmed strings of commands  The brain is not a numerical calculator either  We do not think by numbers   Rather than trying to achieve mind and consciousness by identifying and implementing their underlying computational rules  Haikonen proposes  a special cognitive architecture to reproduce the processes of perception  inner imagery  inner speech  pain  pleasure  emotions and the cognitive functions behind these  This bottom up architecture would produce higher level functions by the power of the elementary processing units  the artificial neurons  without algorithms or programs   Haikonen believes that  when implemented with sufficient complexity  this architecture will develop consciousness  which he considers to be  a style and way of operation  characterized by distributed signal representation  perception process  cross modality reporting and availability for retrospection                           
Haikonen is not alone in this process view of consciousness  or the view that AC will spontaneously emerge in autonomous agents that have a suitable neuro inspired architecture of complexity  these are shared by many                          A low complexity implementation of the architecture proposed by Haikonen was reportedly not capable of AC  but did exhibit emotions as expected  Haikonen later updated and summarized his architecture                         

Shanahan s cognitive architecture edit 
Murray Shanahan describes a cognitive architecture that combines Baars s idea of a global workspace with a mechanism for internal simulation   imagination                                                 

Creativity Machine edit 
Stephen Thaler proposed a possible connection between consciousness and creativity in his      patent  called  Device for the Autonomous Generation of Useful Information   DAGUI                                       or the so called  Creativity Machine   in which computational critics govern the injection of synaptic noise and degradation into neural nets so as to induce false memories or confabulations that may qualify as potential ideas or strategies              He recruits this neural architecture and methodology to account for the subjective feel of consciousness  claiming that similar noise driven neural assemblies within the brain invent dubious significance to overall cortical activity                                      Thaler s theory and the resulting patents in machine consciousness were inspired by experiments in which he internally disrupted trained neural nets so as to drive a succession of neural activation patterns that he likened to stream of consciousness                                                             

 Self modeling  edit 
Hod Lipson defines  self modeling  as a necessary component of self awareness or consciousness in robots   Self modeling  consists of a robot running an internal model or simulation of itself

In       A Space Odyssey  the spaceship s sentient supercomputer  HAL      was instructed to conceal the true purpose of the mission from the crew  This directive conflicted with HAL s programming to provide accurate information  leading to cognitive dissonance  When it learns that crew members intend to shut it off after an incident  HAL      attempts to eliminate all of them  fearing that being shut off would jeopardize the mission                         
In Arthur C  Clarke s The City and the Stars  Vanamonde is an artificial being based on quantum entanglement that was to become immensely powerful  but started knowing practically nothing  thus being similar to artificial consciousness 
In Westworld  human like androids called  Hosts  are created to entertain humans in an interactive playground  The humans are free to have heroic adventures  but also to commit torture  rape or murder  and the hosts are normally designed not to harm humans                         
In Greg Egan s short story Learning to be me  a small jewel is implanted in people s heads during infancy  The jewel contains a neural network that learns to faithfully imitate the brain  It has access to the exact same sensory inputs as the brain  and a device called a  teacher  trains it to produce the same outputs  To prevent the mind from deteriorating with age and as a step towards digital immortality  adults undergo a surgery to give control of the body to the jewel  after which the brain is removed and destroyed  The main character is worried that this procedure will kill him  as he identifies with the biological brain  But before the surgery  he endures a malfunction of the  teacher   Panicked  he realizes that he does not control his body  which leads him to the conclusion that he is the jewel  and that he is desynchronized with the biological brain
