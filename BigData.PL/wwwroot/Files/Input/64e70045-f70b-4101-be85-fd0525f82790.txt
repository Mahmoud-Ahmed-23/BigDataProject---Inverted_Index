These datasets are used in machine learning  ML  research and have been cited in peer reviewed academic journals  Datasets are an integral part of the field of machine learning  Major advances in this field can result from advances in learning algorithms  such as deep learning   computer hardware  and  less intuitively  the availability of high quality training datasets             High quality labeled training datasets for supervised and semi supervised machine learning algorithms are usually difficult and expensive to produce because of the large amount of time needed to label the data  Although they do not need to be labeled  high quality datasets for unsupervised learning can also be difficult and costly to produce                                  
Many organizations  including governments  publish and share their datasets  The datasets are classified  based on the licenses  as Open data and Non Open data 
The datasets from various governmental bodies are presented in List of open government data sites  The datasets are ported on open data portals  They are made available for searching  depositing and accessing through interfaces like Open API   The datasets are made available as various sorted types and subtypes
