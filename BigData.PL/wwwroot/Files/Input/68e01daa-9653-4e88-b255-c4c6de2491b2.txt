Early life and education edit 
Karel  apek was born in      in the village of Mal  Svato ovice in the Bohemian mountains  However  six months after his birth  the  apek family moved to their own house in  pice              Karel  apek s father  Anton n  apek  worked as a doctor at the local textile factory              Anton n was a very active person  apart from his work as a doctor  he also co funded the local museum and was a member of the town council             
Despite opposing his father s materialist and positivist views  Karel  apek loved and admired his father  later calling him  a good example          of the generation of national awakeners               Karel s mother  Bo ena  apkov   was a homemaker              Unlike her husband  she did not like life in the country  and she suffered from long term depression              Despite that  she assiduously collected and recorded local folklore  such as legends  songs and stories              Karel was the youngest of three siblings  He would maintain an especially close relationship with his brother Josef  a highly successful painter  living and working with him throughout his adult life              His sister  Helena  was a talented pianist who later become a writer and published several memoirs about Karel and Josef             
After finishing elementary school in  pice  Karel moved with his grandmother to Hradec Kr lov   where he started attending high school  Two years later the school expelled him for taking part in an illegal students  club               apek later described the club as a  very non murderous anarchist society              
After this incident he moved to Brno with his sister and attempted to finish high school there  but two years later he moved again  to Prague  where he finished high school at the Academic Grammar School in                               During his teenage years  apek became enamored with the visual arts  especially Cubism  which influenced his later writing             
After graduating from high school  he studied philosophy and aesthetics in Prague at Charles University  but he also spent some time at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin and at the Sorbonne University in Paris                          While still a university student he wrote some works on contemporary art and literature              He graduated with a doctorate of philosophy in                  

World War I and Interwar period edit 
Exempted from military service due to the spinal problems that would haunt him his whole life   apek observed World War I from Prague  His political views were strongly affected by the war  and as a budding journalist he began to write on topics like nationalism  totalitarianism and consumerism              Through social circles  the young author developed close relationships with many of the political leaders of the nascent Czechoslovak state  including Tom   Garrigue Masaryk  Czechoslovak patriot and the first President of Czechoslovakia  and his son Jan Masaryk                          who would later become minister of foreign affairs  T  G  Masaryk was a regular guest at  apek s  Friday Men  garden parties for leading Czech intellectuals   apek was also a member of Masaryk s Hrad political network              Their frequent conversations on various topics later served as the basis for  apek s book Talks with T  G  Masaryk             

Tomb of Karel  apek and Olga Scheinpflugov  at Vy ehrad cemetery
 apek began his writing career as a journalist  With his brother Josef  he worked as an editor for the Czech paper N rodn  listy  The National Newspaper  from October      to April                   Upon leaving  he and Josef joined the staff of Lidov  noviny  The People s Paper  in April                  
 apek s early attempts at fiction were short stories and plays for the most part written with his brother Josef                          His first international success was R U R   a dystopian work about a bad day at a factory populated with sentient androids  The play was translated into English in       and was being performed in the UK and America by       Throughout the     s   apek worked in many writing genres  producing both fiction and non fiction  but worked primarily as a journalist 
In the     s   apek s work focused on the threat of brutal national socialist and fascist dictatorships  by the mid     s   apek had become  an outspoken anti fascist               He also became a member of International PEN Club  He established  and was the first president of the Czechoslovak PEN Club             

Late life and death edit 
In       he married actress Olga Scheinpflugov   after a long acquaintance                          In       it became clear that the Western allies  namely France and the United Kingdom  would fail to fulfil the pre war treaty agreements  and they refused to defend Czechoslovakia against Nazi Germany  Although offered the chance to go to exile in England   apek refused to leave his country        even though the Nazi Gestapo had named him  public enemy number two               While repairing flood damage to his family s summer house in Star  Hu   he contracted a common cold              As he had suffered all his life from spondyloarthritis and was also a heavy smoker  Karel  apek died of pneumonia  on    December                  
Surprisingly  the Gestapo was not aware of his death  Several months later  just after the German invasion of Czechoslovakia  Nazi agents came to the  apek family house in Prague to arrest him              Upon discovering that he had already been dead for some time  they arrested and interrogated his wife Olga  She was later released and lived until       she died onstage of a heart attack while performing one of her husband s plays              His brother Josef was arrested in September and eventually died in the Bergen Belsen concentration camp in April                   Karel  apek and his wife are buried at the Vy ehrad Cemetery in Prague  The inscription on the tombstone reads   Here Josef  apek  painter and poet  would have been buried  Grave far away              

Writing edit 
Karel  apek s handwriting
Karel  apek wrote on a wide variety of subjects  His works are known for their precise description of reality               apek is renowned for his work with the Czech language                         
He is known as a science fiction author who wrote before science fiction became widely recognized as a separate genre  Many of his works also discuss ethical aspects of industrial inventions and processes already anticipated in the first half of the   th century  These include mass production  nuclear weapons and intelligent artificial beings such as robots or androids  His most productive years were during the First Republic of Czechoslovakia                  citation needed     
 apek also expressed fear of social disasters  dictatorship  violence  human stupidity  the unlimited power of corporations  and greed  He tried to find hope  and a way out 
From the     s onward his work became increasingly anti fascist  anti militarist  and critical of what he saw as  irrationalism              
Ivan Kl ma  in his biography of  apek  notes his influence on modern Czech literature  as well as on the development of Czech as a written language   apek  along with contemporaries like Jaroslav Ha ek              spawned part of the early   th century revival in written Czech thanks to their decision to use the vernacular  Kl ma writes   It is thanks to  apek that the written Czech language grew closer to the language people actually spoke                apek was also a translator  and his translations from French poetry inspired a new generation of Czech poets             
His books and plays include detective stories  novels  fairy tales and theatre plays  and even a book on gardening             
His most important works attempt to resolve problems of epistemology  to answer the question   What is knowledge   Examples include Tales from Two Pockets  and the first book of the trilogy of novels Hordubal  Meteor  and An Ordinary Life  He also co wrote  with his brother Josef  the libretto for Zden k Folprecht s opera L sky hra osudn  in                  
After World War II   apek s work was only reluctantly accepted by the communist government of Czechoslovakia  in office             because during his life he had refused to accept communism as a viable alternative  He was the first in a series of influential non Marxist intellectuals who wrote a newspaper essay in a series called  Why I am not a Communist              
In          years after his death   a book was published containing extensive correspondence by Karel  apek  in which the writer discusses pacifism and his conscientious objection to military service with lawyer Jind ich Groag from Brno  Until then  only a portion of these letters were known             

Arthur Miller wrote in       
I read Karel  apek for the first time when I was a college student long ago in the Thirties  There was no writer like him     prophetic assurance mixed with surrealistic humour and hard edged social satire  a unique combination   he is a joy to read             


Etymology of robot edit 
R U R  theatrical poster      
Karel  apek introduced and made popular the frequently used international word robot  which first appeared in his play R U R  in       While it is frequently thought that he was the originator of the word  he wrote a short letter in reference to an article in the Oxford English Dictionary etymology in which he named his brother  painter and writer Josef  apek  as its actual inventor                         
In an article in the Czech journal Lidov  noviny in       he also explained that he had originally wanted to call the creatures labo i  from Latin labor  work   However  he did not like the word  seeing it as too artificial  and sought advice from his brother Josef  who suggested roboti  robots in English              
The word robot comes from the word robota  The word robota means literally  corv e    serf labor   and figuratively  drudgery  or  hard work  in Czech  It also means  work    labor  in colloquial Slovak  archaic Czech  and many other Slavic languages  e g   Bulgarian  Russian  Serbian  Polish  Macedonian  Ukrainian  etc    It derives from the reconstructed Proto Slavic word  orbota  meaning  work  hard work  obligatory work for the king  or a short form used for plowing  

Awards and honours edit
