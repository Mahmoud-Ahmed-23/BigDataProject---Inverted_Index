							The Sons of Denmark feature debut of Danish film director Ulaa Salim premiered at the International Film Festival Rotterdam  IFFR  this year causing serious debate about the possible outcome if right wing politics takes over Europe  
Salim  who was born in      in Denmark  studied at the National Film School of Denmark  He used his personal experience as his inspiration to make his film  Together with his partner and producer Daniel M hlendorph  he created the production company Hyanene Film  Salim       s short film debut Our Fathers        Sons        was also shown at the IFFR  His first feature  Sons of Denmark         had its world premiere in Rotterdam  The film takes place a year after a deadly bomb attack in Denmark  where ultra nationalist politician Martin Nordahl and his National Movement are leading in the polls  Influenced by his unabashedly anti immigrant rhetoric  society has rapidly turned against ethnic minorities  especially those with an Arab background 
Salem started writing his script in       where the refugee crisis and the rise of the fascist right wing were not yet at their peak  however  two years after when he re pitched his idea to his instructors  his script became even more relevant to the dark contemporary reality  Although Salem s film is in the future  his script cannot be more relatable  in a time where presidents and politicians blame their failed policies on immigrants or other conspiracies  
In this climate     year old Zakaria feels compelled to act to protect his safety as well as that of his  family s  But  to do what he feels is necessary to turn the political tide  he needs to abandon his mother and little brother  Hence  Zakaria gets involved in a radical organisation  where he forms a bond with Ali  The two men cannot agree with the current state of the country  which is turning on its own citizens because of their immigrant background  and decide to act  However  they are both just tools in the hands of people with power  As the men try to make their mark  their brotherhood will be tested and their actions will have grave consequences on their lives 
Daily News Egypt interviewed Salim to discuss the significance of the film amid the current political situation and to analyse the character of his film  the transcript for which is below  lightly edited for clarity 
How long did it take you to write the script and make the film  And what were the stages that the script went through 
The script took about six years to write and make  The idea started when I enrolled in the Danish Film School but when I showed instructors the first drafts they got scared and said that is it too exaggerated and too violent  And two years later  when I had something concrete to show them and when the political and social scenes were already intensified  they said  yes  that maybe how the world might look like   
When was the first day of shooting 
The first day after I graduated from film school  we went and started looking for methods to fund the film  It took us about a year to find the funds  and we started in      and finished later in the year  
How do you see the significance of the film amid the current political and social contexts both in Europe  the Middle East and North Africa which are seeing a clear rise of right wing inclinations  Also how did you research the details for the film 
I hope that it  the film  will not be  affiliated  with right wing or left wing politics  But I hope that people will see and question what the society we are living in  I didn       t make the film as a political statement  or against one thing  I wanted to make it against all extreme voices  As for research  we read and researched how such politicians rise to power and how young men can become extreme  We watched a lot  but you decide as a filmmaker and you create your characters and use your fantasies  Any other human being that makes this same film  they will make it in their own way  There is no right way to write this film 
The character of Malik played by Zaki Youssef is one of the most complex and complicated characters in the film  He is stuck between different lives  and he manages to do both  What contradictions were written with his character 
Malik s character always wanted to do the right thing and at the same time he saw the world from two points of view  and that is what made it really complex because no one is really wrong in this story  I didn t want anyone to be completely bad or completely good  I wanted to make everybody in a mix  The idea behind that is to show that everyone has several layers to them than just your typical good guy or bad guy  And it       s important to note that this is a fiction film  I take things from real life and put them in exaggerated scopes  and other things are reflected from things I have seen or experienced   Even the right wing politician Noah played by Rasmus Bjerg  you see him playing with his children and being nice  
As the for the character of Zakaria which is played by Mohammed Ismail Mohammed  did you plan from the start to make it the spearhead of the film s opening and then shift the plot s focus to another character  Also in the two sides of the story there are individuals who feel division and violence  who push the film s characters to reach their limits  Can you tell us more about those characters 
This twist was scripted and was done from the start  We wanted to show people what they might think they know and then show them around  to give weight and more complexity to the film and the characters  As for inciting  but unrevealed characters  there is one character who is named Hassan and is played by Imad Abul Foul  he is like a politician  We get to see him from a lower point of view  where he is in charge of his little society  He is the equivalent of the character of Rasmus Bjerg who plays the right wing politician  Both incite people around them to commit violence but they don t take active roles  
I am not sure whether you conform to the idea that films have to have messages  If so what kind of message you want to send to a both a Danish audience and an international audience 
It s not one message  It s not like you have to understand this or feel this  It       s a discussion of what happens when the extreme becomes normal  What will happen in a society  What do you think will happen in a society when this happens  What do you think will happen  I want the audience to think for themselves  The film has a lot from the Danish features like the music the protagonist listens to which implies that this is just another Danish young guy like everybody else  But internationally  at the end of the day  I believe that every society has its own problems  and is dealing with extreme voices on both sides  I hope the film will engage every country 
The imagery of the film is very rich  as well as the usage of colours  which when combined with the night scenes created a depressing and pessimistic mood  Was this intentional 
We tried to think that red was Zakaria s colour in the first part  while the second part of the film the green colour was predominant during the role of Malik  The third part came when Malik started to feel Zakaria s position with a different colour   I also wanted to have a documentary feeling  but visually I aimed not to have a documentary feeling  Visually I wanted to have a beautiful and bold film  and at the same time I wanted to have the documentary feeling when it came to the relationships between characters
