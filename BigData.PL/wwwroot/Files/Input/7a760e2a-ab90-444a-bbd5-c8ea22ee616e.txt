A tactile sensor is a device that measures information arising from physical interaction with its environment  Tactile sensors are generally modeled after the biological sense of cutaneous touch which is capable of detecting stimuli resulting from mechanical stimulation  temperature  and pain  although pain sensing is not common in artificial tactile sensors   Tactile sensors are used in robotics  computer hardware and security systems  A common application of tactile sensors is in touchscreen devices on mobile phones and computing 
Tactile sensors may be of different types including piezoresistive  piezoelectric  optical  capacitive and elastoresistive sensors            


Uses edit 
Tactile sensors appear in everyday life such as elevator buttons and lamps which dim or brighten by touching the base  There are also innumerable other applications for tactile sensors of which most people are never aware 
Sensors that measure very small changes must have very high sensitivities  Sensors need to be designed to have a small effect on what is measured  making the sensor smaller often improves this and may introduce other advantages  Tactile sensors can be used to test the performance of all types of applications  For example  these sensors have been used in the manufacturing of automobiles  brakes  clutches  door seals  gasket   battery lamination  bolted joints  fuel cells etc 
Tactile imaging  as a medical imaging modality  translating the sense of touch into a digital image is based on the tactile sensors  Tactile imaging closely mimics manual palpation  since the probe of the device with a pressure sensor array mounted on its face acts similar to human fingers during clinical examination  deforming soft tissue by the probe and detecting resulting changes in the pressure pattern 
Robots designed to interact with objects requiring handling involving precision  dexterity  or interaction with unusual objects  need sensory apparatus which is functionally equivalent to a human s tactile ability  Tactile sensors have been developed for use with robots                                       better      source      needed      Tactile sensors can complement visual systems by providing added information when the robot begins to grip an object  At this time vision is no longer sufficient  as the mechanical properties of the object cannot be determined by vision alone  Determining weight  texture  stiffness  center of mass  curvature  coefficient of friction  and thermal conductivity require object interaction and some sort of tactile sensing 
Several classes of tactile sensors are used in robots of different kinds  for tasks spanning collision avoidance and manipulation      citation needed      Some methods for simultaneous localization and mapping are based on tactile sensors            

Pressure sensor arrays edit 
Pressure sensor arrays are large grids of tactels  A  tactel  is a  tactile element   Each tactel is capable of detecting normal forces  Tactel based sensors provide a high resolution  image  of the contact surface  Alongside spatial resolution and force sensitivity  systems integration questions such as wiring and signal routing are important             Pressure sensor arrays are available in thin film form  They are primarily used as analytical tools used in the manufacturing and R amp D processes by engineers and technicians  and have been adapted for use in robots  Examples of such sensors available to consumers include arrays built from conductive rubber             lead zirconate titanate  PZT   polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF   PVDF TrFE              FET              and metallic capacitive sensing                         elements 

Optically based tactile sensors edit 
Several kinds of tactile sensors have been developed that take advantage of camera like technology to provide high resolution data 
A key exemplar is the Gelsight technology first developed at MIT which uses a camera behind an opaque gel layer to
achieve high resolution tactile feedback                           The Samsung   See through your skin  STS  sensor uses a semi transparent gel to produce combined tactile and optical imaging             

Strain gauge rosettes edit 
Strain gauges rosettes are constructed from multiple strain gauges  with each gauge detecting the force in a particular direction  When the information from each strain gauge is combined  the information allows determination of a pattern of forces or torques

Biologically inspired tactile sensors edit 
A variety of biologically inspired designs have been suggested ranging from simple whisker like sensors which measure only one point at a time              through more advanced fingertip like sensors                                      to complete skin like sensors as on the latest iCub     citation needed       Biologically inspired tactile sensors often incorporate more than one sensing strategy  For example  they might detect both the distribution of pressures  and the pattern of forces that would come from pressure sensor arrays and strain gauge rosettes  allowing two point discrimination and force sensing  with human like ability 
Advanced versions of biologically designed tactile sensors include vibration sensing which has been determined to be important for understanding interactions between the tactile sensor and objects where the sensor slides over the object  Such interactions are now understood to be important for human tool use and judging the texture even curvature of an object                         One such sensor combines force sensing  vibration sensing  and heat transfer sensing            
A recent breakthrough bioinspired tactile sensor that lets robots  feel  their surroundings with       precision  enabling blind navigation     mm accuracy  and texture recognition      success   Its ultra robust design withstands extreme deformations for reliable operation in real world environments             

DIY and open hardware tactile sensors edit 
Recently  a sophisticated tactile sensor has been made open hardware  enabling enthusiasts and hobbyists to experiment with an otherwise expensive technology              Furthermore  with the advent of cheap optical cameras  novel sensors have been proposed which can be built easily and cheaply with a  D printer

    Tactile sensors also come in the form of pressure indicating films that reveal pressure distribution and magnitude between contacting surfaces by virtue of an immediate and permanent color change  These pressure indicating films are one time use sensor that capture the maximum pressure they were exposed to  Pressure indicating films are activated by chemical reaction and are non electronic sensors   Robotic Tactile Sensing   Technologies and System
