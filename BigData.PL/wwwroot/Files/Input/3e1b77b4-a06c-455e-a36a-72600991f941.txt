In your opinion  what distinguishes Egypt in its relation with Korea  And how do you evaluate the Korea Egypt relationship  especially as the next year marks this partnership s   th anniversary 
Egypt is strategically located at the crossroads linking the Middle East  Africa and Europe  It is home to a dynamic and vibrant young population  The Egyptian government has demonstrated a clear vision for sustainable growth through national initiatives such as        Egypt Vision              which emphasizes innovation driven economic development  digital transformation  and green energy projects 
All these factors provide precious opportunities for investment  cultural exchanges  and development cooperation  in addition to joint action to address global agenda  Moreover  for the last    years  both countries have made tremendous achievements in terms of development

In       the Korean government chose Egypt as a priority development partner  so why did Korea choose Egypt  And how did this impact the bilateral relations  and KOICA s activities in Egypt 
Egypt s regional presence  coupled with its extensive FTA network and youthful population  positions it as a vital partner for regional and global development  The country s growth potential  bolstered by its dynamic leadership and expanding economy  makes it a natural choice for strengthened cooperation  Since the      Korea Egypt Joint Declaration and the      Korea Egypt summit  our two nations have been working to deepen collaboration in transportation  energy  ICT  and education 
Recognizing Egypt s pivotal role  the Korean government designated it as a priority partner for Official Development Assistance  ODA  in       This has catalyzed initiatives focused on education  public administration  transportation  environmental sustainability  and digital transformation 
 
How do you see Egypt s role and contributions to the success of the      Korea Africa Summit 
In May  ahead of the summit  Prime Minister Madbouly convened a strategic meeting with representatives from    prominent Korean companies operating in Egypt including Samsung  LG and Hyundai  to discuss ways to bolster economic and social cooperation between our two countries  During the summit  Minister of International Cooperation Rania Al Mashat headed the Egyptian delegation to Korea  and both governments produced fruitful outcomes on common areas of interest ranging from development cooperation to business  Thanks to Egypt       s participation  the      Korea Africa Summit served as an opportunity to further expand and accelerate our partnership

What are KOICA s priorities in terms of its cooperation with Egypt  What are the development cooperation sectors that need to be bolstered 
KOICA is committed to fostering mutual prosperity and shared interests through strengthened development cooperation  Our collaborative efforts focus on key areas such as economic and social development  youth empowerment  human capital development  climate change mitigation  and the promotion of peace and justice  In Egypt  we believe that development cooperation can serve as a catalyst for economic growth by enhancing technical education  empowering youth  and improving government services through digital efficiency  Additionally  our work aims to promote social inclusion  particularly for women and vulnerable groups  including refugees

What are the key pillars of your programmes and projects in Egypt 
KOICA       s Country Plan for cooperation with Egypt focuses on three priority pillars  providing technical education for youth  supporting the digitalization of government services and systems  and implementing programs to combat gender based violence  empower women  and support vulnerable groups

KOICA is known for being so advanced in technology  so in your opinion how the projects of KOICA have supported Egypt in being a digitalized country 
Digital transformation has a profound impact on people       s lives  Korea has accumulated a wealth of experience and expertise in the digital transformation of government services  digital government being a key area of KOICA       s ODA  Official Development Assistance  projects  Korea itself has emerged as a global leader in digital government  consistently ranking highly in international assessments by the World Bank  UN  OECD 
Egypt  with its growing need for digitalization and strong potential in policy  infrastructure  industry  and the private sector  is well positioned for progress  The KOICA Egypt office is currently developing a        Digital Transformation Program Result Framework         set to launch next year  This framework will outline a long term partnership strategy between Korea and Egypt  identifying key projects to support Egypt       s        Digital Egypt        initiative 

 nbsp 
As we know that gender equality is a core pillar in KOICA s projects  so how do you think these gender projects impact the women empowerment in Egypt 
We aim to support all women and girls  including refugees  who are affected by gender based violence and face discrimination that limits their full economic and social participation  In partnership with the National Council of Women of Egypt and UN agencies such as UNFPA  UN Women  WFP  and UNHCR  we are implementing projects to prevent and respond to violence in families  schools  workplaces  and communities  Our efforts empower women and girls to become resilient and self reliant  contributing to the full realization of their potential and building a more inclusive  prosperous nation 
 nbsp 
Korea is advanced in the technical and educational education  how could Egypt benefit from this experience  
The Egyptian labor market has been increasingly in demand of technical education graduates equipped with not only theoretical knowledge but also practical skills that match fast changing industrial trends in Egypt  Our strategy is to engage more deeply with private sector partners in key aspects of technical education  including joint development of curriculum  long term internships  and other forms of university industry cooperation 
Through KOICA       s support  the students of Beni Suef Technological University  have benefited from an internship program with Samsung       s local branch  Beni Suef Technological University is now collaborating with KOICA and Hyundai Rotem  which is actively participating in the Egyptian government s nation wide railway system transformation projects

Could you talk about KOICA s upcoming projects and programs in the near and medium term  and the key areas of focus 
Given Egypt s potential and challenges  including pressing issues such as climate change  food security  population growth  and the global trend toward digital transformation  there are significant opportunities for deeper cooperation between Korea and Egypt through joint initiatives 
KOICA has recently launched several signature programs focusing on key development areas such as digital  health  and agriculture across Africa  In this vein  the KOICA Egypt Office is collaborating with relevant ministries on the        Inclusive Digital Education Access        project  which aims to build the digital competencies of both teachers and students  as well as improve digital learning management skills for basic education 
Green development is another important part of our focus for Egypt  KOICA has long standing partnerships with technical education institutions in Egypt  We are currently working with the Productivity Vocational Training Department  PVTD  under the Ministry of Transport and Industry on a project to enhance the quality of vocational training for automotive maintenance  especially for eco friendly vehicles including LNG and electric cars

How do you envision the future of the relationship between KOICA and Egypt in terms of the development cooperation 
Africa  as the youngest and fastest growing continent  faces pressing challenges such as climate change  food insecurity  and health crises  Within this context  Egypt plays a strategic and influential role as a leader in the region 
The recent Korea Africa Summit reaffirmed Korea s commitment to expanding development cooperation  including a pledge to provide     billion in ODA by      and initiatives like the Tech Africa program to drive digital innovation and opportunities for youth  Within this broader framework  Egypt stands out as a model for successful development initiatives  including digital transformation and vocational training 
Looking ahead  the relationship between KOICA and Egypt will continue to grow  with an emphasis on leveraging Egypt s achievements to promote South South cooperation  The MOU between KOICA and the Egyptian Agency of Partnership for Development  EAPD  is a testament to this vision  as it aims to share Egypt s development successes with neighboring nations  We anticipate expanded collaboration in areas like green technology  digital education  and public governance  with the positive impacts extending across Africa
