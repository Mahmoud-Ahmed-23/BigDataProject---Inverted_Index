							Rasha Abdel Aal  Head of the Egyptian Tax Authority  ETA   has announced that a comprehensive guide on the tax treatment of exported services is currently under preparation  The guide aims to provide a unified  accurate  and widely accepted reference for businesses and tax professionals  addressing ongoing ambiguities in the tax system 
Her remarks came during a virtual seminar hosted by Deloitte Egypt  which brought together representatives from companies  tax consultants  and experts to discuss recent tax facility initiatives introduced by the government to support the business environment and simplify procedures 
Abdel Aal explained that earlier directives issued to clarify the taxation of exported services had inadvertently created confusion during implementation  leading to their cancellation a move broadly welcomed by the professional community  She emphasized the importance of direct engagement with taxpayers as a core strategy to resolve challenges and ensure practical  transparent tax administration 
She noted that the first phase of tax facilities has delivered measurable benefits  including improved voluntary compliance  higher tax revenue  and a significant number of taxpayers filing amended returns to benefit from the new provisions  These measures have also helped settle a large number of outstanding tax disputes and strengthened trust between the Tax Authority and the business community 

VAT refunds  Abdel Aal said  remain a top priority for the Authority and receive direct oversight from the Minister of Finance  As part of the current reforms  the Tax Authority aims to increase the volume of VAT refund cases by three to four times  with recent changes already reducing average processing time to about    days  However  she acknowledged that challenges remain and called on taxpayers to submit accurate and complete documentation now clearly outlined on the Authority s website to further streamline the refund process 
Abdel Aal reiterated that effective implementation is essential to successful tax policy  From the launch of the tax facility package  the Authority has focused on promoting tax fairness  ease of compliance  and constructive partnership with taxpayers across all provinces 
She also highlighted efforts to support small enterprises with annual revenues of up to EGP   m through a simplified tax system  This is part of a broader strategy to encourage businesses in the informal sector to integrate into the formal economy  The simplified framework aims to ease both tax and procedural burdens  but participation requires registration in the electronic invoicing and receipt systems 
To support this transition  the Ministry of Finance and the Tax Authority are providing technical assistance and training to help small businesses adopt the system  This includes facilitating electronic signature issuance  offering point of sale  POS  devices  and covering associated costs all aimed at accelerating the digital transformation of commercial operations and enhancing tax compliance 
Abdel Aal also underscored the important role of certified accountants in supporting the tax system  She announced the activation of a pre ruling system that provides binding guidance on the tax implications of future transactions  helping investors make informed decisions and comply with tax laws with greater certainty 
She further noted that the Authority is addressing issues related to the registration of virtual permanent establishments  Coordination between the General Directorate of International Agreements and the Corporate Tax Department is underway to streamline the registration process  New instructions on registration and profit allocation for virtual permanent establishments aligned with international standards are also under consideration
