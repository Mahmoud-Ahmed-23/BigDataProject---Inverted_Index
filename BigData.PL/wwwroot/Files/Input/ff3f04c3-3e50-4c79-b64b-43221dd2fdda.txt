Manchester United announced signing Cristiano Ronaldo on Tuesday evening  in a sensational return of the Portuguese international to his former club  coming from Italy s giants Juventus 



The huge transfer cost the Red Devils up to    m     m   and gave the  Don  the chance to play again at Old Trafford 



Ronaldo  aka CR   moved to Man United back in      at the age of    years  coming from Sporting Lisbon  to play for   seasons  during which he scored     goals in     games  winning the English Premier League title three times  Ronaldo also won his first UEFA Champions League trophy and first FIFA Ballon d       Or in      with Man United 



In       he joined Real Madrid  to win four FIFA Ballon d       Or awards and four Champions League titles 



       Manchester United has always had a special place in my heart and I have been overwhelmed by all the messages I       ve received since the announcement  I can       t wait to play again at Old Trafford  in a crowded stadium  to see the fans again         Ronaldo said in a statement 



       I am looking forward to joining the team after the international break  and I hope we will have a very successful season         he added 



Ronaldo is expected to play his first game with Manchester United against Newcastle United on    September 



The English club fans seemed really excited to see the five time Ballon d       Or winner play again for their team  as they chanted his name and raised his picture in the last league match of the Red Devils in which they defeated Wolverhampton     



The investment in Ronaldo  who is set to become the highest paid player in the Premier League  is increasing pressure on the team s coach Solskjaer to win his first major title with the Red Devils since joining in December      



Man United also signed Ronaldo       s former Real Madrid teammate  Raphael Varane  to strengthen their defence  They also paid    m to sign    year old English winger Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund  in their quest to win their first league title since      



Solskjaer said         I am delighted to see him  Ronaldo  return to where it all began        



Man United have collected seven points from their first three league games  ranking the second in the standings  two points behind the table leaders Tottenham 



Man United have not also won the UEFA Champions League since       when Ronaldo scored the winner against Chelsea in Moscow 



Nevertheless  Ronaldo       s experience in Italy could be a warning that his scoring prowess did not guarantee European success 



In the three seasons he spent in Juventus  they failed to go beyond the quarter finals in the Champions League
