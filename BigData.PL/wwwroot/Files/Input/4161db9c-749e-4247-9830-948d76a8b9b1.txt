							Orascom Development Holding  the Swiss hotel operator company owned by Samih Sawiris  reported Tuesday that their net profit has registered CHF     m       m   which is deemed the first biannual net profit since      
In the corresponding period in       the company has recorded CHF   m       m  in net loss  blaming the political events and saying that it had affected the group s operations 
The net profit was attributed to the company s savings of      m compared to the cost base of      and strong real estate and construction revenues  which compensated for a weaker hotel performance and the deconsolidation of Orascom Housing Communities  OHC  
 The successful carve out of the budget housing operations and construction segment in Egypt marks an important milestone in further reducing the group s cost base   the company said in a Monday statement 
In the first half of       the company s revenues increased by    registering       m compared to       m in the same period in       the statement said  adding that the real estate and construction segment has doubled its revenues 
The company is expecting an improvement in the hotel performance during the second half of      after it has suffered from travel bans to the Sinai Peninsula and general travel warnings on the Red Sea area imposed by several European countries since       following the ouster of former Islamist President Mohamed Morsi 
On Tuesday  the Egyptian Resorts Company  ERC  announced that the cancellation of a plan to acquire a group of assets from Orascom Hotels Development  OHD   part of the mother company Orascom Development Holding  as a result of the inability to reach a  final agreement to finalise the deal  
The two companies have signed earlier this year a Memorandum of Understanding allowing ERC to initially acquire a majority stake in OHD  which is comprised of around   hotels and an underdeveloped bank in Sahl Hasheesh  worth EGP    bn  bn 
However  the board members said that they will look for other opportunities to maximise their revenues over the coming period 
ERC noted on Tuesday that they have registered a net loss of EGP     m in the first half of       compared to an EGP     m net loss in the corresponding period last year
