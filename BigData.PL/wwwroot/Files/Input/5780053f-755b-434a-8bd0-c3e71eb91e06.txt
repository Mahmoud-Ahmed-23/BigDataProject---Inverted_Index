Lean is a proof assistant and a functional programming language             It is based on the calculus of constructions with inductive types  It is an open source project hosted on GitHub  Development is currently supported by the non profit Lean Focused Research Organization  FRO  


History edit 
Lean was developed primarily by Leonardo de Moura while employed by Microsoft Research and now Amazon Web Services  and has had significant contributions from other coauthors and collaborators during its history  
It was launched by Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft Research in                  The initial versions of the language  later known as Lean   and    were experimental and contained features such as support for homotopy type theory   based foundations that were later dropped 
Lean    first released Jan           was the first moderately stable version of Lean  It was implemented primarily in C   with some features written in Lean itself  After version       Lean   was officially end of lifed while development of Lean   began  In this interim period members of the Lean community developed and released unofficial versions up to        
In       Lean   was released  which was a reimplementation of the Lean theorem prover capable of producing C code which is then compiled  enabling the development of efficient domain specific automation             Lean   also contains a macro system and improved type class synthesis and memory management procedures over the previous version  Another benefit compared to Lean   is the ability to avoid touching C   code in order to modify the frontend and other key parts of the core system  as they are now all implemented in Lean and available to the end user to be overridden as needed            
Lean   is not backwards compatible with Lean              
In       the Lean FRO was formed  with the goals of improving the language s scalability and usability  and implementing proof automation            

Overview edit 
Libraries edit 
The official lean package includes a standard library batteries  which implements common data structures that may be used for both mathematical research and more conventional software development            
In       a community maintained project to develop a Lean library mathlib began  with the goal to digitize as much of pure mathematics as possible in one large cohesive library  up to research level mathematics                        As of May       mathlib had formalized over         theorems and         definitions in Lean             

Editors integration edit 
Lean integrates with             

Visual Studio Code
Neovim
Emacs
Interfacing is done via a client extension and Language Server Protocol server 
It has native support for Unicode symbols  which can be typed using LaTeX like sequences  such as   times  for      Lean can also be compiled to JavaScript and accessed in a web browser and has extensive support for meta programming 

Examples  Lean    edit 
The natural numbers can be defined as an inductive type  This definition is based on the Peano axioms and states that every natural number is either zero or the successor of some other natural number 

inductive Nat   Type
  zero   Nat
  succ   Nat   Nat

Addition of natural numbers can be defined recursively  using pattern matching  

def Nat add   Nat   Nat   Nat
  n  Nat zero     gt  n                         n       n  
  n  Nat succ m   gt  Nat succ  Nat add n m     n   succ m    succ n   m 

This is a simple proof of 
  
    
      
         
        P
          x     
        Q
         
        
          x  f  
        
         
        Q
          x     
        P
         
      
    
      displaystyle  P wedge Q  implies  Q wedge P  
  
 for two propositions P and Q  where 
  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  wedge  
  
 is the conjunction and 
  
    
      
        
          x  f  
        
      
    
      displaystyle  implies  
  
 the implication  in Lean using tactic mode 

theorem and swap  p q   Prop    p   q   q   p    by
  intro h               assume p   q with proof h  the goal is q   p
  apply And intro       the goal is split into two subgoals  one is q and the other is p
    exact h right       the first subgoal is exactly the right part of h        p   q
    exact h left        the second subgoal is exactly the left part of h        p   q

This same proof in term mode

Usage edit 
Mathematics edit

Lean has received attention from mathematicians such as Thomas Hales              Kevin Buzzard              and Heather Macbeth              Hales is using it for his project  Formal Abstracts              Buzzard uses it for the Xena project              One of the Xena Project s goals is to rewrite every theorem and proof in the undergraduate math curriculum of Imperial College London in Lean  Macbeth is using Lean to teach students the fundamentals of mathematical proof with instant feedback             
In       a team of researchers used Lean to verify the correctness of a proof by Peter Scholze in the area of condensed mathematics  The project garnered attention for formalizing a result at the cutting edge of mathematical research              In       Terence Tao used Lean to formalize a proof of the Polynomial Freiman Ruzsa  PFR  conjecture  a result published by Tao and collaborators in the same year             

Artificial intelligence edit 
In       OpenAI and Meta AI independently created AI models to generate proofs of various high school level olympiad problems in Lean              Meta AI s model is available for public use with the Lean environment             
In       Vlad Tenev and Tudor Achim co founded startup Harmonic  which aims to reduce AI hallucinations by generating and checking Lean code             
In       Google DeepMind created AlphaProof             which proves mathematical statements in Lean at the level of a silver medalist at the International Mathematical Olympiad  This was the first AI system that achieved a medal worthy performance on a math olympiad s problems             
In April       DeepSeek introduced DeepSeek Prover V   an AI model designed for theorem proving in Lean    built on top of DeepSeek V
