Biography edit 
Early life and education edit 
John Joseph Hopfield was born in      in Chicago            to physicists John Joseph Hopfield  born in Poland as Jan J zef Chmielewski  and Helen Hopfield  n e Staff                        
Hopfield received a Bachelor of Arts with a major in physics from Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania in      and a Doctor of Philosophy in physics from Cornell University in                  His doctoral dissertation was titled  A quantum mechanical theory of the contribution of excitons to the complex dielectric constant of crystals              His doctoral advisor was Albert Overhauser            

Career edit 
He spent two years in the theory group at Bell Laboratories working on optical properties of semiconductors working with David Gilbert Thomas            and later on a quantitative model to describe the cooperative behavior of hemoglobin in collaboration with Robert G  Shulman                                   Subsequently he became a faculty member at University of California  Berkeley  physics                         Princeton University  physics                         California Institute of Technology  Caltech  chemistry and biology                        and again at Princeton                                where he is the Howard A  Prior Professor of Molecular Biology  emeritus             
In       he participated in a science short film on the structure of the hemoglobin  featuring Linus Pauling             
From      to      Richard Feynman  Carver Mead and Hopfield gave a one year course at Caltech called  The Physics of Computation                           This collaboration inspired the Computation and Neural Systems PhD program at Caltech in       co founded by Hopfield                         
His former PhD students include Gerald Mahan  PhD in                    Bertrand Halperin                      Steven Girvin                     Terry Sejnowski                     Erik Winfree                     Jos  Onuchic                     Li Zhaoping                    and David J  C  MacKay                    

Work edit 
In his doctoral work of       he wrote on the interaction of excitons in crystals  coining the term polariton for a quasiparticle that appears in solid state physics                          He wrote   The polarization field  particles  analogous to photons will be called  polaritons                His polariton model is sometimes known as the Hopfield dielectric             
From      to       Hopfield and David G  Thomas investigated the exciton structure of cadmium sulfide from its reflection spectra  Their experiments and theoretical models allowed to understand the optical spectroscopy of II VI semiconductor compounds             
Condensed matter physicist Philip W  Anderson reported that John Hopfield was his  hidden collaborator  for his           works on the Anderson impurity model which explained the Kondo effect  Hopfield was not included as a co author in the papers but Anderson admitted the importance of Hopfield s contribution in various of his writings             
William C  Topp and Hopfield introduced the concept of norm conserving pseudopotentials in                                          
In      he introduced a mechanism for error correction in biochemical reactions known as kinetic proofreading to explain the accuracy of DNA replication                         
Hopfield published his first paper in neuroscience in       titled  Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities  where he introduced what is now known as Hopfield network  a type of artificial network that can serve as a content addressable memory  made of binary neurons that can be  on  or  off                          He extended his formalism to continuous activation functions in                   The      and      papers represent his two most cited works              Hopfield has said that the inspiration came from his knowledge of spin glasses from his collaborations with P  W  Anderson             
Together with David W  Tank  Hopfield developed a method in                                   for solving discrete optimization problems based on the continuous time dynamics using a Hopfield network with continuous activation function  The optimization problem was encoded in the interaction parameters  weights  of the network  The effective temperature of the analog system was gradually decreased  as in global optimization with simulated annealing             
Hopfield is one of the pioneers of the critical brain hypothesis  he was the first to link neural networks with self organized criticality in reference to the Olami Feder Christensen model for earthquakes in                               In       Hopfield and Andreas V  Herz showed that avalanches in neural activity follow  power law distribution associated to earthquakes                         
The original Hopfield networks had a limited memory  this problem was addressed by Hopfield and Dimitry Krotov in                               Large memory storage Hopfield networks are now known as modern Hopfield networks             

Views on artificial intelligence edit 
In March       Hopfield signed an open letter titled  Pause Giant AI Experiments   calling for a pause on the training of artificial intelligence  AI  systems more powerful than GPT    The letter  signed by over        individuals including AI researchers Yoshua Bengio and Stuart Russell  cited risks such as human obsolescence and society wide loss of control                         
Upon being jointly awarded the      Nobel Prize in Physics  Hopfield revealed he was very unnerved by recent advances in AI capabilities  and said  as a physicist  I m very unnerved by something which has no control               In a followup press conference in Princeton University  Hopfield compared AI with discovery of nuclear fission  which led to nuclear weapons and nuclear power
