Henry Alfred Kissinger     a       May                           November           was an American diplomat and political scientist who served as the   th United States secretary of state from      to      and the  th national security advisor from      to       serving under presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford            
Born in Germany  Kissinger emigrated to the United States in      as a Jewish refugee fleeing Nazi persecution  He served in the U S  Army during World War II  After the war  he attended Harvard University  where he excelled academically  He later became a professor of government at the university and earned an international reputation as an expert on nuclear weapons and foreign policy  He acted as a consultant to government agencies  think tanks  and the presidential campaigns of Nelson Rockefeller and Nixon before being appointed as national security advisor and later secretary of state by President Nixon 
An advocate of a pragmatic approach to geopolitics known as Realpolitik  Kissinger pioneered the policy of d tente with the Soviet Union  orchestrated an opening of relations with China  engaged in  shuttle diplomacy  in the Middle East to end the Yom Kippur War  and negotiated the Paris Peace Accords  which ended American involvement in the Vietnam War  For his role in negotiating the accords  he was awarded the      Nobel Peace Prize  which sparked controversy             Kissinger is also associated with controversial U S  policies including its bombing of Cambodia  involvement in the      Bolivian and      Chilean coup d  tats  support for Argentina s military junta in its Dirty War  support for Indonesia in its invasion of East Timor  and support for Pakistan during the Bangladesh Liberation War and Bangladesh genocide             Considered by many American scholars to have been an effective secretary of state             Kissinger was also accused by critics of war crimes for the civilian death toll of the policies he pursued and for his role in facilitating U S  support for authoritarian regimes                       
After leaving government  Kissinger founded Kissinger Associates  an international geopolitical consulting firm which he ran from      until his death  He authored over a dozen books on diplomatic history and international relations  His advice was sought by American presidents of both major political parties                         


Early life and education
Kissinger was born Heinz Alfred Kissinger     b      on May           in F rth  Bavaria  Germany  He was the son of homemaker Paula  n e      Stern   from Leutershausen  and Louis Kissinger           de       a school teacher  He had a younger brother  Walter  who was a businessman  Kissinger s family was German Jewish              His great great grandfather Meyer L b adopted  Kissinger  as his surname in       taking it from the Bavarian spa town of Bad Kissingen              In his childhood  Kissinger enjoyed playing soccer  He played for the youth team of SpVgg F rth  one of the nation s best clubs at the time             
In a      BBC interview  Kissinger vividly recalled being nine years old in      and learning of Adolf Hitler s election as Chancellor of Germany  which proved to be a profound turning point for the Kissinger family              During Nazi rule  Kissinger and his friends were regularly harassed and beaten by Hitler Youth gangs              Kissinger sometimes defied the segregation imposed by Nazi racial laws by sneaking into soccer stadiums to watch matches  often receiving beatings from security guards                          As a result of the Nazis  anti Semitic laws  Kissinger was unable to gain admittance to the Gymnasium and his father was dismissed from his teaching job                         
On August           when Kissinger was    years old  he and his family fled Germany to avoid further Nazi persecution              The family briefly stopped in London before arriving in New York City on September    Kissinger later downplayed the influence his experiences of Nazi persecution had had on his policies and view of the world  writing that the  Germany of my youth had a great deal of order and very little justice  it was not the sort of place likely to inspire devotion to order in the abstract   Nevertheless  many scholars  including Kissinger s biographer Walter Isaacson  have argued that his experiences influenced the formation of his realist approach to foreign policy             
Kissinger spent his high school years in the German Jewish community in Washington Heights  Manhattan  Although Kissinger assimilated quickly into American culture  he never lost his pronounced German accent  due to childhood shyness that made him hesitant to speak                          After his first year at George Washington High School  he completed school at night while working in a shaving brush factory during the day             
Kissinger studied accounting at the City College of New York  excelling academically as a part time student while continuing to work  His studies were interrupted in early       when he was drafted into the U S  Army             

U S  Army
Kissinger underwent basic training at Camp Croft in Spartanburg  South Carolina  On June           while stationed in South Carolina  he became a naturalized U S       citizen  The army sent him to study engineering at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania under the Army Specialized Training Program  but the program was canceled and Kissinger was reassigned to the   th Infantry Division  There  he made the acquaintance of Fritz Kraemer  a fellow immigrant from Germany who noted Kissinger s fluency in German and his intellect and arranged for him to be assigned to the division s military intelligence  According to Vernon A  Walters  Kissinger also received training at Camp Ritchie  Maryland  before being shipped to Europe              Kissinger saw combat with the division and volunteered for hazardous intelligence duties during the Battle of the Bulge  On April           he participated in the liberation of the Hannover Ahlem concentration camp  a subcamp of the Neuengamme concentration camp  At the time  Kissinger wrote in his journal   I had never seen people degraded to the level that people were in Ahlem  They barely looked human  They were skeletons   After the initial shock  however  Kissinger was relatively silent about his wartime service                         
During the American advance into Germany  Kissinger  though only a private  was put in charge of the administration of the city of Krefeld because of a lack of German speakers on the division s intelligence staff  Within eight days he had established a civilian administration              Kissinger was then reassigned to the Counter Intelligence Corps  CIC   where he became a CIC Special Agent holding the enlisted rank of sergeant  He was given charge of a team in Hanover assigned to tracking down Gestapo officers and other saboteurs  for which he was awarded the Bronze Star              Kissinger drew up a comprehensive list of all known Gestapo employees in the Bergstra e region  and had them rounded up  By the end of July     men had been arrested  In March       Fritz Girke  Hans Hellenbroich  Michael Raaf  and Karl Stattmann were subsequently caught and tried by the Dachau Military Tribunal for killing two American prisoners of war  The four men were all found guilty and sentenced to death  They were executed by hanging at Landsberg Prison in October                  
In June       Kissinger was made commandant of the Bensheim metro CIC detachment  Bergstra e district of Hesse  with responsibility for denazification of the district  Although he possessed absolute authority and powers of arrest  Kissinger took care to avoid abuses against the local population by his command             
In       Kissinger was reassigned to teach at the European Command Intelligence School at Camp King and  as a civilian employee following his separation from the army  continued to serve in this role                         
Kissinger recalled that his experience in the army  made me feel like an American              

Academic career
Kissinger earned his Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude  Phi Beta Kappa             in political science from Harvard College in       where he lived in Adams House and studied under William Yandell Elliott              His senior undergraduate thesis  titled The Meaning of History  Reflections on Spengler  Toynbee and Kant  was over     pages long  and provoked Harvard s current cap on the length of undergraduate theses         words                                       He earned his Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy at Harvard University in      and       respectively  In       while still a graduate student at Harvard  he served as a consultant to the director of the Psychological Strategy Board              and founded a magazine  Confluence              At that time  he sought to work as a spy for the FBI                         

Portrait of Kissinger as a Harvard senior in     
Kissinger s doctoral dissertation was titled Peace  Legitimacy  and the Equilibrium  A Study of the Statesmanship of Castlereagh and Metternich               Stephen Graubard  Kissinger s friend  asserted that Kissinger primarily pursued such endeavor to instruct himself on the history of power play between European states in the   th century              In his doctoral dissertation  Kissinger first introduced the concept of  legitimacy               which he defined as   Legitimacy as used here should not be confused with justice  It means no more than an international agreement about the nature of workable arrangements and about the permissible aims and methods of foreign policy               An international order accepted by all of the major powers is  legitimate  whereas an international order not accepted by one or more of the great powers is  revolutionary  and hence dangerous              Thus  when after the Congress of Vienna in       the leaders of Britain  France  Austria  Prussia  and Russia agreed to co operate in the Concert of Europe to preserve the peace after Austria  Prussia  and Russia participated in a series of three Partitions of Poland  in Kissinger s viewpoint this international system was  legitimate  because it was accepted by the leaders of all five of the Great Powers of Europe  Notably  Kissinger s Primat der Au enpolitik  Primacy of foreign policy  approach to diplomacy took it for granted that as long as the decision makers in the major states were willing to accept the international order  then it is  legitimate  with questions of public opinion and morality dismissed as irrelevant              His dissertation also won him the Senator Charles Sumner Prize  an award given to the best dissertation  from the legal  political  historical  economic  social  or ethnic approach  dealing with any means or measures tending toward the prevention of war and the establishment of universal peace  by a student under the Harvard Department of Government              It was published in      as A World Restored  Metternich  Castlereagh and the Problems of Peace                       
Kissinger remained at Harvard as a member of the faculty in the Department of Government where he served as the director of the Harvard International Seminar between      and       In       he was a consultant to the National Security Council s Operations Coordinating Board              During      and       he was also study director in nuclear weapons and foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations  He released his book Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy the following year              The book  which criticized the Eisenhower administration s massive retaliation nuclear doctrine  caused much controversy at the time by proposing the use of tactical nuclear weapons on a regular basis to win wars              That same year  he published A World Restored  a study of balance of power politics in post Napoleonic Europe

From      to       Kissinger worked for the Rockefeller Brothers Fund as director of its Special Studies Project              He served as the director of the Harvard Defense Studies Program between      and       In       he also co founded the Center for International Affairs with Robert R  Bowie where he served as its associate director  Outside of academia  he served as a consultant to several government agencies and think tanks  including the Operations Research Office  the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency  Department of State  and the RAND Corporation             
Keen to have a greater influence on U S  foreign policy  Kissinger became foreign policy advisor to the presidential campaigns of Nelson Rockefeller  supporting his bids for the Republican nomination in             and                   Kissinger first met Richard Nixon at a party hosted by Clare Boothe Luce in       saying that he found him more  thoughtful  than he expected              During the Republican primaries in       Kissinger again served as the foreign policy adviser to Rockefeller and in July      called Nixon  the most dangerous of all the men running to have as president               Initially upset when Nixon won the Republican nomination  the ambitious Kissinger soon changed his mind about Nixon and contacted a Nixon campaign aide  Richard Allen  to state he was willing to do anything to help Nixon win              After Nixon became president in January       Kissinger was appointed as National Security Advisor  By this time  he was arguably  one of the most important theorists about foreign policy ever to be produced by the United States   according to his official biographer Niall Ferguson             

Foreign policy

Kissinger served as National Security Advisor and Secretary of State under President Richard Nixon and continued as Secretary of State under Nixon s successor Gerald Ford              With the death of George Shultz in February       Kissinger was the last surviving member of the Nixon administration Cabinet             
The relationship between Nixon and Kissinger was unusually close  and has been compared to the relationships of Woodrow Wilson and Colonel House  or Franklin D  Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins              In all three cases  the State Department was relegated to a backseat role in developing foreign policy              Kissinger and Nixon shared a penchant for secrecy and conducted numerous  backchannel  negotiations  such as that through the Soviet Ambassador to the United States  Anatoly Dobrynin  that excluded State Department experts  Historian David Rothkopf looked at the personalities of Nixon and Kissinger  saying 

They were a fascinating pair  In a way  they complemented each other perfectly  Kissinger was the charming and worldly Mr  Outside who provided the grace and intellectual establishment respectability that Nixon lacked  disdained and aspired to  Kissinger was an international citizen  Nixon very much a classic American  Kissinger had a worldview and a facility for adjusting it to meet the times  Nixon had pragmatism and a strategic vision that provided the foundations for their policies  Kissinger would  of course  say that he was not political like Nixon but in fact he was just as political as Nixon  just as calculating  just as relentlessly ambitious          these self made men were driven as much by their need for approval and their neuroses as by their strengths             
A proponent of Realpolitik  Kissinger played a dominant role in United States foreign policy between      and       In that period  he extended the policy of d tente  This policy led to a significant relaxation in U S  Soviet tensions and played a crucial role in      talks with the People s Republic of China premier Zhou Enlai  The talks concluded with a rapprochement between the United States and China  and the formation of a new strategic anti Soviet Sino American alignment  He was jointly awarded the      Nobel Peace Prize with L    c Th  for helping to establish a ceasefire and U S  withdrawal from Vietnam  The ceasefire  however  was not durable              Th  declined to accept the award             and Kissinger appeared deeply ambivalent about it he donated his prize money to charity  did not attend the award ceremony  and later offered to return his prize medal                          As National Security Advisor in       Kissinger directed the much debated National Security Study Memorandum

Kissinger initially had little interest in China when he began his work as National Security Adviser in       and the driving force behind the rapprochement with China was Nixon              Like Nixon  Kissinger believed that relations with China would help the United States exit the Vietnam War and obtain long term strategic benefits in confrontations with the Soviet Union                                 
In April       both Nixon and Kissinger promised Chiang Ching kuo  the son of Generalissimo Chiang Kai shek  that they would never abandon Taiwan or make any compromises with Mao Zedong  although Nixon did speak vaguely of his wish to improve relations with the People s Republic

Kissinger made two trips to the People s Republic in July and October       the first of which was made in secret  to confer with Premier Zhou Enlai  then in charge of Chinese foreign policy              During his visit to Beijing  the main issue turned out to be Taiwan  as Zhou demanded the United States recognize that Taiwan was a legitimate part of the People s Republic  pull U S  forces out of Taiwan  and end military support for the Kuomintang regime              Kissinger gave way by promising to pull U S  forces out of Taiwan  saying two thirds would be pulled out when the Vietnam war ended and the rest to be pulled out as Sino American relations improved             
In October       as Kissinger was making his second trip to the People s Republic  the issue of which Chinese government deserved to be represented in the United Nations came up again              Out of concern to not be seen abandoning an ally  the United States tried to promote a compromise under which both Chinese regimes would be United Nations members  although Kissinger called it  an essentially doomed rearguard action               While American ambassador to the United Nations George H  W  Bush was lobbying for the  two Chinas  formula  Kissinger was removing favorable references to Taiwan from a speech that then Secretary of State William P  Rogers was preparing  as he expected the country to be expelled from the United Nations              During his second visit to Beijing  Kissinger told Zhou that according to a public opinion poll     of Americans wanted Taiwan to remain a United Nations member and asked him to consider the  two Chinas  compromise to avoid offending American public opinion              Zhou responded with his claim that the People s Republic was the legitimate government of all China  and no compromise was possible              Kissinger said that the United States could not totally sever ties with Chiang  who had been an ally in World War II  Kissinger told Nixon that Bush was  too soft and not sophisticated  enough to properly represent the United States at the United Nations and expressed no anger when the United Nations General Assembly voted to expel Taiwan and give China s seat on the United Nations Security Council to the People s Republic             
Kissinger s trips paved the way for the groundbreaking      summit between Nixon  Zhou  and Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong  as well as the formalization of relations between the two countries  ending    years of diplomatic isolation and mutual hostility  The result was the formation of a tacit strategic anti Soviet alliance between China and the United States  Kissinger s diplomacy led to economic and cultural exchanges between the two sides and the establishment of  liaison offices  in the Chinese and American capitals  though full normalization of relations with China would not occur until                  

Vietnam War
Main article  Henry Kissinger and the Vietnam War
Kissinger and President Richard Nixon discussing the Vietnam situation in Camp David        with Alexander Haig 
Kissinger discussed being involved in Indochina prior to his appointment as National Security Adviser to Nixon              According to Kissinger  his friend Henry Cabot Lodge Jr   the Ambassador to Saigon  employed Kissinger as a consultant  leading to Kissinger visiting Vietnam once in      and twice in       where Kissinger realized that the United States  knew neither how to win or how to conclude  the Vietnam War              Kissinger also stated that in       he served as an intermediary for negotiations between the United States and North Vietnam  with Kissinger providing the American position  while two Frenchmen provided the North Vietnamese position             
When he came into office in       Kissinger favored a negotiating strategy under which the United States and North Vietnam would sign an armistice and agreed to pull their troops out of South Vietnam while the South Vietnamese government and the Viet Cong were to agree to a coalition government              Kissinger had doubts about Nixon s theory of  linkage   believing that this would give the Soviet Union leverage over the United States and unlike Nixon was less concerned about the ultimate fate of South Vietnam              Though Kissinger did not regard South Vietnam as important in its own right  he believed it was necessary to support South Vietnam to maintain the United States as a global power  believing that none of America s allies would trust the United States if South Vietnam were abandoned too quickly             
In early       Kissinger was opposed to the plans for Operation Menu  the bombing of Cambodia  fearing that Nixon was acting rashly with no plans for the diplomatic fall out  but on March           Nixon announced the bombing would start the next day              As he saw the president was committed  he became more supportive              Kissinger played a key role in bombing Cambodia to disrupt raids into South Vietnam from Cambodia  as well as the      Cambodian campaign and subsequent widespread bombing of Khmer Rouge targets in Cambodia              For his role in planning the U S  bombing of Cambodia  scholars have stated that Kissinger bears substantial responsibility for the killing of between        and         Cambodian civilians and also the destabilization of Cambodia that the U S  bombing campaign caused  which contributed to the Khmer Rouge s ascendance to power                          The Paris peace talks had become stalemated by late      owing to the obstructionism of the South Vietnamese delegation              The South Vietnamese president Nguy n V n Thi u did not want the United States to withdraw from Vietnam  and out of frustration with him  Kissinger began secret peace talks with 
Le Duc Th  in Paris parallel to the official talks that the South Vietnamese were unaware of              In June       Kissinger supported Nixon s effort to ban the Pentagon Papers saying the  hemorrhage of state secrets  to the media was making diplomacy impossible             
On August          Kissinger met Th  again in Paris  and for first time  he seemed willing to compromise  saying that political and military terms of an armistice could be treated separately and hinted that his government was no longer willing to make the overthrow of Thi u a precondition              On the evening of October          at a secret meeting of Kissinger and Th  in Paris came the decisive breakthrough in the talks              Th  began with  a very realistic and very simple proposal  for a ceasefire that would see the Americans pull all their forces out of Vietnam in exchange for the release of all the POWs in North Vietnam              Kissinger accepted Th  s offer as the best deal possible  saying that the  mutual withdrawal formula  had to be abandoned as it been  unobtainable through ten years of war          We could not make it a condition for a final settlement  We had long passed that threshold               In the fall of       both Kissinger and Nixon were frustrated with Thi u s refusal to accept any sort of peace deal calling for withdrawal of American forces              On October    Kissinger and the American ambassador Ellsworth Bunker arrived in Saigon to show Thi u the peace agreement              Thi u refused to sign the peace agreement and demanded very extensive amendments that Kissinger reported to Nixon  verge on insanity              
Though Nixon had initially supported Kissinger against Thi u  H R  Haldeman and John Ehrlichman urged him to reconsider  arguing that Thi u s objections had merit              Nixon wanted    amendments to the draft peace agreement included in the final treaty and ordered Kissinger back to Paris to force Th  to accept them              Kissinger regarded Nixon s    amendments as  preposterous  as he knew Th  would never accept them              As expected  Th  refused to consider any of the    amendments  and on December           left Paris for Hanoi              Kissinger by this stage was worked up into a state of fury after Th  walked out of the Paris talks and told Nixon   They re just a bunch of shits  Tawdry  filthy shits              
On January          Kissinger and Th  met again in Paris and the next day reached an agreement  which in main points was essentially the same as the one Nixon had rejected in October with only cosmetic concessions to the Americans              Thi u once again rejected the peace agreement  only to receive an ultimatum from Nixon which caused Thi u to reluctantly accept the peace agreement              On January           Kissinger and Th  signed a peace agreement that called for the complete withdrawal of all U S  forces from Vietnam by March in exchange for North Vietnam freeing all the U S  POWs              Along with Th   Kissinger was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on December           for their work in negotiating the ceasefires contained in the Paris Peace Accords on  Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam   signed the previous January              According to Irwin Abrams in       this prize was the most controversial to date  For the first time in the history of the Peace Prize  two members left the Nobel Committee in protest                          Th  rejected the award  telling Kissinger that peace had not been restored in South Vietnam              Kissinger wrote to the Nobel Committee that he accepted the award  with humility                           and  donated the entire proceeds to the children of American service members killed or missing in action in Indochina               After the Fall of Saigon in       Kissinger attempted to return the award

By the summer of       the U S  embassy reported that morale in the ARVN had fallen to dangerously low levels and it was uncertain how much longer South Vietnam would last              In August       the U S  Congress passed a bill limiting American aid to South Vietnam to           million annually               By November       Kissinger lobbied Leonid Brezhnev to end Soviet military aid to North Vietnam               The same month  he also lobbied Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai to end Chinese military aid to North Vietnam               On April           Kissinger testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee  urging Congress to increase the military aid budget to South Vietnam by another           million to save the ARVN as the PAVN was rapidly advancing on Saigon  which was refused               Kissinger maintained at the time  and until his death  that if only Congress had approved of his request for another           million South Vietnam would have been able to resist              
In November       seven months after the Khmer Rouge took power  Kissinger told the Thai foreign minister   You should tell the Cambodians that we will be friends with them  They are murderous thugs but we won t let that stand in our way                In a      interview  Kissinger said   some countries  the Chinese in particular supported Pol Pot as a counterweight to the Vietnamese supported people and We at least tolerated it   Kissinger said he did not approve of this due to the genocide and said he  would not have dealt with Pol Pot for any purpose whatsoever   He further said   The Thais and the Chinese did not want a Vietnamese dominated Indochina  We didn t want the Vietnamese to dominate  I don t believe we did anything for Pol Pot  But I suspect we closed our eyes when some others did something for Pol Pot               

Interview with Oriana Fallaci
On November                       Kissinger agreed to an interview with Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci  Kissinger  who rarely engaged in one on one interviews with the press and knew very little about Fallaci  accepted her request after reportedly being impressed with her      interview with V  Nguy n Gi p               The interview turned out to be a political and public relations disaster for Kissinger as he agreed that Vietnam was a  useless war   implied that he preferred to have dinner with L    c Th  over Nguy n V n Thi u  in her      book Interview with History  Fallaci recalled that Kissinger agreed with many of her negative sentiments towards Thi u in a private discussion before the interview   and engaged in a now infamous exchange with the hard pressing Fallaci  with Kissinger comparing himself to a cowboy leading the Nixon administration 

Fallaci  I suppose that at the root of everything there s your success  I mean  like a chess player  you ve made two or three good moves  China  first of all  People like chess players who checkmate the king Kissinger  Yes  China has been a very important element in the mechanics of my success  And yet that s not the main point  The main point           Well  yes  I ll tell you  What do I care  The main point arises from the fact that I ve always acted alone  Americans like that immensely  Americans like the cowboy who leads the wagon train by riding ahead alone on his horse  the cowboy who rides all alone into the town  the village  with his horse and nothing else  Maybe even without a pistol  since he doesn t shoot  He acts  that s all  by being in the right place at the right time  In short  a Western Fallaci  I see  You see yourself as a kind of Henry Fonda  unarmed and ready to fight with his fists for honest ideals  Alone  courageous         Kissinger  Not necessarily courageous  In fact  this cowboy doesn t have to be courageous  All he needs is to be alone  to show others that he rides into the town and does everything by himself  This amazing  romantic character suits me precisely because to be alone has always been part of my style or  if you like  my technique  Together with independence  Oh  that s very important in me and for me  And finally  conviction  I ve always been convinced that I had to do whatever I ve done  And people feel it  and believe in it  And I care about the fact that they believe in me when you sway or convince somebody  you shouldn t confuse them  Nor can you even simply calculate  Some people think that I carefully plan what are to be the consequences  for the public  of any of my initiatives or efforts  They think this preoccupation is always on my mind  Instead the consequences of what I do  I mean the public s judgment  have never bothered me  I don t ask for popularity  I m not looking for popularity  On the contrary  if you really want to know  I care nothing about popularity  I m not at all afraid of losing my public  I can allow myself to say what I think  I m referring to what s genuine in me  If I were to let myself be disturbed by the reactions of the public  if I were to act solely on the basis of a calculated technique  I would accomplish nothing              
Nixon was enraged by the interview  in particular the comedic  cowboy  comparison which infuriated Nixon  For several weeks afterwards  he refused to see Kissinger and even contemplated firing him  At one point  Kissinger  in desperation  drove up unannounced to Nixon s San Clemente residence but was rejected by Secret Service personnel at the gates               Kissinger later claimed that it was  the single most disastrous conversation I have ever had with any member of the press                Fallaci described the interview with the evasive  monotonous  non expressive Kissinger as the most uncomfortable and most difficult she ever did  criticizing Kissinger as a  intellectual adventurer  and a self styled Metternich              

Bangladesh Liberation War

Kissinger in the West Wing as National Security Adviser in April     
Nixon supported Pakistani dictator Yahya Khan in the Bangladesh Liberation War in       Kissinger sneered at people who  bleed  for  the dying Bengalis  and ignored the first telegram from the U S  consul general in East Pakistan  Archer K  Blood  and    members of his staff  which informed the U S  that their allies West Pakistan were undertaking  in Blood s words   a selective genocide  targeting the Bengali intelligentsia  supporters of independence for East Pakistan  and the Hindu minority               In the second  more famous  Blood Telegram the word  genocide  was again used to describe the events  and further that with its continuing support for West Pakistan the U S  government had  evidenced          moral bankruptcy                As a direct response to the dissent against U S  policy  Kissinger and Nixon ended Archer Blood s tenure as United States consul general in East Pakistan and put him to work in the State Department s Personnel Office                            Christopher Clary argues that Nixon and Kissinger were unconsciously biased  leading them to overestimate the likelihood of Pakistani victory against Bengali rebels              
Kissinger was particularly concerned about the expansion of Soviet influence in the Indian subcontinent as a result of a treaty of friendship recently signed by India and the Soviet Union  and sought to demonstrate to China  Pakistan s ally and an enemy of both India and the Soviet Union  the value of a tacit alliance with the United States                                                                  
Kissinger had also come under fire for private comments he made to Nixon during the Bangladesh Pakistan War in which he described Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi as a  bitch  and a  witch   He also said  the Indians are bastards   shortly before the war               Kissinger later expressed his regret over the comments                           

Europe
As National Security Adviser under Nixon  Kissinger pioneered the policy of d tente with the Soviet Union  seeking a relaxation in tensions between the two superpowers  As a part of this strategy  he negotiated the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks  culminating in the SALT I treaty  and the Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty with Leonid Brezhnev  General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party  Negotiations about strategic disarmament were originally supposed to start under the Lyndon Johnson administration but were postponed in protest upon the invasion by Warsaw Pact troops of Czechoslovakia in August                   
Nixon felt his administration had neglected relations with the Western European states in his first term and in September      decided that if he was reelected that      would be the  Year of Europe  as the United States would focus on relations with the states of the European Economic Community  EEC  which had emerged as a serious economic rival by                    Applying his favorite  linkage  concept  Nixon intended henceforward economic relations with Europe would not be severed from security relations  and if the EEC states wanted changes in American tariff and monetary policies  the price would be defense spending on their part               Kissinger in particular as part of the  Year of Europe  wanted to  revitalize  NATO  which he called a  decaying  alliance as he believed that there was nothing at present to stop the Red Army from overrunning Western Europe in a conventional forces conflict               The  linkage  concept more applied to the question of security as Kissinger noted that the United States was going to sacrifice NATO for the sake of  citrus fruits               

Israeli policy and Soviet Jewry

Kissinger  right  during a      visit to Israel
According to notes taken by H  R  Haldeman  Nixon  ordered his aides to exclude all Jewish Americans from policy making on Israel   including Kissinger               One note quotes Nixon as saying  get K   Kissinger  out of the play Haig handle it               
In       Kissinger did not feel that pressing the Soviet Union concerning the plight of Jews being persecuted there was in the interest of U S  foreign policy  In a conversation with Nixon shortly after a meeting with Israeli prime minister Golda Meir on March          Kissinger stated   The emigration of Jews from the Soviet Union is not an objective of American foreign policy  and if they put Jews into gas chambers in the Soviet Union  it is not an American concern  Maybe a humanitarian concern                He had a negative view of American Jews who lobbied for aid to Soviet Jews  calling them  bastards  and  self serving                He went on to state that   If it were not for the accident of my birth  I would be antisemitic  and  any people who has been persecuted for two thousand years must be doing something wrong               

Arab Israeli conflict
Main article  Yom Kippur War
In September       Nixon fired William P  Rogers as Secretary of State and replaced him with Kissinger  He would later state he had not been given enough time to know the Middle East as he settled into the State Department               Kissinger later admitted that he was so engrossed with the Paris peace talks to end the Vietnam war that he and others in Washington missed the significance of the Egyptian Saudi alliance  Egyptian president Anwar Sadat expelled Soviet advisors from Egypt in May       attempting to signal to the U S  that he was open to disentangling Egypt from the Soviet sphere of influence  Kissinger offered secret talks on a settlement for the Middle East  though nothing came of the offer  By March       Sadat had moved back towards the Soviets  closing the largest arms package between Egypt and the Soviet Union and allowing for the return of Soviet military personnel and advisors to Egypt              
On October          at           am  assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs Joseph Sisco  informed Kissinger that Egypt and Syria were about to go to war with Israel  Sisco had been warned by U S  ambassador to Israel  Kenneth Keating  who two hours previously had been urgently summoned by Israel s Prime Minister Golda Meir who believed conflict was imminent               Prioritising d tente  Kissinger s first phone call  at           am  was to Soviet ambassador and good friend Anatoly Dobrynin  He would later make calls to British ambassador Rowland Baring and the U N  secretary general Kurt Waldheim  Kissinger did not inform President Richard Nixon or White House chief of staff Alexander Haig about the start of the Yom Kippur War until either                   or           am               as both were spending the weekend at Key Biscayne discussing Spiro Agnew s imminent resignation               According to Kissinger his urgent calls to the Soviets and Egyptians were ineffective 
On October     under Nixon s direction  and against Kissinger s initial advice               while Kissinger was on his way to Moscow to discuss conditions for a cease fire  Nixon sent a message to Brezhnev giving Kissinger full negotiating authority               Kissinger wanted to stall a ceasefire to gain more time for Israel to push across the Suez Canal to the African side  and wanted to be perceived as a mere presidential emissary who needed to consult the White House all the time as a stalling tactic              

On October           Egyptian foreign minister Ismail Fahmi  left  meets with Richard Nixon  middle  and Henry Kissinger  right   about a week after the end of fighting in the Yom Kippur War 
Kissinger promised the Israeli prime minister Golda Meir that the United States would replace its losses in equipment after the war  but sought initially to delay arms shipments to Israel  as he believed it would improve the odds of making peace along the lines of United Nations Security Council Resolution                   In       Meir requested           million worth of American arms and equipment to replace its materiel losses               Nixon instead sent some         billion worth               The arms lift enraged King Faisal of Saudi Arabia  and he retaliated on October           by placing a total embargo on oil shipments to the United States  to be joined by all of the other oil producing Arab states except Iraq and Libya              
On November          Kissinger flew to Riyadh to meet King Faisal and to ask him to end the oil embargo in exchange for promising to be  even handed  in the Arab Israeli dispute               Despite Kissinger s efforts to charm him  Faisal refused to lift the oil embargo               Only on March           did the King end the oil embargo  after Sadat reported to him that the United States was being more  even handed  and after Kissinger had promised to sell Saudi Arabia weapons that it had previously denied under the grounds that they might be used against Israel              
Kissinger pressured the Israelis to cede some of the newly captured land back to its Arab neighbors  contributing to the first phases of Israeli Egyptian non aggression  In            Kissinger engaged in  shuttle diplomacy  flying between Tel Aviv  Cairo  and Damascus in a bid to make the armistice the basis of a permanent peace  Kissinger s first meeting with Hafez al Assad lasted   hours and    minutes  causing the press to believe for a moment that he had been kidnapped by the Syrians               In his memoirs  Kissinger described how  during the course of his    meetings in Damascus in          Assad  negotiated tenaciously and daringly like a riverboat gambler to make sure he had exacted the last sliver of available concessions                As for the others Kissinger negotiated with  Kissinger viewed the Israeli politicians as rigid  while he had a good relationship and was able to develop a sense of assurance with Sadat               Kissinger s efforts resulted in two ceasefires between Egypt and Israel  Sinai I in January       and Sinai II in September                   
Kissinger had avoided involving France and the United Kingdom  the former European colonial powers of the Middle East  in the peace negotiations that followed the Yom Kippur War  being primarily focused on minimizing the Soviet Union s sway over the peace negotiations and on moderating the international influences on the Arab Israeli conflict  President Pompidou of France was concerned and perturbed by this development  viewing it as an indication of the United States  ambitions of hegemonically domineering the region              

Persian Gulf
Kissinger and King Faisal of Saudi Arabia  left  in Riyadh on March           In the far background behind Faisal is his half brother  the future King Fahd 
A major concern for Kissinger was the possibility of Soviet influence in the Persian Gulf  In April       Iraq came into conflict with Iran when Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi renounced the      treaty governing the Shatt al Arab river  On December          after two years of skirmishes along the border  President Ahmed Hassan al Bakr broke off diplomatic relations with Iran               In May       Nixon and Kissinger visited Tehran to tell the Shah that there would be no  second guessing of his requests  to buy American weapons               At the same time  Nixon and Kissinger agreed to a plan of the Shah s that the United States together with Iran and Israel would support the Kurdish peshmerga guerrillas fighting for independence from Iraq               Kissinger later wrote that after Vietnam  there was no possibility of deploying American forces in the Middle East  and henceforward Iran was to act as America s surrogate in the Persian Gulf               Kissinger described the Ba athist regime in Iraq as a potential threat to the United States and believed that building up Iran and supporting the peshmerga was the best counterweight              

Turkish invasion of Cyprus

Following a period of steady relations between the U S  Government and the Greek military regime after       Secretary of State Kissinger was faced with the coup by the Greek junta and the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in July and August       In an August      edition of The New York Times  it was revealed that Kissinger and State Department were informed in advance of the impending coup by the Greek junta in Cyprus  Indeed  according to the journalist               the official version of events as told by the State Department was that it felt it had to warn the Greek military regime not to carry out the coup 
Kissinger was a target of anti American sentiment which was a significant feature of Greek public opinion at the time particularly among young people viewing the U S  role in Cyprus as negative  In a demonstration by students in Heraklion  Crete                            soon after the second phase of the Turkish invasion in August       slogans such as  Kissinger  murderer    Americans get out    No to Partition  and  Cyprus is no Vietnam  were heard  Some years later  Kissinger expressed the opinion that the Cyprus issue was resolved in                    The New York Times and other major newspapers were highly critical  and even State Department officials did not hide their dissatisfaction with his alleged arrogance and ignorance of the basics              
Kissinger was reported to have said   The Turkish tactics are right   grab what they want and then negotiate on the basis of possession               
However  Kissinger never felt comfortable with the way he handled the Cyprus issue               Journalist Alexis Papahelas stated that Kissinger s  facial expression changes markedly when someone usually Greek or Cypriot refers to the crisis                According to him  Kissinger had felt since the summer of      that history would not treat him lightly in relation to his actions

Ford and Kissinger conversing on the White House grounds  August     
In       Kissinger parroted to Nixon the United States Department of Defense s position that the country should maintain control over the Panama Canal  which was a reversal of the commitment by the Lyndon Johnson administration               Later  in the face of international pressure  Kissinger changed his stance  viewing the past hardline position in the Panama Canal issue as a hindrance to American relations with Latin America and an international setback that the Soviet Union would approve of               Kissinger in      called for  new dialogue  between the United States and Latin America  then in       Kissinger met Panama military leader Omar Torrijos and an agreement on eight operating principles for an eventual handover of the Panama Canal to Panama was made between Kissinger and Panamanian foreign minister Juan Antonio Tack  which angered the United States Congress  but ultimately provided a framework for the      U S  Panama treaties

Kissinger initially supported the normalization of United States Cuba relations  broken since       all U S  Cuban trade was blocked in February       a few weeks after the exclusion of Cuba from the Organization of American States because of U S  pressure   However  he quickly changed his mind and followed Kennedy s policy  After the involvement of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces in the independence struggles in Angola and Mozambique  Kissinger said that unless Cuba withdrew its forces relations would not be normalized  Cuba refused

Following the uprising of October          General Juan Jos  Torres came to power in Bolivia  forming a left wing nationalist government with an  anti imperialist  stance  His policies  which included the nationalization of some American owned property  led to the U S  exerting external pressure over his government 
On June           Nixon and Kissinger discussed plans for a coup in Bolivia               and later in July  the    Committee approved covert funding towards Torres s opposition               Torres was successfully overthrown by the Nationalist Popular Front  led by Hugo Banzer  in August

Augusto Pinochet shaking hands with Kissinger in     
Chilean Socialist Party presidential candidate Salvador Allende was elected by a plurality of      percent in       causing serious concern in Washington  D C   due to his openly socialist and pro Cuban politics  The Nixon administration  with Kissinger s input  authorized the Central Intelligence Agency  CIA  to encourage a military coup that would prevent Allende s inauguration  but the plan was not successful                                                                                             
On September           Allende died during an army attack on the presidential palace that was an element of a military coup launched by Army Commander in Chief Augusto Pinochet  who then became president               In September       Orlando Letelier  a Chilean opponent of the new Pinochet regime  was assassinated in Washington  D C   with a car bomb  Previously  Kissinger had helped secure his release from prison               and had chosen to cancel an official U S  letter to Chile warning them against carrying out any political assassinations               This murder was part of Operation Condor  a covert program of political repression and assassination carried out by Southern Cone nations that Kissinger has been accused of being involved in                           
On September           after recent declassification of documents  relatives and survivors of General Ren  Schneider filed civil proceedings against Kissinger  in federal court in Washington  D C                accusing him of collaborating in arranging Schneider s kidnapping which resulted in his death               The case was later dismissed by the U S  District Court for the District of Columbia  citing separation of powers   The decision to support a coup of the Chilean government to prevent Dr  Allende from coming to power  and the means by which the United States Government sought to effect that goal  implicate policy makers in the murky realm of foreign affairs and national security best left to the political branches                Decades later  the CIA admitted its involvement in the kidnapping of General Schneider  but not his murder  and subsequently paid the group responsible for his death          to keep the prior contact secret  maintain the goodwill of the group  and for humanitarian reasons                            

Argentina
See also  Dirty War
Kissinger took a similar line as he had toward Chile when the Argentine Armed Forces  led by Jorge Videla  toppled the elected government of Isabel Per n in      with a process called the National Reorganization Process by the military  with which they consolidated power  launching brutal reprisals and  disappearances  against political opponents  An October      investigative report in The Nation broke the story of how  in a June      meeting in the Hotel Carrera in Santiago  Kissinger gave the military junta in neighboring Argentina the  green light  for their own clandestine repression against leftwing guerrillas and other dissidents  thousands of whom were kept in more than     secret concentration camps before they were executed  During a meeting with Argentine foreign minister C sar Augusto Guzzetti  Kissinger assured him that the United States was an ally but urged him to  get back to normal procedures  quickly before the U S  Congress reconvened and had a chance to consider sanctions                                                     
As the article published in The Nation noted  as the state sponsored terror mounted  conservative Republican U S  Ambassador to Buenos Aires Robert C  Hill   was shaken  he became very disturbed  by the case of the son of a thirty year embassy employee  a student who was arrested  never to be seen again   recalled Juan de Onis  former reporter for The New York Times   Hill took a personal interest   He went to the Interior Minister  a general with whom he had worked on drug cases  saying   Hey  what about this  We re interested in this case   He questioned  Foreign Minister Cesar  Guzzetti and  finally  President Jorge Videla himself   All he got was stonewalling  he got nowhere   de Onis said   His last year was marked by increasing disillusionment and dismay  and he backed his staff on human rights right to the hilt               

In a letter to The Nation editor Victor Navasky  protesting publication of the article  Kissinger claimed that   At any rate  the notion of Hill as a passionate human rights advocate is news to all his former associates   Yet Kissinger aide Harry W  Shlaudeman later disagreed with Kissinger  telling the oral historian William E  Knight of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training Foreign Affairs Oral History Project  It really came to a head when I was Assistant Secretary  or it began to come to a head  in the case of Argentina where the dirty war was in full flower  Bob Hill  who was Ambassador then in Buenos Aires  a very conservative Republican politician by no means liberal or anything of the kind  began to report quite effectively about what was going on  this slaughter of innocent civilians  supposedly innocent civilians this vicious war that they were conducting  underground war  He  at one time in fact  sent me a back channel telegram saying that the Foreign Minister  who had just come for a visit to Washington and had returned to Buenos Aires  had gloated to him that Kissinger had said nothing to him about human rights  I don t know I wasn t present at the interview              
Navasky later wrote in his book about being confronted by Kissinger   Tell me  Mr  Navasky    Kissinger  said in his famous guttural tones   how is it that a short article in an obscure journal such as yours about a conversation that was supposed to have taken place years ago about something that did or didn t happen in Argentina resulted in sixty people holding placards denouncing me a few months ago at the airport when I got off the plane in Copenhagen               
According to declassified state department files  Kissinger also hindered the Carter administration s efforts to halt the mass killings by the           military dictatorship by visiting the country as Videla s personal guest to attend the      FIFA World Cup and praising the regime              

Brazil s nuclear weapons program
Kissinger was in favor of accommodating Brazil while it pursued a nuclear weapons program in the     s  Kissinger justified his position by arguing that Brazil was a U S  ally and on the grounds that it would benefit private nuclear industry actors in the U S  Kissinger s position on Brazil was out of sync with influential voices in the U S  Congress  the State Department  and the U S  Arms Control and Disarmament Agency              

Rhodesia
In September       Kissinger was actively involved in negotiations regarding the Rhodesian Bush War  Kissinger  along with South Africa s prime minister John Vorster  pressured Rhodesian prime minister Ian Smith to hasten the transition to black majority rule in Rhodesia  With FRELIMO in control of Mozambique and even the apartheid regime of South Africa withdrawing its support  Rhodesia s isolation was nearly complete  According to Smith s autobiography  Kissinger told Smith of Mrs  Kissinger s admiration for him  but Smith stated that he thought Kissinger was asking him to sign Rhodesia s  death certificate   Kissinger  bringing the weight of the United States  and corralling other relevant parties to put pressure on Rhodesia  hastened the end of white minority rule              

Portuguese Empire
In contrast to the unfriendly disposition of the previous Kennedy and Johnson administrations towards the Estado Novo regime of Portugal  particularly with regards to its attempts to maintain the Portuguese Colonial Empire by waging the Portuguese Colonial War against anti colonial rebellions in defense of its empire  the Department of State under Kissinger adopted a more conciliatory attitude towards Portugal  In       the administration of President Nixon successfully renewed the lease of the American military base in the Azores  despite condemnation from the Congressional Black Caucus and some members of the Senate  Though privately continuing to view Portugal contemptibly for its perceived atavistic foreign policy towards Africa  Kissinger publicly expressed thanks for Portugal s agreement to use its military base in Lajes in the Azores to resupply Israel in the Yom Kippur War  Following the fall of the far right Portuguese regime in       Kissinger worried that the new government s hasty decolonization plan might benefit radical factions such as the MPLA in Angola  He also expressed concern that the inclusion of the Portuguese Communist Party in the new Portuguese government could legitimize communist parties in other NATO member states  such as Italy

President Donald Trump meeting with Kissinger on May

In an interview with Charlie Rose on August           Kissinger said about President Trump   I m hoping for an Augustinian moment  for St  Augustine          who in his early life followed a pattern that was quite incompatible with later on when he had a vision  and rose to sainthood  One does not expect the president to become that  but it s conceivable                Kissinger also argued that Russian president Vladimir Putin wanted to weaken Hillary Clinton  not elect Donald Trump  Kissinger said that Putin  thought wrongly incidentally that she would be extremely confrontational          I think he tried to weaken the incoming president  Clinton                

Views on U S  foreign policy
Yugoslav Wars
Kissinger  alongside President Barack Obama and other politicians  discussing the New START Treaty between the U S  and Russia      
In several articles of his and interviews that he gave during the Yugoslav Wars  he criticized the United States  policies in Southeast Europe  among other things for the recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a sovereign state  which he described as a foolish act               Most importantly he dismissed the notion of Serbs and Croats being aggressors or separatist  saying that  they can t be separating from something that has never existed                In addition  he repeatedly warned the West against inserting itself into a conflict that has its roots at least hundreds of years back in time  and said that the West would do better if it allowed the Serbs and Croats to join their respective countries               Kissinger shared similarly critical views on Western involvement in Kosovo  In particular  he held a disparaging view of the Rambouillet Agreement              

The Rambouillet text  which called on Serbia to admit NATO troops throughout Yugoslavia  was a provocation  an excuse to start bombing  Rambouillet is not a document that any Serb could have accepted  It was a terrible diplomatic document that should never have been presented in that form 
However  as the Serbs did not accept the Rambouillet text and NATO bombings started  he opted to support a continuation of the bombing as NATO s credibility was now at stake  but dismissed the use of ground forces in claiming that it was not worth it              

Iraq
Kissinger speaking during Gerald Ford s funeral in January     
In       it was reported in the book State of Denial by Bob Woodward that Kissinger met regularly with President George W  Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney to offer advice on the Iraq War               Kissinger confirmed in recorded interviews with Woodward              that the advice was the same as he had given in a column in The Washington Post on August            Victory over the insurgency is the only meaningful exit strategy                Kissinger also frequently met with U S  Secretary of State Colin Powell  whom he warned that Coalition Provisional Authority Director L  Paul Bremer was  a control freak               
In an interview on the BBC s Sunday AM on November           Kissinger was asked whether there was any hope left for a clear military victory in Iraq and responded   If you mean by  military victory  an Iraqi government that can be established and whose writ runs across the whole country  that gets the civil war under control and sectarian violence under control in a time period that the political processes of the democracies will support  I don t believe that is possible           I think we have to redefine the course  But I don t believe that the alternative is between military victory as it had been defined previously  or total withdrawal               
In an interview with Peter Robinson of the Hoover Institution on April          Kissinger reiterated that even though he supported the      invasion of Iraq               he thought that the George W  Bush administration rested too much of its case for war on Saddam s supposed weapons of mass destruction  Robinson noted that Kissinger had criticized the administration for invading with too few troops  for disbanding the Iraqi Army as part of de Baathification  and for mishandling relations with certain allies

In       Kissinger published On China  chronicling the evolution of Sino American relations and laying out the challenges to a partnership of  genuine strategic trust  between the U S  and China               In this book On China and his      book World Order  as well as in his      interview with Financial Times  Kissinger consistently stated that he believed that China wants to restore its historic role as the Middle Kingdom and be  the principal adviser to all humanity                                         
In       during a period of worsening Sino American relations caused by the COVID    pandemic  the Hong Kong protests  and the U S  China trade war  Kissinger expressed concerns that the United States and China are entering a Second Cold War and will eventually become embroiled in a military conflict similar to World War I  He called for Chinese leader Xi Jinping and the incoming U S  president elect Joe Biden to take a less confrontational foreign policy               Kissinger previously said that a potential war between China and the United States would be  worse than the world wars that ruined European civilization               
In July       Kissinger traveled to Beijing to meet with Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu  who was sanctioned by the U S  government in      for engaging in the purchase of combat aircraft from a Russian arms exporter               Kissinger emphasized Sino American relations in the meeting  stating that  the United States and China should eliminate misunderstandings  coexist peacefully  and avoid confrontation                Later that trip  Kissinger met with Xi with the intention of defrosting relations between the U S  and China              

Iran
Kissinger s position on this issue of U S  Iran talks was reported by the Tehran Times to be that  Any direct talks between the U S  and Iran on issues such as the nuclear dispute would be most likely to succeed if they first involved only diplomatic staff and progressed to the level of secretary of state before the heads of state meet                In       Kissinger said that the biggest challenge facing the Middle East is the  potential domination of the region by an Iran that is both imperial and jihadist   He further wrote in August      that if the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran and its Shiite allies were allowed to fill the territorial vacuum left by a militarily defeated Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant  the region would be left with a land corridor extending from Iran to the Levant  which could mark the emergence of an Iranian radical empire                Commenting on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action  Kissinger said that he would not have agreed to it  but that Trump s plan to end the agreement after it was signed would  enable the Iranians to do more than us               

     Ukrainian crisis
Henry Kissinger on April         
On March          The Washington Post published an op ed piece by Kissinger     days before the Crimean referendum on whether Autonomous Republic of Crimea should officially rejoin Ukraine or join neighboring Russia               In it  he attempted to balance the Ukrainian  Russian  and Western desires for a functional state  He made four main points 

Ukraine should have the right to choose freely its economic and political associations  including with Europe 
Ukraine should not join NATO  a repetition of the position he took seven years before 
Ukraine should be free to create any government compatible with the expressed will of its people  Wise Ukrainian leaders would then opt for a policy of reconciliation between the various parts of their country  He imagined an international position for Ukraine like that of Finland 
Ukraine should maintain sovereignty over Crimea 
Kissinger also wrote   The west speaks Ukrainian  the east speaks mostly Russian  Any attempt by one wing of Ukraine to dominate the other as has been the pattern would lead eventually to civil war or break up               
Following the publication of his book titled World Order  Kissinger participated in an interview with Charlie Rose and updated his position on Ukraine  which he saw as a possible geographical mediator between Russia and the West               In a question he posed to himself for illustration regarding re conceiving policy regarding Ukraine  Kissinger stated   If Ukraine is considered an outpost  then the situation is that its eastern border is the NATO strategic line  and NATO will be within     miles           km  of Volgograd  That will never be accepted by Russia  On the other hand  if the Russian western line is at the border of Poland  Europe will be permanently disquieted  The Strategic objective should have been to see whether one can build Ukraine as a bridge between East and West  and whether one can do it as a kind of a joint effort               
In December       Kissinger advised President elect Donald Trump to accept  Crimea as a part of Russia  in an attempt to secure a rapprochement between the United States and Russia  whose relations soured as a result of the Crimean crisis               When asked if he explicitly considered Russia s sovereignty over Crimea legitimate  Kissinger answered in the affirmative  reversing the position he took in his Washington Post op ed              

Computers and nuclear weapons
In       Kissinger wrote about the increasing tendency to give control of nuclear weapons to computers operating with artificial intelligence  AI  that   Adversaries  ignorance of AI developed configurations will become a strategic advantage                Kissinger argued that giving power to launch nuclear weapons to computers using algorithms to make decisions would eliminate the human factor and give the advantage to the state that had the most effective AI system as a computer can make decisions about war and peace far faster than any human ever could               Just as an AI enhanced computer can win chess games by anticipating human decision making  an AI enhanced computer could be useful in a crisis as in a nuclear war  the side that strikes first would have the advantage by destroying the opponent s nuclear capacity  Kissinger also noted there was always the danger that a computer could make a decision to start a nuclear war before diplomacy had been exhausted  or for a reason that would not be understandable to the operators               Kissinger also warned the use of AI to control nuclear weapons would impose  opacity  on the decision making process as the algorithms that control the AI system are not readily understandable  destabilizing the decision making process 

grand strategy requires an understanding of the capabilities and military deployments of potential adversaries  But if more and more intelligence becomes opaque  how will policy makers understand the views and abilities of their adversaries and perhaps even allies  Will many different internets emerge or  in the end  only one  What will be the implications for cooperation  For confrontation  As AI becomes ubiquitous  new concepts for its security need to emerge              
COVID    pandemic
On April          Kissinger shared his diagnostic view of the COVID    pandemic  saying that it threatens the  liberal world order   Kissinger added that the virus does not know borders although global leaders are trying to address the crisis on a mainly national basis  He stressed that the key is not a purely national effort but greater international cooperation            

Russian invasion of Ukraine
In May       speaking to the World Economic Forum on the Russian invasion of Ukraine  Kissinger advocated for a diplomatic settlement that would restore the status quo ante bellum  effectively ceding Crimea and parts of Donbas to Russian control               Kissinger urged Ukrainians to  match the heroism they have shown with wisdom   arguing that   p ursuing the war beyond that point would not be about the freedom of Ukraine  but a new war against Russia itself                He spoke to Edward Luce and a Financial Times audience in the same month               Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected Kissinger s suggestions  saying Ukraine would not agree to peace until Russia agreed to return Crimea and the Donbas region to Ukraine              
On a book tour to sell Leadership  Six Studies in World Strategy in July      he spoke to Judy Woodruff of PBS and he was still of the opinion that  a negotiation is desirable  and clarified his earlier statements  saying that he supported a ceasefire line on the borders of February    and that  Russia should not gain anything from the war    Ukraine above all cannot give up territory that it had when the war started because this would be symbolically dangerous               
On January           Kissinger was interviewed by Graham Allison for a World Economic Forum audience  he said that U S  support should be intensified until either the February    borders are reached or the February    borders are recognized  upon which time under a ceasefire agreement negotiations would begin  Kissinger felt that Russia needs to be given an opportunity to rejoin the comity of nations while the sanctions are maintained until final settlement is reached  He expressed his admiration for President Zelenskyy and lauded the heroic conduct of the Ukrainian people  Kissinger felt that the invasion has ipso facto its logical outcome pointed to NATO membership for Ukraine at the end of the peace process              
In September       Kissinger met with Volodymyr Zelenskyy in New York City  on which occasion they discussed his change in position on Ukraine s NATO membership ambitions              

Gaza war
In a statement made a month before his death  Kissinger responded to the October   Hamas led attack on Israel and outbreak of the Gaza war by saying that the goals of Hamas  can only be to mobilize the Arab world against Israel and to get off the track of peaceful negotiations   In response to celebrations of the attack by some Arabs in Germany  he issued a statement denouncing Muslim immigration into Germany   It was a grave mistake to let in so many people of totally different culture and religion and concepts  because it creates a pressure group inside each country that does that

Nixon s and Kissinger s conversation on October        


Problems playing this file  See media help 

A      poll of American international relations scholars conducted by the College of William  amp  Mary ranked Kissinger as the most effective Secretary of State in the    years prior to                  In       Time commented that  a streak of suspicion seems to underlie all that he does  and  His jokes about his paranoia have an uncomfortable edge of truth   He was so often seen escorting Hollywood starlets that the Village Voice charged he was  a secret square posing as a swinger                The insight   Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac   is widely attributed to him  although Kissinger was paraphrasing Napoleon Bonaparte               Critics on the right  such as Ray Takeyh  have faulted Kissinger for his role in the Nixon administration s opening to China and secret negotiations with North Vietnam  Takeyh writes that while rapprochement with China was a worthy goal  the Nixon administration failed to achieve any meaningful concessions from Chinese officials in return  as China continued to support North Vietnam and various  revolutionary forces throughout the Third World    nor does there appear to be even a remote  indirect connection between Nixon and Kissinger s diplomacy and the communist leadership s decision  after Mao s bloody rule  to move away from a communist economy towards state capitalism              
Historian Jeffrey Kimball developed the theory that Kissinger and the Nixon administration accepted a South Vietnamese collapse provided a face saving decent interval passed between U S  withdrawal and defeat               In his first meeting with Zhou Enlai in       Kissinger  laid out in detail the settlement terms that would produce such a delayed defeat  total American withdrawal  return of all American POWs  and a ceasefire in place for     months or some period    in the words of historian Ken Hughes               On October          Kissinger told Nixon twice that the terms of the Paris Peace Accords would probably destroy South Vietnam   I also think that Thieu is right  that our terms will eventually destroy him                             However  Kissinger denied using a  decent interval  strategy  writing  All of us who negotiated the agreement of October    were convinced that we had vindicated the anguish of a decade not by a  decent interval  but by a decent settlement                Johannes Kadura offers a positive assessment of Nixon and Kissinger s strategy  arguing that the two men  simultaneously maintained a Plan A of further supporting Saigon and a Plan B of shielding Washington should their maneuvers prove futile   According to Kadura  the  decent interval  concept has been  largely misrepresented   in that Nixon and Kissinger  sought to gain time  make the North turn inward  and create a perpetual equilibrium  rather than acquiescing in the collapse of South Vietnam              
Kissinger s record was brought up during the      Democratic Party presidential primaries  Hillary Clinton had cultivated a close relationship with Kissinger  describing him as a  friend  and a source of  counsel                During the Democratic primary debates  Clinton touted Kissinger s praise for her record as secretary of state                            In response  candidate Bernie Sanders criticized Kissinger and said   I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend  I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger               
Kissinger was an immensely beloved figure within China  with China News Service describing him in his obituary as someone  who had a sharp vision and a thorough understanding of world affairs                            

Legacy and reception
Kissinger has generally received a polarizing reception  some have portrayed him as a strategic genius who was willing to act in a utilitarian manner  others have portrayed his foreign policy decisions as immoral and profoundly damaging in the long run              

Positive views
Historian Niall Ferguson has argued that Kissinger is one of the most effective secretaries of state in American history               The editorial board of The Wall Street Journal stated in the aftermath of his death  Kissinger was a target of both the right and left in those perilous Cold War years  often unfairly   The article noted that he was often criticized by American conservatives for overlooking human rights in China  while saying  he had no illusions about the Communist Party or its nationalist ambitions  His view was that the U S  and China had to achieve some modus vivendi to avoid war despite their profound cultural and political differences  while claiming that  the alternatives then  as now  weren t usually  democracy advocates  of the left s imagining  They were often Communists who would have aligned themselves with the Soviets       The U S  provided covert aid to Allende s political opponents  but declassified briefings from the time show the U S  was unaware of the military coup that deposed him  Kissinger wasn t responsible for Augusto Pinochet s coup or its bloody excesses  Chile eventually became a democracy     Cuba remains a dictatorship               

Negative views
A number of journalists  activists  and human rights lawyers accused Kissinger of being responsible for war crimes during his tenure in government                          Some sought civil and even criminal penalties against Kissinger  but none of these attempts were successful               In September       relatives and survivors of General Rene Schneider filed civil proceedings in federal court in Washington  D C               The suit was later dismissed               In April       a petition for Kissinger s arrest was filed in the High Court of Justice in London by human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell  citing the destruction of civilian populations and the environment in Indochina during the years                                      The petition was rejected one day after filing              
One of his most prominent critics was American British journalist and author Christopher Hitchens  Hitchens authored The Trial of Henry Kissinger  in which he called for the prosecution of Kissinger  for war crimes  for crimes against humanity  and for offenses against common or customary or international law  including conspiracy to commit murder  kidnap  and torture                                                       American chef and TV personality Anthony Bourdain wrote in A Cook s Tour   Once you ve been to Cambodia  you ll never stop wanting to beat Henry Kissinger to death with your bare hands    Witness what  he  did    and you will never understand why he s not sitting in the dock at The Hague next to Milo evi                             
Author Robert D  Kaplan and historian Niall Ferguson have disputed these notions and argued that there is a double standard in how Kissinger is judged in comparison to others  They have defended Kissinger by arguing that American power to advocate for human rights in other nations is often counterproductive and limited  that taking into consideration geopolitical realities is an inevitable part of any effective foreign policy  and that there are utilitarian reasons to defend most of the decisions of his tenure              

Other perspectives
Several historians have rejected both prominent reputations of Kissinger  David Greenberg argued that each are exaggerated caricatures that overstate both his genius and immorality  In fact  if there s a single word I d apply to Kissinger  it s  overrated   He was overrated as a scholar  famous mainly for writing a very long dissertation   He was overrated as a strategist  he often gave bad advice  as he did in urging George W  Bush not to withdraw troops from Iraq   He was even overrated as a villain        the  Christopher Hitchenses  of the world loved to call him a  war criminal   but this was a fundamentally unserious charge  The Defense Department  not the State Department  prosecutes wars  and the president oversees it        but the Hitchenses preferred to go after Kissinger rather than  Defense Secretaries  Mel Laird or James Schlesinger or even Nixon               Similarly  Mario Del Pero argued  He was not particularly original or bold  once we scratch away from his writings the deliberately opaque and convoluted prose he often used  possibly to try to render more original thoughts and reflections that were in reality fairly conventional      In short  he wasn t a war criminal  he wasn t a very deep or sophisticated thinker  he rarely challenged the intellectual vogues of the time  even because it would have meant to challenge those in power  something he always was and still is reluctant to do   and once in government he displayed a certain intellectual laziness vis   vis the intricacies and complexities of a world that he still tended to see in black and white
