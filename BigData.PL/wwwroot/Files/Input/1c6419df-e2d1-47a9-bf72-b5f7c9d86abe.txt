On July           the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the merger of Exelon and Public Service Enterprise Group  a New Jersey utility             however  after    months  the two companies terminated the agreement due to pressure put on the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities by public interest groups  including New Jersey Citizen Action                       
On March           Exelon acquired Constellation Energy  with the combined company owning more than    gigawatts of power generation      nuclear      natural gas     renewable including hydro     oil and    coal                         
Exelon announced the proposed purchase of Pepco Holdings on April           for      billion in an all cash transaction  The merger faced stiff opposition from community groups and D C  Mayor Muriel Bowser              The merger was originally rejected by the District of Columbia Public Service Commission in August       though it was approved by other federal and state regulators  The companies appealed the decision              On March           the merger was finally approved by the District of Columbia Public Service Commission after the company made concessions and the merger was completed  making Exelon the largest regulated utility in the United States by customer count and total revenue

In       Exelon was required to pay a          fine for exceeding the permitted sulfur dioxide emission limit from April to October      at its Cromby Generating Station in Chester County  Pennsylvania 
Exelon and Illinois state officials waited for four years until      before disclosing that Exelon s Braidwood Nuclear Generating Station  a nuclear plant    miles southwest of Chicago  had spilled millions of gallons of water containing tritium  a radioactive form of hydrogen  multiple times over a decade   Exelon officials eventually apologized and said the risks from the leak were  minimal   with tritium levels in surrounding wells all found to be below regulatory limits                         
In       the Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced its plan for a         fine against Exelon for permitting its contracted security guards that were guarding its Peach Bottom Nuclear Generating Station  a two reactor nuclear plant located in Delta  Pennsylvania  to sleep on the job  The incidents did not come to light until a videotape of the security guards was leaked to news media              As a result  Exelon terminated the security contract of the Wackenhut security firm that had been involved and now operates its own in house nuclear security force
