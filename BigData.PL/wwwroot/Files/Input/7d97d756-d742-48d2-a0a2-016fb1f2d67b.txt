							Recently  Egypt is achieving remarkable progress in attracting more tourists  It managed to organise the CAF in a professional and civilised way that dazzled the entire world 
Countless effort is being exerted to increase the ratio of tourism toward Egypt through different state channels  including parliament  with the aim of transferring the right image of the country and correcting many erroneous stereotypes of Egypt in foreign societies in the wake of political instability that popped up during the one year rule of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group  
With the aim of getting the new updates on tourism and plans to improve touristic destinations in Egypt  Daily News Egypt sat down with former head of the parliament s civil and tourism committee and member of the parliament  Sahar Talaat Mostafa  who previously suggested establishing a ministerial group which includes the tourism  antiques  civil aviation  and transportation ministries  The group would work with the aims of improving the tourism sector in Egypt as well as affording all tourists  demands in the country  
Recently  a delegation from the Russian Federal Council paid a visit to Egypt  You  as the president of the Russian Egyptian Parliamentary Friendship Group  and the Chairperson of the Egyptian Russian Business Council  were the first to receive them  What happened during these meetings 
Of course  I met with members of the delegation of the Russian Federal Council who were on a visit to Egypt this July  and we engaged in an extensive meeting at the House of Representatives  The meeting witnessed a number of discussions and important results  including the discussion on resuming flights to Egypt to increase the flow of tourists 
Members of the delegation expected the resumption of flights to Egypt next autumn  
The meeting also dealt with the development of cultural cooperation  especially with regard to the expansion of establishing art academies  The Russian side supported us to establish the first art academy in the Haram district    years ago  Currently  there is a branch for an Art Academy that is being established in the Sixth of October city  and to complete this academy I called them to afford more support in establishing it among other proposals that I saw as an occasion to discuss and implement during the joint cultural year between Egypt and Russia and in line with the decision of President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi and President Putin that      is the year of humanity between the two countries 
How will Egypt benefit from the Russian African summit scheduled next October 
Egypt is the gateway to Africa  and the summit comes while Egypt is heading the African Union 
It is expected to open the door to further economic cooperation between Russia and Africa  as well as develop the political  economic  and cultural fields  It is planned  as I am aware  to discuss a wide range of international issues  including the fight against new threats  and the promotion of regional stability  
In the same context  your visit to Russia recently within the parliamentary delegation has had important results  Can you please inform us more about it 
The visit of the Egyptian Parliamentary delegation to Russia headed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives Ali Abdel Al Aal was very important  The reception of the Russian side to us was an expression of their interest in Egypt  During the visit  we participated in the second international forum on parliamentary development and the Russian  African Parliamentary Conference  We had important meetings in this regard  among them the Head of the Russian Federal Federation Council and the Head of Russia       s State Duma  On the personal level  I met the group of friends of Egypt in the Federal Federation of Russia  We also discussed all aspects of cooperation between the two sides in the common areas and how to benefit from the most important event of the Russia Africa Summit scheduled for October  in addition to the discussion of applying the  Twin Towns  system between Egypt and Russia and the importance of cooperation between the Egyptian Parliament and its Russian counterpart in organising the joint legislation agenda 
How does the State       s external and domestic efforts affect the flow of tourism to Egypt 
I believe that the huge number of foreign visits of President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi  directly affected our relations with the countries of the world  and played a major role in re branding Egypt as an appropriate destination  The political leadership has a great interest in the tourism file in Egypt  The president does not leave an opportunity to provide support to the tourism sector  this was very clear through his meetings with number of international leaders such as the German Chancellor Angela Merkel  which had a significant impact on the increase in the volume of tourism  The Egyptian Parliament has also played a major role by providing all forms of legislative support with new laws that serve the sector  in addition to the great efforts of the ministers of antiquities  tourism and all relevant state bodies  which also had a clear role in restoring security which is the most important message to the world  to come to Egypt 
Do you think that Egypt s tourism can target new touristic destinations 
Yes  Egypt is a diverse and rich country with many tourist products that can be promoted in various markets exporting tourism  We have in Egypt what is not found in any country in the world  we have wonderful monuments  culture  civilisation  beaches  entertainment  and shopping  We have entered into deals with various tourist destinations such as East Asia  in addition to the agreement between President Al Sisi  the president of Cyprus and the Greek President to coordinate tourist activity among the three countries  which we discussed in one of our parliamentary visits to Cyprus 
Does Egypt need to increase hotel capacity now or to add international luxury projects like Dubai 
There are enough hotel rooms in the traditional tourist destinations  but there are places of course that need new tourist rooms like Alamein  and I assure you that Egypt is always able to meet the demand for tourist destination  what we really need is world class entertainment projects  being one of the most important attractions and promotors of tourism  so that the tourist is not confined to his room 
 Accessible tourism  is one of the files that have become strongly on the table of the World Tourism Organization  can Egypt get a fair share of them 
It is certainly a very important file especially that it has become a global trend and one of the factors affecting the tourist s decision  especially in the case of a family member with special needs  and it became on the list of interest of the government and the private sector tourism  This segment of tourists have the right to access services that help them to live a distinct tourist experience  highly qualified tour guides  service providers  and hotels  as well as tourist facilities in a technical format that take into account that segment of tourists  which account for     of the volume of global tourism  There are also a large number of people who have reached the age of retirement and are interested in foreign visits  I sat with a great number of them  especially from the German market  but they demand special attention from the beginning of their arrival at the airport until they leave the country  
Do we have the ability to experience a loss in exchange for marketing Egyptian tourism externally 
First  marketing should be done on a scientific basis  meaning that the market is studied before the decision is made  This decision is made through representatives of the private sector such as the Federation of Chambers of Tourism  the Chamber of Tourism Companies and the administrative authority represented by the Tourism Promotion Authority in addition to the company or the corporate alliance responsible for promoting the tourist destination  Secondly  in the event of choosing a market or a group of markets to start promoting for the tourist destination  it is necessary to determine the nature of this market  and to consider all the studies related to it in terms of the trends of the prospective tourist  such as do they prefer cultural tourism or shopping  Are these tourists coming alone or with their families  Some markets  for example  women are the most influential in deciding the destination of the trip  and others children are the basis  and some markets the only source of young tourists prefer adventure tourism  Therefore  there is no risk or loss  as long as there is institutional work based on market studies  It is not logical that Egypt  for example  will conduct marketing and promotion campaigns in some markets that will impose a travel ban on our country  
In the context of the archaeology file  some Egyptian artifacts have recently appeared in a number of countries in the world  such as the head of
Former head of the parliament s civil and tourism committee and member of the parliament  Sahar Talaat Mostafa
Tutankhamun  which was exhibited in London  What can we do to recover these pieces to Egypt 
First of all  we must make it clear that the statue is the head of the god Amun and bears the features of the young king Tutankhamun  Second  the Egyptian government has taken a series of measures from the beginning represented by the ministries of foreign affairs  antiquities and the Attorney General  moreover the British government was informed that it is necessary to stop the auction  In spite of that  the auction was held and the statue was sold  The Egyptian government held an emergency meeting to discuss the matter and legally moved toward suspending the exit of the statue in case it moved to any other country  In my opinion  legal and criminal prosecution is particularly important because the auction hall did not provide any proof of ownership and only made a brief statement that did not provide any information with evidence 
I call on UNESCO to intervene to stop what I consider to be a        theft        of Egyptian identity  I call on lovers of civilisation and soft forces around the world to pressure the public to stop such crimes  The world should know that a part of the antiquities trade money may go to the financing of terrorism  The message that I want to convey to the world in this context is that Egypt does not need to prove that its civilisation which is known to the whole world  is not for sale 
What about the pyramids development project and the expected results 
I want to clarify at the beginning that the project of developing the pyramid is a great dream for me  you can say that I am associated with a spiritual connection to all our monuments  we worked a lot in the tourism committee of the parliament during my presidency in collaboration with the ministry of antiquities and concerned parties to achieve a civilised image of the pyramids  Especially as it carries an important aspect of our Egyptian identity  We  as members of the parliament  organised a number of field visits to discuss developments and overcome any obstacles facing the project 
How will the Grand Egyptian Museum change tourists  experience in Egypt 
What I want to say about this project in short  that the project of the Grand Egyptian Museum  GEM  is highly important  it tells the story of Egyptian civilisation based on the latest technological methods  and provides a precise picture of the civilisation and history of Egypt  The project is a great opportunity for Egypt to increase the rate of incoming cultural tourism  Here I would like to mention the great effort exerted by the ministry of antiquities and the Armed Forces Engineering Authority in this regard  as well as hundreds of workers who laboured day and night without days off  I expect that the grand museum will be the jewel of Egypt for the world  It is planned to be linked with the pyramids  I also expect that the grand opening of the museum will be another spectacle to dazzle the world with the power of Egypt and its ability to organise 
Before the start of the African Nations Cup  you called on the state to promote Egyptian monuments during the events        Did this happen 
Certainly  the African Nations Cup is an important opportunity to promote Egyptian tourism in general  especially in the presence of important Icons for African and international media  and I think that Egypt was able to dazzle the whole world in less than a quarter of an hour during the organisation ceremony and send a clear message that Egypt is a strong and safe state that is able to regulate what is greater than that  but as for what I demanded  there was indeed a response from the Minister of Antiquities  Khalid Al Anani  Moreover  many renowned guests appeared in their social media while they were in the events of the cup  this contributed very well in promoting for tourism in Egypt 
What is your interest in promoting the  Egyptian identity  in many of the posts you write on your official Facebook page 
Let me talk about this in a detailed way because I decided to put it at the top of my interests  I am interested in highlighting the importance of the Egyptian identity because it enjoys the privacy and uniqueness that has been exposed for nearly five decades to the attempts of deliberate sabotage  and pasting strange habits that came into Egyptian society without taking into account the privacy of the Egyptian personality  beside the waves of ignorance  spreading rumours and lies about Egypt  its history  culture and identity need a comprehensive confrontation of facts and evidence in order to protect the younger generations so as not to be surprised by the day when we have a generation that doubts its past and does not know anything about its history  
I notice great interest in this matter  is there a project adopted by you in this context during the coming period 
There will be an important project in that context  and I will study carefully with a specialised team  but it will be officially announced in due course 
What is your feedback on the first test flight that headed to the New Administrative Capital s airport 
I saw a dream turning into reality  In just    months  we have a world class airport  a parking area for     cars     buses     buildings  and a    metre air observation tower in the New Administrative Capital  Today  we can say that the New Administrative Capital has been linked to all countries of the world and in my view that this scene opens wide horizons for investment and tourism and is a new achievement for the Egyptian state
