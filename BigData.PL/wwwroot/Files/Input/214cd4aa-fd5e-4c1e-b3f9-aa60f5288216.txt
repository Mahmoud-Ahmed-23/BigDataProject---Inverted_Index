Decision theory or the theory of rational choice is a branch of probability  economics  and analytic philosophy that uses expected utility and probability to model how individuals would behave rationally under uncertainty                        It differs from the cognitive and behavioral sciences in that it is mainly prescriptive and concerned with identifying optimal decisions for a rational agent  rather than describing how people actually make decisions  Despite this  the field is important to the study of real human behavior by social scientists  as it lays the foundations to mathematically model and analyze individuals in fields such as sociology  economics  criminology  cognitive science  moral philosophy and political science      citation needed

The roots of decision theory lie in probability theory  developed by Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat in the   th century  which was later refined by others like Christiaan Huygens  These developments provided a framework for understanding risk and uncertainty  which are central to decision making 
In the   th century  Daniel Bernoulli introduced the concept of  expected utility  in the context of gambling  which was later formalized by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in the     s  Their work on Game Theory and Expected Utility Theory helped establish a rational basis for decision making under uncertainty 
After World War II  decision theory expanded into economics  particularly with the work of economists like Milton Friedman and others  who applied it to market behavior and consumer choice theory  This era also saw the development of Bayesian decision theory  which incorporates Bayesian probability into decision making models 
By the late   th century  scholars like Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky challenged the assumptions of rational decision making  Their work in behavioral economics highlighted cognitive biases and heuristics that influence real world decisions  leading to the development of prospect theory  which modified expected utility theory by accounting for psychological factors 

Branches edit 
Normative decision theory is concerned with identification of optimal decisions where optimality is often determined by considering an ideal decision maker who is able to calculate with perfect accuracy and is in some sense fully rational  The practical application of this prescriptive approach  how people ought to make decisions  is called decision analysis and is aimed at finding tools  methodologies  and software  decision support systems  to help people make better decisions                       
In contrast  descriptive decision theory is concerned with describing observed behaviors often under the assumption that those making decisions are behaving under some consistent rules  These rules may  for instance  have a procedural framework  e g  Amos Tversky s elimination by aspects model  or an axiomatic framework  e g  stochastic transitivity axioms   reconciling the Von Neumann Morgenstern axioms with behavioral violations of the expected utility hypothesis  or they may explicitly give a functional form for time inconsistent utility functions  e g  Laibson s quasi hyperbolic discounting                        
Prescriptive decision theory is concerned with predictions about behavior that positive decision theory produces to allow for further tests of the kind of decision making that occurs in practice  In recent decades  there has also been increasing interest in  behavioral decision theory   contributing to a re evaluation of what useful decision making requires                       

Types of decisions edit 
Choice under uncertainty edit 
Further information  Expected utility hypothesis
The area of choice under uncertainty represents the heart of decision theory  Known from the   th century  Blaise Pascal invoked it in his famous wager  which is contained in his Pens es  published in        the idea of expected value is that  when faced with a number of actions  each of which could give rise to more than one possible outcome with different probabilities  the rational procedure is to identify all possible outcomes  determine their values  positive or negative  and the probabilities that will result from each course of action  and multiply the two to give an  expected value   or the average expectation for an outcome  the action to be chosen should be the one that gives rise to the highest total expected value  In       Daniel Bernoulli published an influential paper entitled Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk  in which he uses the St  Petersburg paradox to show that expected value theory must be normatively wrong  He gives an example in which a Dutch merchant is trying to decide whether to insure a cargo being sent from Amsterdam to St  Petersburg in winter  In his solution  he defines a utility function and computes expected utility rather than expected financial value            
In the   th century  interest was reignited by Abraham Wald s      paper pointing out that the two central procedures of sampling distribution based statistical theory  namely hypothesis testing and parameter estimation  are special cases of the general decision problem             Wald s paper renewed and synthesized many concepts of statistical theory  including loss functions  risk functions  admissible decision rules  antecedent distributions  Bayesian procedures  and minimax procedures  The phrase  decision theory  itself was used in      by E  L  Lehmann            
The revival of subjective probability theory  from the work of Frank Ramsey  Bruno de Finetti  Leonard Savage and others  extended the scope of expected utility theory to situations where subjective probabilities can be used  At the time  von Neumann and Morgenstern s theory of expected utility             proved that expected utility maximization followed from basic postulates about rational behavior 
The work of Maurice Allais and Daniel Ellsberg showed that human behavior has systematic and sometimes important departures from expected utility maximization  Allais paradox and Ellsberg paradox               The prospect theory of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky renewed the empirical study of economic behavior with less emphasis on rationality presuppositions  It describes a way by which people make decisions when all of the outcomes carry a risk              Kahneman and Tversky found three regularities   in actual human decision making   losses loom larger than gains   people focus more on changes in their utility states than they focus on absolute utilities  and the estimation of subjective probabilities is severely biased by anchoring 

Intertemporal choice edit 
Main article  Intertemporal choice
Intertemporal choice is concerned with the kind of choice where different actions lead to outcomes that are realized at different stages over time              It is also described as cost benefit decision making since it involves the choices between rewards that vary according to magnitude and time of arrival              If someone received a windfall of several thousand dollars  they could spend it on an expensive holiday  giving them immediate pleasure  or they could invest it in a pension scheme  giving them an income at some time in the future  What is the optimal thing to do  The answer depends partly on factors such as the expected rates of interest and inflation  the person s life expectancy  and their confidence in the pensions industry  However even with all those factors taken into account  human behavior again deviates greatly from the predictions of prescriptive decision theory  leading to alternative models in which  for example  objective interest rates are replaced by subjective discount rates      citation needed     

Interaction of decision makers edit 
Military planners often conduct extensive simulations to help predict the decision making of relevant actors   
Some decisions are difficult because of the need to take into account how other people in the situation will respond to the decision that is taken  The analysis of such social decisions is often treated under decision theory  though it involves mathematical methods  In the emerging field of socio cognitive engineering  the research is especially focused on the different types of distributed decision making in human organizations  in normal and abnormal emergency crisis situations             

Complex decisions edit 
Other areas of decision theory are concerned with decisions that are difficult simply because of their complexity  or the complexity of the organization that has to make them  Individuals making decisions are limited in resources  i e  time and intelligence  and are therefore boundedly rational  the issue is thus  more than the deviation between real and optimal behavior  the difficulty of determining the optimal behavior in the first place  Decisions are also affected by whether options are framed together or separately  this is known as the distinction bias      citation needed     

Heuristics edit 
Main article  Heuristics in judgment and decision making
The gambler s fallacy  even when the roulette ball repeatedly lands on red  it is no more likely to land on black the next time   
Heuristics are procedures for making a decision without working out the consequences of every option  Heuristics decrease the amount of evaluative thinking required for decisions  focusing on some aspects of the decision while ignoring others              While quicker than step by step processing  heuristic thinking is also more likely to involve fallacies or inaccuracies             
One example of a common and erroneous thought process that arises through heuristic thinking is the gambler s fallacy   believing that an isolated random event is affected by previous isolated random events  For example  if flips of a fair coin give repeated tails  the coin still has the same probability  i e        of tails in future turns  though intuitively it might seems that heads becomes more likely              In the long run  heads and tails should occur equally often  people commit the gambler s fallacy when they use this heuristic to predict that a result of heads is  due  after a run of tails              Another example is that decision makers may be biased towards preferring moderate alternatives to extreme ones  The compromise effect operates under a mindset that the most moderate option carries the most benefit  In an incomplete information scenario  as in most daily decisions  the moderate option will look more appealing than either extreme  independent of the context  based only on the fact that it has characteristics that can be found at either extreme

A highly controversial issue is whether one can replace the use of probability in decision theory with something else 

Probability theory edit 
Advocates for the use of probability theory point to 

the work of Richard Threlkeld Cox for justification of the probability axioms 
the Dutch book paradoxes of Bruno de Finetti as illustrative of the theoretical difficulties that can arise from departures from the probability axioms  and
the complete class theorems  which show that all admissible decision rules are equivalent to the Bayesian decision rule for some utility function and some prior distribution  or for the limit of a sequence of prior distributions   Thus  for every decision rule  either the rule may be reformulated as a Bayesian procedure  or a limit of a sequence of such   or there is a rule that is sometimes better and never worse 
Alternatives to probability theory edit 
The proponents of fuzzy logic  possibility theory  Dempster Shafer theory  and info gap decision theory maintain that probability is only one of many alternatives and point to many examples where non standard alternatives have been implemented with apparent success  Notably  probabilistic decision theory can sometimes be sensitive to assumptions about the probabilities of various events  whereas non probabilistic rules  such as minimax  are robust in that they do not make such assumptions 

Ludic fallacy edit 
Main article  Ludic fallacy
A general criticism of decision theory based on a fixed universe of possibilities is that it considers the  known unknowns   not the  unknown unknowns               it focuses on expected variations  not on unforeseen events  which some argue have outsized impact and must be considered   significant events may be  outside model   This     which       line of argument  called the ludic fallacy  is that there are inevitable imperfections in modeling the real world by particular models  and that unquestioning reliance on models blinds one to their limits
