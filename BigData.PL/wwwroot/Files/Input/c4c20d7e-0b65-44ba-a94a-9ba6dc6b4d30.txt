Greenhouse gases emitted from human activities
Greenhouse gas emissions per person in the highest emitting countries             Areas of rectangles represent total emissions for each country 
Greenhouse gas  GHG  emissions from human activities intensify the greenhouse effect  This contributes to climate change  Carbon dioxide  CO    from burning fossil fuels such as coal  oil  and natural gas  is the main cause of climate change  The largest annual emissions are from China followed by the United States  The United States has higher emissions per capita  The main producers fueling the emissions globally are large oil and gas companies  Emissions from human activities have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide by about     over pre industrial levels  The growing levels of emissions have varied  but have been consistent among all greenhouse gases  Emissions in the     s averaged    billion tons a year  higher than any decade before             Total cumulative emissions from      to      were     GtC       GtCO    of which        GtC          GtCO   from fossil fuels and industry  and        GtC          GtCO   from land use change  Land use change  such as deforestation  caused about     of cumulative emissions over            coal      oil      and gas                           
Carbon dioxide is the main greenhouse gas resulting from human activities  It accounts for more than half of warming  Methane  CH   emissions have almost the same short term impact             Nitrous oxide  N O  and fluorinated gases  F gases  play a lesser role in comparison  Emissions of carbon dioxide  methane and nitrous oxide in      were all higher than ever before            
Electricity generation  heat and transport are major emitters  overall energy is responsible for around     of emissions             Deforestation and other changes in land use also emit carbon dioxide and methane  The largest source of anthropogenic methane emissions is agriculture  closely followed by gas venting and fugitive emissions from the fossil fuel industry  The largest agricultural methane source is livestock  Agricultural soils emit nitrous oxide partly due to fertilizers  Similarly  fluorinated gases from refrigerants play an outsized role in total human emissions 
The current CO  equivalent emission rates averaging     tonnes per person per year             are well over twice the estimated rate     tons                        required to stay within the      Paris Agreement increase of           C            F  over pre industrial levels              Annual per capita emissions in the industrialized countries are typically as much as ten times the average in developing countries             

The carbon footprint  or greenhouse gas footprint  serves as an indicator to compare the amount of greenhouse gases emitted over the entire life cycle from the production of a good or service along the supply chain to its final consumption                          Carbon accounting  or greenhouse gas accounting  is a framework of methods to measure and track how much greenhouse gas an organization emits             
Relevance for greenhouse effect and global warming edit 
These paragraphs are an excerpt from Greenhouse effect  edit 
The greenhouse effect occurs when greenhouse gases in a planet s atmosphere insulate the planet from losing heat to space  raising its surface temperature  Surface heating can happen from an internal heat source  as in the case of Jupiter  or come from an external source  such as its host star  In the case of Earth  the Sun emits shortwave radiation  sunlight  that passes through greenhouse gases to heat the Earth s surface  In response  the Earth s surface emits longwave radiation that is mostly absorbed by greenhouse gases  The absorption of longwave radiation prevents it from reaching space  reducing the rate at which the Earth can cool off 

Without the greenhouse effect  the Earth s average surface temperature would be as cold as           C             F                           This is of course much less than the   th century average of about          C           F                           In addition to naturally present greenhouse gases  burning of fossil fuels has increased amounts of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere                          As a result  global warming of about           C            F  has occurred since the Industrial Revolution              with the global average surface temperature increasing at a rate of            C             F  per decade since

The major anthropogenic  human origin  sources of greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide  CO    nitrous oxide  N O   methane and three groups of fluorinated gases  sulfur hexafluoride  SF    hydrofluorocarbons  HFCs  and perfluorocarbons  PFCs  sulphur hexafluoride  SF    and nitrogen trifluoride  NF                 Though the greenhouse effect is heavily driven by water vapor              human emissions of water vapor are not a significant contributor to warming 
Although CFCs are greenhouse gases  they are regulated by the Montreal Protocol which was motivated by CFCs  contribution to ozone depletion rather than by their contribution to global warming  Ozone depletion has only a minor role in greenhouse warming  though the two processes are sometimes confused in the media  In       negotiators from over     nations meeting at the summit of the United Nations Environment Programme reached a legally binding accord to phase out hydrofluorocarbons  HFCs  in the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol                                      The use of CFC     except some essential uses  has been phased out due to its ozone depleting properties              The phasing out of less active HCFC compounds will be completed in                  

Human activities edit 
The industrial era growth in atmospheric CO  equivalent gas concentrations since                 
Starting about       industrial activity powered by fossil fuels began to significantly increase the concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases  Emissions have grown rapidly since about      with ongoing expansions in global population and economic activity following World War II  As of       measured atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide were almost     higher than pre industrial levels                         
The main sources of greenhouse gases due to human activity  also called carbon sources  are 

Burning fossil fuels  Burning oil  coal and gas is estimated to have emitted      billion tonnes of CO  eq in                   The largest single source is coal fired power stations  with     of greenhouse gases  GHG  as of                  
Land use change  mainly deforestation in the tropics  accounts for about a quarter of total anthropogenic GHG emissions             
Livestock enteric fermentation and manure management              paddy rice farming  land use and wetland changes  human made lakes              pipeline losses  and covered vented landfill emissions leading to higher methane atmospheric concentrations  Many of the newer style fully vented septic systems that enhance and target the fermentation process also are sources of atmospheric methane 
Use of chlorofluorocarbons  CFCs  in refrigeration systems  and use of CFCs and halons in fire suppression systems and manufacturing processes 
Agricultural soils emit nitrous oxide  N O  partly due to application of fertilizers             
The largest source of anthropogenic methane emissions is agriculture  closely followed by gas venting and fugitive emissions from the fossil fuel industry                          The largest agricultural methane source is livestock  Cattle  raised for both beef and milk  as well as for inedible outputs like manure and draft power  are the animal species responsible for the most emissions  representing about     of the livestock sector s emissions             
Global estimates edit 
See also  Arctic methane emissions and Greenhouse gas emissions from wetlandsThis section needs to be updated  Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information    April      
Global greenhouse gas emissions are about    Gt per year             and for      have been estimated at    Gt CO  eq including   Gt due to land use change              In       approximately         GtCO  eq  of total net anthropogenic GHG emissions came from the energy supply sector          GtCO  eq  from industry          GtCO  eq  from agriculture  forestry and other land use  AFOLU            GtCO  eq  from transport and         GtCO  eq  from buildings             
The current CO  equivalent emission rates averaging     tonnes per person per year             are well over twice the estimated rate     tons                        required to stay within the      Paris Agreement increase of           C            F  over pre industrial levels             
While cities are sometimes considered to be disproportionate contributors to emissions  per capita emissions tend to be lower for cities than the averages in their countries             
A      survey of corporations responsible for global emissions found that     companies were responsible for     of global direct and indirect emissions  and that state owned companies were responsible for     of their emissions                         
China is  by a significant margin  Asia s and the world s largest emitter  it emits nearly    billion tonnes each year  more than one quarter of global emissions              Other countries with fast growing emissions are South Korea  Iran  and Australia  which apart from the oil rich Persian Gulf states  now has the highest per capita emission rate in the world   On the other hand  annual per capita emissions of the EU    and the US are gradually decreasing over time              Emissions in Russia and Ukraine have decreased fastest since      due to economic restructuring in these countries             
     was the first year to see both total global economic growth and a reduction of carbon emissions             

High income countries compared to low income countries edit 
CO  emissions per capita versus GDP per capita         In general  countries with a higher GDP per capita also have higher greenhouse gas emissions per capita             
Annual per capita emissions in the industrialized countries are typically as much as ten times the average in developing countries                                    Due to China s fast economic development  its annual per capita emissions are quickly approaching the levels of those in the Annex I group of the Kyoto Protocol  i e   the developed countries excluding the US              
Africa and South America are both fairly small emitters  accounting for      of global emissions each  Both have emissions almost equal to international aviation and shipping             

Calculations and reporting edit

Per capita CO  emissions surged after the mid   th century  but then slowed their rate of growth             
Variables edit 
There are several ways of measuring greenhouse gas emissions  Some variables that have been reported include             

Definition of measurement boundaries  Emissions can be attributed geographically  to the area where they were emitted  the territory principle  or by the activity principle to the territory that produced the emissions  These two principles result in different totals when measuring  for example  electricity importation from one country to another  or emissions at an international airport 
Time horizon of different gases  The contribution of given greenhouse gas is reported as a CO  equivalent  The calculation to determine this takes into account how long that gas remains in the atmosphere  This is not always known accurately     clarification needed      and calculations must be regularly updated to reflect new information 
The measurement protocol itself  This may be via direct measurement or estimation  The four main methods are the emission factor based method  mass balance method  predictive emissions monitoring systems  and continuous emissions monitoring systems  These methods differ in accuracy  cost  and usability  Public information from space based measurements of carbon dioxide by Climate Trace is expected to reveal individual large plants before the      United Nations Climate Change Conference             
These measures are sometimes used by countries to assert various policy ethical positions on climate change                                  The use of different measures leads to a lack of comparability  which is problematic when monitoring progress towards targets  There are arguments for the adoption of a common measurement tool  or at least the development of communication between different tools             

Reporting edit 
Emissions may be tracked over long time periods  known as historical or cumulative emissions measurements  Cumulative emissions provide some indicators of what is responsible for greenhouse gas atmospheric concentration build up                                   

National accounts balance edit 
See also  Carbon leakage
The national accounts balance tracks emissions based on the difference between a country s exports and imports  For many richer nations  the balance is negative because more goods are imported than they are exported  This result is mostly due to the fact that it is cheaper to produce goods outside of developed countries  leading developed countries to become increasingly dependent on services and not goods  A positive account balance would mean that more production was occurring within a country  so more operational factories would increase carbon emission levels             
Emissions may also be measured across shorter time periods  Emissions changes may  for example  be measured against the base year of            was used in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  UNFCCC  as the base year for emissions  and is also used in the Kyoto Protocol  some gases are also measured from the year                                                     A country s emissions may also be reported as a proportion of global emissions for a particular year 
Another measurement is of per capita emissions  This divides a country s total annual emissions by its mid year population                                    Per capita emissions may be based on historical or annual emissions                                       

Embedded emissions edit 
See also  Embedded emissions
One way of attributing greenhouse gas emissions is to measure the embedded emissions  also referred to as  embodied emissions   of goods that are being consumed  Emissions are usually measured according to production  rather than consumption              For example  in the main international treaty on climate change  the UNFCCC   countries report on emissions produced within their borders  e g   the emissions produced from burning fossil fuels                                                                    Under a production based accounting of emissions  embedded emissions on imported goods are attributed to the exporting  rather than the importing  country  Under a consumption based accounting of emissions  embedded emissions on imported goods are attributed to the importing country  rather than the exporting  country 
A substantial proportion of CO  emissions is traded internationally  The net effect of trade was to export emissions from China and other emerging markets to consumers in the US  Japan  and Western Europe                                 

Carbon footprint edit 
This section is an excerpt from Carbon footprint  edit 
A carbon footprint  or greenhouse gas footprint  is a calculated value or index that makes it possible to compare the total amount of greenhouse gases that an activity  product  company or country adds to the atmosphere  Carbon footprints are usually reported in tonnes of emissions  CO  equivalent  per unit of comparison  Such units can be for example tonnes CO  eq per year  per kilogram of protein for consumption  per kilometer travelled  per piece of clothing and so forth  A product s carbon footprint includes the emissions for the entire life cycle  These run from the production along the supply chain to its final consumption and disposal 
Emission intensity edit 
Further information  Emission intensity
Emission intensity is a ratio between greenhouse gas emissions and another metric  e g   gross domestic product  GDP  or energy use  The terms  carbon intensity  and  emissions intensity  are also sometimes used              Emission intensities may be calculated using market exchange rates  MER  or purchasing power parity  PPP                                   

Example tools and websites edit 
Carbon accounting  or greenhouse gas accounting  is a framework of methods to measure and track how much greenhouse gas an organization emits             

Climate TRACE edit 
This section is an excerpt from Climate TRACE  edit 
Climate TRACE  Tracking Real Time Atmospheric Carbon Emissions              is an independent group which monitors and publishes greenhouse gas emissions              It launched in      before COP                and improves monitoring  reporting and verification  MRV  of both carbon dioxide and methane                          The group monitors sources such as coal mines and power station smokestacks worldwide              with satellite data  but not their own satellites  and artificial intelligence                         
Historical trends edit 
Cumulative and historical emissions edit 
Cumulative and annual CO  emissionsCumulatively  the U S  has emitted the greatest amount of CO   though China s emission trend is now steeper             Annually  the U S  emitted the most CO  until early in the   st century  when China s annual emissions began to dominate             
Cumulative CO  emission by world regionCumulative per person emissions by world region in   time periods
CO  emissions by source since     
Cumulative anthropogenic  i e   human emitted  emissions of CO  from fossil fuel use are a major cause of global warming              and give some indication of which countries have contributed most to human induced climate change  In particular  CO  stays in the atmosphere for at least     years and up to      years              whilst methane disappears within a decade or so              and nitrous oxides last about     years              The graph gives some indication of which regions have contributed most to human induced climate change                                               When these numbers are calculated per capita cumulative emissions based on then current population the situation is shown even more clearly  The ratio in per capita emissions between industrialized countries and developing countries was estimated at more than    to   
Non OECD countries accounted for     of cumulative energy related CO  emissions between      and                                            Over this time period  the US accounted for     of emissions  the EU       Japan      other OECD countries     Russia       China      India      and the rest of the world                                           The European Commission adopted a set of legislative proposals targeting a reduction of the CO  emissions by     by      
Overall  developed countries accounted for       of industrial CO  emissions over this time period  and       of total CO  emissions  Developing countries accounted for industrial CO  emissions of       over this time period  and       of total CO  emissions 
However  what becomes clear when we look at emissions across the world today is that the countries with the highest emissions over history are not always the biggest emitters today  For example  in       the UK accounted for just    of global emissions             
In comparison  humans have emitted more greenhouse gases than the Chicxulub meteorite impact event which caused the extinction of the dinosaurs             
Transport  together with electricity generation  is the major source of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU  Greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector continue to rise  in contrast to power generation and nearly all other sectors  Since       transportation emissions have increased by      The transportation sector accounts for around     of these emissions  The majority of these emissions are caused by passenger vehicles and vans  Road travel is the first major source of greenhouse gas emissions from transportation  followed by aircraft and maritime                          Waterborne transportation is still the least carbon intensive mode of transportation on average  and it is an essential link in sustainable multimodal freight supply chains             
Buildings  like industry  are directly responsible for around one fifth of greenhouse gas emissions  primarily from space heating and hot water consumption  When combined with power consumption within buildings  this figure climbs to more than one third                                    
Within the EU  the agricultural sector presently accounts for roughly     of total greenhouse gas emissions  with methane from livestock accounting for slightly more than half of                 
Estimates of total CO  emissions do include biotic carbon emissions  mainly from deforestation                                   Including biotic emissions brings about the same controversy mentioned earlier regarding carbon sinks and land use change                                      The actual calculation of net emissions is very complex  and is affected by how carbon sinks are allocated between regions and the dynamics of the climate system 

Fossil fuel CO  emissions on log  natural and base     scales
The graphic shows the logarithm of           fossil fuel CO  emissions              natural log on left  actual value of Gigatons per year on right  Although emissions increased during the     year period by about    per year overall  intervals of distinctly different growth rates  broken at             and       can be detected  The regression lines suggest that emissions can rapidly shift from one growth regime to another and then persist for long periods of time  The most recent drop in emissions growth   by almost   percentage points   was at about the time of the     s energy crisis  Percent changes per year were estimated by piecewise linear regression on the log data and are shown on the plot  the data are from The Integrated Carbon Observation system             

Changes since a particular base year edit 
See also  Greenhouse gas inventory
The sharp acceleration in CO  emissions since      to more than a    increase per year  more than        ppm per year  from      per year during the     s is attributable to the lapse of formerly declining trends in carbon intensity of both developing and developed nations  China was responsible for most of global growth in emissions during this period  Localised plummeting emissions associated with the collapse of the Soviet Union have been followed by slow emissions growth in this region due to more efficient energy use  made necessary by the increasing proportion of it that is exported              In comparison  methane has not increased appreciably  and N O by       y   
Using different base years for measuring emissions has an effect on estimates of national contributions to global warming                                                  This can be calculated by dividing a country s highest contribution to global warming starting from a particular base year  by that country s minimum contribution to global warming starting from a particular base year  Choosing between base years of                   and      has a significant effect for most countries

Distribution of global greenhouse gas emissions based on type of greenhouse gas  data from      Carbon dioxide  CO   is the dominant emitted greenhouse gas  while methane  CH   emissions almost have the same short term impact             Nitrous oxide  N O  and fluorinated gases  F gases  play a lesser role in comparison 
Greenhouse gas emissions are measured in CO  equivalents determined by their global warming potential  GWP   which depends on their lifetime in the atmosphere  Estimations largely depend on the ability of oceans and land sinks to absorb these gases  Short lived climate pollutants  SLCPs  including methane  hydrofluorocarbons  HFCs   tropospheric ozone and black carbon persist in the atmosphere for a period ranging from days to    years  whereas carbon dioxide can remain in the atmosphere for millennia              Reducing SLCP emissions can cut the ongoing rate of global warming by almost half and reduce the projected Arctic warming by two thirds             
Greenhouse gas emissions in      were estimated at      GtCO e  while CO  emissions alone made up      Gt including land use change  LUC              
While mitigation measures for decarbonization are essential on the longer term  they could result in weak near term warming because sources of carbon emissions often also co emit air pollution  Hence  pairing measures that target carbon dioxide with measures targeting non CO  pollutants   short lived climate pollutants  which have faster effects on the climate  is essential for climate goals             

Carbon dioxide  CO   edit 
Fossil fuel  use for energy generation  transport  heating and machinery in industrial plants   oil  gas and coal       are the major driver of anthropogenic global warming with annual emissions of      GtCO  in                                       
Cement production  burning of fossil fuels       is estimated at      GtCO 
Land use change  LUC  is the imbalance of deforestation and reforestation  Estimations are very uncertain at     GtCO   Wildfires alone cause annual emissions of about   GtCO                         
Non energy use of fuels  carbon losses in coke ovens  and flaring in crude oil production

Historical and future temperature projections showing importance of mitigating short lived climate pollutants like methane
Methane has a high immediate impact with a   year global warming potential of up to                 Given this  the current     Mt of methane emissions                                 has about the same short term global warming effect as CO  emissions  with a risk to trigger irreversible changes in climate and ecosystems  For methane  a reduction of about     below current emission levels would lead to a stabilization in its atmospheric concentration 

Fossil fuels        emissions due to losses during production and transport  account for most of the methane emissions including coal mining      of methane total   gas distribution and leakages       as well as gas venting in oil production                                                                       
Livestock       with cattle       as the dominant source  followed by buffalo       sheep       and goats                                                  
Human waste and wastewater        When biomass waste in landfills and organic substances in domestic and industrial wastewater is decomposed by bacteria in anaerobic conditions  substantial amounts of methane are generated                                  
Rice cultivation       on flooded rice fields is another agricultural source  where anaerobic decomposition of organic material produces methane                                  
Nitrous oxide  N O  edit 
N O has a high GWP and significant Ozone Depleting Potential  It is estimated that the global warming potential of N O over     years is     times greater than CO               For N O  a reduction of more than     would be required for a stabilization 
Most emissions       of nitrous oxide comes from agriculture  especially meat production  cattle  droppings on pasture   fertilizers  animal manure                                  Further contributions come from combustion of fossil fuels       and biofuels              as well as industrial production of adipic acid and nitric acid 

F gases edit 
Fluorinated gases include hydrofluorocarbons  HFC   perfluorocarbons  PFC   sulfur hexafluoride  SF    and nitrogen trifluoride  NF    They are used by switchgear in the power sector  semiconductor manufacture  aluminum production and a largely unknown source of SF                                    Continued phase down of manufacture and use of HFCs under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol will help reduce HFC emissions and concurrently improve the energy efficiency of appliances that use HFCs like air conditioners  freezers and other refrigeration devices 

Hydrogen edit 
Hydrogen leakages contribute to indirect global warming              
When hydrogen is oxidized in the atmosphere  the result is an increase in concentrations of greenhouse gases in both the troposphere and the stratosphere               Hydrogen can leak from hydrogen production facilities as well as any infrastructure in which hydrogen is transported  stored  or consumed              

Black carbon edit 
Black carbon is formed through the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels  biofuel  and biomass  It is not a greenhouse gas but a climate forcing agent  Black carbon can absorb sunlight and reduce albedo when deposited on snow and ice  Indirect heating can be caused by the interaction with clouds               Black carbon stays in the atmosphere for only several days to weeks               Emissions may be mitigated by upgrading coke ovens  installing particulate filters on diesel based engines  reducing routine flaring  and minimizing open burning of biomass 

Emissions by sector edit

Contributions to climate change broken down by economic sector as of     
     global greenhouse gas emissions by sector               Percentages are calculated from estimated global emissions of all Kyoto Greenhouse Gases  converted to CO  equivalent quantities  GtCO e  
Global greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to different sectors of the economy  This provides a picture of the varying contributions of different types of economic activity to climate change  and helps in understanding the changes required to mitigate climate change 
Greenhouse gas emissions can be divided into those that arise from the combustion of fuels to produce energy  and those generated by other processes  Around two thirds of greenhouse gas emissions arise from the combustion of fuels              
Energy may be produced at the point of consumption  or by a generator for consumption by others  Thus emissions arising from energy production may be categorized according to where they are emitted  or where the resulting energy is consumed  If emissions are attributed at the point of production  then electricity generators contribute about     of global greenhouse gas emissions               If these emissions are attributed to the final consumer then     of total emissions arise from manufacturing and construction      from transportation      from domestic consumers  and    from commercial consumers               Around    of emissions arise from the energy consumed by the energy and fuel industry itself 
The remaining third of emissions arise from processes other than energy production      of total emissions arise from agriculture     from land use change and forestry     from industrial processes  and    from waste

Coal fired power stations are the single largest emitter  with over     of global greenhouse gas emissions in                    Although much less polluting than coal plants  natural gas fired power plants are also major emitters               taking electricity generation as a whole over     in                    Notably  just    of the world s power plants account for almost three quarters of carbon emissions from electricity generation  based on an inventory of more than        fossil fuel power plants across     countries               In the      IPCC report  it is noted that providing modern energy services universally would only increase greenhouse gas emissions by a few percent at most  This slight increase means that the additional energy demand that comes from supporting decent living standards for all would be far lower than current average energy consumption              
In March       the International Energy Agency  IEA  reported that in       global CO  emissions from energy sources increased by       rising by     million tonnes to a record      billion tonnes  primarily due to coal  Drought related decreases in hydropower contributed to a     million tonne rise in emissions  which would have otherwise led to a decrease in the electricity sector s emissions               The implementation of clean energy technologies like solar  wind  nuclear  heat pumps  and electric vehicles since      has significantly tempered emissions growth  which would have been threefold without these technologies

This section is an excerpt from Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture  edit 
The amount of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture is significant  The agriculture  forestry and land use sectors contribute between     and     of global greenhouse gas emissions               Emissions come from direct greenhouse gas emissions  for example from rice production and livestock farming                And from indirect emissions  With regards to direct emissions  nitrous oxide and methane makeup over half of total greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture               Indirect emissions on the other hand come from the conversion of non agricultural land such as forests into agricultural land                            Furthermore  there is also fossil fuel consumption for transport and fertilizer production  For example  the manufacture and use of nitrogen fertilizer contributes around    of all global greenhouse gas emissions               Livestock farming is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions               At the same time  livestock farming is affected by climate change  
Farm animals  digestive systems can be put into two categories  monogastric and ruminant  Ruminant cattle for beef and dairy rank high in greenhouse gas emissions  In comparison  monogastric  or pigs and poultry related foods  are lower  The consumption of the monogastric types may yield less emissions  Monogastric animals have a higher feed conversion efficiency and also do not produce as much methane               Non ruminant livestock  such as poultry  emit far fewer greenhouse gases                

There are many strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture  this is one of the goals of climate smart agriculture   Mitigation measures in the food system can be divided into four categories  These are demand side changes  ecosystem protections  mitigation on farms  and mitigation in supply chains  On the demand side  limiting food waste is an effective way to reduce food emissions  Changes to a diet less reliant on animal products such as plant based diets are also effective                          XXV        This could include milk substitutes and meat alternatives  Several methods are also under investigation to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from livestock farming  These include genetic selection                            introduction of methanotrophic bacteria into the rumen                            vaccines  feeds               diet modification and grazing management

Deforestation is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions  A study shows annual carbon emissions  or carbon loss  from tropical deforestation have doubled during the last two decades and continue to increase              PgC per year in           to            PgC per year in                                     

Land use change edit 
Main article  Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture
 Substantial land use change contributions to emissions have been made by Latin America  Southeast Asia  Africa  and Pacific Islands  Area of rectangles shows total emissions in      for that region              
Land use change  e g   the clearing of forests for agricultural use  can affect the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by altering how much carbon flows out of the atmosphere into carbon sinks               Accounting for land use change can be understood as an attempt to measure  net  emissions  i e   gross emissions from all sources minus the removal of emissions from the atmosphere by carbon sinks                                     
There are substantial uncertainties in the measurement of net carbon emissions               Additionally  there is controversy over how carbon sinks should be allocated between different regions and over time                                   For instance  concentrating on more recent changes in carbon sinks is likely to favour those regions that have deforested earlier  e g   Europe 
In       human caused Indonesian peat fires were estimated to have released between     and     of the average annual global carbon emissions caused by the burning of fossil fuels

Maritime transport accounts for      to    of all greenhouse gas emissions  primarily carbon dioxide                            In       the shipping industry s    of global greenhouse gas emissions made it  the sixth largest greenhouse gas emitter worldwide  ranking between Japan and Germany

In       manufacturing construction materials and maintaining buildings accounted for     of carbon dioxide emissions from energy and process related emissions  Manufacture of glass  cement  and steel accounted for     of energy and process related emissions               Because building construction is a significant investment  more than two thirds of buildings in existence will still exist in       Retrofitting existing buildings to become more efficient will be necessary to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement  it will be insufficient to only apply low emission standards to new construction               Buildings that produce as much energy as they consume are called zero energy buildings  while buildings that produce more than they consume are energy plus  Low energy buildings are designed to be highly efficient with low total energy consumption and carbon emissions       a popular type is the passive house              
The construction industry has seen marked advances in building performance and energy efficiency over recent decades               Green building practices that avoid emissions or capture the carbon already present in the environment  allow for reduced footprint of the construction industry  for example  use of hempcrete  cellulose fiber insulation  and landscaping              
In       the building sector was responsible for    GtCO  eq emissions  More than     of these emissions were carbon  and the remaining    were CH   N O  and halocarbon              
The largest contributor to building sector emissions      of total  is the production of electricity for use in buildings              
Of global building sector GHG emissions      are produced during the manufacturing process of building materials such as steel  cement  a key component of concrete                and glass               The conventional process inherently related to the production of steel and cement results in large amounts of CO  emitted  For example  the production of steel in      was responsible for   to    of the global CO  emissions              
The remaining     of global building sector GHG emissions are produced directly on site during building operations              

Embodied carbon emissions in construction sector edit 
Embodied carbon emissions  or upfront carbon emissions  UCE   are the result of creating and maintaining the materials that form a building               As of        Embodied carbon is responsible     of global greenhouse gas emissions and     of global building sector emissions     Embodied carbon will be responsible for almost half of total new construction emissions between now and                    
GHG emissions which are produced during the mining  processing  manufacturing  transportation and installation of building materials are referred to as the embodied carbon of a material               The embodied carbon of a construction project can be reduced by using low carbon materials for building structures and finishes  reducing demolition  and reusing buildings and construction materials whenever possible

Mining edit 
Flaring and venting of natural gas in oil wells is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions  Its contribution to greenhouse gases has declined by three quarters in absolute terms since a peak in the     s of approximately     million metric tons year  and in      accounted for about     of one percent of all anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions              
The World Bank estimates that     billion cubic meters of natural gas are flared or vented annually       datum   an amount equivalent to the combined annual gas consumption of Germany and France or enough to supply the entire world with gas for    days  This flaring is highly concentrated     countries account for     of emissions  and twenty for                  

Steel and aluminum edit 
Steel and aluminum are key economic sectors where CO  is produced  According to a      study   in       the steel industry along emits about    M tons of CO   which accounts for      of the global anthropogenic GHG emissions  CO  emitted from steel production primarily comes from energy consumption of fossil fuel as well as the use of limestone to purify iron oxides               
More recent estimates suggest that global steel production emitted around       million tons of CO  in       indicating the scale has increased significantly  A      study found that across bulk material sectors steel  aluminum  cement  and paper total emissions reached approximately     billion tons of CO  equivalent              

Plastics edit 
Plastics are produced mainly from fossil fuels  It was estimated that between    and    of global GHG emissions are associated with plastics  life cycles               The EPA estimates              as many as five mass units of carbon dioxide are emitted for each mass unit of polyethylene terephthalate  PET  produced the type of plastic most commonly used for beverage bottles               the transportation produce greenhouse gases also               Plastic waste emits carbon dioxide when it degrades  In      research claimed that some of the most common plastics in the environment release the greenhouse gases methane and ethylene when exposed to sunlight in an amount that can affect the earth climate                           
Due to the lightness of plastic versus glass or metal  plastic may reduce energy consumption  For example  packaging beverages in PET plastic rather than glass or metal is estimated to save     in transportation energy  if the glass or metal package is single use  of course 
In      a new report  Plastic and Climate  was published  According to the report  the production and incineration of plastics will contribute in the equivalent of          million tonnes of carbon dioxide  CO   to the atmosphere in       With the current trend  annual life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of plastics will grow to           billion tonnes by       By       the life cycle emissions of plastics could reach         billion tonnes  as much as    percent of the Earth s remaining carbon budget               The report says that only solutions which involve a reduction in consumption can solve the problem  while others like biodegradable plastic  ocean cleanup  using renewable energy in plastic industry can do little  and in some cases may even worsen it

In       data centers  excluding cryptocurrency mining  and data transmission each used about    of world electricity               The digital sector produces between    and    of global GHG emissions               a large part of which is from chipmaking               However the sector reduces emissions from other sectors which have a larger global share  such as transport of people               and possibly buildings and industry              
Mining for proof of work cryptocurrencies requires enormous amounts of electricity and consequently comes with a large carbon footprint               Proof of work blockchains such as Bitcoin  Ethereum  Litecoin  and Monero were estimated to have added between   million and    million tonnes of carbon dioxide  CO   to the atmosphere in the period from   January      to    June                    By the end of       Bitcoin was estimated to produce      million tonnes of CO   as much as Greece               and consume between    and     terawatt hours annually  Bitcoin is the least energy efficient cryptocurrency  using       kilowatt hours of electricity per transaction

Water supply and sanitation edit 
This section is an excerpt from WASH   Reducing greenhouse gas emissions  edit 
Solutions exist to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of water and sanitation services               These solutions into three categories which partly overlap  Firstly  reducing water and energy consumption through lean and efficient approaches   secondly  embracing circular economy to produce energy and valuable products   and thirdly by  planning to reduce GHG emissions through strategic decisions                                     The mentioned lean and efficient approaches include for example finding ways to reduce water loss from water networks and to reduce infiltration of rainwater or groundwater into sewers                                    Also  incentives can to encourage households and industries to reduce their water consumption and their energy requirements for water heating                                    There is another method to reduce the energy requirements for the treatment of raw water to make drinking water out of it  protecting the quality of the source water better

This section is an excerpt from Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of energy sources  edit 
Greenhouse gas emissions are one of the environmental impacts of electricity generation  Measurement of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions involves calculating the global warming potential  GWP  of energy sources through life cycle assessment  These are usually sources of only electrical energy but sometimes sources of heat are evaluated               The findings are presented in units of global warming potential per unit of electrical energy generated by that source  The scale uses the global warming potential unit  the carbon dioxide equivalent  CO e   and the unit of electrical energy  the kilowatt hour  kWh   The goal of such assessments is to cover the full life of the source  from material and fuel mining through construction to operation and waste management 

In       the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change harmonized the carbon dioxide equivalent  CO e  findings of the major electricity generating sources in use worldwide  This was done by analyzing the findings of hundreds of individual scientific papers assessing each energy source               Coal is by far the worst emitter  followed by natural gas  with solar  wind and nuclear all low carbon  Hydropower  biomass  geothermal and ocean power may generally be low carbon  but poor design or other factors could result in higher emissions from individual power stations 
By socio economic class and age edit 
This pie chart illustrates both total emissions for each income group  and emissions per person within each income group  For example  the     with the highest incomes are responsible for half of carbon emissions  and its members emit an average of more than five times as much per person as members of the lowest half of the income scale              Though total CO  emissions  size of pie charts  differ substantially among high emitting regions  the pattern of higher income classes emitting more than lower income classes is consistent across regions               The world s top    of emitters emit over      times more than the bottom                 
Scaling the effect of wealth to the national level  richer  developed  countries emit more CO  per person than poorer  developing  countries               Emissions are roughly proportional to GDP per person  though the rate of increase diminishes with average GDP pp of about         
Fueled by the consumptive lifestyle of wealthy people  the wealthiest    of the global population has been responsible for     of the absolute increase in greenhouse gas emissions worldwide  It can be seen that there is a strong relationship between income and per capita carbon dioxide emissions              Almost half of the increase in absolute global emissions has been caused by the richest     of the population               In the newest report from the IPCC       it states that the lifestyle consumptions of the poor and middle class in emerging economies produce approximately      times less the amount that the high class in already developed high income countries                            Variations in regional  and national per capita emissions partly reflect different development stages  but they also vary widely at similar income levels  The     of households with the highest per capita emissions contribute a disproportionately large share of global household greenhouse gas emissions              
Studies find that the most affluent citizens of the world are responsible for most environmental impacts  and robust action by them is necessary for prospects of moving towards safer environmental conditions                           
According to a      report by Oxfam and the Stockholm Environment Institute                            the richest    of the global population have caused twice as much carbon emissions as the poorest     over the    years from      to                                              This was  respectively  during that period      of cumulative emissions compared to                  The bottom half of the population is directly responsible for less than     of energy footprints and consume less than the top    in terms of trade corrected energy  The largest disproportionality was identified to be in the domain of transport  where e g  the top     consume     of vehicle fuel and conduct     of vehicle purchases               However  wealthy individuals are also often shareholders and typically have more influence              and  especially in the case of billionaires  may also direct lobbying efforts  direct financial decisions  and or control companies 
Based on a study in    developed countries  researchers found that  seniors in the United States and Australia have the highest per capita footprint  twice the Western average  The trend is mainly due to changes in expenditure patterns of seniors               

Methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions edit

Governments have taken action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change  Countries and regions listed in Annex I of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  UNFCCC   i e   the OECD and former planned economies of the Soviet Union  are required to submit periodic assessments to the UNFCCC of actions they are taking to address climate change                                   Policies implemented by governments include for example national and regional targets to reduce emissions  promoting energy efficiency  and support for an energy transition This section is an excerpt from Climate change mitigation  edit 
Climate change mitigation  or decarbonisation  is action to limit the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that cause climate change  Climate change mitigation actions include conserving energy and replacing fossil fuels with clean energy sources  Secondary mitigation strategies include changes to land use and removing carbon dioxide  CO   from the atmosphere                            Current climate change mitigation policies are insufficient as they would still result in global warming of about           C by                    significantly above the      Paris Agreement s              goal of limiting global warming to below         C                             

Solar energy and wind power can replace fossil fuels at the lowest cost compared to other renewable energy options               The availability of sunshine and wind is variable and can require electrical grid upgrades  such as using long distance electricity transmission to group a range of power sources               Energy storage can also be used to even out power output  and demand management can limit power use when power generation is low  Cleanly generated electricity can usually replace fossil fuels for powering transportation  heating buildings  and running industrial processes               Certain processes are more difficult to decarbonise  such as air travel and cement production  Carbon capture and storage  CCS  can be an option to reduce net emissions in these circumstances  although fossil fuel power plants with CCS technology is currently a high cost climate change mitigation strategy              
Projections for future emissions edit 
Figure        from the International Energy Outlook       IEO      report               Aggregate energy related carbon emissions remain constant to      under the low GDP growth case  otherwise emissions rise significantly 
See also  Carbon budget and Climate change scenarioIn October       the US Energy Information Administration  EIA  released a series of projections out to      based on current ascertainable policy interventions                                         Unlike many integrated systems models in this field  emissions are allowed to float rather than be pinned to net  x     zero in       A      sensitivity analysis varied key parameters  primarily future GDP growth             pa as reference  variously      and       and secondarily technological learning rates  future crude oil prices  and similar exogenous inputs  The model results are far from encouraging  In no case did aggregate energy related carbon emissions ever dip below      levels  see figure        plot   The IEO     exploration provides a benchmark and suggests that far stronger action is needed 
This section is an excerpt from Climate change mitigation   Needed emissions cuts  edit 
The annual  Emissions Gap Report  by UNEP stated in      that it was necessary to almost halve emissions   To get on track for limiting global warming to     C  global annual GHG emissions must be reduced by    per cent compared with emissions projections under policies currently in place in just eight years  and they must continue to decline rapidly after       to avoid exhausting the limited remaining atmospheric carbon budget                           xvi        The report commented that the world should focus on broad based economy wide transformations and not incremental change                          xvi       
In       the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  IPCC  released its Sixth Assessment Report on climate change  It warned that greenhouse gas emissions must peak before      at the latest and decline     by      to have a good chance of limiting global warming to           C            F                             Or in the words of Secretary General of the United Nations Ant nio Guterres   Main emitters must drastically cut emissions starting this year               

A      synthesis by leading climate scientists highlighted ten critical areas in climate science with significant policy implications  These include the near inevitability of temporarily exceeding the     C warming limit  the urgent need for a rapid and managed fossil fuel phase out  challenges in scaling carbon dioxide removal technologies  uncertainties regarding the future contribution of natural carbon sinks  and the interconnected crises of biodiversity loss and climate change  These insights underscore the necessity for immediate and comprehensive mitigation strategies to address the multifaceted challenges of climate change

United States edit 
Though the U S  s per capita and per GDP emissions have declined significantly  the raw numerical decline in emissions is much less substantial              
These paragraphs are an excerpt from Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States  edit 
The United States produced     billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gas  GHG  emissions in                    the second largest in the world after greenhouse gas emissions by China and among the countries with the highest greenhouse gas emissions per person  In      China is estimated to have emitted     of world GHG  followed by the United States with      then India with                    In total the United States has emitted a quarter of world GHG  more than any other country                            Annual emissions are over    tons per person and  amongst the top eight emitters  is the highest country by greenhouse gas emissions per person              
China edit 
These paragraphs are an excerpt from Greenhouse gas emissions by China  edit 
The total greenhouse gas emissions of the People s Republic of China are the world s highest  accounting for     of the world s total according to the International Energy Agency  The country s per capita greenhouse gas emissions are the   th highest of any country  as of      
India edit 
These paragraphs are an excerpt from Climate change in India   Greenhouse gas emissions  edit 
Greenhouse gas emissions by India are the third largest in the world and the main source is coal               India emitted     Gt of CO eq in           including LULUCF                                 were CO       methane and    nitrous oxide               India emits about   gigatonnes  Gt  CO eq of greenhouse gases each year  about two tons per person               which is half the world average               The country emits    of global emissions              

In India in       emissions increased by     million tonnes due to strong GDP growth and reduced hydroelectricity production following a weak monsoon  with its per capita emissions remaining significantly below the global average              
Society and culture edit 
Impacts of the COVID    pandemic edit 
Main article  Impact of the COVID    pandemic on the environment        Climate change
In       carbon dioxide emissions fell by      or     billion tonnes globally               In April       NOx emissions fell by up to                   In China  lockdowns and other measures resulted in a     decrease in coal consumption  and a     reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions               Greenhouse gas emissions rebounded later in the pandemic as many countries began lifting restrictions  with the direct impact of pandemic policies having a negligible long term impact on climate change
