In video games  an open world is a virtual world in which the player can approach objectives freely  as opposed to a world with more linear and structured gameplay                        Notable games in this category include The Legend of Zelda         Grand Theft Auto V         Red Dead Redemption          and Minecraft                              
Games with open or free roaming worlds typically lack level structures like walls and locked doors  or the invisible walls in more open areas that prevent the player from venturing beyond them  only at the bounds of an open world game will players be limited by geographic features like vast oceans or impassable mountains  Players typically do not encounter loading screens common in linear level designs when moving about the game world  with the open world game using strategic storage and memory techniques to load the game world dynamically and seamlessly  Open world games still enforce many restrictions in the game environment  either because of absolute technical limitations or in game limitations imposed by a game s linearity            
While the openness of the game world is an important facet to games featuring open worlds  the main draw of open world games is about providing the player with autonomy not so much the freedom to do anything they want in the game  which is nearly impossible with current computing technology   but the ability to choose how to approach the game and its challenges in the order and manner as the player desires while still constrained by gameplay rules             Examples of high level of autonomy in computer games can be found in massively multiplayer online role playing games  MMORPG  or in single player games adhering to the open world concept such as the Fallout series  The main appeal of open world gameplay is that it provides a simulated reality and allows players to develop their character and its behavior in the direction and pace of their own choosing  In these cases  there is often no concrete goal or end to the game  although there may be the main storyline  such as with games like The Elder Scrolls V  Skyrim 


Gameplay and design edit 
An open world is a level or game designed as nonlinear  open areas with many ways to reach an objective             Some games are designed with both traditional and open world levels             An open world facilitates greater exploration than a series of smaller levels             or a level with more linear challenges             Reviewers have judged the quality of an open world based on whether there are interesting ways for the player to interact with the broader level when they ignore their main objective             Some games actually use real settings to model an open world  such as New York City             
A major design challenge is to balance the freedom of an open world with the structure of a dramatic storyline              Since players may perform actions that the game designer did not expect              the game s writers must find creative ways to impose a storyline on the player without interfering with their freedom              As such  games with open worlds will sometimes break the game s story into a series of missions  or have a much simpler storyline altogether              Other games instead offer side missions to the player that do not disrupt the main storyline  Most open world games make the character a blank slate that players can project their own thoughts onto  although several games such as Landstalker  The Treasures of King Nole offer more character development and dialogue             Writing in       David Braben described the narrative structure of current video games as  little different to the stories of those Harold Lloyd films of the     s   and considered genuinely open ended stories to be the  Holy Grail  for the fifth generation of gaming              Gameplay designer Manveer Heir  who worked on Mass Effect   and Mass Effect Andromeda for Electronic Arts  said that there are difficulties in the design of an open world game since it is difficult to predict how players will approach solving gameplay challenges offered by a design  in contrast to a linear progression  and needs to be a factor in the game s development from its onset  Heir opined that some of the critical failings of Andromeda were due to the open world being added late in development             
Some open world games  to guide the player towards major story events  do not provide the world s entire map at the start of the game  but require the player to complete a task to obtain part of that map  often identifying missions and points of interest when they view the map  This has been derogatorily referred to as  Ubisoft towers   as this mechanic was promoted in Ubisoft s Assassin s Creed series  the player climbing a large tower as to observe the landscape around it and identify waypoints nearby  and reused in other Ubisoft games  including Far Cry  Might  amp  Magic X  Legacy and Watch Dogs  Other games that use this approach include Middle earth  Shadow of Mordor  The Legend of Zelda  Breath of the Wild  and Marvel s Spider Man                                                  Rockstar games like GTA IV and the Red Dead Redemption series lock out sections of the map as  barricaded by law enforcement  until a specific point in the story has been reached 
Games with open worlds typically give players infinite lives or continues  although some force the player to start from the beginning should they die too many times             There is also a risk that players may get lost as they explore an open world  thus designers sometimes try to break the open world into manageable sections              The scope of open world games requires the developer to fully detail every possible section of the world the player may be able to access  unless methods like procedural generation are used  The design process  due to its scale  may leave numerous game world glitches  bugs  incomplete sections  or other irregularities that players may find and potentially take advantage of              The term  open world jank  has been used to apply to games where the incorporation of the open world gameplay elements may be poor  incomplete  or unnecessary to the game itself such that these glitches and bugs become more apparent  though are generally not game breaking  such as the case for No Man s Sky near its launch             

Distinctions between open world and sandbox games edit 
The mechanics of open world games are often overlapped with ideas of sandbox games  but these are considered different concepts  Whereas open world refers to the lack of limits for the player s exploration of the game s world  sandbox games are based on the ability of giving the player tools for creative freedom within the game to approach objectives  if such objectives are present  For example  Microsoft Flight Simulator is an open world game as one can fly anywhere within the mapped world  but is not considered a sandbox game as there are few creative aspects brought into the game             

Emergent gameplay edit 
The combination of open world and sandbox mechanics can lead towards emergent gameplay  complex reactions that emerge  either expectedly or unexpectedly  from the interaction of relatively simple game mechanics              According to Peter Molyneux  emergent gameplay appears wherever a game has a good simulation system that allows players to play in the world and have it respond realistically to their actions  It is what made SimCity and The Sims compelling to players  Similarly  being able to freely interact with the city s inhabitants in Grand Theft Auto added an extra dimension to the series             
In recent years game designers have attempted to encourage emergent play by providing players with tools to expand games through their own actions  Examples include in game web browsers in EVE Online and The Matrix Online  XML integration tools and programming languages in Second Life  shifting exchange rates in Entropia Universe  and the complex object and grammar system used to solve puzzles in Scribblenauts  Other examples of emergence include interactions between physics and artificial intelligence  One challenge that remains to be solved  however  is how to tell a compelling story using only emergent technology             
In an op ed piece for BBC News  David Braben  co creator of Elite  called truly open ended game design  The Holy Grail  of modern video gaming  citing games like Elite and the Grand Theft Auto series as early steps in that direction              Peter Molyneux has also stated that he believes emergence  or emergent gameplay  is where video game development is headed in the future  He has attempted to implement emergent gameplay to a great extent in some of his games  particularly Black  amp  White and Fable             

Procedural generation of open worlds edit 
Procedural generation refers to content generated algorithmically rather than manually  and is often used to generate game levels and other content  While procedural generation does not guarantee that a game or sequence of levels is nonlinear  it is an important factor in reducing game development time and opens up avenues making it possible to generate larger and more or less unique seamless game worlds on the fly and using fewer resources  This kind of procedural generation is known as worldbuilding  in which general rules are used to construct a believable world 
Most  X and roguelike games make use of procedural generation to some extent to generate game levels  SpeedTree is an example of a developer oriented tool used in the development of The Elder Scrolls IV  Oblivion and aimed at speeding up the level design process  Procedural generation also made it possible for the developers of Elite  David Braben and Ian Bell  to fit the entire game including thousands of planets  dozens of trade commodities  multiple ship types and a plausible economic system into less than    kilobytes of memory              More recently  No Man s Sky procedurally generated over    quintillion planets including flora  fauna  and other features that can be researched and explored             

History edit 
  th century edit 
There is no consensus on what the earliest open world game is  due to differing definitions of how large or open a world needs to be              Inverse provides some early examples games that established elements of the open world  Jet Rocket  a      Sega electro mechanical arcade game that  while not a video game  predated the flight simulator genre to give the player free roaming capabilities  and dnd  a      text based adventure game for the PLATO system that offered non linear gameplay              Ars Technica traces the concept back to the free roaming exploration of      text adventure game Colossal Cave Adventure              which inspired the free roaming exploration of Adventure                                 but notes that it was not until      that what  we now know as open world gaming  took on a  definite shape  with      space simulator Elite              considered a pioneer of the open world                                                  Gamasutra argues that its open ended sandbox style is rooted in flight simulators  such as SubLOGIC s Flight Simulator            noting most flight sims  offer a  free flight  mode that allows players to simply pilot the aircraft and explore the virtual world               Others trace the concept back to      CRPG Ultima                                      which had a free roaming overworld map inspired by tabletop RPG Dungeons  amp  Dragons              The overworld maps of the first five Ultima games  released up to       lacked a single  unified scale  with towns and other places represented as icons              this style was adopted by the first three Dragon Quest games  released from      to      in Japan                        
Early examples of open world gameplay in adventure games include The Portopia Serial Murder Case                                and The Lords of Midnight                     with open world elements also found in The Hobbit                    and Valhalla                     The strategy video game  The Seven Cities of Gold         is also cited as an early open world game                                      influencing Sid Meier s Pirates                      Eurogamer also cites British computer games such as Ant Attack        and Sabre Wulf        as early examples             
According to Game Informer     s Kyle Hilliard  Hydlide        and The Legend of Zelda        were among the first open world games  along with Ultima              IGN traces the roots of open world game design to The Legend of Zelda  which it argues is  the first really good game based on exploration   while noting that it was anticipated by Hydlide  which it argues is  the first RPG that rewarded exploration               According to GameSpot  never  had a game so open ended  nonlinear  and liberating been released for the mainstream market  before The Legend of Zelda              According to The Escapist  The Legend of Zelda was an early example of open world  nonlinear gameplay  with an expansive and cohesive world  inspiring many games to adopt a similar open world design             
Mercenary        has been cited as the first open world  D action adventure game                          There were also other open world games in the     s  such as Back to Skool                     Turbo Esprit                                and Alternate Reality  The City                     Wasteland  released in       is also considered an open world game              The early     s saw open world games such as The Terminator                     The Adventures of Robin Hood                     and Hunter         which IGN describes as the first sandbox game to feature full  D  third person graphics              and Ars Technica argues  has one of the strongest claims to the title of GTA forebear               Sierra On Line s      adventure game King s Quest VI has an open world  almost half of the quests are optional  many have multiple solutions  and players can solve most in any order              Atari Jaguar launch title  Cybermorph         was notable for its open  D polygonal world and non linear gameplay  Quarantine        is an example of an open world driving game from this period              while Iron Soldier        is an open world mech game              The director of      s Blade Runner argues that that game was the first open world three dimensional action adventure game             



I think The Elder Scrolls II  Daggerfall is one of those games that people can  project  themselves on  It does so many things and allows  for  so many play styles that people can easily imagine what type of person they d like to be in game

IGN considers Nintendo s Super Mario           revolutionary for its  D open ended free roaming worlds  which had rarely been seen in  D games before  along with its analog stick controls and camera control              Other  D examples include Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon                                 Ocarina of Time                    the DMA Design  Rockstar North  game Body Harvest         the Angel Studios  Rockstar San Diego  games Midtown Madness        and Midnight Club  Street Racing         the Reflections Interactive  Ubisoft Reflections  game Driver                     and the Rareware games Banjo Kazooie         Donkey Kong            and Banjo Tooie             citation needed     
 UP considers Sega s adventure Shenmue        the originator of the  open city  subgenre              touted as a  FREE    Full Reactive Eyes Entertainment   game giving players the freedom to explore an expansive sandbox city with its own day night cycles  changing weather  and fully voiced non player characters going about their daily routines  The game s large interactive environments  wealth of options  level of detail and the scope of its urban sandbox exploration has been compared to later sandbox games like Grand Theft Auto III and its sequels  Sega s own Yakuza series  Fallout    and Deadly Premonition

Grand Theft Auto has had over     million sales              Creative director Gary Penn  who previously worked on Frontier  Elite II  cited Elite as a key influence  calling it  basically Elite in a city   and mentioned other team members being influenced by Syndicate and Mercenary              Grand Theft Auto III combined elements from previous games  and fused them together into a new immersive  D experience that helped define open world games for a new generation  Executive producer Sam Houser described it as  Zelda meets Goodfellas               while producer Dan Houser also cited The Legend of Zelda  Ocarina of Time and Super Mario    as influences              Radio stations had been implemented earlier in games such as Maxis  SimCopter         the ability to beat or kill non player characters date back to games such as The Portopia Serial Murder Case                     and Valhalla                    and the way in which players run over pedestrians and get chased by police has been compared to Pac Man                     After the release of Grand Theft Auto III  many games which employed a  D open world  such as Ubisoft s Watch Dogs and Deep Silver s Saints Row series  were labeled  often disparagingly  as Grand Theft Auto clones  much as how many early first person shooters were called  Doom clones              
Other examples include World of Warcraft  The Elder Scrolls  Horizon  video game series  and Fallout series of games  which feature a large and diverse world  offering tasks and possibilities to play 
In the Assassin s Creed series  which began in       players explore historic open world settings  These include the Holy Land during the Third Crusade in Assassin s Creed  Renaissance Italy in Assassin s Creed II and Brotherhood  Constantinople during the rise of the Ottoman Empire in Revelations  New England during the American Revolution in Assassin s Creed III  the Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy in Black Flag  the North Atlantic during the French and Indian War in Rogue  Paris during the French Revolution in Unity  London at the onset of the Second Industrial Revolution in Syndicate  Ptolemaic Egypt in Origins  Classical Greece during the Peloponnesian War in Odyssey  and Medieval England and Norway during the Viking Age in Valhalla  The series intertwines factual history with a fictional storyline  In the fictional storyline  the Templars and the Assassins  two secret organisations inspired by their real life counterparts  have been mortal enemies for all of known history  Their conflict stems from the Templars  desire to have peace through control  which directly contrasts the Assassins  wish for peace with free will  Their fighting influences much of history  as the sides often back real historical forces  For example  during the American Revolution depicted in Assassin s Creed III  the Templars initially support the British  while the Assassins side with the American colonists 
S T A L K E R   Shadow of Chernobyl was developed by GSC Game World in       followed by two other games  a prequel and a sequel  The free world style of the zone was divided into huge maps  like sectors  and the player can go from one sector to another  depending on required quests or just by choice 
In       Dan Ryckert of Game Informer wrote that open world crime games were  a major force  in the gaming industry for the preceding decade             
Another popular sandbox game is Minecraft  which has since become the best selling video game of all time  selling over     million copies worldwide on multiple platforms by April                   Minecraft     s procedurally generated overworlds cover a virtual     billion square kilometers 
The Outerra Engine is a world rendering engine in development since      that is capable of seamlessly rendering whole planets from space down to ground level  Anteworld is a world building game and free tech demo of the Outerra Engine that builds upon real world data to render planet Earth realistically on a true to life scale             
No Man s Sky  released in       is an open world game set in a virtually infinite universe  According to the developers  through procedural generation  the game is able to produce more than    quintillion          or                             planets to explore              Several critics found that the nature of the game can become repetitive and monotonous  with the survival gameplay elements being lackluster and tedious  Jake Swearingen in New York said that the players can procedurally generate      quintillion unique planets  but they can t procedurally generate      quintillion unique things to do              Updates have aimed to address these criticisms 
In       the open world design of The Legend of Zelda  Breath of the Wild was described by critics as being revolutionary                                     and by developers as a paradigm shift for open world design              In contrast to the more structured approach of most open world games  Breath of the Wild features a large and fully interactive world that is generally unstructured and rewards the exploration and manipulation of its world              Inspired by the original      Legend of Zelda  the open world of Breath of the Wild integrates multiplicative gameplay  where  objects react to the player s actions and the objects themselves also influence each other               Along with a physics engine  the game s open world also integrates a chemistry engine   which governs the physical properties of certain objects and how they relate to each other   rewarding experimentation              Nintendo has described the game s approach to open world design as  open air
