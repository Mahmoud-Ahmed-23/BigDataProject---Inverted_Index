Google Photos is a photo sharing and storage service developed by Google  It was announced in May      and spun off from Google   the company s former social network 
Google Photos shares the    gigabytes of free storage space with other Google services  such as Google Drive and Gmail  Users can upload their photos and videos in either quality setting  original or compressed  photos and videos up to         megapixels and     p      resolution  respectively       a      that will count towards the free storage tier  compressed items uploaded before June          along with items uploaded via Pixel phones released before that date  are unlimited                         Users can expand their storage through paid Google One subscriptions 
The service automatically analyzes photos  identifying various visual features and subjects  Users can search for anything in photos  with the service returning results from three major categories  People  Places  and Things  The computer vision of Google Photos recognizes faces  not only those of humans  but pets as well   grouping similar ones together  this feature is only available in certain countries due to privacy laws   geographic landmarks  such as the Eiffel Tower   and subject matter  including birthdays  buildings  animals  food  and more 
Different forms of machine learning in the Photos service allow recognition of photo contents  automatically generate albums  animate similar photos into quick videos  surface memories at significant times  and improve the quality of photos and videos  In May       Google announced several updates to Google Photos  including reminders for and suggested sharing of photos  shared photo libraries between two users  and physical albums  Photos automatically suggested collections based on face  location  trip  or other distinction 
Google Photos received critical acclaim after its decoupling from Google  in       Reviewers praised the updated Photos service for its recognition technology  search  apps  and loading times  Nevertheless  privacy concerns were raised  including Google s motivation for building the service  as well as its relationship to governments and possible laws requiring Google to hand over a user s entire photo history  Google Photos has seen strong user adoption  It reached     million users after five months           million after one year      million after two years  and passed the   billion user mark in       four years after its initial launch             Google reports as of       approximately    billion photos and videos are uploaded to the service every week  and more than   trillion photos are stored in the service total

History edit 
Google Photos is the standalone successor to the photo features previously embedded in Google   the company s social network              Google launched the social network to compete with Facebook  but the service never became as popular as Facebook for social networking and photo sharing   Google  offered photo storage and organizational tools that surpassed Facebook s in power  though Google  lacked the user base to use it              By leaving the social network affiliation  the Photos service changed its association from a sharing platform to a private library platform             
In December       Google added shared albums to Google Photos  Users pool photos and videos into an album  and then share the album with other Google Photos users  The recipient  can join to add their own photos and videos  and also get notifications when new pics are added   Users can also save photos and videos from shared albums to add them to their own  private collection                                      Unlike the native Photos service within iOS  Google Photos permits full resolution sharing across Android and iOS platforms and between the two 
On February           Google announced that the Picasa desktop application would be discontinued on March           followed by the closure of the Picasa Web Albums service on May          Google stated that the primary reason for retiring Picasa was that it wanted to focus its efforts  entirely on a single photo service   the cross platform  web based Google Photos             
In June       Google updated Photos to include automatically generated albums  After an event or trip  Photos will group some of the photos together and suggest creating an album with them  alongside maps to show geographic travel and location pins for exact places  Users can also add text captions to describe photos                          In October  Google announced multiple significant updates  Google Photos now surfaces old memories with people identified in users  recent photos  it occasionally highlights a subset of photos when a user has recently taken a lot of images of a specific subject  it now makes animations from videos as well as photos  photo animations have been present since the start   displaying specific photos intermixed with short excerpts from longer videos in videos  and it now attempts to detect sideways and upside down photos and prompts the user to accept or reject a different orientation  For all of these features  Google touts machine learning does the work  with no user interaction required             
In November  Google released a separate app   PhotoScan   for users to scan printed photos into the service  The app  released for iOS and Android  uses a scanning process in which users must center their camera over four dots that overlay the printed image  so that the software can combine the photographs for a high resolution digital image with the fewest possible defects                          Later that month  Google added a  Deep blue  slider feature that lets users change the color and saturation of skies  without degrading image quality or inadvertently changing colors of other objects or elements in photos             
In February       Google updated the  Albums  tab on the Android app to include three separate sections  one for the phone s camera roll  with different views for sorting options  such as people or location   another for photos taken inside other apps  and a third for the actual photo albums                          In March  Google added an automatic white balance feature to the service  The Android app and website were the first to receive the feature  with a later rollout to the iOS app                          Later in March  updates to the service enabled uploading of photos in a  lightweight preview  quality for immediate viewing on slow cellular networks before a higher quality upload later while on faster Wi Fi  The feature also extends to sharing photos  in which a low resolution image will be sent before being updated with a higher quality version                          In April  Google added video stabilization  The feature creates a duplicate video to avoid overwriting the original clip                         
In May       Google announced several updates to Google Photos   Suggested Sharing  reminds users to share captured photos after the fact  and also groups photos based on faces and suggests recipients based on facial recognition   Shared Libraries  lets two users share a central repository for all photos or specific categories of images   Photo Books  are physical collections of photos  offered either as softcover or hardcover albums  with Photos automatically suggesting collections based on face  location  trip  or other distinction                                      Towards the end of the month  Google introduced an  Archive  feature that lets users hide photos from the main timeline view without deleting them  Archived content still appears in relevant albums and in search                          In June  the new sharing features announced in May began rolling out to users                         
In December       Google doubled the number of photos and videos users can store in a private Google Photos Live Album  The number increased from        to        photos  which is equivalent to the capacity for shared albums             
In September       Google Photos introduced a new social media like feature called  Memories  similar to the Stories feature in Instagram and Facebook which highlights past photos to give their users a nostalgic feeling             
On June           Google Photos introduced a major redesign to the mobile and web apps  accompanied by a new  simplified logo             
In March       The New York Times reported that Google Photos was being used in a facial recognition program by Unit       a surveillance unit of the Israeli Defense Forces  to surveil Palestinians in Gaza amid the Gaza war  Intelligence officers told the Times that the unit uploads databases of known faces to the service and uses its search functions to identify individuals  A Google spokesman commented that the service is free and  does not provide identities for unknown people in photographs              

Features edit 
The service has apps for the Android and iOS operating systems  and a website             Users back up their photos to the cloud service  which becomes accessible for all of their devices             
The Photos service analyzes and organizes images into groups and can identify features such as beaches  skylines  or  snowstorm in Toronto              From the application s search window  users are shown potential searches for groups of photos in three major categories  People  Places  and Things              The service analyzes photos for similar faces and groups them together in the People category              It can also track faces as they age             The Places category uses geotagging data but can also determine locations in older pictures by analyzing for major landmarks  e g   photos containing the Eiffel Tower               The Things category processes photos for their subject matter  birthdays  buildings  cats  concerts  food  graduations  posters  screenshots  etc  Users can manually remove categorization errors              Google Lens is also integrated into the service             
Recipients of shared images can view web galleries without needing to download the app             Users can swipe their fingers across the screen to adjust the service s photo editing settings  as opposed to using sliders             Images can be easily shared with social networks  Google   Facebook  Twitter  and other services  The application generates web links that both Google Photos users and non users can access             
A new feature showing a heat map of photo locations was added in                  

Outstanding issues edit 
There are issues about data sharing and exporting  such as not being able to download pictures                         and videos                         in their original quality or with all the original data  notably GPS location info              Even downloading via the Google Takeout feature results in some of the original information missing  This could potentially lead to vendor lock in if the user wants to keep using features requiring those missing pieces of data 

Storage edit 
Google Photos has three storage settings   Storage saver   formerly  High quality     Original quality  and  Express quality   unavailable in certain locations   Storage saver includes photo and video storage for photos up to         megapixels and videos up to     p      resolution  the maximum resolutions for average smartphone users in                    Original quality preserves the original resolution and quality of the photos and videos              Express quality includes photo and video storage for photos up to   megapixels and videos up to    p resolution 
For the first three generations of the Google Pixel phones  Google Photos offers unlimited storage at  Original quality  for free                          The original Pixel had no limits to this offer  while the Pixel   and   only offered unlimited storage at  Original quality  for photos and videos taken before January           and January           respectively  with all photos and videos taken after those dates being uploaded at  Storage saver  instead  The Pixel  a and onwards do not offer unlimited storage at  Original quality               with the Pixel    Pixel  a  Pixel  a   G   and Pixel   offering a   month trial for the          GB Google One plan to new members instead                         
In November       Google Photos announced that it would be ending its offering of free unlimited storage for photos uploaded in  High quality  or  Express quality  starting on June          due to rising demand for storage              On June          Google Photos changed the name of  High quality  to  Storage saver               The move was part of an effort to reduce Google s reliance on ad based revenue and increase subscriptions              Existing photos will remain unaffected  and new photos will count towards the user s storage quota shared across Google Drive  Gmail  and Google Photos             Owners of the Google Pixel smartphones up until the Pixel   will remain exempt from this change             

Growth edit 
In October       five months after the launch of the service  Google announced that Google Photos had     million users  who had uploaded           petabytes of photos and videos                                     
In May       one year after the release of Google Photos  Google announced the service had over     million monthly active users  Other statistics it revealed was at least           petabytes of photos videos had been uploaded    trillion labels had been applied     billion of those being selfies   and     billion animations  collages and effects had been created based on user content             
In May       Google announced that Google Photos has over          million users              who upload over          billion photos every day             
In November       Google announced that more than   trillion photos are stored in Google Photos  and every week    billion new photos and videos are uploaded                         

Reception edit 
At the May      release of Google Photos  reviewers wrote that the service was among the best of its kind                          Walt Mossberg of Recode declared the service the best in cloud photo storage  against its competition from Amazon  Amazon Drive   Apple  iCloud   Dropbox  and Microsoft  OneDrive               Jacob Kastrenakes of The Verge wrote that the release made Google a major competitor in the photo storage market             and that its pricing structure obsoleted the idea of paying for photo storage             Sarah Mitroff and Lynn La of CNET wrote that the service s phone and tablet apps were particularly good  and that Google Photos had a more streamlined design than Yahoo s Flickr and more organizing features than Apple s iCloud photo service             
Kastrenakes described the service s May      release as evidence that Google was spinning out the  best features  of its Google  social network  He stated that the Photos service was  always excellent   and liked that users would be able to use the service  without signing up for a new social network              Mossberg described the release as  liberation day  for the photos features that were  effectively hidden  in the  widely ignored social network               The service s strategy  as described by Josh Lowensohn of The Verge  was to put all data on Google s servers so that it can be accessed universally            
Mossberg liked the service s search function  writing that a search for  Massachusetts   instantly brought up loads of photos of subjects               Lowensohn noted the service s speed and intelligence  especially in its ability to sort unorganized photos  as well as its photo loading times  search speeds  and simple photo editing tools             Kastrenakes compared the service s new image analysis to technology unveiled by Flickr earlier in the same month             Mossberg thought the face grouping feature was  remarkably accurate   but was most impressed by the subject based grouping  He was surprised that a search for  boats  found both Cape Cod fishing boats and Venetian gondolas  but also noted errors such as a professional photograph registering as a screenshot             
PC Magazine     s John C  Dvorak was concerned about the service s privacy  He was particularly concerned about Google s motivation for building the service  the company s relationships with existing governments  and potential laws that would require Google to provide a user s entire history of photos upon request  Dvorak compared such a scenario to inviting others to  scrounge through your underwear drawer   He criticized the service s sync functions  and preferred folders of images over an unsorted  flat database   Dvorak also highlighted the service s poor choice of photos to animate and lack of longevity guarantees  considering the company s abrupt cancellation of Google Reader  He ultimately suggested that users instead use a portable hard drive  which he considered safer and cheap
