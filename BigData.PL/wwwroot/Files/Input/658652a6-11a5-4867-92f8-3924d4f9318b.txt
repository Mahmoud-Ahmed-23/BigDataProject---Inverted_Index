History edit 
  th century edit 
Paul Reuter  the founder of Reuters  photographed by Nadar  c             
Paul Julius Reuter worked at a book publishing firm in Berlin and was involved in distributing radical pamphlets at the beginning of the Revolutions of       These publications brought much attention to Reuter  who in      developed a prototype news service in Aachen using homing pigeons and electric telegraphy from      on  in order to transmit messages between Brussels and Aachen              in what today is Aachen s Reuters House 
Reuter moved to London in      and established a news wire agency at the London Royal Exchange  Headquartered in London  Reuter s company initially covered commercial news  serving banks  brokerage houses  and business firms              The first newspaper client to subscribe was the London Morning Advertiser in       and more began to subscribe soon after                          According to the Encyclop dia Britannica   the value of Reuters to newspapers lay not only in the financial news it provided but in its ability to be the first to report on stories of international importance               It was the first to report Abraham Lincoln s assassination in Europe  for instance  in                              
In       Reuter incorporated his private business  under the name Reuter s Telegram Company Limited  Reuter was appointed managing director of the company             
In      the press agencies French Havas  founded in        British Reuter s  founded in       and German Wolff  founded in       signed an agreement  known as the Ring Combination  that set  reserved territories  for the three agencies  Each agency made its own separate contracts with national agencies or other subscribers within its territory  In practice  Reuters  who came up with the idea  tended to dominate the Ring Combination  Its influence was greatest because its reserved territories were larger or of greater news importance than most others  It also had more staff and stringers throughout the world and thus contributed more original news to the pool  British control of cable lines made London itself an unrivalled centre for world news  further enhanced by Britain s wide ranging commercial  financial and imperial activities             
In       Reuter s expanded into the Far East  followed by South America in       Both expansions were made possible by advances in overland telegraphs and undersea cables              In       Reuter retired as managing director  and was succeeded by his eldest son  Herbert de Reuter              In       Reuter s began transmitting messages electrically to London newspapers

In       Reuters scooped news of the erection of the Berlin Wall              Reuters was one of the first news agencies to transmit financial data over oceans via computers in the     s              In       Reuters  began making computer terminal displays of foreign exchange rates available to clients               In       Reuters began supporting electronic transactions on its computer network and afterwards developed a number of electronic brokerage and trading services              Reuters was floated as a public company in                   when Reuters Trust was listed on stock exchanges             including the London Stock Exchange  LSE  and NASDAQ              Reuters later published the first story of the Berlin Wall being breached in

Controversies edit 
This article s  criticism  or  controversy  section may compromise the article s neutrality  Please help rewrite or integrate negative information to other sections through discussion on the talk page    March      
Accusation of collaboration with the CIA edit 
In       Rolling Stone and The New York Times said that according to information from CIA officials  Reuters cooperated with the CIA                                      In response to that  Reuters  then managing director  Gerald Long  had asked for evidence of the charges  but none was provided  according to Reuters  then managing editor for North America              Desmond Maberly                         

Policy of objective language edit 
Reuters building entrance in New York City
Reuters has a policy of taking a  value neutral approach   which extends to not using the word terrorist in its stories  The practice attracted criticism following the September    attacks              Reuters  editorial policy states   Reuters may refer without attribution to terrorism and counterterrorism in general  but do not refer to specific events as terrorism  Nor does Reuters use the word terrorist without attribution to qualify specific individuals  groups or events               By contrast  the Associated Press uses the term terrorist in reference to non governmental organizations that carry out attacks on civilian populations              In       Reuters asked CanWest Global Communications  a Canadian newspaper chain  to remove Reuters  bylines  as the chain had edited Reuters articles to insert the word terrorist  A spokesman for Reuters stated   My goal is to protect my reporters and protect our editorial integrity              

Climate change reporting edit 
In July       David Fogarty  former Reuters climate change correspondent in Asia  resigned after a career of almost    years with the company and wrote that  progressively  getting any climate change themed story published got harder  after comments from then deputy editor in chief Paul Ingrassia that he was a  climate change sceptic   In his comments  Fogarty stated                                     

By mid October  I was informed that climate change just wasn t a big story for the present  but that it would be if there was a significant shift in global policy  such as the US introducing an emissions cap and trade system  Very soon after that conversation I was told my climate change role was abolished 
Ingrassia  formerly Reuters  managing editor  previously worked for The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones for    years                          Reuters responded to Fogarty s piece by stating   Reuters has a number of staff dedicated to covering this story  including a team of specialist reporters at Point Carbon and a columnist  There has been no change in our editorial policy              
Subsequently  climate blogger Joe Romm cited a Reuters article on climate as having a  false balance  and quoted Stefan Rahmstorf  co chair of Earth System Analysis at the Potsdam Institute that   s imply  a lot of unrelated climate sceptics nonsense has been added to this Reuters piece  In the words of the late Steve Schneider  this is like adding some nonsense from the Flat Earth Society to a report about the latest generation of telecommunication satellites  It is absurd   Romm opined   We can t know for certain who insisted on cramming this absurd and non germane  climate sceptics nonsense  into the piece  but we have a strong clue  If it had been part of the reporter s original reporting  you would have expected direct quotes from actual sceptics  because that is journalism      The fact that the blather was all inserted without attribution suggests it was added at the insistence of an editor              

Photograph controversies edit 
According to Ynetnews  Reuters was accused of bias against Israel in its coverage of the      Israel Lebanon conflict after the wire service used two doctored photos by a Lebanese freelance photographer  Adnan Hajj              In August       Reuters announced it had severed all ties with Hajj and said his photographs would be removed from its database                         
In       Reuters was criticised again by Haaretz for  anti Israeli  bias when it cropped the edges of photos  removing commandos  knives held by activists and a naval commando s blood from photographs taken aboard the Mavi Marmara during the Gaza flotilla raid  a raid that left nine Turkish activists dead  It has been alleged that in two separate photographs  knives held by the activists were cropped out of the versions of the pictures published by Reuters              Reuters said it is standard operating procedure to crop photos at the margins  and replaced the cropped images with the original ones after it was brought to the agency s attention             

Indian man falsely accused of cybercrime edit 
On   June       three Reuters journalists  Jack Stubbs  Raphael Satter and Christopher Bing  incorrectly used the image of an Indian herbal medicine entrepreneur in an exclusive story titled  Obscure Indian cyber firm spied on politicians  investors worldwide               Indian local media picked up the report  and the man whose image was wrongly used was invited and interrogated for nine hours by Indian police  Reuters admitted to the error  but Raphael Satter claimed that it had mistaken the man for the suspected hacker Sumit Gupta because both men share the same business address  A check by local media  however  showed that both men were in different buildings and not as claimed by Raphael Satter                          As the report of the inaccurate reporting trickled out to the public  Reuters  senior director of communication Heather Carpenter contacted media outlets to ask them to take down their posts             

Accusations of pro Fernando Henrique Cardoso bias edit 
In March       the Brazilian affiliate of Reuters released an excerpt from an interview with Brazilian ex president Fernando Henrique Cardoso about Operation Car Wash  Portuguese  Opera  o Lava Jato   In       several politicians from Brazil were found to be involved in corruption  by accepting bribes from different corporations in exchange for government contracts  After the scandal  the excerpt from Brazil s president Fernando Henrique s interview was released  One paragraph by a former Petrobras manager mentioned a comment in which he suggested corruption in the company may date back to Cardoso s presidency  Attached  was a comment between parenthesis   Podemos tirar se achar melhor    we can take it out if  you  think better                which was removed from the current version of the text              This had the effect of confusing readers  and suggests that the former president was involved in corruption and the comment was attributed to him  Reuters later confirmed the error  and explained that the comment  originating from one of the local editors  was actually intended for the journalist who wrote the original text in English  and that it should not have been published             

Funding by the UK Government edit 
In November       the UK Foreign Office released archive documents confirming that it had provided funding to Reuters during the     s and     s so that Reuters could expand its coverage in the Middle East  An agreement was made between the Information Research Department  IRD  and Reuters for the UK Treasury to provide          over four years to fund Reuters  expansion  The UK government had already been funding the Latin American department of Reuters through a shell company  but that method was discounted for the Middle East operation since the accounting of the shell company looked suspicious  and the IRD stated that the company  already looks queer to anyone who might wish to investigate why such an inactive and unprofitable company continues to run               Instead  the BBC was used to fund the project by paying for enhanced subscriptions to the news organisation for which the Treasury would reimburse the BBC at a later date  The IRD acknowledged that this agreement would not give them editorial control over Reuters  although the IRD believed it would give them political influence over Reuters  work  stating  this influence would flow  at the top level  from Reuters  willingness to consult and to listen to views expressed on the results of its work                          

Partnership with TASS edit 
On   June       Reuters announced that Russian news agency TASS had joined its  Reuters Connect  programme  comprising a then total of    partner agencies  Reuters president Michael Friedenberg said he was  delighted that TASS and Reuters are building upon our valued partnership               Two years later  TASS s membership in Reuters Connect came under scrutiny in the wake of the      Russian invasion of Ukraine  Politico reported that Reuters staff members were  frustrated and embarrassed  that their agency had not suspended its partnership with TASS             
On    March       Reuters removed TASS from its  content marketplace   Matthew Keen  interim CEO of Reuters said  we believe making TASS content available on Reuters Connect is not aligned with the Thomson Reuters Trust Principles              

Fossil fuel advertising edit 
An investigation by The Intercept  The Nation  and DeSmog found that Reuters is one of the leading media outlets that publishes advertising for the fossil fuel industry              Journalists who cover climate change for Reuters are concerned that conflicts of interest with the companies and industries that caused climate change and obstructed action will reduce the credibility of their reporting on climate change and cause readers to downplay the climate crisis
