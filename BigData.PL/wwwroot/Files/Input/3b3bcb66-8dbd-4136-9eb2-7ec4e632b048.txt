Jon Michael Kleinberg  born       is an American computer scientist and the Tisch University Professor of Computer Science and Information Science at Cornell University known for his work in algorithms and networks                                                                               He is a recipient of the Nevanlinna Prize by the International Mathematical Union 


Early life and education edit 
Jon Kleinberg was born in      in Boston  Massachusetts to a mathematics professor father and a computer consultant mother              He received a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science from Cornell University in      and a PhD from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in       He is the older brother of fellow Cornell computer scientist Robert Kleinberg 

Career edit 
Since      Kleinberg has been a professor in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell  as well as a visiting scientist at IBM s Almaden Research Center  His work has been supported by an NSF Career Award  an ONR Young Investigator Award  a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship  a Packard Foundation Fellowship  a Sloan Foundation Fellowship  and grants from Google  Yahoo   and the NSF  He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  In       he was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences                          In      he became a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery             

Research edit 
Kleinberg is best known for his work on networks  One of his best known contributions is the HITS algorithm  developed while he was at IBM   HITS is an algorithm for web search that builds on the eigenvector based methods used in algorithms and served as the full scale model for PageRank by recognizing that web pages or sites should be considered important not only if they are linked to by many others  as in PageRank   but also if they link to many others   Search engines themselves are examples of sites that are important because they link to many others   Kleinberg realized that this generalization implies two different classes of important web pages  which he called  hubs  and  authorities    The HITS algorithm is an algorithm for automatically identifying the leading hubs and authorities in a network of hyperlinked pages 
Kleinberg is also known for his work on algorithmic aspects of the small world experiment               He was one of the first to realize that Stanley Milgram s famous  six degrees  letter passing experiment implied not only that there are short paths between individuals in social networks but also that people seem to be good at finding those paths  an apparently simple observation that turns out to have profound implications for the structure of the networks in question  The formal model in which Kleinberg studied this question is a two dimensional grid  where each node has both short range connections  edges  to neighbours in the grid and long range connections to nodes further apart  For each node v  a long range edge between v and another node w is added with a probability that decays as the second power of the distance between v and w  This is generalized to a d dimensional grid  where the probability decays as the d th power of the distance 
Kleinberg has written numerous papers and articles as well as a textbook on computer algorithms  Algorithm Design  co authored the first edition with  va Tardos and sole authored the second edition                          Among other honors  he received a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship also known as the  genius grant  in      and the Nevanlinna Prize in       an award that is given out once every four years along with the Fields Medal as the premier distinction in Computational Mathematics             
His new book is entitled  Networks  Crowds  and Markets  Reasoning About a Highly Connected World   published by Cambridge University Press in                  
Cornell s Association of Computer Science Undergraduates awarded him the  Faculty of the Year  award in
