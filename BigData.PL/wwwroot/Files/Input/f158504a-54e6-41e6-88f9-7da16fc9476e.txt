Some engines suggest queries when the user is typing in the search box 
A search engine is a software system that provides hyperlinks to web pages and other relevant information on the Web in response to a user s query  The user inputs a query within a web browser or a mobile app  and the search results are often a list of hyperlinks  accompanied by textual summaries and images  Users also have the option of limiting the search to a specific type of results  such as images  videos  or news 
For a search provider  its engine is part of a distributed computing system that can encompass many data centers throughout the world  The speed and accuracy of an engine s response to a query is based on a complex system of indexing that is continuously updated by automated web crawlers  This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers  but some content is not accessible to crawlers 
There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the     s  but Google Search became the dominant one in the     s and has remained so  It currently has a     global market share                        The business of websites improving their visibility in search results  known as marketing and optimization  has thus largely focused on Google

Pre     s edit 
In       Vannevar Bush described an information retrieval system that would allow a user to access a great expanse of information  all at a single desk             He called it a memex  He described the system in an article titled  As We May Think  that was published in The Atlantic Monthly             The memex was intended to give a user the capability to overcome the ever increasing difficulty of locating information in ever growing centralized indices of scientific work  Vannevar Bush envisioned libraries of research with connected annotations  which are similar to modern hyperlinks            
Link analysis eventually became a crucial component of search engines through algorithms such as Hyper Search and PageRank                       

    s  Birth of search engines edit 
The first internet search engines predate the debut of the Web in December       WHOIS user search dates back to                  and the Knowbot Information Service multi network user search was first implemented in                  The first well documented search engine that searched content files  namely FTP files  was Archie  which debuted on    September                  
Prior to September       the World Wide Web was entirely indexed by hand  There was a list of webservers edited by Tim Berners Lee and hosted on the CERN webserver  One snapshot of the list in      remains              but as more and more web servers went online the central list could no longer keep up  On the NCSA site  new servers were announced under the title  What s New               
The first tool used for searching content  as opposed to users  on the Internet was Archie              The name stands for  archive  without the  v               It was created by Alan Emtage                                                  computer science student at McGill University in Montreal  Quebec  Canada  The program downloaded the directory listings of all the files located on public anonymous FTP  File Transfer Protocol  sites  creating a searchable database of file names  however  Archie Search Engine did not index the contents of these sites since the amount of data was so limited it could be readily searched manually 
The rise of Gopher  created in      by Mark McCahill at the University of Minnesota  led to two new search programs  Veronica and Jughead  Like Archie  they searched the file names and titles stored in Gopher index systems  Veronica  Very Easy Rodent Oriented Net wide Index to Computerized Archives  provided a keyword search of most Gopher menu titles in the entire Gopher listings  Jughead  Jonzy s Universal Gopher Hierarchy Excavation And Display  was a tool for obtaining menu information from specific Gopher servers  While the name of the search engine  Archie Search Engine  was not a reference to the Archie comic book series   Veronica  and  Jughead  are characters in the series  thus referencing their predecessor 
In the summer of       no search engine existed for the web  though numerous specialized catalogs were maintained by hand  Oscar Nierstrasz at the University of Geneva wrote a series of Perl scripts that periodically mirrored these pages and rewrote them into a standard format  This formed the basis for W Catalog  the web s first primitive search engine  released on September                     
In June       Matthew Gray  then at MIT  produced what was probably the first web robot  the Perl based World Wide Web Wanderer  and used it to generate an index called  Wandex   The purpose of the Wanderer was to measure the size of the World Wide Web  which it did until late       The web s second search engine Aliweb appeared in November       Aliweb did not use a web robot  but instead depended on being notified by website administrators of the existence at each site of an index file in a particular format 
JumpStation  created in December                  by Jonathon Fletcher  used a web robot to find web pages and to build its index  and used a web form as the interface to its query program  It was thus the first WWW resource discovery tool to combine the three essential features of a web search engine  crawling  indexing  and searching  as described below  Because of the limited resources available on the platform it ran on  its indexing and hence searching were limited to the titles and headings found in the web pages the crawler encountered 
One of the first  all text  crawler based search engines was WebCrawler  which came out in       Unlike its predecessors  it allowed users to search for any word in any web page  which has become the standard for all major search engines since  It was also the search engine that was widely known by the public  Also  in       Lycos  which started at Carnegie Mellon University  was launched and became a major commercial endeavor 
The first popular search engine on the Web was Yahoo  Search              The first product from Yahoo   founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January       was a Web directory called Yahoo  Directory  In       a search function was added  allowing users to search Yahoo  Directory                          It became one of the most popular ways for people to find web pages of interest  but its search function operated on its web directory  rather than its full text copies of web pages 
Soon after  a number of search engines appeared and vied for popularity  These included Magellan  Excite  Infoseek  Inktomi  Northern Light  and AltaVista  Information seekers could also browse the directory instead of doing a keyword based search 
In       Robin Li developed the RankDex site scoring algorithm for search engines results page ranking                                     and received a US patent for the technology              It was the first search engine that used hyperlinks to measure the quality of websites it was indexing              predating the very similar algorithm patent filed by Google two years later in                   Larry Page referenced Li s work in some of his U S  patents for PageRank              Li later used his Rankdex technology for the Baidu search engine  which was founded by him in China and launched in      
In       Netscape was looking to give a single search engine an exclusive deal as the featured search engine on Netscape s web browser  There was so much interest that instead  Netscape struck deals with five of the major search engines  for    million a year  each search engine would be in rotation on the Netscape search engine page  The five engines were Yahoo   Magellan  Lycos  Infoseek  and Excite                         
Google adopted the idea of selling search terms in      from a small search engine company named goto com  This move had a significant effect on the search engine business  which went from struggling to one of the most profitable businesses in the Internet                         
Search engines were also known as some of the brightest stars in the Internet investing frenzy that occurred in the late     s              Several companies entered the market spectacularly  receiving record gains during their initial public offerings  Some have taken down their public search engine and are marketing enterprise only editions  such as Northern Light  Many search engine companies were caught up in the dot com bubble  a speculation driven market boom that peaked in March      

    s present  Post dot com bubble edit 
Around       Google s search engine rose to prominence              The company achieved better results for many searches with an algorithm called PageRank  as was explained in the paper Anatomy of a Search Engine written by Sergey Brin and Larry Page  the later founders of Google             This iterative algorithm ranks web pages based on the number and PageRank of other web sites and pages that link there  on the premise that good or desirable pages are linked to more than others  Larry Page s patent for PageRank cites Robin Li s earlier RankDex patent as an influence                          Google also maintained a minimalist interface to its search engine  In contrast  many of its competitors embedded a search engine in a web portal  In fact  the Google search engine became so popular that spoof engines emerged such as Mystery Seeker 
By       Yahoo  was providing search services based on Inktomi s search engine  Yahoo  acquired Inktomi in       and Overture  which owned AlltheWeb and AltaVista  in       Yahoo  switched to Google s search engine until       when it launched its own search engine based on the combined technologies of its acquisitions 
Microsoft first launched MSN Search in the fall of      using search results from Inktomi  In early       the site began to display listings from Looksmart  blended with results from Inktomi  For a short time in       MSN Search used results from AltaVista instead  In       Microsoft began a transition to its own search technology  powered by its own web crawler  called msnbot  
Microsoft s rebranded search engine  Bing  was launched on June          On July           Yahoo  and Microsoft finalized a deal in which Yahoo  Search would be powered by Microsoft Bing technology 
As of           update      active search engine crawlers include those of Google  Sogou  Baidu  Bing  Gigablast  Mojeek  DuckDuckGo and Yandex 

Approach edit 


Main article  Search engine technology
A search engine maintains the following processes in near real time             

Web crawling
Indexing
Searching            
Web search engines get their information by web crawling from site to site  The  spider  checks for the standard filename robots txt  addressed to it  The robots txt file contains directives for search spiders  telling it which pages to crawl and which pages not to crawl  After checking for robots txt and either finding it or not  the spider sends certain information back to be indexed depending on many factors  such as the titles  page content  JavaScript  Cascading Style Sheets  CSS   headings  or its metadata in HTML meta tags  After a certain number of pages crawled  amount of data indexed  or time spent on the website  the spider stops crawling and moves on    N o web crawler may actually crawl the entire reachable web  Due to infinite websites  spider traps  spam  and other exigencies of the real web  crawlers instead apply a crawl policy to determine when the crawling of a site should be deemed sufficient  Some websites are crawled exhaustively  while others are crawled only partially              
Indexing means associating words and other definable tokens found on web pages to their domain names and HTML based fields  The associations are stored in a public database and accessible through web search queries  A query from a user can be a single word  multiple words or a sentence  The index helps find information relating to the query as quickly as possible              Some of the techniques for indexing  and caching are trade secrets  whereas web crawling is a straightforward process of visiting all sites on a systematic basis 
Between visits by the spider  the cached version of the page  some or all the content needed to render it  stored in the search engine working memory is quickly sent to an inquirer  If a visit is overdue  the search engine can just act as a web proxy instead  In this case  the page may differ from the search terms indexed              The cached page holds the appearance of the version whose words were previously indexed  so a cached version of a page can be useful to the website when the actual page has been lost  but this problem is also considered a mild form of linkrot 

High level architecture of a standard Web crawler
Typically when a user enters a query into a search engine it is a few keywords              The index already has the names of the sites containing the keywords  and these are instantly obtained from the index  The real processing load is in generating the web pages that are the search results list  Every page in the entire list must be weighted according to information in the indexes              Then the top search result item requires the lookup  reconstruction  and markup of the snippets showing the context of the keywords matched  These are only part of the processing each search results web page requires  and further pages  next to the top  require more of this post processing 
Beyond simple keyword lookups  search engines offer their own GUI  or command driven operators and search parameters to refine the search results  These provide the necessary controls for the user engaged in the feedback loop users create by filtering and weighting while refining the search results  given the initial pages of the first search results 
For example  from      the Google com search engine has allowed one to filter by date by clicking  Show search tools  in the leftmost column of the initial search results page  and then selecting the desired date range              It is also possible to weight by date because each page has a modification time  Most search engines support the use of the Boolean operators AND  OR and NOT to help end users refine the search query  Boolean operators are for literal searches that allow the user to refine and extend the terms of the search  The engine looks for the words or phrases exactly as entered  Some search engines provide an advanced feature called proximity search  which allows users to define the distance between keywords              There is also concept based searching where the research involves using statistical analysis on pages containing the words or phrases you search for 
The usefulness of a search engine depends on the relevance of the result set it gives back  While there may be millions of web pages that include a particular word or phrase  some pages may be more relevant  popular  or authoritative than others  Most search engines employ methods to rank the results to provide the  best  results first  How a search engine decides which pages are the best matches  and what order the results should be shown in  varies widely from one engine to another              The methods also change over time as Internet usage changes and new techniques evolve  There are two main types of search engine that have evolved  one is a system of predefined and hierarchically ordered keywords that humans have programmed extensively  The other is a system that generates an  inverted index  by analyzing texts it locates  This first form relies much more heavily on the computer itself to do the bulk of the work 
Most Web search engines are commercial ventures supported by advertising revenue and thus some of them allow advertisers to have their listings ranked higher in search results for a fee  Search engines that do not accept money for their search results make money by running search related ads alongside the regular search engine results  The search engines make money every time someone clicks on one of these ads             

Local search edit 
Local search is the process that optimizes the efforts of local businesses  They focus on change to make sure all searches are consistent  It is important because many people determine where they plan to go and what to buy based on their searches             

Market share edit 
As of January                update      Google is by far the world s most used search engine  with a market share of      and the world s other most used search engines were Bing at     Yandex at     Yahoo  at     Other search engines not listed have less than a    market share             In       Google s dominance was ruled an illegal monopoly in a case brought by the US Department of Justice             

Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues  Updates on reimplementing the Graph extension  which will be known as the Chart extension  can be found on Phabricator and on MediaWiki org 
Russia and East Asia edit 
This section needs to be updated  Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information    December      
In Russia  Yandex has a market share of        compared to Google s        Yandex is the second most used search engine on smartphones in Asia and Europe              In China  Baidu is the most popular search engine              South Korea based search portal Naver is used for       of online searches in the country              Yahoo  Japan and Yahoo  Taiwan are the most popular choices for Internet searches in Japan and Taiwan  respectively              China is one of few countries where Google is not in the top three web search engines for market share  Google was previously more popular in China  but withdrew significantly after a disagreement with the government over censorship and a cyberattack  Bing  however  is in the top three web search engines with a market share of         Baidu is top with       of the market share                  failed verification     

Europe edit 
Most countries  markets in the European Union are dominated by Google  except for the Czech Republic  where Seznam is a strong competitor             
The search engine Qwant is based in Paris  France  where it attracts most of its    million monthly registered users from 

Search engine bias edit 
Although search engines are programmed to rank websites based on some combination of their popularity and relevancy  empirical studies indicate various political  economic  and social biases in the information they provide                         and the underlying assumptions about the technology              These biases can be a direct result of economic and commercial processes  e g   companies that advertise with a search engine can become also more popular in its organic search results   and political processes  e g   the removal of search results to comply with local laws               For example  Google will not surface certain neo Nazi websites in France and Germany  where Holocaust denial is illegal 
Biases can also be a result of social processes  as search engine algorithms are frequently designed to exclude non normative viewpoints in favor of more  popular  results              Indexing algorithms of major search engines skew towards coverage of U S  based sites  rather than websites from non U S  countries             
Google Bombing is one example of an attempt to manipulate search results for political  social or commercial reasons 
Several scholars have studied the cultural changes triggered by search engines              and the representation of certain controversial topics in their results  such as terrorism in Ireland              climate change denial              and conspiracy theories             

Customized results and filter bubbles edit 
There has been concern raised that search engines such as Google and Bing provide customized results based on the user s activity history  leading to what has been termed echo chambers or filter bubbles by Eli Pariser in                   The argument is that search engines and social media platforms use algorithms to selectively guess what information a user would like to see  based on information about the user  such as location  past click behaviour and search history   As a result  websites tend to show only information that agrees with the user s past viewpoint  According to Eli Pariser users get less exposure to conflicting viewpoints and are isolated intellectually in their own informational bubble  Since this problem has been identified  competing search engines have emerged that seek to avoid this problem by not tracking or  bubbling  users  such as DuckDuckGo  However many scholars have questioned Pariser s view  finding that there is little evidence for the filter bubble                                      On the contrary  a number of studies trying to verify the existence of filter bubbles have found only minor levels of personalisation in search              that most people encounter a range of views when browsing online  and that Google news tends to promote mainstream established news outlets                         

Religious search engines edit 
The global growth of the Internet and electronic media in the Arab and Muslim world during the last decade has encouraged Islamic adherents in the Middle East and Asian sub continent  to attempt their own search engines  their own filtered search portals that would enable users to perform safe searches  More than usual safe search filters  these Islamic web portals categorizing websites into being either  halal  or  haram   based on interpretation of Sharia law  ImHalal came online in September       Halalgoogling came online in July       These use haram filters on the collections from Google and Bing  and others              
While lack of investment and slow pace in technologies in the Muslim world has hindered progress and thwarted success of an Islamic search engine  targeting as the main consumers Islamic adherents  projects like Muxlim  a Muslim lifestyle site  received millions of dollars from investors like Rite Internet Ventures  and it also faltered  Other religion oriented search engines are Jewogle  the Jewish version of Google              and Christian search engine SeekFind org  SeekFind filters sites that attack or degrade their faith             

Search engine submission edit 
Web search engine submission is a process in which a webmaster submits a website directly to a search engine  While search engine submission is sometimes presented as a way to promote a website  it generally is not necessary because the major search engines use web crawlers that will eventually find most web sites on the Internet without assistance  They can either submit one web page at a time  or they can submit the entire site using a sitemap  but it is normally only necessary to submit the home page of a web site as search engines are able to crawl a well designed website  There are two remaining reasons to submit a web site or web page to a search engine  to add an entirely new web site without waiting for a search engine to discover it  and to have a web site s record updated after a substantial redesign 
Some search engine submission software not only submits websites to multiple search engines  but also adds links to websites from their own pages  This could appear helpful in increasing a website s ranking  because external links are one of the most important factors determining a website s ranking  However  John Mueller of Google has stated that this  can lead to a tremendous number of unnatural links for your site  with a negative impact on site ranking             

Comparison to social bookmarking edit 
See also  Social media optimization
In comparison to search engines  a social bookmarking system has several advantages over traditional automated resource location and classification software  such as search engine spiders  All tag based classification of Internet resources  such as web sites  is done by human beings  who understand the content of the resource  as opposed to software  which algorithmically attempts to determine the meaning and quality of a resource  Also  people can find and bookmark web pages that have not yet been noticed or indexed by web spiders              Additionally  a social bookmarking system can rank a resource based on how many times it has been bookmarked by users  which may be a more useful metric for end users than systems that rank resources based on the number of external links pointing to it   However  both types of ranking are vulnerable to fraud   see Gaming the system   and both need technical countermeasures to try to deal with this 

Technology edit 
This article or section may need to be cleaned up or summarized because it has been split from to Search engine technology Web search engines 
Archie edit 
The first web search engine was Archie  created in                  by Alan Emtage  a student at McGill University in Montreal  The author originally wanted to call the program  archives   but had to shorten it to comply with the Unix world standard of assigning programs and files short  cryptic names such as grep  cat  troff  sed  awk  perl  and so on 
The primary method of storing and retrieving files was via the File Transfer Protocol  FTP   This was  and still is  a system that specified a common way for computers to exchange files over the Internet  It works like this  Some administrator decides that he wants to make files available from his computer  He sets up a program on his computer  called an FTP server  When someone on the Internet wants to retrieve a file from this computer  he or she connects to it via another program called an FTP client  Any FTP client program can connect with any FTP server program as long as the client and server programs both fully follow the specifications set forth in the FTP protocol 
Initially  anyone who wanted to share a file had to set up an FTP server in order to make the file available to others  Later   anonymous  FTP sites became repositories for files  allowing all users to post and retrieve them 
Even with archive sites  many important files were still scattered on small FTP servers  These files could be located only by the Internet equivalent of word of mouth  Somebody would post an e mail to a message list or a discussion forum announcing the availability of a file 
Archie changed all that  It combined a script based data gatherer  which fetched site listings of anonymous FTP files  with a regular expression matcher for retrieving file names matching a user query      In other words  Archie s gatherer scoured FTP sites across the Internet and indexed all of the files it found  Its regular expression matcher provided users with access to its database             

Veronica edit 
In       the University of Nevada System Computing Services group developed Veronica              It was created as a type of searching device similar to Archie but for Gopher files  Another Gopher search service  called Jughead  appeared a little later  probably for the sole purpose of rounding out the comic strip triumvirate  Jughead is an acronym for Jonzy s Universal Gopher Hierarchy Excavation and Display  although  like Veronica  it is probably safe to assume that the creator backed into the acronym  Jughead s functionality was pretty much identical to Veronica s  although it appears to be a little rougher around the edges             

The Lone Wanderer edit 
The World Wide Web Wanderer  developed by Matthew Gray in                  was the first robot on the Web and was designed to track the Web s growth  Initially  the Wanderer counted only Web servers  but shortly after its introduction  it started to capture URLs as it went along  The database of captured URLs became the Wandex  the first web database 
Matthew Gray s Wanderer created quite a controversy at the time  partially because early versions of the software ran rampant through the Net and caused a noticeable netwide performance degradation  This degradation occurred because the Wanderer would access the same page hundreds of times a day  The Wanderer soon amended its ways  but the controversy over whether robots were good or bad for the Internet remained 
In response to the Wanderer  Martijn Koster created Archie Like Indexing of the Web  or ALIWEB  in October       As the name implies  ALIWEB was the HTTP equivalent of Archie  and because of this  it is still unique in many ways 
ALIWEB does not have a web searching robot  Instead  webmasters of participating sites post their own index information for each page they want listed  The advantage to this method is that users get to describe their own site  and a robot does not run about eating up Net bandwidth  The disadvantages of ALIWEB are more of a problem today  The primary disadvantage is that a special indexing file must be submitted  Most users do not understand how to create such a file  and therefore they do not submit their pages  This leads to a relatively small database  which meant that users are less likely to search ALIWEB than one of the large bot based sites  This Catch    has been somewhat offset by incorporating other databases into the ALIWEB search  but it still does not have the mass appeal of search engines such as Yahoo  or Lycos             

Excite edit 
Excite  initially called Architext  was started by six Stanford undergraduates in February       Their idea was to use statistical analysis of word relationships in order to provide more efficient searches through the large amount of information on the Internet 
Their project was fully funded by mid       Once funding was secured  they released a version of their search software for webmasters to use on their own web sites  At the time  the software was called Architext  but it now goes by the name of Excite for Web Servers             
Excite was the first serious commercial search engine which launched in                   It was developed in Stanford and was purchased for      billion by  Home  In      Excite and  Home went bankrupt and InfoSpace bought Excite for     million 
Some of the first analysis of web searching was conducted on search logs from Excite                        

Yahoo  edit 
In April       two Stanford University Ph D  candidates  David Filo and Jerry Yang  created some pages that became rather popular  They called the collection of pages Yahoo  Their official explanation for the name choice was that they considered themselves to be a pair of yahoos 
As the number of links grew and their pages began to receive thousands of hits a day  the team created ways to better organize the data  In order to aid in data retrieval  Yahoo   www yahoo com  became a searchable directory  The search feature was a simple database search engine  Because Yahoo  entries were entered and categorized manually  Yahoo  was not really classified as a search engine  Instead  it was generally considered to be a searchable directory  Yahoo  has since automated some aspects of the gathering and classification process  blurring the distinction between engine and directory 
The Wanderer captured only URLs  which made it difficult to find things that were not explicitly described by their URL  Because URLs are rather cryptic to begin with  this did not help the average user  Searching Yahoo  or the Galaxy was much more effective because they contained additional descriptive information about the indexed sites 

Lycos edit 
At Carnegie Mellon University during July       Michael Mauldin  on leave from CMU  developed the Lycos search engine 

Types of web search engines edit 
Search engines on the web are sites enriched with facility to search the content stored on other sites  There is difference in the way various search engines work  but they all perform three basic tasks             

Finding and selecting full or partial content based on the keywords provided 
Maintaining index of the content and referencing to the location they find
Allowing users to look for words or combinations of words found in that index 
The process begins when a user enters a query statement into the system through the interface provided

There are basically three types of search engines  Those that are powered by robots  called crawlers  ants or spiders  and those that are powered by human submissions  and those that are a hybrid of the two 
Crawler based search engines are those that use automated software agents  called crawlers  that visit a Web site  read the information on the actual site  read the site s meta tags and also follow the links that the site connects to performing indexing on all linked Web sites as well  The crawler returns all that information back to a central depository  where the data is indexed  The crawler will periodically return to the sites to check for any information that has changed  The frequency with which this happens is determined by the administrators of the search engine 
Human powered search engines rely on humans to submit information that is subsequently indexed and catalogued  Only information that is submitted is put into the index 
In both cases  when you query a search engine to locate information  you re actually searching through the index that the search engine has created  you are not actually searching the Web  These indices are giant databases of information that is collected and stored and subsequently searched  This explains why sometimes a search on a commercial search engine  such as Yahoo  or Google  will return results that are  in fact  dead links  Since the search results are based on the index  if the index has not been updated since a Web page became invalid the search engine treats the page as still an active link even though it no longer is  It will remain that way until the index is updated 
So why will the same search on different search engines produce different results  Part of the answer to that question is because not all indices are going to be exactly the same  It depends on what the spiders find or what the humans submitted  But more important  not every search engine uses the same algorithm to search through the indices  The algorithm is what the search engines use to determine the relevance of the information in the index to what the user is searching for 
One of the elements that a search engine algorithm scans for is the frequency and location of keywords on a Web page  Those with higher frequency are typically considered more relevant  But search engine technology is becoming sophisticated in its attempt to discourage what is known as keyword stuffing  or spamdexing 
Another common element that algorithms analyze is the way that pages link to other pages in the Web  By analyzing how pages link to each other  an engine can both determine what a page is about  if the keywords of the linked pages are similar to the keywords on the original page  and whether that page is considered  important  and deserving of a boost in ranking  Just as the technology is becoming increasingly sophisticated to ignore keyword stuffing  it is also becoming more savvy to Web masters who build artificial links into their sites in order to build an artificial ranking 
Modern web search engines are highly intricate software systems that employ technology that has evolved over the years  There are a number of sub categories of search engine software that are separately applicable to specific  browsing  needs  These include web search engines  e g  Google   database or structured data search engines  e g  Dieselpoint   and mixed search engines or enterprise search  The more prevalent search engines  such as Google and Yahoo   utilize hundreds of thousands computers to process trillions of web pages in order to return fairly well aimed results  Due to this high volume of queries and text processing  the software is required to run in a highly dispersed environment with a high degree of superfluity 
Another category of search engines is scientific search engines  These are search engines which search scientific literature  The best known example is Google Scholar  Researchers are working on improving search engine technology by making them understand the content element of the articles  such as extracting theoretical constructs or key research findings
