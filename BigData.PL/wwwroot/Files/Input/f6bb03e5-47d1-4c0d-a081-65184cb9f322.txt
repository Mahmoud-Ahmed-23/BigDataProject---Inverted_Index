The uncanny valley  Japanese         Hepburn  bukimi no tani  effect is a hypothesized psychological and aesthetic relation between an object s degree of resemblance to a human being and the emotional response to the object  The uncanny valley hypothesis predicts that an entity appearing almost human will risk eliciting eerie feelings in viewers  Examples of the phenomenon exist among robotics   D computer animations and lifelike dolls  The increasing prevalence of digital technologies  e g   virtual reality  augmented reality  and photorealistic computer animation  has propagated discussions and citations of the  valley   such conversation has enhanced the construct s verisimilitude  


Etymology edit 
As related to robotics engineering  robotics professor Masahiro Mori first introduced the concept in      from his book titled Bukimi No Tani          phrasing it as bukimi no tani gensh            lit         uncanny valley phenomenon               Bukimi no tani was translated literally as uncanny valley in the      book Robots  Fact  Fiction  and Prediction written by Jasia Reichardt             Over time  this translation created an unintended association of the concept to Ernst Jentsch s psychoanalytic concept of the uncanny established in his      essay On the Psychology of the Uncanny  German  Zur Psychologie des Unheimlichen                         which was then critiqued and extended in Sigmund Freud s      essay The Uncanny  German  Das Unheimliche             

Hypothesis edit 
In an experiment involving the human lookalike robot Repliee Q   pictured above   the uncovered robotic structure underneath Repliee  and the actual human who was the model for Repliee  the human lookalike elicited the greatest degree of mirror neuron activity            
Mori s original hypothesis states that as the appearance of a robot is made more human  some observers  emotional response to the robot becomes increasingly positive and empathetic  until it becomes almost human  at which point the response quickly becomes strong revulsion  However  as the robot s appearance continues to become less distinguishable from that of a human being  the emotional response becomes positive once again and approaches human to human empathy levels             When plotted on a graph  the reactions are indicated by a steep decrease followed by a steep increase  hence the  valley  part of the name  in the areas where anthropomorphism is closest to reality 
This interval of repulsive response aroused by a robot with appearance and motion between a  somewhat human  and  fully human  entity is the uncanny valley effect  The name represents the idea that an almost human looking robot seems overly  strange  to some human beings  produces a feeling of uncanniness  and thus fails to evoke the empathic response required for productive human robot interaction            

Theoretical basis edit 
A number of theories have been proposed to explain the cognitive mechanism causing the phenomenon 

Mate selection  Automatic  stimulus driven appraisals of uncanny stimuli elicit aversion by activating an evolved cognitive mechanism for the avoidance of selecting mates with low fertility  poor hormonal health  or ineffective immune systems based on visible features of the face and body that are predictive of those traits            
Mortality salience  Viewing an  uncanny  robot elicits an innate fear of death and culturally supported defenses for coping with death s inevitability      P artially disassembled androids   play on subconscious fears of reduction  replacement  and annihilation      A mechanism with a human fa ade and a mechanical interior plays on our subconscious fear that we are all just soulless machines      Androids in various states of mutilation  decapitation  or disassembly are reminiscent of a battlefield after a conflict and  as such  serve as a reminder of our mortality      Since most androids are copies of actual people  they are doppelg ngers and may elicit a fear of being replaced  on the job  in a relationship  and so on      The jerkiness of an android s movements could be unsettling because it elicits a fear of losing bodily control            
Pathogen avoidance  Uncanny stimuli may activate a cognitive mechanism that originally evolved to motivate the avoidance of potential sources of pathogens by eliciting a disgust response   The more human an organism looks  the stronger the aversion to its defects  because     defects indicate disease      more human looking organisms are more closely related to human beings genetically  and     the probability of contracting disease causing bacteria  viruses  and other parasites increases with genetic similarity              The visual anomalies of androids  robots  and other animated human characters cause reactions of alarm and revulsion  similar to corpses and visibly diseased individuals                         
Sorites paradoxes  Stimuli with human and nonhuman traits undermine our sense of human identity by linking qualitatively different categories  human and nonhuman  by a quantitative metric  degree of human likeness             
Violation of human norms  If an entity looks sufficiently nonhuman  its human characteristics are noticeable  generating empathy  However  if the entity looks almost human  it elicits our model of a human other and its detailed normative expectations  The nonhuman characteristics are noticeable  giving the human viewer a sense of strangeness  In other words  a robot which has an appearance in the uncanny valley range is not judged as a robot doing a passable job at pretending to be human  but instead as an abnormal human doing a bad job at seeming like a normal person  This has been associated with perceptual uncertainty and the theory of predictive coding                                     
Conflicting perceptual cues  The negative effect associated with uncanny stimuli is produced by the activation of conflicting cognitive representations  Perceptual tension occurs when an individual perceives conflicting cues to category membership  such as when a humanoid figure moves like a robot  or has other visible robot features  This cognitive conflict is experienced as psychological discomfort  i e    eeriness    much like the discomfort that is experienced with cognitive dissonance                          Several studies support this possibility  Mathur and Reichling found that the time subjects took to gauge a robot face s human  or mechanical resemblance peaked for faces deepest in the uncanny valley  suggesting that perceptually classifying these faces as  human  or  robot  posed a greater cognitive challenge              However  they found that while perceptual confusion coincided with the uncanny valley  it did not mediate the effect of the uncanny valley on subjects  social and emotional reactions suggesting that perceptual confusion may not be the mechanism behind the uncanny valley effect  Burleigh and colleagues demonstrated that faces at the midpoint between human and non human stimuli produced a level of reported eeriness that diverged from an otherwise linear model relating human likeness to affect              Yamada et al  found that cognitive difficulty was associated with negative affect at the midpoint of a morphed continuum  e g   a series of stimuli morphing between a cartoon dog and a real dog               Ferrey et al  demonstrated that the midpoint between images on a continuum anchored by two stimulus categories produced a maximum of negative affect  and found this with both human and non human entities              Schoenherr and Burleigh provide examples from history and culture that evidence an aversion to hybrid entities  such as the aversion to genetically modified organisms   Frankenfoods                Finally  Moore developed a Bayesian mathematical model that provides a quantitative account of perceptual conflict              There has been some debate as to the precise mechanisms that are responsible  It has been argued that the effect is driven by categorization difficulty                          configural processing  perceptual mismatch              frequency based sensitization              and inhibitory devaluation             
Threat to humans  distinctiveness and identity  Negative reactions toward very humanlike robots can be related to the challenge that this kind of robot leads to the categorical human   non human distinction  Kaplan             stated that these new machines challenge human uniqueness  pushing for a redefinition of humanness  Ferrari  Paladino and Jetten             found that the increase of anthropomorphic appearance of a robot leads to an enhancement of threat to the human distinctiveness and identity  The more a robot resembles a real person  the more it represents a challenge to our social identity as human beings 
Religious definition of human identity  The existence of artificial but humanlike entities is viewed by some as a threat to the concept of human identity  An example can be found in the theoretical framework of psychiatrist Irvin Yalom  Yalom explains that humans construct psychological defenses to avoid existential anxiety stemming from death  One of these defenses is  specialness   the irrational belief that aging and death as central premises of life apply to all others but oneself              The experience of the very humanlike  living  robot can be so rich and compelling that it challenges humans  notions of  specialness  and existential defenses  eliciting existential anxiety  In folklore  the creation of human like  but soulless  beings is often shown to be unwise  as with the golem in Judaism  whose absence of human empathy and spirit can lead to disaster  however good the intentions of its creator             
Uncanny valley of the mind or AI  Due to rapid advancements in the areas of artificial intelligence and affective computing  cognitive scientists have also suggested the possibility of an  uncanny valley of mind                           Accordingly  people might experience strong feelings of aversion if they encounter highly advanced  emotion sensitive technology  Among the possible explanations for this phenomenon  both a perceived loss of human uniqueness and expectations of immediate physical harm are discussed by contemporary research 
Research edit 
An empirically estimated uncanny valley for static robot face images            
A series of studies experimentally investigated whether uncanny valley effects exist for static images of robot faces  Mathur MB  amp  Reichling DB             used two complementary sets of stimuli spanning the range from very mechanical to very human like  first  a sample of    objectively chosen robot face images from Internet searches  and second  a morphometrically and graphically controlled   face series set of faces  They asked subjects to explicitly rate the likability of each face  To measure trust toward each face  subjects completed an investment game to measure indirectly how much money they were willing to  wager  on a robot s trustworthiness  Both stimulus sets showed a robust uncanny valley effect on explicitly rated likability and a more context dependent uncanny valley on implicitly rated trust  Their exploratory analysis of one proposed mechanism for the uncanny valley  perceptual confusion at a category boundary  found that category confusion occurs in the uncanny valley but does not mediate the effect on social and emotional responses 
One study conducted in      examined the evolutionary mechanism behind the aversion associated with the uncanny valley  A group of five monkeys were shown three images  two different  D      monkey faces  realistic  unrealistic   and a real photo of a monkey s face  The monkeys  eye gaze was used as a proxy for preference or aversion  Since the realistic  D      monkey face was looked at less than either the real photo  or the unrealistic  D      monkey face  this was interpreted as an indication that the monkey participants found the realistic  D      face aversive  or otherwise preferred the other two images  As one would expect with the uncanny valley  more realism can result in less positive reactions  and this study demonstrated that neither human specific cognitive processes  nor human culture explain the uncanny valley  In other words  this aversive reaction to realism can be said to be evolutionary in origin             
As of          update       researchers at University of California  San Diego and California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology were measuring human brain activations related to the uncanny valley                          In one study using fMRI  a group of cognitive scientists and roboticists found the biggest differences in brain responses for uncanny robots in parietal cortex  on both sides of the brain  specifically in the areas that connect the part of the brain s visual cortex that processes bodily movements with the section of the motor cortex thought to contain mirror neurons  The researchers say they saw  in essence  evidence of mismatch or perceptual conflict              The brain  lit up  when the human like appearance of the android and its robotic motion  didn t compute   Ay e P nar Sayg n  an assistant professor from UCSD  stated that  The brain doesn t seem selectively tuned to either biological appearance or biological motion per se  What it seems to be doing is looking for its expectations to be met   for appearance and motion to be congruent                                      
Viewer perception of facial expression and speech and the uncanny valley in realistic  human like characters intended for video games and movies is being investigated by Tinwell et al                     Consideration is also given by Tinwell et al         as to how the uncanny may be exaggerated for antipathetic characters in survival horror games              Building on the body of work already performed for android science  this research intends to build a conceptual mapping of the uncanny valley using  D characters generated in a real time gaming engine  The goal is to analyze how cross modal factors of facial expression and speech can exaggerate the uncanny  Tinwell et al                    have also introduced the notion of an  unscalable  uncanny wall that suggests that a viewer s discernment for detecting imperfections in realism will keep pace with new technologies in simulating realism  A summary of Angela Tinwell s research on the uncanny valley  psychological reasons behind the uncanny valley and how designers may overcome the uncanny in human like virtual characters is provided in her book  The Uncanny Valley in Games and Animation by CRC Press 

Design principles edit 
A number of design principles have been proposed for avoiding the uncanny valley 

Design elements should match in human realism  A robot may look uncanny when human and nonhuman elements are mixed  For example  both a robot with a synthetic voice or a human being with a human voice have been found to be less eerie than a robot with a human voice or a human being with a synthetic voice              For a robot to give a more positive impression  its degree of human realism in appearance should also match its degree of human realism in behavior              If an animated character looks more human than its movement  this gives a negative impression              Human neuroimaging studies also indicate matching appearance and motion kinematics are important                                     
Reducing conflict and uncertainty by matching appearance  behavior  and ability  In terms of performance  if a robot looks too appliance like  people expect little from it  if it looks too human  people expect too much from it              A highly human like appearance leads to an expectation that certain behaviors are present  such as humanlike motion dynamics  This likely operates at a sub conscious level and may have a biological basis  Neuroscientists have noted  when the brain s expectations are not met  the brain   generates a  prediction error   As human like artificial agents become more commonplace  perhaps our perceptual systems will be re tuned to accommodate these new social partners  Or perhaps  we will decide  it is not a good idea to make  robots  so clearly in our image after all                                       
Human facial proportions and photorealistic texture should only be used together  A photorealistic human texture demands human facial proportions  or the computer generated character can result in the uncanny valley  Abnormal facial proportions  including those typically used by artists to enhance attractiveness  e g        larger eyes   can look eerie with a photorealistic human texture 
Criticism edit 
A number of criticisms have been raised concerning whether the uncanny valley exists as a unified phenomenon amenable to scientific scrutiny 

The uncanny valley effect is a heterogeneous group of phenomena  Phenomena considered as exhibiting the uncanny valley effect can be diverse  involve different sense modalities  and have multiple  possibly overlapping causes  People s cultural heritage may have a considerable influence on how androids are perceived with respect to the uncanny valley             
The uncanny valley effect may be generational  Younger generations  more used to computer generated imagery  CGI   robots  and such  may be less likely to be affected by this hypothesized issue             
The uncanny valley effect is simply a specific case of information processing such as categorization and frequency based effects  In contrast to the assumption that the uncanny valley is based on a heterogeneous group of phenomena  recent arguments have suggested that uncanny valley like phenomena simply represent the products of information processing such as categorization  Cheetham et al              have argued that the uncanny valley effect can be understood in terms of categorization processes  with a category boundary defining  the valley   Extending this argument  Burleigh and Schoenherr             suggested that the effects associated with the uncanny valley can be divided into those attributable to the category boundary and individual exemplar frequency  Namely  the negative affective responses attributed to the uncanny valley were simply a result of the frequency of exposure  similar to the mere exposure effect  By varying the frequency of training items  they were able to demonstrate a dissociation between cognitive uncertainty based on the category boundary and affective uncertainty based on the frequency of training exemplars  In a follow up study  Schoenherr and Burleigh             demonstrated that an instructional manipulation affected categorization accuracy but not ratings of negative affect  Thus  generational effects and cultural artifacts can be accounted for with basic information processing mechanisms              These and related findings have been used to argue that the uncanny valley is merely an artifact of having greater familiarity with members of human categories and does not reflect a unique phenomenon 
The uncanny valley effect occurs at any degree of human likeness  Hanson has also stated that uncanny entities may appear anywhere in a spectrum ranging from the abstract  e g        MIT s robot Lazlo  to the perfectly human  e g        cosmetically atypical people               Capgras delusion is a relatively rare condition in which the patient believes that people  or  in some cases  things  have been replaced with duplicates  These duplicates are accepted rationally as identical in physical properties  but the irrational belief is held that the  true  entity has been replaced with something else  Some people with Capgras delusion claim that the duplicate is a robot  Ellis and Lewis argue that the delusion arises from an intact system for overt recognition coupled with a damaged system for covert recognition  which results in conflict over an individual being identifiable but not familiar in any emotional sense              This supports the opinion that the uncanny valley effect could occur due to issues of categorical perception that are particular to how the brain processes information                         
Good design can avoid the uncanny valley effect  David Hanson has criticized Mori s hypothesis that entities having an almost human appearance will necessarily be evaluated negatively              He has shown that the uncanny valley effect could be eliminated by adding neotenous  cartoonish features to entities that had formerly caused an uncanny valley effect              This method incorporates the idea that humans find characteristics appealing when they are reminiscent of the young of our own  as well as many other  species  as used in cartoons 
Similar effects edit 
If the uncanny valley effect is the result of general cognitive processes  there should be evidence in evolutionary history and cultural artifacts              An effect similar to the uncanny valley was noted by Charles Darwin in      

The expression of this  Trigonocephalus  snake s face was hideous and fierce  the pupil consisted of a vertical slit in a mottled and coppery iris  the jaws were broad at the base  and the nose terminated in a triangular projection  I do not think I ever saw anything more ugly  excepting  perhaps  some of the vampire bats  I imagine this repulsive aspect originates from the features being placed in positions  with respect to each other  somewhat proportional to the human face  and thus we obtain a scale of hideousness         Charles Darwin  The Voyage of the Beagle            
A similar  uncanny valley  effect could  according to the ethical futurist writer Jamais Cascio  show up when humans begin modifying themselves with transhuman enhancements  cf  body modification   which aim to improve the abilities of the human body beyond what would normally be possible  be it eyesight  muscle strength  or cognition              So long as these enhancements remain within a perceived norm of human behavior  a negative reaction is unlikely  but once individuals supplant normal human variety  revulsion can be expected  However  according to this theory  once such technologies gain further distance from human norms   transhuman  individuals would cease to be judged on human levels and instead be regarded as separate entities altogether  this point is what has been dubbed  posthuman    and it is here that acceptance would rise once again out of the uncanny valley              Another example comes from  pageant retouching  photos  especially of children  which some find disturbingly doll like             

In visual effects edit 
A number of movies that use computer generated imagery to show characters have been described by reviewers as giving a feeling of revulsion or  creepiness  as a result of the characters looking too realistic  Examples include the following 

According to roboticist Dario Floreano  the baby character Billy in Pixar s groundbreaking      animated short movie Tin Toy provoked negative audience reactions  which first caused the movie industry to consider the concept of the uncanny valley seriously                         
The      movie Final Fantasy  The Spirits Within  one of the first photorealistic computer animated feature movies  provoked negative reactions from some viewers due to its near realistic yet imperfect visual depictions of human characters                                      The Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw stated that while the movie s animation is brilliant  the  solemnly realist human faces look shriekingly phoney precisely because they re almost there but not quite               Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers wrote of the movie   At first it s fun to watch the characters        But then you notice a coldness in the eyes  a mechanical quality in the movements              
Several reviewers of the      animated movie The Polar Express termed its animation eerie  CNN com reviewer Paul Clinton wrote   Those human characters in the film come across as downright    well  creepy  So The Polar Express is at best disconcerting  and at worst  a wee bit horrifying               The term  eerie  was used by reviewers Kurt Loder             and Manohla Dargis              among others  Newsday reviewer John Anderson called the movie s characters  creepy  and  dead eyed   and wrote that  The Polar Express is a zombie train               Animation director Ward Jenkins wrote an online analysis describing how changes to the Polar Express characters  appearance  especially to their eyes and eyebrows  could have avoided what he considered a feeling of deadness in their faces             
In a review of the      animated movie Beowulf  New York Times technology writer David Gallagher wrote that the movie failed the uncanny valley test  stating that the movie s villain  the monster Grendel  was  only slightly scarier  than the  closeups of our hero Beowulf s face    allowing viewers to admire every hair in his   D digital stubble              
Some reviewers of the      animated film A Christmas Carol criticized its animation as creepy  Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News said of the movie   The motion capture does no favors to co stars  Gary  Oldman  Colin Firth and Robin Wright Penn  since  as in  Polar Express   the animated eyes never seem to focus  And for all the photorealism  when characters get wiggly limbed and bouncy as in standard Disney cartoons  it s off putting               Mary Elizabeth Williams of Salon com wrote of the film   In the center of the action is Jim Carrey    or at least a dead eyed  doll like version of Carrey              
The      animated movie Mars Needs Moms was widely criticized for being creepy and unnatural because of its style of animation  The movie was among the biggest box office bombs in history  which may have been due in part to audience revulsion                                                   Mars Needs Moms was produced by Robert Zemeckis s production company  ImageMovers  which had previously produced The Polar Express  Beowulf  and A Christmas Carol  
Reviewers had mixed opinions regarding whether the      animated movie The Adventures of Tintin  The Secret of the Unicorn was affected by the uncanny valley effect  Daniel D  Snyder of The Atlantic wrote   Instead of trying to bring to life Herge s beautiful artwork  Spielberg and co  have opted to bring the movie into the  D era using trendy motion capture technique to recreate Tintin and his friends  Tintin s original face  while barebones  never suffered for a lack of expression  It s now outfitted with an alien and unfamiliar visage  his plastic skin dotted with pores and subtle wrinkles   He added   In bringing them to life  Spielberg has made the characters dead                N B  of The Economist termed elements of the animation  grotesque   writing   Tintin  Captain Haddock and the others exist in settings that are almost photo realistic  and nearly all of their features are those of flesh and blood people  And yet they still have the sausage fingers and distended noses of comic strip characters  It s not so much  The Secret of the Unicorn  as  The Invasion of the Body Snatchers                However  other reviewers felt that the movie avoided the uncanny valley effect despite its animated characters  realism  Critic Dana Stevens of Slate wrote   With the possible exception of the title character  the animated cast of Tintin narrowly escapes entrapment in the so called  uncanny valley                Wired magazine editor Kevin Kelly wrote of the movie   we have passed beyond the uncanny valley into the plains of hyperreality              
In       the titular protagonist of the children s TV series Bob the Builder got a redesign which was described by some as  creepy              
In the French movie Animal Kingdom  Let s Go Ape it uses motion capture  the apes were criticized for looking creepy  As this review points out  they have  weirdly humanoid figures  and  recognisably human faces              
The      film The Lion King  a remake of the      film that featured photo realistic digital animals instead of the earlier movie s more traditional animation  divided critics about the effectiveness of its imagery  Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote that the images were so realistic that       might best be remembered as the summer we left the Uncanny Valley for good               However  other critics felt that the realism of the animals and setting rendered the scenes where the characters sing and dance disturbing and  weird                          
The      movie Sonic the Hedgehog was delayed for three months to make the title character s appearance less human like and more cartoonish  after an extremely negative audience reaction to the movie s first trailer             
Multiple commentators cited the CGI half human half cat characters in the      movie Cats as an example of the uncanny valley effect  first after the release of the trailer for the movie                                     and then after the movie s actual release             
In the      Disney animated movie Chip  n Dale  Rescue Rangers  the uncanny valley is mentioned when the animated duo visits a place where several realistic CGI characters  including a Cats cameo from the      movie  are inhabitants             
In the      Disney  series She Hulk  Attorney at Law  the appearance of the main character  She Hulk  who is depicted via CGI  was criticized by some reviewers as suffering from the uncanny valley effect  and negatively compared to the appearance of the Hulk in the same series                                     
Virtual actors edit 
An increasingly common practice is to feature virtual actors in movies  CGI likenesses of real actors used because the original actor either looks too old for the part or is deceased  Sometimes a virtual actor is created with involvement from the original actor  who may contribute motion capture  audio  etc    while at other times the actor has no involvement  Reviewers have often criticized the use of virtual actors for its uncanny valley effect  saying it adds an eerie feeling to the movie  Examples of virtual actors that have received such criticism include replicas of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator Salvation                                and Terminator Genisys                     Jeff Bridges in Tron  Legacy                                             Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher in Rogue One                                 and Will Smith in Gemini Man
