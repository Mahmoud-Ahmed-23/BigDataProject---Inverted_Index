Launch as a mail based rental business            
Marc Randolph  co founder of Netflix and the first CEO of the company
Reed Hastings  co founder and executive chairman
Netflix was founded by Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings on August           in Scotts Valley  California  Hastings  a computer scientist and mathematician  was a co founder of Pure Software  which was acquired by Rational Software that year for      million  the then biggest acquisition in Silicon Valley history              Randolph had worked as a marketing director for Pure Software after Pure Atria acquired a company where Randolph worked  He was previously a co founder of MicroWarehouse  a computer mail order company  as well as vice president of marketing for Borland                         
Hastings and Randolph came up with the idea for Netflix while carpooling between their homes in Santa Cruz  California  and Pure Atria s headquarters in Sunnyvale              Patty McCord  later head of human resources at Netflix  was also in the carpool group              Randolph admired Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the Internet using a similar model  Hastings and Randolph considered and rejected selling and renting VHS as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship              When they heard about DVDs  first introduced in the United States in early       they tested the concept of online DVD rental or sales by mail  by mailing a compact disc to Hastings s house in Santa Cruz              When the CD arrived intact  they decided to enter the     billion Home video sales and rental industry                           Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined     at a Blockbuster store for returning late a copy of Apollo     but Randolph later said that Hastings invented the anecdote  Blockbuster reportedly ordered Hastings in the mid     s to stop telling the story  after it could not find such a transaction in its records                           Hastings invested      million into Netflix from the sale of Pure Atria                          Netflix launched as the first DVD rental and sales website with    employees and     titles available nearly all DVDs published                                      Randolph and Hastings met with Jeff Bezos  whose Amazon offered to acquire Netflix for between     and     million  Fearing competition from Amazon  Randolph thought the offer was fair  but Hastings  who owned     of the company  turned it down on the plane ride home                         
Not restricted to the size of a retail store  Netflix could offer hundreds of thousands of DVDs to customers in a long tail business model  Early employee Cindy Holland compared the company acquiring DVDs to  shoveling coal in the side door of the house               Initially  Netflix offered a per rental model for each DVD but introduced a monthly subscription concept in September                   The per rental model was dropped by early       allowing the company to focus on the business model of flat fee unlimited rentals without due dates  late fees  shipping and handling fees  or per title rental fees              While customers enjoyed the convenience  more important to Netflix was that it did not have to store or ship those DVDs  subscribers  homes acted as warehouses  The company secretly slowed deliveries to heavy users   pigs    to discourage them from quickly returning DVDs             
In September       during the dot com bubble  while Netflix was suffering losses  Hastings and Randolph offered to sell the company to Blockbuster for     million  John Antioco  CEO of Blockbuster  thought the offer was a joke and declined  saying   The dot com hysteria is completely overblown                           While Netflix experienced fast growth in early       the continued effects of the dot com bubble collapse and the September    attacks caused the company to hold off plans for its initial public offering  IPO  and to lay off one third of its     employees

DVD players were a popular gift for holiday sales in late       and demand for DVD subscription services were  growing like crazy   according to chief talent officer McCord              The company went public on May           selling          million shares of common stock at US       per share              In       Netflix was issued a patent by the United States Patent and Trademark Office to cover its subscription rental service and several extensions              The company posted its first profit in       earning      million on revenues of      million  by       profit had increased to     million on over      million in revenues              In              different films were available  and Netflix shipped        million DVDs out every day             
In       Blockbuster introduced a DVD rental service  which not only allowed users to check out titles through online sites but allowed for them to return them at brick and mortar stores              By       Blockbuster s service reached two million users  and while trailing Netflix s subscriber count  was drawing business away from Netflix  Netflix lowered fees in                   While it was an urban legend that Netflix ultimately  killed  Blockbuster in the DVD rental market  Blockbuster s debt load and internal disagreements hurt the company
