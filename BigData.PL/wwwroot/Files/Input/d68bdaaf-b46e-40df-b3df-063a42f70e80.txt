Early life and education
William Henry Gates III was born on October           in Seattle  Washington             as the only son of William H  Gates Sr      a                  and his first wife  Mary Maxwell Gates                         His ancestry includes English  German  and Irish Scots Irish             His father was a prominent lawyer  and his mother served on the board of directors of First Interstate BancSystem and United Way of America  Gates s maternal grandfather J  W  Maxwell was a national bank president  Gates also has an older sister Kristi  Kristianne  and a younger sister Libby  He is the fourth of his name in his family but is known as William Gates III or  Trey   i e   three  because his father had the  II  suffix                        The family lived in the Sand Point area of Seattle in a home that was damaged by a rare tornado when Gates was              
When Gates was young his parents wanted him to pursue a career in law             During his childhood  his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches  a Protestant Reformed denomination                                   
Gates was small for his age and was bullied as a child             The family encouraged competition  one visitor reported that  it didn t matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock  there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing              

Gates  right  with Paul Allen seated at Teletype Model    ASR terminals in Lakeside School      
At age     he enrolled in the private Lakeside prep school                          When he was in the eighth grade  the Mothers  Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School s rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model    ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric  GE  computer for the students              Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC  and he was excused from math classes to pursue his interest  He wrote his first computer program on this machine  an implementation of tic tac toe that allowed users to play games against the computer  Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly              After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted  Gates and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers  One of these systems was a PDP    belonging to Computer Center Corporation  CCC  which banned Gates  Paul Allen  Ric Weiland  and Gates s best friend and first business partner Kent Evans for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time                        
The four students formed the Lakeside Programmers Club to make money             At the end of the ban  they offered to find bugs in CCC s software in exchange for extra computer time  Rather than using the system remotely via Teletype  Gates went to CCC s offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system  including Fortran  Lisp  and machine language  The arrangement with CCC continued until      when the company went out of business  The following year  a Lakeside teacher enlisted Gates and Evans to automate the school s class scheduling system  providing them computer time and royalties in return  The duo worked diligently in order to have the program ready for their senior year  Towards the end of their junior year  Evans was killed in a mountain climbing accident  which Gates described as one of the saddest days of his life  He then turned to Allen who helped him finish the system for Lakeside            
At age     Gates formed a venture with Allen called Traf O Data to make traffic counters based on the Intel      processor              In       he served as a congressional page in the House of Representatives                          He was a national merit scholar when he graduated from Lakeside School in                   He scored      out of      on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests  SAT  and enrolled at Harvard College in the autumn of                              
He did not stay at Harvard long enough to choose a concentration  but took mathematics  including Math     and graduate level computer science courses              While at Harvard  he met fellow student and future Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer  Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer stayed and graduated magna cum laude  Years later  Ballmer succeeded Gates as Microsoft s CEO and maintained that position from      until his resignation in                              
Gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems             presented in a combinatorics class by professor Harry Lewis  His solution held the record as the fastest version for over    years  and its successor is faster by only                 His solution was formalized and published in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou             
Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen and joined him at Honeywell during the summer of                   In       the MITS Altair      was released based on the Intel      CPU  and Gates and Allen saw the opportunity to start their own computer software company              Gates dropped out of Harvard that same year  His parents were supportive of him after seeing how much he wanted to start his own company              He explained his decision to leave Harvard   if things hadn t worked out  I could always go back to school  I was officially on leave

BASIC
MITS Altair      Computer with   inch           mm  floppy disk system whose first programming language was Microsoft s founding product  Altair BASIC
Gates read the January      issue of Popular Electronics which demonstrated the Altair       and contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems  MITS  to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform              In reality  Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it  they merely wanted to gauge MITS s interest  MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demonstration  and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer  and then the BASIC interpreter  The demonstration was held at MITS s offices in Albuquerque  New Mexico  it was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC  MITS hired Allen              and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with him at MITS in November       Allen named their partnership  Micro Soft   a combination of  microcomputer  and  software   and their first office was in Albuquerque  The first employee Gates and Allen hired was their high school collaborator Ric Weiland              They dropped the hyphen within a year and officially registered the trade name  Microsoft  with the Secretary of the State of New Mexico on November                       Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies 
Microsoft s Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists  but Gates discovered that a pre market copy had leaked out and was being widely copied and distributed  In February       he wrote An Open Letter to Hobbyists in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than     of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and the Altair  hobby market  was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce  distribute  and maintain high quality software              This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists  but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment  Microsoft became independent of MITS in late       and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems              The company moved from Albuquerque to Bellevue  Washington on January                     
Gates said he personally reviewed and often rewrote every line of code that the company produced in its first five years  As the company grew  he transitioned into a manager role  then an executive             

IBM partnership
IBM  the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time  approached Microsoft in July      concerning software for its upcoming personal computer  the IBM PC              after Gates s mother mentioned Microsoft to John Opel  IBM s then CEO             IBM first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter  IBM s representatives also mentioned that they needed an operating system  and Gates referred them to Digital Research  DRI   makers of the widely used CP M operating system              IBM s discussions with Digital Research went poorly and they did not reach a licensing agreement  IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and asked if Microsoft could provide an operating system  A few weeks later  Gates and Allen proposed using    DOS  an operating system similar to CP M  that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products  SCP  had made for hardware similar to the PC              Microsoft made a deal with SCP to be the exclusive licensing agent of    DOS  and later the full owner  Microsoft employed Paterson to adapt the operating system for the PC             and delivered it to IBM as PC DOS for a one time fee of                     
The contract itself only earned Microsoft a relatively small fee  It was the prestige brought to Microsoft by IBM s adoption of their operating system that would be the origin of Microsoft s transformation from a small business to the leading software company in the world  Gates had not offered to transfer the copyright on the operating system to IBM because he believed that other personal computer makers would clone IBM s PC hardware              They did  making the IBM compatible PC  running DOS  a de facto standard  The sales of MS DOS  the version of DOS sold to customers other than IBM  made Microsoft a major player in the industry              The press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the IBM PC  PC Magazine asked if Gates was  the man behind the machine               
Gates oversaw Microsoft s company restructuring on June           which re incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates the president and chairman of the board  with Paul Allen as vice president and vice chairman  In early       Allen left the company after receiving a Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis  effectively ending the formal business partnership between Gates and Allen  which had been strained months prior due to a contentious dispute over Microsoft equity                          Later in the decade  Gates repaired his relationship with Allen and together the two donated millions to their childhood school Lakeside             They remained friends until Allen s death in October                  

Windows
Microsoft and Gates launched their first retail version of Microsoft Windows on November           in an attempt to fend off competition from Apple s Macintosh GUI  which had captivated consumers with its simplicity and ease of use              In August       the company struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS    Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system  the partnership deteriorated due to mounting creative differences              The operating system grew out of DOS in an organic fashion over a decade until Windows     which hid the DOS prompt by default  Windows XP was released one year after Gates stepped down as Microsoft CEO              Windows     was the last version of the OS released before Gates left the chair of the firm to John W  Thompson on February                     

Management style
Gates delivers a speech at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland  January      
During Microsoft s early years  Gates was an active software developer  particularly in the company s programming language products  but his primary role in most of the company s history was as a manager and executive  He has not officially been on a development team since working on the TRS    Model                  but he wrote code that shipped with the company s products as late as                   Jerry Pournelle wrote in      when Gates announced Microsoft Excel   Bill Gates likes the program  not because it s going to make him a lot of money  although I m sure it will do that   but because it s a neat hack               During the late     s  he was criticized for his business tactics  which were considered anti competitive  This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings             
In June       Gates announced that he would transition out of his role at Microsoft to dedicate more time to philanthropy  He gradually divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed Ray Ozzie in charge of management and Craig Mundie in charge of long term product strategy              The process took two years to fully transfer his duties to Ozzie and Mundie  and was completed on June                      

Post Microsoft
Since leaving day to day operations at Microsoft  Gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects  He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February      to become technology advisor at the firm to support newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella                         
Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues in an interview that was published in the March      issue of Rolling Stone magazine  In the interview  he provided his perspective on climate change  his charitable activities  various tech companies and people involved in them  and the state of America  In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks    years into the future  Gates stated   there ll be some really bad things that ll happen in the next    or     years  but hopefully none of them on the scale of  say  a million people that you didn t expect to die from a pandemic  or nuclear or bioterrorism   Gates also identified innovation as the  real driver of progress  and pronounced that  America s way better today than it s ever been               Gates has often expressed concern about the potential harms of superintelligence  in a Reddit  ask me anything   he stated that 

First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent  That should be positive if we manage it well  A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern  I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don t understand why some people are not concerned                                                 
In an interview that was held at the TED conference in March       with Baidu co founder and CEO  Robin Li  Gates said he would  highly recommend  Nick Bostrom s recent work  Superintelligence  Paths  Dangers  Strategies              During the conference  Gates warned that the world was not prepared for the next pandemic  a situation that would come to pass in late      when the COVID    pandemic began              In March       Gates met at his home in Seattle with Mohammed bin Salman  the crown prince and de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia to discuss investment opportunities for Saudi Vision                               In June       Gates admitted that losing the mobile operating system race to Android was his biggest mistake  He stated that it was within their skill set of being the dominant player  but partially blames the antitrust litigation during the time              That same year  Gates became an advisory board member of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum             

Gates and UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron at COP   in Dubai on December        
In March       Microsoft announced Gates would be leaving his board positions at Berkshire Hathaway and Microsoft to dedicate himself to philanthropic endeavors such as climate change  global health and development  and education              The Wall Street Journal reported in May      that Gates stepped down before Microsoft s board finished its investigation into Gates s alleged inappropriate sexual relationship with a Microsoft employee  which an external law firm had begun probing in late                  
During the COVID    pandemic  Gates has widely been looked at by media outlets as an expert on the issue  despite him not being a public official or having any prior medical training              His foundation did  however  establish the COVID    Therapeutics Accelerator in      to hasten the development and evaluation of new and repurposed drugs and biologics to treat patients for COVID                 and  as of February       Gates expressed that he and Anthony Fauci frequently talk and collaborate on matters including vaccines and other medical innovations to fight the pandemic

Climate change and energy
With Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the COP   climate summit in Glasgow in November     
Gates considers climate change and global access to energy to be critical  interrelated issues  He has urged governments and the private sector to invest in research and development to make clean  reliable energy cheaper  Gates envisions that a breakthrough innovation in sustainable energy technology could drive down both greenhouse gas emissions and poverty  and bring economic benefits by stabilizing energy prices               In       he said   If you gave me the choice between picking the next    presidents or ensuring that energy is environmentally friendly and a quarter as costly  I d pick the energy thing               
In       he wrote about the challenge of transitioning the world s energy system from one based primarily on fossil fuels to one based on sustainable energy sources  Global energy transitions have historically taken decades  He wrote   I believe we can make this transition faster  both because the pace of innovation is accelerating  and because we have never had such an urgent reason to move from one source of energy to another                This rapid transition  according to Gates  would depend on increased government funding for basic research and financially risky private sector investment  to enable innovation in diverse areas such as nuclear energy  grid energy storage to facilitate greater use of solar and wind energy  and solar fuels              

The European Commission  European Investment Bank and Gates  Breakthrough Energy Catalyst agreed at the      UN Climate Change conference to work together to bring green technologies to market 
Gates spearheaded two initiatives that he announced at the      United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris  One was Mission Innovation  in which    national governments pledged to double their spending on research and development for carbon free energy in over five years  time               Another initiative was Breakthrough Energy  a group of investors who agreed to fund high risk startups in clean energy technologies  Gates  who had already invested    billion of his own money in innovative energy startups  committed a further    billion to Breakthrough Energy               In December       he called for the U S  federal government to create institutes for clean energy research  analogous to the National Institutes of Health               Gates has also urged rich nations to shift to      synthetic beef industries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from food production              
Gates has been criticized for holding a large stake in Signature Aviation  a company that services emissions intensive private jets               In       he began to divest from fossil fuels  He does not expect divestment itself to have much practical impact  but says that if his efforts to provide alternatives were to fail  he would not want to personally benefit from an increase in fossil fuel stock prices               After he published his book How to Avoid a Climate Disaster  parts of the climate activist community criticized Gates s approach as technological solutionism               In       educational streamer Wondrium produced the series  Solving for Zero  The Search for Climate Innovation  inspired by the book              
In June       Gates s company TerraPower and Warren Buffett s PacifiCorp announced the first sodium nuclear reactor in Wyoming  Wyoming Governor Mike Gordon hailed the project as a step toward carbon negative nuclear power  Wyoming Senator John Barrasso also said that it could boost the state s once active uranium mining industry              
Gates supported the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of       He tried to convince Joe Manchin to support a climate bill starting in       and especially in the months leading up to the adoption of the bill  The bill aimed to cut the global greenhouse gas emissions in a level similar to  eliminating the annual planet warming pollution of France and Germany combined  and may help to limit the warming of the planet to     degrees   the target of the Paris Agreement               He thanked both Joe Manchin and Chuck Schumer for their efforts in a guest essay in The New York Times  where he said  Inflation Reduction Act of      may be the single most important piece of climate legislation in American history  given its potential to spur development of new technologies               Gates gave further insights on climate change in his commencement address at Northern Arizona University on May          where he was bestowed an honorary doctorate              

Political positions
In October       The New York Times reported Gates had recently donated     million to Future Forward USA Action  a     c     organization supporting Kamala Harris s      presidential campaign  In response to the report  he did not explicitly address the donation or endorse Harris  but said  this election is different               

Regulation of the software industry

In       Gates rejected the need for regulation of the software industry in testimony before the United States Senate               During the Federal Trade Commission s  FTC  investigation of Microsoft in the     s  Gates was reportedly upset at then Commissioner Dennis Yao for  float ing  a line of hypothetical questions suggesting possible curbs on Microsoft s growing monopoly power   According to one source 

Gates was vexed   He started by calling Yao s ideas socialistic   recalls a source familiar with the July    meeting   and as he got angrier and angrier and louder and louder  he got into calling them Communistic               
Donald Trump Facebook ban
After Facebook and Twitter had banned Donald Trump from their platforms on February           as a result of the      United States presidential election which led to the January   United States Capitol attack  Gates said a permanent ban of Trump  would be a shame  and would be an  extreme measure   He warned that it would cause  polarization  if users with different political views divide up among various social networks  and said   I don t think banning somebody who actually did get a fair number of votes  in the presidential election    well less than a majority   but I don t think having him off forever would be that good               

Patents for COVID    vaccines
Main article  TRIPS Agreement waiver
In April       during the COVID    pandemic  Gates was criticized for suggesting that pharmaceutical companies should hold onto patents for COVID    vaccines  The criticism came due to the possibility of this preventing poorer nations from obtaining adequate vaccines  Tara Van Ho of the University of Essex stated   Gates speaks as if all the lives being lost in India are inevitable but eventually the West will help when in reality the US  amp  UK are holding their feet on the neck of developing states by refusing to break  intellectual property rights  protections  It s disgusting               
Gates is opposed to the TRIPS waiver                                         Bloomberg News reported him as saying he argued that Oxford University should not give away the rights to its COVID    information  as it had announced  but instead sell it to a single industry partner  as it did               His views on the value of legal monopolies in medicine have been linked to his views on legal monopolies in software                           

Cryptocurrencies
Gates has been critical of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin  According to him  cryptocurrencies provide no  valuable output   contribute nothing to society  and pose a danger especially for smaller investors who could not survive the potentially high losses  Gates also does not own any cryptocurrencies himself

Gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of David Rockefeller as a major influence  He and his father met with Rockefeller several times  and their charity work is partly modeled on the Rockefeller family s philanthropic focus  whereby they are interested in tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations              
The foundation is organized into five program areas  Global Development Division  Global Health Division  United States Division  and Global Policy  amp  Advocacy Division  Among others  it supports a wide range of public health projects  granting aid to fight transmissible diseases such AIDS  tuberculosis and malaria  as well as widespread vaccine programs to eradicate polio  It grants funds to learning institutes and libraries and supports scholarships at universities  The foundation established a water  sanitation and hygiene program to provide sustainable sanitation services in poor countries               Its agriculture division supports the International Rice Research Institute in developing Golden Rice  a genetically modified rice variant used to combat vitamin A deficiency               The foundation aims to provide women and girls in the developing world with information and support regarding contraception and  ultimately  universal access to consensual family planning               In       the Los Angeles Times criticized the foundation for investing its assets in companies that have been accused of worsening poverty  pollution and pharmaceutical firms that do not sell to developing countries               Although the foundation announced a review of its investments to assess social responsibility               it was subsequently canceled and upheld its policy of investing for maximum return  while using voting rights to influence company practices

Governments are there to think ahead to bad things that might happen  In the case of  the COVID     pandemic  not enough was done  We can t forget that another pandemic will come and we ll need to invest in being ready in that           while not forgetting that we were not prepared and we re going to have to invest   just like having a fire department   some money in an intelligent way and actually simulate what might happen and make sure that we re ready for it              
Gates favors the normalization of COVID    masks  In a November      interview  he said   What are these  like  nudists  I mean  you know  we ask you to wear pants  and no American says  or very few Americans say  that that s  like  some terrible thing

Public image
Gates with U S  Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis  February     
Gates s public image has changed over the years  At first he was perceived as a brilliant but ruthless  robber baron   a  nerd turned tycoon                Starting in      with the foundation of the Bill  amp  Melinda Gates Foundation  and particularly after he stepped down as head of Microsoft  he turned his attention to philanthropy  spending more than     billion on causes like health  poverty  and education  His image morphed from  tyrannical technocrat to saintly savior  to a  huggable billionaire techno philanthropist   celebrated on magazine covers and sought after for his opinions on major issues like global health and climate change               Still another shift in public opinion came in      with the announcement that he and Melinda were divorcing  Coverage of that proceeding brought out information about romantic pursuits of women who worked for him  a long term extra marital affair  and a friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein               This information and his response to the COVID    pandemic resulted in some deterioration of his public image  going from  a lovable nerd who was out to save the world  to  a tech supervillain who wants to protect profits over public health               
Investigative journalist Tim Schwab has accused Gates of using his contributions to the media to shape their coverage of him in order to protect his public image                           In September       Politico published an expos  critical of NGO leadership at the helm of the worldwide COVID    pandemic response  written in cooperation with the German newspaper Die Welt  Criticisms included the interconnectivity of the non profits with Gates  as well as his personal lack of formal credentials in medicine              
Gates and the projects of his foundation have been the subject of many conspiracy theories that proliferate on Facebook and elsewhere  He has been implausibly accused of attempting to depopulate the world  distributing harmful or unethical vaccines  and implanting people with privacy violating microchips  These unfounded theories reached a new level of influence during the COVID    pandemic when  according to New York Times journalist Rory Smith  the uncertainties of pandemic life drove people to seek explanations from the Internet                            When asked about the theories  Gates has remarked that some people are tempted by the  simple explanation  that an evil person rather than biological factors are to blame  and that he does not know for what purpose anyone believes he would want to track them with microchips                           

Religious views
In an interview with Rolling Stone  Gates said in regard to his faith   The moral systems of religion  I think  are super important  We ve raised our kids in a religious way  they ve gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in  I ve been very lucky  and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world  And that s kind of a religious belief  I mean  it s at least a moral belief                In the same      interview he also said   I agree with people like Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths  Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that  we sought false explanations for them  Now science has filled in some of the realm        not all        that religion used to fill  But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing  and there s no scientific explanation of how it came about  To say that it was generated by random numbers  that does seem  you know  sort of an uncharitable view  laughs   I think it makes sense to believe in God  but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it  I don t know               

Wealth
In       Gates was listed as a billionaire in Forbes magazine s first ever America s richest issue  he was the world s youngest ever self made billionaire  with a net worth of            billion  Since then  he has been featured on The World s Billionaires list and was ranked as the richest person in                        and       maintaining the position until       when Jeff Bezos surpassed his wealth  Gates was ranked first on the Forbes     list of wealthiest Americans from      to       in       and from      to                                 According to Forbes  as of February           Gates  estimated net worth stood at US       billion  making him the   th richest individual in the world              
Gates s wealth briefly surpassed US     billion in       making him the first person to reach this net worth                            After       the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings declined  partly because of the decline in Microsoft s stock price after the dot com bubble burst  and partly because of the multi billion dollar donations he had made to his charitable foundations  In May       Gates remarked that he wished that he was not the richest man in the world  because he disliked the attention that it brought               In March       Gates was the second wealthiest person after Carlos Slim  but regained the top position in       according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index                            Slim regained the position again in June                                 but then lost the top position back to Gates   Between      and       his wealth doubled from US         billion to US         billion               In October       Gates was surpassed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as the richest person in the world               In the Forbes     list of wealthiest Americans in       he was ranked sixth with a wealth of             billion               He once again became the richest person in the world in November      after a     increase in Microsoft shares  surpassing Bezos               Gates told the BBC   I ve paid more tax than any individual ever  and gladly so          I ve paid over    billion in taxes                He is a proponent of higher taxes  particularly for the rich              
Gates has several investments outside Microsoft  which in      paid him a salary of US         and a bonus of US          for a total of US                       In       he founded Corbis  a digital imaging company  In       he became a board member of Berkshire Hathaway  the investment company headed by long time friend Warren Buffett              

Controversies
Antitrust litigation
Further information  United States Microsoft antitrust case and European Union Microsoft competition case
Gates giving his deposition at Microsoft on August         
During his tenure as CEO of Microsoft  Gates approved of many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over Microsoft s business practices  In the      United States v  Microsoft case  Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive  He argued with examiner David Boies over the contextual meaning of words such as  compete    concerned   and  we   Later in the year  when portions of the videotaped deposition were played back in court  the judge was seen laughing and shaking his head               BusinessWeek reported 

Early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying  I don t recall  so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle  Worse  many of the technology chief s denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e mail that Gates both sent and received              
Gates later said that he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions   Did I fence with Boies           I plead guilty          rudeness to Boies in the first degree                Despite Gates s denials  the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed monopolization  tying and blocking competition  each in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act              

Treatment of colleagues and employees
Gates had primary responsibility for Microsoft s product strategy from the company s founding in      until       He gained a reputation for being distant from others  an industry executive complained in      that  Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls                An Atari executive recalled that he showed Gates a game and defeated him    of    times  When they met again a month later  Gates  won or tied every game  He had studied the game until he solved it  That is a competitor               
In the early     s  while business partner Paul Allen was undergoing treatments for cancer  Gates according to Allen conspired to reduce Allen s share in Microsoft by issuing himself stock options                                         In his autobiography  Allen would later recall that Gates was  scheming to rip me off  It was mercenary opportunism plain and simple                Gates says he remembers the episode differently               Allen would also recall that Gates was prone to shouting episodes              
Gates has often been accused of bullying Microsoft employees               He met regularly with Microsoft s senior managers and program managers  and the managers described him as being verbally combative  berating them for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company s long term interests at risk                            Gates saw competition in personal terms  when Borland s Turbo Pascal performed better than Microsoft s own tools  he yelled at programming director Greg Whitten  for half an hour  because  Gates believed  Borland s Philippe Kahn had surpassed Gates               Gates interrupted presentations with such comments as  that s the stupidest thing I ve ever heard               and  why don t you just give up your options and join the Peace Corps                The target of his outburst would then have to defend the proposal in detail until Gates was fully convinced               Not all harsh language was criticism  a manager recalled that  You re full of shit  That s the stupidest fucking thing I ve ever heard  meant that Gates was amazed   In the lore of Microsoft  if Bill says that to you  you re made                When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating  he was known to remark sarcastically   I ll do it over the weekend                                        

Relationship with Jeffrey Epstein
A      New York Times article reported that Gates s relationship with financier Jeffrey Epstein started in       just a few years after Epstein was convicted for procuring a child for prostitution  and continued for some years  including a visit to Epstein s house with his wife in the fall of       despite her declared discomfort               Gates said in      about Epstein   His lifestyle is very different and kind of intriguing although it would not work for me               
The depth of the friendship between Gates and Epstein is unclear though Gates generally commented that  I met him  I didn t have any business relationship or friendship with him                However  Gates visited Epstein  many times  despite  Epstein s  past                It was reported that Epstein and Gates  discussed the Gates Foundation and philanthropy                However  in an interview in      Gates completely denied any connection between Epstein and the Gates Foundation or his philanthropy generally               In August       Gates said the reason he had meetings with Epstein was because Gates hoped Epstein could provide money for philanthropic work  though nothing came of the idea  Gates added   It was a huge mistake to spend time with him  to give him the credibility of being there                Gates came under further scrutiny after it was revealed that he had travelled on Epstein s private jet  though further claims about Gates travelling to Little St James proved unsubstantiated              
It has also been reported that Epstein and Gates met with Nobel Committee chair Thorbj rn Jagland at his residence in Strasbourg  France  in March      to discuss the Nobel Prize               Also in attendance were representatives of the International Peace Institute which has received millions in grants from the Gates Foundation  including a      million  community engagement  grant in October                    In       it was reported that Epstein threatened to expose an alleged affair Gates had with a Russian bridge player
