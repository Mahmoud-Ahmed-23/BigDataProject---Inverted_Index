A ruler  sometimes called a rule  scale or a line gauge or metre meter stick  is an instrument used to make length measurements  whereby a length is read from a series of markings called  rules  along an edge of the device             Usually  the instrument is rigid and the edge itself is a straightedge   ruled straightedge    which additionally allows one to draw straighter lines 


Variants edit 
Rulers have long been made from different materials and in multiple sizes  Historically  they were mainly wood but plastics have also been used  They can be created with length markings instead of being scribed  Metal is also used for more durable rulers for use in the workshop  sometimes a metal edge is embedded into a wooden desk ruler to preserve the edge when used for straight line cutting          in or         cm in length  although some can go up to    cm  it is useful for a ruler to be kept on a desk to help in drawing  Shorter rulers are convenient for keeping in a pocket             Longer rulers  e g           cm          in   are necessary in some cases  Rigid wooden or plastic yardsticks         yard long  and meter sticks         meter long  are also used  Classically  long measuring rods were used for larger projects  now superseded by the tape measure  the surveyor s wheel or laser rangefinders 

Use in geometry edit 
Main article  Compass and straightedge
In geometry  straight lines between points may be drawn using a straightedge  ruler without any markings on it   Furthermore  it is also used to draw accurate graphs and tables 
A ruler and compass construction is a construction that uses a ruler and a compass  It is possible to bisect an angle into two equal parts with a ruler and compass  It can be proven  though  that it is impossible to divide an angle into three equal parts using only a compass and straightedge        the problem of angle trisection  However  if two marks be allowed on the ruler  the problem becomes solvable 

History edit 
The Nippur cubit rod  c             BC  in the Archeological Museum of Istanbul  Turkey

In the history of measurement many distance units have been used which were based on human body parts such as the cubit  hand and foot and these units varied in length by era and location             In the late   th century the metric system came into use and has been adopted to varying degrees in almost all countries in the world  
The oldest preserved measuring rod is a copper alloy bar that dates from c            BC and was found by the German Assyriologist Eckhard Unger while excavating at the Sumerian city of Nippur  present day Iraq   
Rulers made of ivory were in use by the Indus Valley civilization period prior to           BC             Excavations at Lothal            BC  have yielded one such ruler calibrated to about     millimetres                  in              Ian Whitelaw holds that the Mohenjo Daro ruler is divided into units corresponding to      millimetres            in  and these are marked out in decimal subdivisions with amazing accuracy  to within      millimetres             in   Ancient bricks found throughout the region have dimensions that correspond to these units            
Anton Ullrich invented the folding ruler in       Frank Hunt later made the flexible ruler in                 

Curved and flexible rulers edit 
The equivalent of a ruler for drawing or reproducing a smooth curve  where it takes the form of a rigid template  is known as a French curve  A flexible device that can be bent to the desired shape is known as a flat spline  or  in its more modern incarnation  a flexible curve  Historically  a flexible lead rule used by masons that could be bent to the curves of a molding was known as a lesbian rule            

Philosophy edit 
Ludwig Wittgenstein famously used rulers as an example in his discussion of language games in the Philosophical Investigations          He pointed out that the standard meter bar in Paris was the criterion against which all other rulers were determined to be one meter long  However  there was no analytical way to demonstrate that the standard meter bar itself was one meter long  It could only be asserted as one meter as part of a language game
