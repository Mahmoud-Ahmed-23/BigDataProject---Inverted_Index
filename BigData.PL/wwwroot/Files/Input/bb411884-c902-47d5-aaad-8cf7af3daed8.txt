							CAIRO  Egypt warned the five permanent members of the UN Security Council on Thursday not to threaten Sudan with fresh sanctions over Darfur  calling instead for confidence building measures and dialogue 
Egypt made the call a day after the United States and Britain  cranking up pressure on Khartoum  threatened sanctions and other punitive measures unless Sudan agrees to a robust UN peacekeeping force in war torn Darfur 
Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit said he sent the warning in a series of  urgent messages  to the foreign ministers of the United States  Britain  France  China and Russia 
 The messages that were sent stressed the need for confidence building and strengthening contacts and dialogue with the Sudanese government rather than threatening to impose sanctions   Aboul Gheit said in a statement 
Egypt is Sudan s northern neighbor and has longstanding cultural and political ties with Sudan  
The United Nations says at least         people have been killed and     million displaced since violence flared in Darfur in      in ethnic and political conflict  The violence has since spilled over to neighboring Chad and Central African Republic  
Sudan agreed on Monday to an interim support package in which       UN personnel and heavy support equipment including six attack helicopters would reinforce a       strong African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur 
But Sudan has refused to admit a larger  hybrid  force of more than        UN and African Union troops and police that Western powers say is needed to stem the violence 
Aboul Gheit said   It would have been expected and logical for the international community to greet Sudan s agreement to the light and heavy support package         with a welcome and encouragement instead of a threat and pressure  
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said talks would begin on Thursday on a new Security Council resolution on Darfur        Among new UN sanctions under consideration are an arms embargo  monitoring flights at Sudanese airports and adding names to a list of government  rebel and militia leaders subject to financial and travel bans 
UN ambassadors from Russia and China have said they do not believe the time for sanctions is right
