Bioterrorism is terrorism involving the intentional release or dissemination of biological agents             These agents include bacteria  viruses  insects  fungi  and or their toxins  and may be in a naturally occurring or a human modified form  in much the same way as in biological warfare                        Further  modern agribusiness is vulnerable to anti agricultural attacks by terrorists  and such attacks can seriously damage economy as well as consumer confidence             The latter destructive activity is called agrobioterrorism and is a subtype of agro terrorism

 Bioterrorism is the deliberate release of viruses  bacteria  toxins or other harmful agents to cause illness or death in people  animals or plants  
Interpol           


 A biological attack  or bioterrorism  is the intentional release of viruses  bacteria  or other germs that can sicken or kill people  livestock  or crops  
CDC           


 Violent action using living matter  such as bacteria  to harm or kill people for political reasons 
Cambridge Dictionary           

Bioterrorism agents are typically found in nature  but could be mutated or altered to increase their ability to cause disease  make them resistant to current medicines  or to increase their ability to be spread into the environment  Biological agents can be spread through the air  water  or in food  Biological agents are attractive to terrorists because they are extremely difficult to detect and do not cause illness for several hours to several days  Some bioterrorism agents  like the smallpox virus  can be spread from person to person and some  like anthrax  cannot                        
Bioterrorism may be favored because biological agents are relatively easy and inexpensive to obtain  can be easily disseminated  and can cause widespread fear and panic beyond the actual physical damage             Military leaders  however  have learned that  as a military asset  bioterrorism has some important limitations  it is difficult to use a bioweapon in a way that only affects the enemy and not friendly forces  A biological weapon is useful to terrorists mainly as a method of creating mass panic and disruption to a state or a country  However  technologists such as Bill Joy have warned of the potential power which genetic engineering might place in the hands of future bio terrorists             
The use of agents that do not cause harm to humans  but disrupt the economy  have also been discussed              One such pathogen is the foot and mouth disease  FMD  virus  which is capable of causing widespread economic damage and public concern  as witnessed in the      and      FMD outbreaks in the UK   while having almost no capacity to infect humans 

History edit 
See also  History of biological warfare and List of bioterrorist incidents
By the time World War I began  attempts to use anthrax were directed at animal populations  This generally proved to be ineffective 
Shortly after the start of World War I  Germany launched a biological sabotage campaign in the United States  Russia  Romania  and France              At that time  Anton Dilger lived in Germany  but in      he was sent to the United States carrying cultures of glanders  a virulent disease of horses and mules  Dilger set up a laboratory in his home in Chevy Chase  Maryland  He used stevedores working the docks in Baltimore to infect horses with glanders while they were waiting to be shipped to Britain  Dilger was under suspicion as being a German agent  but was never arrested  Dilger eventually fled to Madrid  Spain  where he died during the Influenza Pandemic of                   In       the Russians arrested a German agent with similar intentions  Germany and its allies infected French cavalry horses and many of Russia s mules and horses on the Eastern Front  These actions hindered artillery and troop movements  as well as supply convoys             
In       police in Chicago arrested two college students  Allen Schwander and Stephen Pera  who had planned to poison the city s water supply with typhoid and other bacteria  Schwander had founded a terrorist group   R I S E    while Pera collected and grew cultures from the hospital where he worked  The two men fled to Cuba after being released on bail  Schwander died of natural causes in       while Pera returned to the U S  in      and was put on probation             
In       anthrax spores killed around    people after the spores were unintentionally released from a military lab near Sverdlovsk  Russia  This occurrence of inhalational anthrax had provided a majority of the knowledge scientists understand about clinical anthrax  Soviet officials and physicians claimed the epidemic was produced by the consumption of infected game meat  but further investigation proves the source of infection were the inhaled spores  There is continued discussion about the intentionality of the epidemic and some speculate it was calculated by the Soviet government                 
In       the World Health Organization  WHO  announced the eradication of smallpox  a highly contagious and incurable disease  Although the disease has been eliminated in the wild  frozen stocks of smallpox virus are still maintained by the governments of the United States and Russia  Disastrous consequences are feared if rogue politicians or terrorists were to get hold of the smallpox strains              Since vaccination programs are now terminated  the world population is more susceptible to smallpox than ever before 
In Oregon in       followers of the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh attempted to control a local election by incapacitating the local population  They infected salad bars in    restaurants  produce in grocery stores  doorknobs  and other public domains with Salmonella typhimurium bacteria in the city of The Dalles  Oregon  The attack infected     people with severe food poisoning and hospitalized    of them  There were no fatalities  This incident was the first known bioterrorist attack in the United States in the   th century              It was also the single largest bioterrorism attack on U S  soil             
In June       the religious group Aum Shinrikyo released anthrax in Tokyo  Eyewitnesses reported a foul odor  The attack was a failure  because it did not infect a single person  The reason for this is due to the fact that the group used the vaccine strain of the bacterium  The spores which were recovered from the site of the attack showed that they were identical to an anthrax vaccine strain that was given to animals at the time  These vaccine strains are missing the genes that cause a symptomatic response             
In September and October       several cases of anthrax broke out in the United States  apparently deliberately caused  Letters laced with infectious anthrax were concurrently delivered to news media offices and the U S  Congress  The letters killed five people             

Scenarios edit 
There are multiple considerable scenarios  how terrorists might employ biological agents             In       tests conducted by various US agencies showed that indoor attacks in densely populated spaces are much more serious than outdoor attacks  Such enclosed spaces are large buildings  trains  indoor arenas  theaters  malls  tunnels and similar  Contra measures against such scenarios are building architecture and ventilation systems engineering  In       sewage was spilled out into a river  subsequently drawn into the water system and affected         people in Milwaukee  Wisconsin              The disease causing organism was cryptosporidium parvum  This man made disaster can be a template for a terrorist scenario             Nevertheless  terrorist scenarios are considered more likely near the points of delivery than at the water sources before the water treatment             Release of biological agents is more likely for a single building or a neighborhood  Counter measures against this scenario include the further limitation of access to the water supply systems  tunnels  and infrastructure  Agricultural crop duster flights might be misused as delivery devices for biological agents as well             Counter measures against this scenario are background checks of employees of crop dusting companies and surveillance procedures 
In the most common hoax scenario  no biological agents are employed              For instance  an envelope with powder in it that says   You ve just been exposed to anthrax   Such hoaxes have been shown to have a large psychological impact on the population             
Anti agriculture attacks are considered to require relatively little expertise and technology              Biological agents that attack livestock  fish  vegetation  and crops are mostly not contagious to humans and are therefore easier for attackers to handle  Even a few cases of infection can disrupt a country s agricultural production and exports for months  as evidenced by FMD outbreaks

Under current United States law  bio agents which have been declared by the U S  Department of Health and Human Services or the U S  Department of Agriculture to have the  potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety  are officially defined as  select agents   The CDC categorizes these agents  A  B or C  and administers the Select Agent Program  which regulates the laboratories which may possess  use  or transfer select agents within the United States  As with US attempts to categorize harmful recreational drugs  designer viruses are not yet categorized and avian H N  has been shown to achieve high mortality and human communication in a laboratory setting 

Category A edit 
These high priority agents pose a risk to national security  can be easily transmitted and disseminated  result in high mortality  have potential major public health impact  may cause public panic  or require special action for public health preparedness 

SARS and COVID     though not as lethal as other diseases  was concerning to scientists                         and policymakers for its social and economic disruption potential              After the global containment of the pandemic  the United States President George W  Bush stated     A global influenza pandemic that infects millions and lasts from one to three years could be far worse              
Tularemia or  rabbit fever               Tularemia has a very low fatality rate if treated  but can severely incapacitate  The disease is caused by the Francisella tularensis bacterium  and can be contracted through contact with fur  inhalation  ingestion of contaminated water or insect bites  Francisella tularensis is very infectious  A small number of organisms        or so  can cause disease  If F  tularensis were used as a weapon  the bacteria would likely be made airborne for exposure by inhalation  People who inhale an infectious aerosol would generally experience severe respiratory illness  including life threatening pneumonia and systemic infection  if they are not treated  The bacteria that cause tularemia occur widely in nature and could be isolated and grown in quantity in a laboratory  although manufacturing an effective aerosol weapon would require considerable sophistication             
Anthrax  Anthrax is a non contagious disease caused by the spore forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis  The ability of Anthrax to produce within small spores  or bacilli bacterium  makes it readily permeable to porous skin and can cause abrupt symptoms within    hours of exposure  The dispersal of this pathogen among densely populated areas is said to carry less than one percent mortality rate  for cutaneous exposure  to a ninety percent or higher mortality for untreated inhalational infections              An anthrax vaccine does exist but requires many injections for stable use  When discovered early  anthrax can be cured by administering antibiotics  such as ciprofloxacin               Its first modern incidence in biological warfare were when Scandinavian  freedom fighters  supplied by the German General Staff used anthrax with unknown results against the Imperial Russian Army in Finland in                   In       the Aum Shinrikyo used anthrax in an unsuccessful attempt in Tokyo with zero fatalities              Anthrax was used in a series of attacks by a microbiologist at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infection Disease on the offices of several United States senators in late       The anthrax was in a powder form and it was delivered by the mail              This bioterrorist attack inevitably prompted seven cases of cutaneous anthrax and eleven cases of inhalation anthrax  with five leading to deaths  Additionally  an estimated    to    cases had prevented fatality through treatment supplied to over        individuals              Anthrax is one of the few biological agents that federal employees have been vaccinated for  In the US an anthrax vaccine  Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed  AVA  exists and requires five injections for stable use  Other anthrax vaccines also exist  The strain used in the      anthrax attacks was identical to the strain used by the USAMRIID             
Smallpox              Smallpox is a highly contagious virus  It is transmitted easily through the atmosphere and has a high mortality rate           Smallpox was eradicated in the world in the     s  thanks to a worldwide vaccination program              However  some virus samples are still available in Russian and American laboratories  Some believe that after the collapse of the Soviet Union  cultures of smallpox have become available in other countries  Although people born pre      will have been vaccinated for smallpox under the WHO program  the effectiveness of vaccination is limited since the vaccine provides high level of immunity for only   to   years  Revaccination s protection lasts longer              As a biological weapon smallpox is dangerous because of the highly contagious nature of both the infected and their pox  Also  the infrequency with which vaccines are administered among the general population since the eradication of the disease would leave most people unprotected in the event of an outbreak  Smallpox occurs only in humans  and has no external hosts or vectors 
Botulinum toxin              The neurotoxin             Botulinum is the deadliest toxin known to man  and is produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum  Botulism causes death by respiratory failure and paralysis              Furthermore  the toxin is readily available worldwide due to its cosmetic applications in injections 
Bubonic plague              Plague is a disease caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium  Rodents are the normal host of plague  and the disease is transmitted to humans by flea bites and occasionally by aerosol in the form of pneumonic plague              The disease has a history of use in biological warfare dating back many centuries  and is considered a threat due to its ease of culture and ability to remain in circulation among local rodents for a long period of time  The weaponized threat comes mainly in the form of pneumonic plague  infection by inhalation              It was the disease that caused the Black Death in medieval Europe 
Viral hemorrhagic fevers              This includes hemorrhagic fevers caused by members of the family Filoviridae  Marburg virus and Ebola virus   and by the family Arenaviridae  for example Lassa virus and Machupo virus   Ebola virus disease  in particular  has caused high fatality rates ranging from    to     with a     average  No cure currently exists  although vaccines are in development  The Soviet Union investigated the use of filoviruses for biological warfare  and the Aum Shinrikyo group unsuccessfully attempted to obtain cultures of Ebola virus              Death from Ebola virus disease is commonly due to multiple organ failure and hypovolemic shock  Marburg virus was first discovered in Marburg  Germany  No treatments currently exist aside from supportive care  The arenaviruses have a somewhat reduced case fatality rate compared to disease caused by filoviruses  but are more widely distributed  chiefly in central Africa and South America 
Category B edit 
Category B agents are moderately easy to disseminate and have low mortality rates 

Brucellosis  Brucella species             
Epsilon toxin of Clostridium perfringens
Food safety threats  for example  Salmonella species  E coli O    H   Shigella  Staphylococcus aureus 
Glanders              Burkholderia mallei 
Melioidosis  Burkholderia pseudomallei                         
Psittacosis  Chlamydia psittaci 
Q fever  Coxiella burnetii             
Ricin             toxin from Ricinus communis  castor beans 
Abrin toxin from Abrus precatorius  Rosary peas 
Staphylococcal enterotoxin B
Typhus  Rickettsia prowazekii 
Viral encephalitis  alphaviruses  for example   Venezuelan equine encephalitis  eastern equine encephalitis  western equine encephalitis 
Water supply threats  for example  Vibrio cholerae              Cryptosporidium parvum 
Category C edit 
Category C agents are emerging pathogens that might be engineered for mass dissemination because of their availability  ease of production and dissemination  high mortality rate  or ability to cause a major health impact

Planning may involve the development of biological identification systems  Until recently in the United States  most biological defense strategies have been geared to protecting soldiers on the battlefield rather than ordinary people in cities  Financial cutbacks have limited the tracking of disease outbreaks  Some outbreaks  such as food poisoning due to E  coli or Salmonella  could be of either natural or deliberate origin 
Global defense strategies have also been put into place including the introduction of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention in       A majority of countries across the globe participated in the conventions       but a handful chose not to take part in the defense  Many of the countries who opted out of the convention are located in the Middle East and former Soviet Union countries             

Preparedness edit 
Export controls on biological agents are not applied uniformly  providing terrorists a route for acquisition              Laboratories are working on advanced detection systems to provide early warning  identify contaminated areas and populations at risk  and to facilitate prompt treatment              Methods for predicting the use of biological agents in urban areas as well as assessing the area for the hazards associated with a biological attack are being established in major cities  In addition  forensic technologies are working on identifying biological agents  their geographical origins and or their initial source  Efforts include decontamination technologies to restore facilities without causing additional environmental concerns 
Early detection and rapid response to bioterrorism depend on close cooperation between public health authorities and law enforcement  however  such cooperation is lacking  National detection assets and vaccine stockpiles are not useful if local and state officials do not have access to them             
Aspects of protection against bioterrorism in the United States include 

Detection and resilience strategies in combating bioterrorism  This occurs primarily through the efforts of the Office of Health Affairs  OHA   a part of the Department of Homeland Security  DHS   whose role is to prepare for an emergency situation that impacts the health of the American populace  Detection has two primary technological factors  First there is OHA s BioWatch program in which collection devices are disseminated to thirty high risk areas throughout the country to detect the presence of aerosolized biological agents before symptoms present in patients              This is significant primarily because it allows a more proactive response to a disease outbreak rather than the more passive treatment of the past 
Implementation of the Generation   automated detection system  This advancement is significant simply because it enables action to be taken in four to six hours due to its automatic response system  whereas the previous system required aerosol detectors to be manually transported to laboratories              Resilience is a multifaceted issue as well  as addressed by OHA  One way in which this is ensured is through exercises that establish preparedness  programs like the Anthrax Response Exercise Series exist to ensure that  regardless of the incident  all emergency personnel will be aware of the role they must fill              Moreover  by providing information and education to public leaders  emergency medical services and all employees of the DHS  OHS suggests it can significantly decrease the impact of bioterrorism             
Enhancing the technological capabilities of first responders is accomplished through numerous strategies  The first of these strategies was developed by the Science and Technology Directorate  S amp T  of DHS to ensure that the danger of suspicious powders could be effectively assessed   as many dangerous biological agents such as anthrax exist as a white powder   By testing the accuracy and specificity of commercially available systems used by first responders  the hope is that all biologically harmful powders can be rendered ineffective             
Enhanced equipment for first responders  One recent advancement is the commercialization of a new form of Tyvex  armor which protects first responders and patients from chemical and biological contaminants  There has also been a new generation of Self Contained Breathing Apparatuses  SCBA  which has been recently made more robust against bioterrorism agents  All of these technologies combine to form what seems like a relatively strong deterrent to bioterrorism  However  New York City as an entity has numerous organizations and strategies that effectively serve to deter and respond to bioterrorism as it comes  From here the logical progression is into the realm of New York City s specific strategies to prevent bioterrorism             
Excelsior Challenge  In the second week of September       the state of New York held a large emergency response training exercise called the Excelsior Challenge  with over     emergency responders participating  According to WKTV   This is the fourth year of the Excelsior Challenge  a training exercise designed for police and first responders to become familiar with techniques and practices should a real incident occur               The event was held over three days and hosted by the State Preparedness Training Center in Oriskany  New York  Participants included bomb squads  canine handlers  tactical team officers and emergency medical services              In an interview with Homeland Preparedness News  Bob Stallman  assistant director at the New York State Preparedness Training Center  said   We re constantly seeing what s happening around the world and we tailor our training courses and events for those types of real world events   For the first time  the      training program implemented New York s new electronic system  The system  called NY Responds  electronically connects every county in New York to aid in disaster response and recovery  As a result   counties have access to a new technology known as Mutualink  which improves interoperability by integrating telephone  radio  video  and file sharing into one application to allow local emergency staff to share real time information with the state and other counties               The State Preparedness Training Center in Oriskany was designed by the State Division of Homeland Security  and Emergency Services  DHSES  in       It cost          million to construct on over      acres and is available for training     days a year              Students from SUNY Albany s College of Emergency Preparedness  Homeland Security and Cybersecurity  were able to participate in this year s exercise and learn how  DHSES supports law enforcement specialty teams              
Project BioShield  The accrual of vaccines and treatments for potential biological threats  also known as medical countermeasures has been an important aspect in preparing for a potential bioterrorist attack  this took the form of a program beginning in       referred to as Project BioShield              The significance of this program should not be overlooked as  there is currently enough smallpox vaccine to inoculate every United States citizen and a variety of therapeutic drugs to treat the infected               The Department of Defense also has a variety of laboratories currently working to increase the quantity and efficacy of countermeasures that comprise the national stockpile              Efforts have also been taken to ensure that these medical countermeasures can be disseminated effectively in the event of a bioterrorist attack  The National Association of Chain Drug Stores championed this cause by encouraging the participation of the private sector in improving the distribution of such countermeasures if required             
On a CNN news broadcast in       the CNN chief medical correspondent  Dr  Sanjay Gupta  weighed in on the American government s recent approach to bioterrorist threats  He explains how  even though the United States would be better fending off bioterrorist attacks now than they would be a decade ago  the amount of money available to fight bioterrorism over the last three years has begun to decrease  Looking at a detailed report that examined the funding decrease for bioterrorism in fifty one American cities  Dr  Gupta stated that the cities  wouldn t be able to distribute vaccines as well  and  wouldn t be able to track viruses   He also said that film portrayals of global pandemics  such as Contagion  were actually quite possible and may occur in the United States under the right conditions             
A news broadcast by MSNBC in      also stressed the low levels of bioterrorism preparedness in the United States   The broadcast stated that a bipartisan report gave the Obama administration a failing grade for its efforts to respond to a bioterrorist attack  The news broadcast invited the former New York City police commissioner  Howard Safir  to explain how the government would fare in combating such an attack  He said how  biological and chemical weapons are probable and relatively easy to disperse   Furthermore  Safir thought that efficiency in bioterrorism preparedness is not necessarily a question of money  but is instead dependent on putting resources in the right places  The broadcast suggested that the nation was not ready for something more serious             
In a September      interview conducted by Homeland Preparedness News  Daniel Gerstein  a senior policy researcher for the RAND Corporation  stresses the importance in preparing for potential bioterrorist attacks on the nation  He implored the U S  government to take the proper and necessary actions to implement a strategic plan of action to save as many lives as possible and to safeguard against potential chaos and confusion  He believes that because there have been no significant instances of bioterrorism since the anthrax attacks in       the government has allowed itself to become complacent making the country that much more vulnerable to unsuspecting attacks  thereby further endangering the lives of U S  citizens             
Gerstein formerly served in the Science and Technology Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security from      to       He claims there has not been a serious plan of action since      during George W  Bush s presidency  in which he issued a Homeland Security directive delegating responsibilities among various federal agencies  He also stated that the blatant mishandling of the Ebola virus outbreak in      attested to the government s lack of preparation  This past May  legislation that would create a national defense strategy was introduced in the Senate  coinciding with the timing of ISIS affiliated terrorist groups get closer to weaponizing biological agents  In May       Kenyan officials apprehended two members of an Islamic extremist group in motion to set off a biological bomb containing anthrax  Mohammed Abdi Ali  the believed leader of the group  who was a medical intern  was arrested along with his wife  a medical student  The two were caught just before carrying out their plan              The Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense  which comprises a group of experts on national security and government officials  in which Gerstein had previously testified to  submitted its National Blueprint for Biodefense to Congress in October      listing their recommendations for devising an effective plan             
Bill Gates said in a February          Business Insider op ed  published near the time of his Munich Security Conference speech  that it is possible for an airborne pathogen to kill at least         million people over the course of a year              In a New York Times report  the Gates Foundation predicted that a modern outbreak similar to the Spanish Influenza pandemic  which killed between         million and          million people  could end up killing more than          million people worldwide  even considering widespread availability of vaccines and other healthcare tools  The report cited increased globalization  rapid international air travel  and urbanization as increased reasons for concern              In a March          interview with CNBC  former U S  Senator Joe Lieberman  who was co chair of the bipartisan Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense  said a worldwide pandemic could end the lives of more people than a nuclear war  Lieberman also expressed worry that a terrorist group like ISIS could develop a synthetic influenza strain and introduce it to the world to kill civilians              In July       Robert C  Hutchinson  former agent at the Department of Homeland Security  called for a  whole of government  response to the next global health threat  which he described as including strict security procedures at our borders and proper execution of government preparedness plans             
Also  novel approaches in biotechnology  such as synthetic biology  could be used in the future to design new types of biological warfare agents                                      Special attention has to be laid on future experiments  of concern  that             

Would demonstrate how to render a vaccine ineffective 
Would confer resistance to therapeutically useful antibiotics or antiviral agents 
Would enhance the virulence of a pathogen or render a nonpathogen virulent 
Would increase transmissibility of a pathogen 
Would alter the host range of a pathogen 
Would enable the evasion of diagnostic detection tools 
Would enable the weaponization of a biological agent or toxin
Most of the biosecurity concerns in synthetic biology  however  are focused on the role of DNA synthesis and the risk of producing genetic material of lethal viruses  e g       Spanish flu  polio  in the lab                                      The CRISPR Cas system has emerged as a promising technique for gene editing  It was hailed by The Washington Post as  the most important innovation in the synthetic biology space in nearly    years               While other methods take months or years to edit gene sequences  CRISPR speeds that time up to weeks              However  due to its ease of use and accessibility  it has raised a number of ethical concerns  especially surrounding its use in the biohacking space

In       the University of Pittsburgh s Center for Biomedical Informatics deployed the first automated bioterrorism detection system  called RODS  Real Time Outbreak Disease Surveillance   RODS is designed to collect data from many data sources and use them to perform signal detection  that is  to detect a possible bioterrorism event at the earliest possible moment  RODS  and other systems like it  collect data from sources including clinic data  laboratory data  and data from over the counter drug sales                          In       Michael Wagner  the codirector of the RODS laboratory  and Ron Aryel  a subcontractor  conceived the idea of obtaining live data feeds from  non traditional   non health care  data sources  The RODS laboratory s first efforts eventually led to the establishment of the National Retail Data Monitor  a system which collects data from        retail locations nationwide             
On February          George W  Bush visited the RODS laboratory and used it as a model for a      million spending proposal to equip all    states with biosurveillance systems  In a speech delivered at the nearby Masonic temple  Bush compared the RODS system to a modern  DEW  line  referring to the Cold War ballistic missile early warning system              
The principles and practices of biosurveillance  a new interdisciplinary science  were defined and described in the Handbook of Biosurveillance  edited by Michael Wagner  Andrew Moore and Ron Aryel  and published in       Biosurveillance is the science of real time disease outbreak detection  Its principles apply to both natural and man made epidemics  bioterrorism  
Data which potentially could assist in early detection of a bioterrorism event include many categories of information  Health related data such as that from hospital computer systems  clinical laboratories  electronic health record systems  medical examiner record keeping systems      call center computers  and veterinary medical record systems could be of help  researchers are also considering the utility of data generated by ranching and feedlot operations  food processors  drinking water systems  school attendance recording  and physiologic monitors  among others             
In Europe  disease surveillance is beginning to be organized on the continent wide scale needed to track a biological emergency  The system not only monitors infected persons  but attempts to discern the origin of the outbreak 
Researchers have experimented with devices to detect the existence of a threat 

Tiny electronic chips that would contain living nerve cells to warn of the presence of bacterial toxins  identification of broad range toxins 
Fiber optic tubes lined with antibodies coupled to light emitting molecules  identification of specific pathogens  such as anthrax  botulinum  ricin 
Some research shows that ultraviolet avalanche photodiodes offer the high gain  reliability and robustness needed to detect anthrax and other bioterrorism agents in the air  The fabrication methods and device characteristics were described at the   th Electronic Materials Conference in Santa Barbara on June           Details of the photodiodes were also published in the February           issue of the journal Electronics Letters and the November      issue of the journal IEEE Photonics Technology Letters             
The United States Department of Defense conducts global biosurveillance through several programs  including the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System             
Another powerful tool developed within New York City for use in countering bioterrorism is the development of the New York City Syndromic Surveillance System  This system is essentially a way of tracking disease progression throughout New York City  and was developed by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene  NYC DOHMH  in the wake of the      attacks  The system works by tracking the symptoms of those taken into the emergency department based on the location of the hospital to which they are taken and their home address and assessing any patterns in symptoms  These established trends can then be observed by medical epidemiologists to determine if there are any disease outbreaks in any particular locales  maps of disease prevalence can then be created rather easily              This is an obviously beneficial tool in fighting bioterrorism as it provides a means through which such attacks could be discovered in their nascence  assuming bioterrorist attacks result in similar symptoms across the board  this strategy allows New York City to respond immediately to any bioterrorist threats that they may face with some level of alacrity 

Response to bioterrorism incident or threat edit 
The examples and perspective in this section deal primarily with the United States and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject  You may improve this section  discuss the issue on the talk page  or create a new section  as appropriate    June        Learn how and when to remove this message 
Government agencies which would be called on to respond to a bioterrorism incident would include law enforcement  hazardous materials and decontamination units  and emergency medical units  if available 
The US military has specialized units  which can respond to a bioterrorism event  among them are the United States Marine Corps  Chemical Biological Incident Response Force and the U S  Army s   th Support Command  CBRNE   which can detect  identify  and neutralize threats  and decontaminate victims exposed to bioterror agents  US response would include the Centers for Disease Control 
Historically  governments and authorities have relied on quarantines to protect their populations  International bodies such as the World Health Organization already devote some of their resources to monitoring epidemics and have served clearing house roles in historical epidemics 
Media attention toward the seriousness of biological attacks increased in      to       In July       Forbes published an article with the title  Bioterrorism  A Dirty Little Threat With Huge Potential Consequences               In November       Fox News reported on a new strain of botulism  saying that the Centers for Disease and Control lists botulism as one of two agents that have  the highest risks of mortality and morbidity   noting that there is no antidote for botulism              USA Today reported that the U S  military in November was trying to develop a vaccine for troops from the bacteria that cause the disease Q fever  an agent the military once used as a biological weapon              In February       the former special assistant and senior director for biodefense policy to President George W  Bush called the bioterrorism risk imminent and uncertain             and Congressman Bill Pascrell called for increasing federal measures against bioterrorism as a  matter of life or death               The New York Times wrote a story saying the United States would spend          million to help certain low and middle income countries deal with the threats of bioterrorism and infectious diseases             
Bioterrorism can additionally harm the psychological aspect of victims and the general public  Victims exposed to biological weapons have shown an increased presence of clinical anxiety compared to the normal population               
Bill Gates has warned that bioterrorism could kill more people than nuclear war             
In February       a CNN employee discovered on an airplane a  sensitive  top secret document in the seatback pouch explaining how the Department of Homeland Security would respond to a bioterrorism attack at the Super Bowl              

     U S  budget proposal affecting bioterrorism programs edit 
President Donald Trump promoted his first budget around keeping America safe  However  one aspect of defense would receive less money   protecting the nation from deadly pathogens  man made or natural   according to The New York Times  Agencies tasked with biosecurity get a decrease in funding under the Administration s budget proposal             
For example             

The Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response would be cut by           million  or     percent  The office tracks outbreaks of disease 
The National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases would be cut by          million  or    percent  The center is a branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that fights threats like anthrax and the Ebola virus  and additionally towards research on HIV AIDS vaccines 
Within the National Institutes of Health  the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  NIAID  would lose    percent of its budget  NIAID oversees responses to Zika  Ebola and HIV AIDS vaccine research 
 The next weapon of mass destruction may not be a bomb   Lawrence O  Gostin  the director of the World Health Organization s Collaborating Center on Public Health Law and Human Rights  told The New York Times   It may be a tiny pathogen that you can t see  smell or taste  and by the time we discover it  it ll be too late              

Lack of international standards on public health experiments edit 
Tom Inglesy  the CEO and director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health             and an internationally recognized expert on public health preparedness  pandemic and emerging infectious disease said in      that the lack of an internationally standardized approval process that could be used to guide countries in conducting public health experiments for resurrecting a disease that has already been eradicated increases the risk that the disease could be used in bioterrorism  This was in reference to the lab synthesis of horsepox in      by researchers at the University of Alberta  The researchers recreated horsepox  an extinct cousin of the smallpox virus              in order to research new ways to treat cancer
