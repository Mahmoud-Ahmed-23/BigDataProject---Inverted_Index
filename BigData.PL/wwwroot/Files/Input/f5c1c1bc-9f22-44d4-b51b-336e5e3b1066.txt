Development edit 
StarCraft II was announced on May           nearly a decade after the original  at the Blizzard Worldwide Invitational in Seoul  South Korea                        StarCraft II was being developed  under the codename Medusa              for concurrent release on Windows XP  Windows Vista and Mac OS X  Blizzard announced a release date for July                       Development on the game began in       shortly after Warcraft III  The Frozen Throne was released             

Music edit 
The soundtrack for StarCraft II was provided by Derek Duke  Glenn Stafford  Neal Acree  and Russell Brower             
Brower  Blizzard s Director of Audio  has suggested that the music of StarCraft serves two functions  the music heard during gameplay is designed to be unobtrusive in order to allow the player to focus  with only the music that attaches to the cinematic interludes permitted to become more distinctive              Brower has also pointed out that certain musical themes in StarCraft II become associated with certain characters              a technique borrowed from composers such as John Williams and Richard Wagner 
The original material for the Wings of Liberty soundtrack spans approximately four hours  Brower has said in interviews that his team was consciously seeking a film score feel for StarCraft II              In a short commentary provided for Blizzard  he recounted that the orchestral music for StarCraft II  Wings of Liberty was performed by    members of the San Francisco Symphony and Opera and recorded at the Skywalker stage at the Lucasfilm Ranch in Marin County  California  under the name  Skywalker Symphony Orchestra   conducted by E mear Noone  Brower also recalled the use of a    voice choir in Seattle  Washington  Both these recording sessions were mixed by John Kurlander  who had previously worked on Peter Jackson s The Lord of the Rings and The Beatles  Abbey Road              The Terran country and blues pieces were recorded at Dreamland studio in Woodstock  New York and performed by members of Peter Gabriel s band  including bassist Tony Levin and drummer Jerry Marotta  Remaining pieces were recorded at the Blizzard studios  performed by musicians such as Laurence Juber  formerly of Wings  and Tommy Morgan              The soundtrack also contains John Bacchus Dykes and William Whiting s hymn Eternal Father  Strong to Save                    
The orchestral music for Heart of the Swarm was likewise recorded in Marin County  again with the services of Kurlander and Noone  with    performers from the Skywalker Symphony Orchestra             
Brower stated in an interview in      that he intended to continue the process of associative musical themes in Legacy of the Void

Aside from the single player campaigns corresponding to the four expansions  StarCraft II features several multiplayer game modes  the most common of which are the  versus  modes and the  co op  mode 

Versus edit 
The versus mode can be  v    v    v    v   with the numbers indicating the number of players per team  The  v  mode is the most well known one  and the basis for the esport competition  see below   In it  the players collect experience points and achievements  but these do not affect future gameplay per se  The complexity of the game grows as the player progresses through the ranks  based on a matchmaking system that is based on the number of wins and losses  The so called  ladder   the ordering of all players  is organized per geographic region  and consists of tiers called leagues  ranging from the lowest bronze  through silver  gold  platinum  diamond  master and in turn the highest  grandmaster league 
As the number of players per team grows  the maps they can play on typically change as well  It is also possible to play multiplayer tournaments in each team size  where a team either wins or is eliminated  The versus mode also includes the  Archon  option  where the matches are ostensibly  v  but more than one human player control what is usually controlled by a single person 

Co op edit 
The co op mode involves two human players playing against an A I  using special hero characters  and where collecting XP leads to leveling up that in turn affects future gameplay  The heroes are modeled after the characters from the single player campaign  amended with extra abilities  This mode also features what is called  mutations   where the game parameters change in order to present a bigger challenge  There are    co op commanders in total to choose from  divided evenly between the three races    of each   The co op mode takes heroes from the main game storyline although not all heroes     heroes  are playable characters 

Professional competition edit 
Main article  StarCraft II in esports
Since its release  StarCraft II was played professionally throughout the world  though much like its predecessor StarCraft  Brood War s professional competition  the highest level of play has historically been centered in South Korea 
Since the release of StarCraft II  a number of tournaments have been hosted in Korea and elsewhere  such as the Global StarCraft II League  GSL              
The game was widely considered the largest esport in the world during its early years and has been credited as bringing esports to the rest of the world in the way the original brought it to South Korea              It has since experienced a decline and a more recent resurgence following its transition to a free to play business model                         
In       Blizzard started the StarCraft II World Championship Series  WCS  as the primary sanctioned StarCraft II tournament circuit              Since       both Korean individual leagues like the Global StarCraft II League  GSL  and non Korean events such as Intel Extreme Masters  IEM  and Dreamhack had been included in the WCS system  distributing points and guaranteeing spots that qualify players for the Global Finals  held annually at BlizzCon             
Since       Blizzard changed the format of WCS by entering into a three year partnership with esports organizers ESL and DreamHack             

Use in artificial intelligence edit 
In November      Alphabet s DeepMind branch announced a collaboration with Blizzard to create  a useful testing platform for the wider AI research community              
StarCraft II has been used in the field of multi agent reinforcement learning for a dual purpose 

A proof of concept to show that modern reinforcement learning algorithms can compete with professional human players  In December       DeepMind s StarCraft II bot  called AlphaStar  defeated professional StarCraft II players in the game for the first time              It beat the player MaNA      albeit under conditions some deemed to be unfair  A fairer version of AlphaStar attained Grandmaster status in August       an accomplishment called a  landmark achievement  for the field of artificial intelligence             
A benchmark to measure and improve the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms that are used for environments other than StarCraft
