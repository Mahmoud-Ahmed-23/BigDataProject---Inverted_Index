A collection of various classic video game consoles at a game show in     
A video game console is an electronic device that outputs a video signal or image to display a video game that can typically be played with a game controller  These may be home consoles  which are generally placed in a permanent location connected to a television or other display devices and controlled with a separate game controller  or handheld consoles  which include their own display unit and controller functions built into the unit and which can be played anywhere  Hybrid consoles combine elements of both home and handheld consoles 
Video game consoles are a specialized form of a home computer geared towards video game playing  designed with affordability and accessibility to the general public in mind  but lacking in raw computing power and customization  Simplicity is achieved in part through the use of game cartridges or other simplified methods of distribution  easing the effort of launching a game  However  this leads to ubiquitous proprietary formats that create competition for market share             More recent consoles have shown further confluence with home computers  making it easy for developers to release games on multiple platforms  Further  modern consoles can serve as replacements for media players with capabilities to play films and music from optical media or streaming media services 
Video game consoles are usually sold on a five seven year cycle called a generation  with consoles made with similar technical capabilities or made around the same time period grouped into one generation  The industry has developed a razor and blades model  manufacturers often sell consoles at low prices  sometimes at a loss  while primarily making a profit from the licensing fees for each game sold  Planned obsolescence then draws consumers into buying the next console generation  While numerous manufacturers have come and gone in the history of the console market  there have always been two or three dominant leaders in the market  with the current market led by Sony  with their PlayStation brand   Microsoft  with their Xbox brand   and Nintendo  currently producing the Switch console   Previous console developers include Sega  Atari  Coleco  Mattel  NEC  SNK  Magnavox  Philips and Panasonic 


History edit 
Main articles  History of video game consoles and Home video game console generations
The first video game consoles were produced in the early     s  Ralph H  Baer devised the concept of playing simple  spot based games on a television screen in       which later became the basis of the Magnavox Odyssey in       Inspired by the table tennis game on the Odyssey  Nolan Bushnell  Ted Dabney  and Allan Alcorn at Atari  Inc  developed the first successful arcade game  Pong  and looked to develop that into a home version  which was released in       The first consoles were capable of playing only a very limited number of games built into the hardware  Programmable consoles using swappable ROM cartridges were introduced with the Fairchild Channel F in       though popularized with the Atari      released in      
Handheld consoles emerged from technology improvements in handheld electronic games as these shifted from mechanical to electronic digital logic  and away from light emitting diode  LED  indicators to liquid crystal displays  LCD  that resembled video screens more closely  Early examples include the Microvision in      and Game  amp  Watch in       and the concept was fully realized by the Game Boy in      
Both home and handheld consoles have become more advanced following global changes in technology  These technological shifts include improved electronic and computer chip manufacturing to increase computational power at lower costs and size  the introduction of  D graphics and hardware based graphic processors for real time rendering  digital communications such as the Internet  wireless networking and Bluetooth  and larger and denser media formats as well as digital distribution 
Following the same type of Moore s law progression  home consoles are grouped into generations  each lasting approximately five years  Consoles within each generation share similar specifications and features  such as processor word size  While no one grouping of consoles by generation is universally accepted             one breakdown of generations  showing representative consoles  of each is shown below 



Overview of the console generations  including generation overlaps  Major consoles of each generation are given for each 
Form factor edit

Home video game console edit 
Home video game consoles are meant to be connected to a television or other type of monitor  with power supplied through an outlet  This requires the unit to be used in a fixed location  typically at home in one s living room  Separate game controllers  connected through wired or wireless connections  are used to provide input to the game  Early examples include the Atari       the Nintendo Entertainment System  and the Sega Genesis  newer examples include the Wii U  the PlayStation    and the Xbox Series X 

Microconsole edit 
A microconsole is a home video game console that is typically powered by low cost computing hardware  making the console lower priced compared to other home consoles on the market  The majority of microconsoles  with a few exceptions such as the PlayStation TV and OnLive Game System  are Android based digital media players that are bundled with gamepads and marketed as gaming devices  Such microconsoles can be connected to the television to play video games downloaded from an application store such as Google Play            

Handheld game console edit 
See also  List of handheld game consoles
Handheld game consoles are devices that typically include a built in screen and game controller in their case  and contain a rechargeable battery or battery compartment  This allows the unit to be carried around and played anywhere  in contrast to a home game console  Examples include the Game Boy  the PlayStation Portable  and the Nintendo  DS 

Hybrid video game console edit 
Hybrid video game consoles are devices that can be used either as a handheld or as a home console  They have either a wired connection or docking station that connects the console unit to a television screen and fixed power source  and the potential to use a separate controller  However  they can also be used as a handheld  While prior handhelds like the Sega Nomad and PlayStation Portable  or home consoles such as the Wii U  have had these features  some consider the Nintendo Switch to be the first true hybrid console                       

Functionality edit 
Most consoles are considered programmable consoles and have the means for the player to switch between different games  Traditionally  this has been done by switching a physical game cartridge or game card or by using optical media  It is now common to download games through digital distribution and store them on internal or external digital storage devices 

Dedicated console edit 
The Sega Genesis  Mega Drive  Mini dedicated console
Some consoles are considered dedicated consoles  in which games available for the console are  baked  onto the hardware  either by being programmed via the circuitry or set in the read only flash memory of the console  Thus  the console s game library cannot be added to or changed directly by the user  The user can typically switch between games on dedicated consoles using hardware switches on the console  or through in game menus  Dedicated consoles were common in the first generation of home consoles  such as the Magnavox Odyssey and the home console version of Pong  and more recently have been used for retro style consoles such as the NES Classic Edition and Sega Genesis Mini 
Dedicated consoles were very popular in the first generation until they were gradually replaced by second generation that use ROM cartridges  The fourth generation gradually merged with optical media 

Retro style console edit 
See also  List of retro style video game consoles
During the later part of video game history  there have been specialized consoles using computing components to offer multiple games to players  Most of these plug directly into one s television  and thus are often called plug and play consoles   Most of them are also considered dedicated consoles since it is generally impossible to access the computing components by an average consumer  though tech savvy consumers often have found ways to hack the console to install additional functionality  voiding the manufacturer s warranty  Plug and play consoles usually come with the console unit itself  one or more controllers  and the required components for power and video hookup  Many recent plug and play releases have been for distributing a number of retro games for a specific console platform  Examples of these include the Atari Flashback series  the NES Classic Edition  Sega Genesis Mini            and also handheld retro consoles such as the Nintendo Game  amp  Watch color screen series 

Components edit 
Console unit edit 
Early console hardware was designed as customized printed circuit boards  PCB s  selecting existing integrated circuit chips that performed known functions  or programmable chips like erasable programmable read only memory  EPROM  chips that could perform certain functions  Persistent computer memory was expensive  so dedicated consoles were generally limited to the use of processor registers for storage of the state of a game  thus limiting the complexities of such titles   Pong in both its arcade and home format  had a handful of logic and calculation chips that used the current input of the players  paddles and registers storing the ball s position to update the game s state and send it to the display device             Even with more advanced integrated circuits  IC s of the time  designers were limited to what could be done through the electrical process rather than through programming as normally associated with video game development 
Improvements in console hardware followed with improvements in microprocessor technology and semiconductor device fabrication             Manufacturing processes have been able to reduce the feature size on chips  typically measured in nanometers   allowing more transistors and other components to fit on a chip  and at the same time increasing the circuit speeds and the potential frequency the chip can run at  as well as reducing thermal dissipation  Chips were able to be made on larger dies  further increasing the number of features and effective processing power  Random access memory became more practical with the higher density of transistors per chip  but to address the correct blocks of memory  processors needed to be updated to use larger word sizes and allot for larger bandwidth in chip communications             All these improvements did increase the cost of manufacturing  but at a rate far less than the gains in overall processing power  which helped to make home computers and consoles inexpensive for the consumer  all related to Moore s law of technological improvements            
For the consoles of the     s to     s  these improvements were evident in the marketing in the late     s to     s during the  bit wars   where console manufacturers had focused on their console s processor s word size as a selling point             Consoles since the     s are more similar to personal computers  building in memory  storage features  and networking capabilities to avoid the limitations of the past              The confluence with personal computers eased software development for both computer and console games  allowing developers to target both platforms  However  consoles differ from computers as most of the hardware components are preselected and customized between the console manufacturer and hardware component provider to assure a consistent performance target for developers  Whereas personal computer motherboards are designed with the needs for allowing consumers to add their desired selection of hardware components  the fixed set of hardware for consoles enables console manufacturers to optimize the size and design of the motherboard and hardware  often integrating key hardware components into the motherboard circuitry itself  Often  multiple components  such as the central processing unit and graphics processing unit  can be combined into a single chip  otherwise known as a system on a chip  SoC   which is a further reduction in size and cost              In addition  consoles tend to focus on components that give the unit high game performance  such as the CPU and GPU  and as a tradeoff to keep their prices in expected ranges  use less memory and storage space compared to typical personal computers             
In comparison to the early years of the industry  where most consoles were made directly by the company selling the console  many consoles of today are generally constructed through a value chain that includes component suppliers  such as AMD and NVidia for CPU and GPU functions  and contract manufacturers including electronics manufacturing services  factories which assemble those components into the final consoles such as Foxconn and Flextronics  Completed consoles are then usually tested  distributed  and repaired by the company itself              Microsoft and Nintendo both use this approach to their consoles  while Sony maintains all production in house with the exception of their component suppliers

Some of the commons elements that can be found within console hardware include 

Motherboard
The primary PCB that all of the main chips  including the CPU  are mounted on 
Daughterboard
A secondary PCB that connects to the motherboard that would be used for additional functions  These may include components that can be easily replaced later without having to replace the full motherboard 
Central processing unit  CPU 
The main processing chip on the console that performs most of the computational workload 
The consoles  CPU is generally defined by its word size  such as   bit or    bit   and its clock speed or frequency in hertz  For some CPUs  the clock speed can be variable in response to software needs  In general  larger word sizes and faster clock sizes indicate better performance  but other factors will impact the actual speed 
Another distinguishing feature for a console s CPU is the instruction set architecture  The instruction set defines low level machine code to be sent to the CPU to achieve specific results on the chip  Differences in the instruction set architecture of CPU of consoles of a given generation can make for difficulty in software portability  This had been used by manufacturers to keep software titles exclusive to their platform as one means to compete with others              Consoles prior to the sixth generation typically used chips that the hardware and software developers were most familiar with  but as personal computers stabilized on the x   architecture  console manufacturers followed suit as to help easily port games between computer and console             
Newer CPUs may also feature multiple processing cores  which are also identified in their specification  Multi core CPUs allow for multithreading and parallel computing in modern games  such as one thread for managing the game s rendering engine  one for the game s physics engine  and another for evaluating the player s input 
Graphical processing unit  GPU 
The processing unit that performs rendering of data from the CPU to the video output of the console 
In the earlier console generations  this was generally limited to simple graphic processing routines  such as bitmapped graphics and manipulation of sprites  all otherwise involving integer mathematics while minimizing the amount of required memory needed to complete these routines  as memo  For example  the Atari      used its own Television Interface Adaptor that handled video and audio  while the Nintendo Entertainment System used the Picture Processing Unit  For consoles  these GPUs were also designed to send the signal in the proper analog formation to a cathode ray television  NTSC  used in Japan and North America  or PAL  mostly used in Europe   These two formats differed by their refresh rates     versus    Hertz  and consoles and games that were manufactured for PAL markets used the CPU and GPU at lower frequencies             
The introduction of real time polygonal  D graphics rendering in the early     s       not just an innovation in video games for consoles but in arcade and personal computer games       led to the development of GPUs that were capable of performing the floating point calculations needed for real time  D rendering  In contrast to the CPU  modern GPUs for consoles and computers  principally made by AMD and NVidia  are highly parallel computing devices with a number of compute units streaming multiprocessors  depending on vendor  respectively  within a single chip  Each compute unit microprocessor contains a scheduler  a number of subprocessing units  memory caches and buffers  and dispatching and collecting units which also may be highly parallel in nature  Modern console GPUs can be run at a different frequency from the CPU  even at variable frequencies to increases its processing power at the cost of higher energy draw              The performance of GPUs in consoles can be estimated through floating point operations per second  FLOPS  and more commonly as in teraflops  TFLOPS        FLOPS   However  particularly for consoles  this is considered a rough number as several other factors such as the CPU  memory bandwidth  and console architecture can impact the GPU s true performance             
Coprocessors
Additional processors used to handle other dedicated functions on the console  Many early consoles feature an audio coprocessor for example 
Northbridge
The processor unit that  outside of the CPU and GPU  typically manages the fastest processing elements on the computer  Typically this involves communication of data between the CPU  the GPU  and the on board RAM  and subsequently sending and receiving information with the southbridge 
Southbridge
The counterpart of the northbridge  the southbridge is the processing unit that handles slower processing components of the console  typically those of input output  I O  with some internal storage and other connected devices like controllers 
BIOS
The console s BIOS  Basic Input Output System  is the fundamental instruction set baked into a firmware chip on the console circuit board that the console uses when it is first turned on to direct operations  In older consoles  prior to the introduction of onboard storage  the BIOS effectively served as the console s operating system  while in modern consoles  the BIOS is used to direct loading of the console s operating system off internal memory 
Random access memory  RAM 
Memory storage that is designed for fast reading and writing  often used in consoles to store large amounts of data about a game while it is being played to avoid reading from the slower game media  RAM memory typically does not sustain itself after the console is powered off  Besides the amount of RAM available  a key measurement of performance for consoles is the RAM s bandwidth  how fast in terms of bytes per second that the RAM can be written and read from  This is data that must be transferred to and from the CPU and GPU quickly as needed without requiring these chips to need high memory caches themselves 
Internal storage
Newer consoles have included internal storage devices  such as flash memory  hard disk drives  HDD  and solid state drives  SSD   to save data persistently  Early application of internal storage was for saving game states  and more recently can be used to store the console s operating system  game patches and updates  games downloaded through the Internet  additional content for those games  and additional media such as purchased movies and music  Most consoles provide the means to manage the data on this storage while respecting the copyrights on the system  Newer consoles  such as the PlayStation   and Xbox Series X  use high speed SSD s not only for storage but to augment the console s RAM  as the combination of their I O speeds and the use of decompression routines build into the system software give overall read speeds that approach that of the onboard RAM             
Power supply
Besides converting AC power from a wall socket to the DC power needed by the console electronics  the power supply also helps to regulate that power in cases of power surges  Some consoles power supplies are built into the unit  so that the consumer plugs the unit directly to a wall socket  but more often  the console ships with an AC adapter  colloquially known as a  power brick   that converts the power outside of the unit  On handheld units the power supply will either be from a battery compartment  or optionally from a direct power connection from an AC adapter  or from a rechargeable battery pack built into the unit 
Cooling systems
More advanced computing systems generate heat  and require active cooling systems to keep the hardware at safe operating temperatures  Many newer consoles are designed with cooling fans  engineered cooling fins  internal layouts  and strategically placed vents on the casing to assure good convective heat transfer for keeping the internal components cool 
Media reader
Since the introduction of game cartridges  nearly all consoles have a cartridge port reader or an optical drive for game media  In the latter console generations  some console revisions have offered options without a media reader as a means to reduce the console s cost and letting the consumer rely on digital distribution for game acquisition  such as with the Xbox One S All Digital Edition or the PlayStation   Digital Edition 
Case
All consoles are enclosed in a case to protect the electronics from damage and to constrain the air flow for cooling 
Input output ports
Ports for connecting power  controllers  televisions or video monitors  external storage devices  Internet connectivity  and other features are placed in strategic locations on the console  Controller connections are typically offered on the front of the console  while power and most other connections are usually found on the back to keep cables out of the way 
Controllers edit 
Main article  Game controller
All game consoles require player input through a game controller to provide a method to move the player character in a specific direction and a variation of buttons to perform other in game actions such as jumping or interacting with the game world              Though controllers have become more featured over the years  they still provide less control over a game compared to personal computers or mobile gaming              The type of controller available to a game can fundamentally change the style of how a console game will or can be played                                      However  this has also inspired changes in game design to create games that accommodate for the comparatively limited controls available on consoles             
Controllers have come in a variety of styles over the history of consoles  Some common types include 

Paddle
A unit with a single knob or dial and usually one or two buttons  Turning the knob typically allows one to move an on screen object along one axis  such as the paddle in a table tennis game   while the buttons can have additional features 
Joystick
A unit that has a long handle that can pivot freely along multiple directions along with one or more buttons  The unit senses the direction that the joystick is pushed  allowing for simultaneous movement in two directions within a game 
Gamepad
A unit that contains a variety of buttons  triggers  and directional controls                   either D pads or analog sticks or both  These have become the most common type of controller since the third generation of console hardware  with designs becoming more detailed to give a larger array of buttons and directional controls to player s while maintaining ergonomic features 
Numerous other controller types exist  including those that support motion controls  touchscreen support on handhelds and some consoles  and specialized controllers for specific types of games  such as racing wheels for racing games  light guns for shooting games  and musical instrument controllers for rhythm games  Some newer consoles also include optional support for a mouse and keyboard devices  Some older consoles such as      Sega Genesis aka Mega Drive and       DO Interactive Multiplayer  supported optional mice  both with special mice made for them  but the  DO mouse like that console was a flop  and the mouse for the Sega had very limited game support  The Sega also supported the optional Menacer  a wireless infrared light gun  and such were at one point popular for games  It also support BatterUP  a baseball bat shaped controller 
A controller may be attached through a wired connection onto the console itself  or in some unique cases like the Famicom hardwired to the console  or with a wireless connection  Controllers require power  either provided by the console via the wired connection  or from batteries or a rechargeable battery pack for wireless connections  Controllers are nominally built into a handheld unit  though some newer ones allow for separate wireless controllers to also be used

Game media edit 
While the first game consoles were dedicated game systems  with the games programmed into the console s hardware  the Fairchild Channel F introduced the ability to store games in a form separate from the console s internal circuitry  thus allowing the consumer to purchase new games to play on the system  Since the Channel F  nearly all game consoles have featured the ability to purchase and swap games through some form  through those forms have changes with improvements in technology 

ROM cartridge or game cartridge
The read only memory  ROM  cartridge was introduced with the Fairchild Channel F  A ROM cartridge consist of a printed circuit board  PCB  housed inside of a plastic casing  with a connector allowing the device to interface with the console  The circuit board can contain a wide variety of components  at the minimum  the read only memory with the software written on it  Later cartridges were able to introduce additional components onto the circuit board like coprocessors  such as Nintendo s SuperFX chip  to enhance the performance of the console              Some consoles such as the Turbografx    used a smart card like technology to flatten the cartridge to a credit card sized system  which helped to reduce production costs  but limited additional features that could be included onto the circuitry              PCB based cartridges waned with the introduction of optical media during the fifth generation of consoles  More recently  ROM cartridges have been based on high memory density  low cost flash memory  which allows for easier mass production of games  Sony used this approach for the PlayStation Vita              and Nintendo continues to use ROM cartridges for its  DS and Switch products 
Optical media
Optical media  such as CD ROM  DVD  and Blu ray  became the primary format for retail distribution with the fifth generation  The CD ROM format had gained popularity in the     s  in the midst of the fourth generation  and as a game media  CD ROMs were cheaper and faster to produce  offered much more storage space and allowed for the potential of full motion video              Several console manufacturers attempted to offer CD ROM add ons to fourth generation consoles  but these were nearly as expensive as the consoles themselves and did not fare well  Instead  the CD ROM format became integrated into consoles of the fifth generation  with the DVD format present across most by the seventh generation and Blu ray by the eighth  Console manufacturers have also used proprietary disc formats for copy protection as well  such as the Nintendo optical disc used on the GameCube  and Sony s Universal Media Disc on the PlayStation Portable 
Digital distribution
Since the seventh generation of consoles  most consoles include integrated connectivity to the Internet and both internal and external storage for the console  allowing for players to acquire new games without game media  All three of Nintendo  Sony  and Microsoft offer an integrated storefront for consumers to purchase new games and download them to their console  retaining the consumers  purchases across different consoles  and offering sales and incentives at times 
Cloud gaming
As Internet access speeds improved throughout the eighth generation of consoles  cloud gaming had gained further attention as a media format  Instead of downloading games  the consumer plays them directly from a cloud gaming service with inputs performed on the local console sent through the Internet to the server with the rendered graphics and audio sent back  Latency in network transmission remains a core limitation for cloud gaming at the present time 
While magnetic storage  such as tape drives and floppy disks  had been popular for software distribution with early personal computers in the     s and     s  this format did not see much use in console systems  There were some attempts  such as the Bally Astrocade and APF M     using tape drives  as well as the Disk System for the Nintendo Famicom              and the Nintendo   DD for the Nintendo     but these had limited applications  as magnetic media was more fragile and volatile than game cartridges

External storage edit 
A PlayStation memory card
In addition to built in internal storage  newer consoles often give the consumer the ability to use external storage media to save game date  downloaded games  or other media files from the console  Early iterations of external storage were achieved through the use of flash based memory cards  first used by the Neo Geo but popularized with the PlayStation  Nintendo continues to support this approach with extending the storage capabilities of the  DS and Switch  standardizing on the current SD card format  As consoles began incorporating the use of USB ports  support for USB external hard drives was also added  such as with the Xbox     

Online services edit 
Main article  Online console gaming
With Internet enabled consoles  console manufacturers offer both free and paid subscription services that provide value added services atop the basic functions of the console  Free services generally offer user identity services and access to a digital storefront  while paid services allow players to play online games  interact with other uses through social networking  use cloud saves for supported games  and gain access to free titles on a rotating basis  Examples of such services include the Xbox network  PlayStation Network  and Nintendo Switch Online 

Console add ons edit 
Certain consoles saw various add ons or accessories that were designed to attach to the existing console to extend its functionality  The best example of this was through the various CD ROM add ons for consoles of the fourth generation such as the TurboGrafx CD  Atari Jaguar CD  and the Sega CD  Other examples of add ons include the   X for the Sega Genesis intended to allow owners of the aging console to play newer games but has several technical faults  and the Game Boy Player for the GameCube to allow it to play Game Boy games 

Accessories edit 
Consumers can often purchase a range of accessories for consoles outside of the above categories  These can include 

Video camera
While these can be used with Internet connected consoles like webcams for communication with other friends as they would be used on personal computers  video camera applications on consoles are more commonly used in augmented reality mixed reality and motion sensing games  Devices like the EyeToy for PlayStation consoles and the Kinect for Xbox consoles were center points for a range of games to support these devices on their respective systems 
Standard Headsets
Headsets provide a combination of headphones and a microphone for chatting with other players without disturbing others nearby in the same room 
Virtual reality headsets
Some virtual reality  VR  headsets can operate independently of consoles or use personal computers for their main processing system  As of          update       the only direct VR support on consoles is the PlayStation VR  though support for VR on other consoles is planned by the other manufacturers 
Docking station
For handheld systems as well as hybrids such as the Nintendo Switch  the docking station makes it easy to insert a handheld to recharge its battery  and if supported  for connecting the handheld to a television screen

Game development edit 
The core development process for a console game is very similar to its counterparts and primarily differs in the high level concept due to demographics             and the technical back end              Consoles developers will usually make a development kit available to game developers which they can use to test their games on with more ease than a consumer model 
Early console games were commonly created by a single person and could be changed in a short amount of time due to the simplicity of the games at the time              As technology has improved  the development time  complexity and cost of console games has increased dramatically              to where the size of a team for an eighth generation game can number in the hundreds              Similarly  the programming languages used in video game development has changed over time with early games being developed primarily in assembly  As time went on developers had more choice on what they could use based on the availability on the console but some languages became more popular than others             
In comparison to PC and mobile games  console game developers must consider the limitations of the hardware their game is being developed for  as it is unlikely to have any major changes between the development phase and release  PC and mobile technology progresses quickly and there are many different configurations of their hardware and software  This is beneficial at the start of a console s life cycle  as the technology will be cutting edge  but as the console ages  developers are forced to work with ageing hardware until the next generation of consoles is released  Earlier consoles games could be developed to take advantage of the fixed limitations of the consoles they were developed for  such as the MegaDrive s capability of fast scrolling influencing design decisions made for Sonic the Hedgehog             

Console development kits edit 
Main article  Game development kit
Console or game development kits are specialized hardware units that typically include the same components as the console and additional chips and components to allow the unit to be connected to a computer or other monitoring device for debugging purposes  A console manufacturer will make the console s dev kit available to registered developers months ahead of the console s planned launch to give developers time to prepare their games for the new system  These initial kits will usually be offered under special confidentiality clauses to protect trade secrets of the console s design  and will be sold at a high cost to the developer as part of keeping this confidentiality              Newer consoles that share features in common with personal computers may no longer use specialized dev kits  though developers are still expected to register and purchase access to software development kits from the manufacturer  For example  any consumer Xbox One can be used for game development after paying a fee to Microsoft to register one intent to do so             

Licensing edit 
Since the release of the Nintendo Famicom   Nintendo Entertainment System  most video game console manufacturers employ a strict licensing scheme that limit what games can be developed for it  Developers and their publishers must pay a fee  typically based on royalty per unit sold  back to the manufacturer  The cost varies by manufacturer but was estimated to be about US      per unit in       With additional fees  such as branding rights  this has generally worked out to be an industry wide     royalty rate paid to the console manufacturer for every game sold                          This is in addition to the cost of acquiring the dev kit to develop for the system 
The licensing fee may be collected in a few different ways  In the case of Nintendo  the company generally has controlled the production of game cartridges with its lockout chips and optical media for its systems  and thus charges the developer or publisher for each copy it makes as an upfront fee  This also allows Nintendo to review the game s content prior to release and veto games it does not believe appropriate to include on its system  This had led to over     unlicensed games for the NES              and numerous others on other Nintendo cartridge based systems that had found ways to bypass the hardware lockout chips and sell without paying any royalties to Nintendo  such as by Atari in its subsidiary company Tengen              This licensing approach was similarly used by most other cartridge based console manufacturers using lockout chip technology             
With optical media  where the console manufacturer may not have direct control on the production of the media  the developer or publisher typically must establish a licensing agreement to gain access to the console s proprietary storage format for the media as well as to use the console and manufacturer s logos and branding for the game s packaging  paid back through royalties on sales              In the transition to digital distribution  where now the console manufacturer runs digital storefronts for games  license fees apply to registering a game for distribution on the storefront                   again gaining access to the console s branding and logo                   with the manufacturer taking its cut of each sale as its royalty              In both cases  this still gives console manufacturers the ability to review and reject games it believes unsuitable for the system and deny licensing rights 
With the rise of indie game development  the major console manufacturers have all developed entry level routes for these smaller developers to be able to publish onto consoles at far lower costs and reduced royalty rates  Programs like Microsoft s ID Xbox give developers most of the needed tools for free after validating the small development size and needs of the team             
Similar licensing concepts apply for third party accessory manufacturers             

Emulation and backward compatibility edit 
Main articles  Video game console emulator and Backward compatibility
Consoles  like most consumer electronic devices  have limited lifespans  There is great interest in preservation of older console hardware for archival and historical purposes  as games from older consoles  as well as arcade and personal computers  remain of interest  Computer programmers and hackers have developed emulators that can be run on personal computers or other consoles that simulate the hardware of older consoles that allow games from that console to be run  The development of software emulators of console hardware is established to be legal  but there are unanswered legal questions surrounding copyrights  including acquiring a console s firmware and copies of a game s ROM image  which laws such as the United States  Digital Millennium Copyright Act make illegal save for certain archival purposes              Even though emulation itself is legal  Nintendo is recognized to be highly protective of any attempts to emulate its systems and has taken early legal actions to shut down such projects             
To help support older games and console transitions  manufacturers started to support backward compatibility on consoles in the same family  Sony was the first to do this on a home console with the PlayStation   which was able to play original PlayStation content  and subsequently became a sought after feature across many consoles that followed              Backward compatibility functionality has included direct support for previous console games on the newer consoles such as within the Xbox console family              the distribution of emulated games such as Nintendo s Virtual Console  or using cloud gaming services for these older games as with the PlayStation Now service 

Market edit 
Distribution edit 
Visualization of the Best Selling game consoles from      to      
Consoles may be shipped in a variety of configurations  but typically will include one base configuration that include the console  one controller  and sometimes a pack in game  Manufacturers may offer alternate stock keeping unit  SKUs  options that include additional controllers and accessories or different pack in games  Special console editions may feature unique cases or faceplates with art dedicated to a specific video game or series and are bundled with that game as a special incentive for its fans  Pack in games are typically first party games  often featuring the console s primary mascot characters             
The more recent console generations have also seen multiple versions of the same base console system either offered at launch or presented as a mid generation refresh  In some cases  these simply replace some parts of the hardware with cheaper or more efficient parts  or otherwise streamline the console s design for production going forward  the PlayStation   underwent several such hardware refreshes during its lifetime due to technological improvements such as significant reduction of the process node size for the CPU and GPU              In these cases  the hardware revision model will be marked on packaging so that consumers can verify which version they are acquiring             
In other cases  the hardware changes create multiple lines within the same console family  The base console unit in all revisions share fundamental hardware  but options like internal storage space and RAM size may be different  Those systems with more storage and RAM would be marked as a higher performance variant available at a higher cost  while the original unit would remain as a budget option  For example  within the Xbox One family  Microsoft released the mid generation Xbox One X as a higher performance console  the Xbox One S as the lower cost base console  and a special Xbox One S All Digital Edition revision that removed the optical drive on the basis that users could download all games digitally  offered at even a lower cost than the Xbox One S  In these cases  developers can often optimize games to work better on the higher performance console with patches to the retail version of the game              In the case of the Nintendo  DS  the New Nintendo  DS  featured upgraded memory and processors  with new games that could only be run on the upgraded units and cannot be run on an older base unit              There have also been a number of  slimmed down  console options with significantly reduced hardware components that significantly reduced the price they could sell the console to the consumer  but either leaving certain features off the console  such as the Wii Mini that lacked any online components compared to the Wii  or that required the consumer to purchase additional accessories and wiring if they did not already own it  such as the New Style NES that was not bundled with the required RF hardware to connect to a television

  Microsoft does not report exact sales for its consoles since the Xbox One  and sales are based industry estimates                         



Consoles when originally launched in the     s and     s were about US                      and with the introduction of the ROM cartridge  each game averaged about US                    Over time the launch price of base consoles units has generally risen to about US                      with the average game costing US                 Exceptionally  the period of transition from ROM cartridges to optical media in the early     s saw several consoles with high price points exceeding US     and going as high as US      Resultingly  sales of these first optical media consoles were generally poor             
When adjusted for inflation  the price of consoles has generally followed a downward trend  from US           from the early generations down to US         for current consoles  This is typical for any computer technology  with the improvements in computing performance and capabilities outpacing the additional costs to achieve those gains              Further  within the United States  the price of consoles has generally remained consistent  being within      to    of the median household income  based on the United States Census data for the console s launch year             
Since the Nintendo Entertainment System  console pricing has stabilized on the razorblade model  where the consoles are sold at little to no profit for the manufacturer  but they gain revenue from each game sold due to console licensing fees and other value added services around the console  such as Xbox Live                                       Console manufacturers have even been known to take losses on the sale of consoles at the start of a console s launch with expectation to recover with revenue sharing and later price recovery on the console as they switch to less expensive components and manufacturing processes without changing the retail price              Consoles have been generally designed to have a five year product lifetime  though manufacturers have considered their entries in the more recent generations to have longer lifetimes of seven to potentially ten years             

Competition edit 
See also  Console war  Video game industry  and History of video games
The competition within the video game console market as subset of the video game industry is an area of interest to economics with its relatively modern history  its rapid growth to rival that of the film industry  and frequent changes compared to other sectors                         
Effects of unregulated competition on the market were twice seen early in the industry  The industry had its first crash in      following the release of the Magnavox Odyssey  Atari s home versions of Pong and the Coleco Telstar  which led other third party manufacturers  using inexpensive General Instruments processor chips  to make their own home consoles which flooded the market by                                           The video game crash of      was fueled by multiple factors including competition from lower cost personal computers  but unregulated competition was also a factor  as numerous third party game developers  attempting to follow on the success of Activision in developing third party games for the Atari      and Intellivision  flooded the market with poor quality games  and made it difficult for even quality games to sell              Nintendo implemented a lockout chip  the Checking Integrated Circuit  on releasing the Nintendo Entertainment System in Western territories  as a means to control which games were published for the console  As part of their licensing agreements  Nintendo further prevented developers from releasing the same game on a different console for a period of two years  This served as one of the first means of securing console exclusivity for games that existed beyond technical limitation of console development             
The Nintendo Entertainment System also brought the concept of a video game mascot as the representation of a console system as a means to sell and promote the unit  and for the NES was Mario  The use of mascots in businesses had been a tradition in Japan  and this had already proven successful in arcade games like Pac Man  Mario was used to serve as an identity for the NES as a humor filled  playful console                          Mario caught on quickly when the NES released in the West  and when the next generation of consoles arrived  other manufacturers pushed their own mascots to the forefront of their marketing  most notably Sega with the use of Sonic the Hedgehog              The Nintendo and Sega rivalry that involved their mascot s flagship games served as part of the fourth console generation s  console wars   Since then  manufacturers have typically positioned their mascot and other first party games as key titles in console bundles used to drive sales of consoles at launch or at key sales periods such as near Christmas             
Another type of competitive edge used by console manufacturers around the same time was the notion of  bits  or the size of the word used by the main CPU  The TurboGrafx    was the first console to push on its bit size  advertising itself as a     bit  console  though this only referred to part of its architecture while its CPU was still an   bit unit  Despite this  manufacturers found consumers became fixated on the notion of bits as a console selling point  and over the fourth  fifth and sixth generation  these  bit wars  played heavily into console advertising             The use of bits waned as CPU architectures no longer needed to increase their word size and instead had other means to improve performance such as through multicore CPUs            

Retail demo kiosk for a Dreamcast  the last console from Sega  at the Finnish Museum of Games in Tampere  Finland in     
Generally  increased console numbers gives rise to more consumer options and better competition  but the exclusivity of titles made the choice of console for consumers an  all or nothing  decision for most              Further  with the number of available consoles growing with the fifth and sixth generations  game developers became pressured to which systems to focus on  and ultimately narrowed their target choice of platforms to those that were the best selling  This cased a contraction in the market  with major players like Sega leaving the hardware business after the Dreamcast but continuing in the software area              Effectively  each console generation was shown to have two or three dominant players             
Competition in the console market in the     s and     s is considered an oligopoly between three main manufacturers  Nintendo  Sony  and Microsoft  The three use a combination of first party games exclusive to their console and negotiate exclusive agreements with third party developers to have their games be exclusive for at least an initial period of time to drive consumers to their console  They also worked with CPU and GPU manufacturers to tune and customize hardware for computers to make it more amenable and effective for video games  leading to lower cost hardware needed for video game consoles  Finally  console manufacturers also work with retailers to help with promotion of consoles  games  and accessories  While there is little difference in pricing on the console hardware from the manufacturer s suggested retail price for the retailer to profit from  these details with the manufacturers can secure better profits on sales of game and accessory bundles for premier product placement              These all form network effects  with each manufacturer seeking to maximize the size of their network of partners to increase their overall position in the competition             
Of the three  Microsoft and Sony  both with their own hardware manufacturing capabilities  remain at a leading edge approach  attempting to gain a first mover advantage over the other with adaption of new console technology              Nintendo is more reliant on its suppliers and thus instead of trying to compete feature for feature with Microsoft and Sony  had instead taken a  blue ocean  strategy since the Nintendo DS and Wii
