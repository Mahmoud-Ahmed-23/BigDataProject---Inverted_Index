Paul John Werbos  born September          is an American social scientist and machine learning pioneer  He is best known for his      dissertation  which first described the process of training artificial neural networks through backpropagation of errors             He also was a pioneer of recurrent neural networks            
Werbos was one of the original three two year Presidents of the International Neural Network Society  INNS   In       he was awarded the IEEE Neural Network Pioneer Award for the discovery of backpropagation and other basic neural network learning frameworks such as Adaptive Dynamic Programming            
Werbos has also written on quantum mechanics and other areas of physics                         He also has interest in larger questions relating to consciousness  the foundations of physics  and human potential 
He served as program director in the National Science Foundation for several years until
