In statistics  latent variables  from Latin  present participle of lateo  lie hidden      citation needed       are variables that can only be inferred indirectly through a mathematical model from other observable variables that can be directly observed or measured             Such latent variable models are used in many disciplines  including engineering  medicine  ecology  physics  machine learning artificial intelligence  natural language processing  bioinformatics  chemometrics  demography  economics  management  political science  psychology and the social sciences 
Latent variables may correspond to aspects of physical reality  These could in principle be measured  but may not be for practical reasons  Among the earliest expressions of this idea is Francis Bacon s polemic the Novum Organum  itself a challenge to the more traditional logic expressed in Aristotle s Organon 

But the latent process of which we speak  is far from being obvious to men s minds  beset as they now are  For we mean not the measures  symptoms  or degrees of any process which can be exhibited in the bodies themselves  but simply a continued process  which  for the most part  escapes the observation of the senses         Francis Bacon  Novum Organum           
In this situation  the term hidden variables is commonly used  reflecting the fact that the variables are meaningful  but not observable  Other latent variables correspond to abstract concepts  like categories  behavioral or mental states  or data structures  The terms hypothetical variables or hypothetical constructs may be used in these situations 
The use of latent variables can serve to reduce the dimensionality of data  Many observable variables can be aggregated in a model to represent an underlying concept  making it easier to understand the data  In this sense  they serve a function similar to that of scientific theories  At the same time  latent variables link observable  sub symbolic  data in the real world to symbolic data in the modeled world 


Examples edit 
Estimation of a mean height curve  black  for boys from the Berkeley Growth Study with and without warping  The warping is based on latent variables that maps age to a synchronized biological age using a nonlinear mixed effects model            
Psychology edit 
Latent variables  as created by factor analytic methods  generally represent  shared  variance  or the degree to which variables  move  together  Variables that have no correlation cannot result in a latent construct based on the common factor model

Examples of latent variables from the field of economics include quality of life  business confidence  morale  happiness and conservatism  these are all variables which cannot be measured directly  But linking these latent variables to other  observable variables  the values of the latent variables can be inferred from measurements of the observable variables  Quality of life is a latent variable which cannot be measured directly so observable variables are used to infer quality of life  Observable variables to measure quality of life include wealth  employment  environment  physical and mental health  education  recreation and leisure time  and social belonging

Latent variable methodology is used in many branches of medicine  A class of problems that naturally lend themselves to latent variables approaches are longitudinal studies where the time scale  e g  age of participant or time since study baseline  is not synchronized with the trait being studied  For such studies  an unobserved time scale that is synchronized with the trait being studied can be modeled as a transformation of the observed time scale using latent variables  Examples of this include disease progression modeling and modeling of growth  see box  

Inferring latent variables edit

Bayesian statistics is often used for inferring latent variables 

Latent Dirichlet allocation
The Chinese restaurant process is often used to provide a prior distribution over assignments of objects to latent categories 
The Indian buffet process is often used to provide  a prior distribution over assignments of latent binary features to objects
