							The economic reforms carried out by the government recently were necessary and inevitable  but the government should achieve a growth rate of more than    annually so that the citizen can see the results of those reforms  said Shereen Al Shawarbi  professor of economics at Cairo University 
Al Shawarbi added that the Egyptian economy needs high growth rates in the current period and that Egypt is able to achieve those indicators 
How do you see the recent economic decisions that peaked last November 
No one can deny that Egypt needed these economic reforms to remedy the imbalances of the general budget and the balance of payments  which led to the increase of the low foreign exchange reserves 
But there was a dispute over the way of applying these economic reforms  whether through successive decisions or slow steps 
How could we protect low income citizens from the negative effects of economic reforms 
The recent economic decisions are financial  The IMF is only concerned with macroeconomic reform  however  the fund has been trying to take into account social safety networks in the last    years 
Of course  the reforms affects negatively the poor classes  Therefore  there should be a system that protects those people  I believe the best way is to provide good jobs with suitable income 
The idea of social justice should not be limited to financial aid and subsidies  Economic reforms should positively affect the productive structure  creating real employment opportunities with suitable wages 
It is irrational that the state and family invests in young people to graduate from certain majors  only for the graduate to work in a different one 
At the same time  it is not the ultimate goal to create jobs  since we need to benefit from our resources through investment policies  The Ministry of Investment has reduced the procedures for obtaining licences  and some other procedures have become easier 
We need a broader understanding of social justice that include education  health  and speedy jurisdiction 
The current food subsidies is semi financial  since each family knows how much it gets  Every family receives monthly commodities equivalent to EGP     In the past  families used to receive bottles of oil and sugar packages despite their high world prices 
Many economists believe that the new system of food subsidies will contribute to increasing prices and inflation  What do you think 

I believe the new system is effective since it supports the consumer rather than the commodities  So it prevents corruption 
As long as the subsidy is allocated to a particular commodity  the demand only increases on this commodity  so inflation will increase on it only 
Moreover  the social protection system should have several programmes targeting different groups that take into account the circumstances and needs of each individual or family  such as the Takaful programme 
Some families receive food subsidies and healthcare without participating in the programme  so we had to connect all programmes so that they benefit the citizen who deserves support 
This programme invests in human resources so that new generations can enter the labour market with equal opportunities 
The social security pension covers only about     of Egyptian families equivalent to about     million people  but Takaful increased that number to     million people 
The government has announced some indicators of inflation and foreign direct investments  FDIs  recently  How do you see these indicators 
The availability of information and indicators is necessary so that we can see the picture well 
Many issues could not be understood because of the lack of information on some economic indicators so we as experts ask for access to information so we can evaluate things well 
Do you think economists face any difficulty in obtaining information 
During the recent period  we could not obtain enough information and indicators like we used to in the past so that economists can do their job in this regard 
We need to know the type of FDIs that are injected into Egypt and which sectors are the most attractive for investors  We also want to know whether these investments aim to buy existing assets or establish new companies and projects  Such knowledge makes the difference 
Most FDIs to Egypt are allocated to the oil and gas sector  which creates limited job opportunities 
The construction sector is very important in the Egyptian economy  but we need to know the type of these constructions and which category of consumers use them  whether they are housing projects or industrial zones  which can create real and sustainable jobs 
As is said  the devil is in the details  We need all these details so that we can analyse the investments  We want to know whether any foreign investor or company has exited the Egyptian market  Such news could create a very negative atmosphere for the investment in Egypt 
There have been statistics concerning the bankruptcy of companies  which enabled us study the issue during a certain period of time and compare it to other periods  The non availability of such information gives an opportunity to some people to exaggerate the situation  which affects the public opinion largely 
Of course  there are bankruptcy cases  But we need to know the type of these companies and their sizes  These details reassure the Egyptian street and allow a better vision for decision makers 
The financial reforms        results always appear directly and are usually negative  such as the flotation of the exchange rate 
We need to know whether the increase in exports comes as a result of the increase in production capacity of different factories or through withdrawing products from the local market  We have no idea 
We have some things that we can relate to each other  The production growth rate was       and the export growth rate was      This increase in exports wasn       t certainly caused by an increase in production  Actually  it was the result of exporting the production that was directed to the domestic market in the first place 
This possibly led to the continuous rise in prices  On the other hand  however  it contributed to increasing foreign currency 
The economic conditions currently witnessed in Egypt are very difficult  There is a number of local and international economic obstacles  However  we feel a development is taking place in the recent period  The supply of electricity was very irregular and unreliable  Now  electricity is regular  and power cuts do not happen 
Do you think there is transparency in the economic decision making in the recent period 
The government       s support should be rational and logical  and we need to allow the community dialogue on these issues 
The problem that sometimes we feel that we are two parties in this case  government and citizens  However  we are actually in the same boat facing these economic challenges 
To convince citizens  we should put ourselves in their shoes and do not play the role of teacher because this provokes the feelings of the people and thus lose the goal of convincing them 
The IMF has recently begun to understand that reforms need to be accompanied by social protection for the poor 
The basic goal of any economic reform is to raise the standard of living of people through increasing growth rates and offering suitable wages 
However  some economic reforms prompt the people to protest them  So the IMF said that we need to stabilize the economy first  and reduce inflation and financial deficit  as there are other indicators that accompany this stability 
Why do you think some of the special indicators that the IMF has predicted on the value of the pound  as well as the inflation were beaten by the reality 
I believe that economists in Egypt are capable to identify different economic indicators once they are made available  The IMF and its various accounts on the exchange rate and inflation are not real  Therefore  we are better able to estimate this 
We really need an economic council with respect for all the existing councils  This council will consolidate all the existing economic expertise in Egypt 
We need research centres to work more closely and study the situation well enough to collect all the information about the recent economic decisions 
In less than a year  the CBE raised the interest rate to more than     which led to complaints against these decisions  how do you see coordination between fiscal and monetary policy 
The studies said that the interest rate does not affect investment  There are many other factors affecting it  There should be studies on each decision  In any case  we must know the main objective of each side 
The main objective of the CBE is to curb inflation  Unfortunately  not all targets are going in the same way  The financial deficit is large and therefore we borrow with unprecedented inflation  so there is no way to raise the interest rate 
But on the other hand  the government       s debt has reached a frightening stage  Therefore  it is necessary to increase production to get rid of these burdens  since the situation according to the first deficit means that we rely mainly on debt in basic commodities 
We want to rationalise support for spending on education and health  but it means that the deficit will remain as they are 
Therefore  we are in a real problem that will only be solved by increasing the production  thus increasing the tax revenues 
How do you the complaints against the state for competing private sector and raising the cost of borrowing  
There is still unemployed money in banks which is available for the private sector  but the reasons behind the reluctance of the private sector to borrow from banks that it does not work enough  faces difficulties in obtaining loans or suffers from the high cost of borrowing  We have to know which of these reasons affect the most in each stage 
Although there is an increase in the foreign reserves of about    bn  which is built on foreign deposits  treasury bills and bonds  there is a good side of it that you are more secure than the reserves at    billion  for example 
We should admit that there is a relative improvement in the balance of payments in the recent period 
Regarding investment  I think that the state should pay more attention to the national investors  rather than foreign investments  which focus on the petroleum sector that creates limited jobs with high incomes for a specific number of those working in this field
