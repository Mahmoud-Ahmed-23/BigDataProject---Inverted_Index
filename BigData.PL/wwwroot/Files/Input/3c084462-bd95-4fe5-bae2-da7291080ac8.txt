Lidar has terrestrial  airborne  and mobile applications                        It is commonly used to make high resolution maps  with applications in surveying  geodesy  geomatics  archaeology  geography  geology  geomorphology  seismology  forestry  atmospheric physics             laser guidance  airborne laser swathe mapping  ALSM   and laser altimetry  It is used to make digital   D representations of areas on the Earth s surface and ocean bottom of the intertidal and near coastal zone by varying the wavelength of light  It has also been increasingly used in control and navigation for autonomous cars            and for the helicopter Ingenuity on its record setting flights over the terrain of Mars             Lidar has since been used extensively for atmospheric research and meteorology  Lidar instruments fitted to aircraft and satellites carry out surveying and mapping                   a recent example being the U S  Geological Survey Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar             NASA has identified lidar as a key technology for enabling autonomous precision safe landing of future robotic and crewed lunar landing vehicles             
The evolution of quantum technology has given rise to the emergence of Quantum Lidar  demonstrating higher efficiency and sensitivity when compared to conventional lidar systems             


History and etymology edit 
The essential concept of lidar was originated by E  H  Synge in       who envisaged the use of powerful searchlights to probe the atmosphere                         
Under the direction of Malcolm Stitch  the Hughes Aircraft Company introduced the first lidar like system in                               shortly after the invention of the laser  Intended for satellite tracking  this system combined laser focused imaging with the ability to calculate distances by measuring the time for a signal to return using appropriate sensors and data acquisition electronics  It was originally called  Colidar  an acronym for  coherent light detecting and ranging               derived from the term  radar   itself an acronym for  radio detection and ranging   All     citation needed      laser rangefinders  laser altimeters and lidar units are derived from the early colidar systems 
The first practical terrestrial application of a colidar system was the  Colidar Mark II   a large rifle like laser rangefinder produced in       which had a range of         km and an accuracy of     m  to be used for military targeting                          The first mention of lidar as a stand alone word in      suggests that it originated as a portmanteau of  light  and  radar    Eventually the laser may provide an extremely sensitive detector of particular wavelengths from distant objects  Meanwhile  it is being used to study the Moon by  lidar   light radar                                   
The name  photonic radar  is sometimes used to mean visible spectrum range finding like lidar                         
Lidar s first applications were in meteorology  for which the National Center for Atmospheric Research used it to measure clouds and pollution              The general public became aware of the accuracy and usefulness of lidar systems in      during the Apollo         mission  when astronauts used a laser altimeter to map the surface of the Moon 
Although the English language no longer treats  radar  as an acronym   i e   uncapitalized   the word  lidar  was capitalized as  LIDAR  or  LiDAR  in some publications beginning in the     s  No consensus exists on capitalization  Various publications refer to lidar as  LIDAR    LiDAR    LIDaR   or  Lidar   The USGS uses both  LIDAR  and  lidar   sometimes in the same document              the New York Times predominantly uses  lidar  for staff written articles              although contributing news feeds such as Reuters may use Lidar

Lidar uses ultraviolet  visible  or near infrared light to image objects  It can target a wide range of materials  including non metallic objects  rocks  rain  chemical compounds  aerosols  clouds and even single molecules             A narrow laser beam can map physical features with very high resolutions  for example  an aircraft can map terrain at    centimetre          in  resolution or better             
Wavelengths vary to suit the target  from about         micrometers  infrared  to approximately          nanometers  ultraviolet   Typically  light is reflected via backscattering  as opposed to pure reflection one might find with a mirror  Different types of scattering are used for different lidar applications  most commonly Rayleigh scattering  Mie scattering  Raman scattering  and fluorescence             Suitable combinations of wavelengths can allow remote mapping of atmospheric contents by identifying wavelength dependent changes in the intensity of the returned signal             
The name  photonic radar  is sometimes used to mean visible spectrum range finding like lidar                          although photonic radar more strictly refers to radio frequency range finding using photonics components 
A lidar determines the distance of an object or a surface with the formula

      displaystyle d   frac  c cdot t      
  

where c is the speed of light  d is the distance between the detector and the object or surface being detected  and t is the time spent for the laser light to travel to the object or surface being detected  then travel back to the detector 
The two kinds of lidar detection schemes are  incoherent  or direct energy detection  which principally measures amplitude changes of the reflected light  and coherent detection  best for measuring Doppler shifts  or changes in the phase of the reflected light   Coherent systems generally use optical heterodyne detection              This is more sensitive than direct detection and allows them to operate at much lower power  but requires more complex transceivers 
Both types employ pulse models  either micropulse or high energy  Micropulse systems utilize intermittent bursts of energy  They developed as a result of ever increasing computer power  combined with advances in laser technology  They use considerably less energy in the laser  typically on the order of one microjoule  and are often  eye safe   meaning they can be used without safety precautions  High power systems are common in atmospheric research  where they are widely used for measuring atmospheric parameters  the height  layering and densities of clouds  cloud particle properties  extinction coefficient  backscatter coefficient  depolarization   temperature  pressure  wind  humidity  and trace gas concentration  ozone  methane  nitrous oxide  etc

Laser edit 
               nm lasers are most common for non scientific applications  The maximum power of the laser is limited  or an automatic shut off system which turns the laser off at specific altitudes is used in order to make it eye safe for the people on the ground 
One common alternative             nm lasers  are eye safe at relatively high power levels since this wavelength is not strongly absorbed by the eye  A trade off though is that current detector technology is less advanced  so these wavelengths are generally used at longer ranges with lower accuracies  They are also used for military applications because            nm is not visible in night vision goggles  unlike the shorter            nm infrared laser 
Airborne topographic mapping lidars generally use            nm diode pumped YAG lasers  while bathymetric  underwater depth research  systems generally use          nm frequency doubled diode pumped YAG lasers because          nm penetrates water with much less attenuation than            nm  Laser settings include the laser repetition rate  which controls the data collection speed   Pulse length is generally an attribute of the laser cavity length  the number of passes required through the gain material  YAG  YLF  etc    and Q switch  pulsing  speed  Better target resolution is achieved with shorter pulses  provided the lidar receiver detectors and electronics have sufficient bandwidth            
A phased array can illuminate any direction by using a microscopic array of individual antennas  Controlling the timing  phase  of each antenna steers a cohesive signal in a specific direction  Phased arrays have been used in radar since the     s  On the order of a million optical antennas are used to see a radiation pattern of a certain size in a certain direction  To achieve this the phase of each individual antenna  emitter  are precisely controlled  It is very difficult  if possible at all  to use the same technique in a lidar  The main problems are that all individual emitters must be coherent  technically coming from the same  master  oscillator or laser source   have dimensions about the wavelength of the emitted light    micron range  to act as a point source with their phases being controlled with high accuracy 
Microelectromechanical mirrors  MEMS  are not entirely solid state  However  their tiny form factor provides many of the same cost benefits  A single laser is directed to a single mirror that can be reoriented to view any part of the target field  The mirror spins at a rapid rate  However  MEMS systems generally operate in a single plane  left to right   To add a second dimension generally requires a second mirror that moves up and down  Alternatively  another laser can hit the same mirror from another angle  MEMS systems can be disrupted by shock vibration and may require repeated calibration             

Scanner and optics edit 
Image development speed is affected by the speed at which they are scanned  Options to scan the azimuth and elevation include dual oscillating plane mirrors  a combination with a polygon mirror  and a dual axis scanner  Optic choices affect the angular resolution and range that can be detected  A hole mirror or a beam splitter are options to collect a return signal 

Photodetector and receiver electronics edit 
Two main photodetector technologies are used in lidar  solid state photodetectors  such as silicon avalanche photodiodes  or photomultipliers  The sensitivity of the receiver is another parameter that has to be balanced in a lidar design 

Position and navigation systems edit 
Lidar sensors mounted on mobile platforms such as airplanes or satellites require instrumentation to determine the absolute position and orientation of the sensor  Such devices generally include a Global Positioning System receiver and an inertial measurement unit  IMU  

Sensor edit 
Lidar uses active sensors that supply their own illumination source  The energy source hits objects and the reflected energy is detected and measured by sensors  Distance to the object is determined by recording the time between transmitted and backscattered pulses and by using the speed of light to calculate the distance traveled              Flash lidar allows for   D imaging because of the camera s ability to emit a larger flash and sense the spatial relationships and dimensions of area of interest with the returned energy  This allows for more accurate imaging because the captured frames do not need to be stitched together  and the system is not sensitive to platform motion  This results in less distortion             
  D imaging can be achieved using both scanning and non scanning systems     D gated viewing laser radar  is a non scanning laser ranging system that applies a pulsed laser and a fast gated camera  Research has begun for virtual beam steering using Digital Light Processing  DLP  technology 
Imaging lidar can also be performed using arrays of high speed detectors and modulation sensitive detector arrays typically built on single chips using complementary metal oxide semiconductor  CMOS  and hybrid CMOS charge coupled device  CCD  fabrication techniques  In these devices each pixel performs some local processing such as demodulation or gating at high speed  downconverting the signals to video rate so that the array can be read like a camera  Using this technique many thousands of pixels   channels may be acquired simultaneously              High resolution   D lidar cameras use homodyne detection with an electronic CCD or CMOS shutter             
A coherent imaging lidar uses synthetic array heterodyne detection to enable a staring single element receiver to act as though it were an imaging array             
In       Lincoln Laboratory announced a new imaging chip with more than        pixels  each able to image a single photon  enabling them to capture a wide area in a single image  An earlier generation of the technology with one fourth as many pixels was dispatched by the U S  military after the January      Haiti earthquake  A single pass by a business jet at            m              ft  over Port au Prince was able to capture instantaneous snapshots of          m             ft  squares of the city at a resolution of         cm         ft   displaying the precise height of rubble strewn in city streets              The new system is ten times better  and could produce much larger maps more quickly  The chip uses indium gallium arsenide  InGaAs   which operates in the infrared spectrum at a relatively long wavelength that allows for higher power and longer ranges  In many applications  such as self driving cars  the new system will lower costs by not requiring a mechanical component to aim the chip  InGaAs uses less hazardous wavelengths than conventional silicon detectors  which operate at visual wavelengths               New technologies for infrared single photon counting LIDAR are advancing rapidly  including arrays and cameras in a variety of semiconductor and superconducting platforms             

Classification edit 
Lidar can be oriented to nadir  zenith  or laterally  For example  lidar altimeters look down  an atmospheric lidar looks up  and lidar based collision avoidance systems are side looking 
Laser projections of lidars can be manipulated using various methods and mechanisms to produce a scanning effect  the standard spindle type  which spins to give a     degree view  solid state lidar  which has a fixed field of view  but no moving parts  and can use either MEMS or optical phased arrays to steer the beams  and flash lidar  which spreads a flash of light over a large field of view before the signal bounces back to a detector             
Lidar applications can be divided into airborne and terrestrial types              The two types require scanners with varying specifications based on the data s purpose  the size of the area to be captured  the range of measurement desired  the cost of equipment  and more  Spaceborne platforms are also possible  see satellite laser altimetry 
Airborne lidar  also airborne laser scanning  is when a laser scanner  while attached to an aircraft during flight  creates a   D point cloud model of the landscape  This is currently the most detailed and accurate method of creating digital elevation models  replacing photogrammetry  One major advantage in comparison with photogrammetry is the ability to filter out reflections from vegetation from the point cloud model to create a digital terrain model which represents ground surfaces such as rivers  paths  cultural heritage sites  etc   which are concealed by trees  Within the category of airborne lidar  there is sometimes a distinction made between high altitude and low altitude applications  but the main difference is a reduction in both accuracy and point density of data acquired at higher altitudes  Airborne lidar can also be used to create bathymetric models in shallow water             
The main constituents of airborne lidar include digital elevation models  DEM  and digital surface models  DSM   The points and ground points are the vectors of discrete points while DEM and DSM are interpolated raster grids of discrete points  The process also involves capturing of digital aerial photographs  To interpret deep seated landslides for example  under the cover of vegetation  scarps  tension cracks or tipped trees airborne lidar is used  Airborne lidar digital elevation models can see through the canopy of forest cover  perform detailed measurements of scarps  erosion and tilting of electric poles             
Airborne lidar data is processed using a toolbox called Toolbox for Lidar Data Filtering and Forest Studies  TIFFS              for lidar data filtering and terrain study software  The data is interpolated to digital terrain models using the software  The laser is directed at the region to be mapped and each point s height above the ground is calculated by subtracting the original z coordinate from the corresponding digital terrain model elevation  Based on this height above the ground the non vegetation data is obtained which may include objects such as buildings  electric power lines  flying birds  insects  etc  The rest of the points are treated as vegetation and used for modeling and mapping  Within each of these plots  lidar metrics are calculated by calculating statistics such as mean  standard deviation  skewness  percentiles  quadratic mean  etc             

Lidar scanning performed with a multicopter UAV
Multiple commercial lidar systems for unmanned aerial vehicles are currently on the market  These platforms can systematically scan large areas  or provide a cheaper alternative to manned aircraft for smaller scanning operations             

Airborne Lidar Bathymetric Technology High resolution multibeam lidar map showing spectacularly faulted and deformed seafloor geology  in shaded relief and coloured by depth
The airborne lidar bathymetric technological system involves the measurement of time of flight of a signal from a source to its return to the sensor  The data acquisition technique involves a sea floor mapping component and a ground truth component that includes video transects and sampling  It works using a green spectrum           nm  laser beam              Two beams are projected onto a fast rotating mirror  which creates an array of points  One of the beams penetrates the water and also detects the bottom surface of the water under favorable conditions 
Water depth measurable by lidar depends on the clarity of the water and the absorption of the wavelength used  Water is most transparent to green and blue light  so these will penetrate deepest in clean water              Blue green light of          nm produced by frequency doubled solid state IR laser output is the standard for airborne bathymetry  This light can penetrate water but pulse strength attenuates exponentially with distance traveled through the water              Lidar can measure depths from about     to         m    to          ft   with vertical accuracy in the order of         cm         in   The surface reflection makes water shallower than about          m         ft  difficult to resolve  and absorption limits the maximum depth  Turbidity causes scattering and has a significant role in determining the maximum depth that can be resolved in most situations  and dissolved pigments can increase absorption depending on wavelength              Other reports indicate that water penetration tends to be between two and three times Secchi depth  Bathymetric lidar is most useful in the           m            ft  depth range in coastal mapping             
On average in fairly clear coastal seawater lidar can penetrate to about        m          ft   and in turbid water up to about        m          ft   An average value found by Saputra et al        is for the green laser light to penetrate water about one and a half to two times Secchi depth in Indonesian waters  Water temperature and salinity have an effect on the refractive index which has a small effect on the depth calculation             
The data obtained shows the full extent of the land surface exposed above the sea floor  This technique is extremely useful as it will play an important role in the major sea floor mapping program  The mapping yields onshore topography as well as underwater elevations  Sea floor reflectance imaging is another solution product from this system which can benefit mapping of underwater habitats  This technique has been used for three dimensional image mapping of California s waters using a hydrographic lidar             
Airborne lidar systems were traditionally able to acquire only a few peak returns  while more recent systems acquire and digitize the entire reflected signal              Scientists analysed the waveform signal for extracting peak returns using Gaussian decomposition              Zhuang et al       used this approach for estimating aboveground biomass              Handling the huge amounts of full waveform data is difficult  Therefore  Gaussian decomposition of the waveforms is effective  since it reduces the data and is supported by existing workflows that support interpretation of   D point clouds  Recent studies investigated voxelisation  The intensities of the waveform samples are inserted into a voxelised space    D grayscale image  building up a   D representation of the scanned area              Related metrics and information can then be extracted from that voxelised space  Structural information can be extracted using   D metrics from local areas and there is a case study that used the voxelisation approach for detecting dead standing Eucalypt trees in Australia             
Terrestrial applications of lidar  also terrestrial laser scanning  happen on the Earth s surface and can be either stationary or mobile  Stationary terrestrial scanning is most common as a survey method  for example in conventional topography  monitoring  cultural heritage documentation and forensics              The   D point clouds acquired from these types of scanners can be matched with digital images taken of the scanned area from the scanner s location to create realistic looking   D models in a relatively short time when compared to other technologies  Each point in the point cloud is given the colour of the pixel from the image taken at the same location and direction as the laser beam that created the point 
Terrestrial lidar mapping involves a process of occupancy grid map generation  The process involves an array of cells divided into grids which employ a process to store the height values when lidar data falls into the respective grid cell  A binary map is then created by applying a particular threshold to the cell values for further processing  The next step is to process the radial distance and z coordinates from each scan to identify which   D points correspond to each of the specified grid cell leading to the process of data formation             
Mobile lidar  also mobile laser scanning  is when two or more scanners are attached to a moving vehicle to collect data along a path  These scanners are almost always paired with other kinds of equipment  including GNSS receivers and IMUs  One example application is surveying streets  where power lines  exact bridge heights  bordering trees  etc  all need to be taken into account  Instead of collecting each of these measurements individually in the field with a tachymeter  a   D model from a point cloud can be created where all of the measurements needed can be made  depending on the quality of the data collected  This eliminates the problem of forgetting to take a measurement  so long as the model is available  reliable and has an appropriate level of accuracy 

Applications edit 
This mobile robot uses its lidar to construct a map and avoid obstacles 
There are a wide variety of lidar applications  in addition to the applications listed below  as it is often mentioned in national lidar dataset programs  These applications are largely determined by the range of effective object detection  resolution  which is how accurately the lidar identifies and classifies objects  and reflectance confusion  meaning how well the lidar can see something in the presence of bright objects  like reflective signs or bright sun             
Companies are working to cut the cost of lidar sensors  currently anywhere from about US       to more than          Lower prices will make lidar more attractive for new markets             

Agriculture edit 
Lidar is used to analyze yield rates on agricultural fields 
Agricultural robots have been used for a variety of purposes ranging from seed and fertilizer dispersions  sensing techniques as well as crop scouting for the task of weed control 
Lidar can help determine where to apply costly fertilizer  It can create a topographical map of the fields and reveal slopes and sun exposure of the farmland  Researchers at the Agricultural Research Service used this topographical data with the farmland yield results from previous years  to categorize land into zones of high  medium  or low yield              This indicates where to apply fertilizer to maximize yield 
Lidar is now used to monitor insects in the field  The use of lidar can detect the movement and behavior of individual flying insects  with identification down to sex and species              In      a patent application was published on this technology in the United States  Europe  and China             
Another application is crop mapping in orchards and vineyards  to detect foliage growth and the need for pruning or other maintenance  detect variations in fruit production  or count plants 
Lidar is useful in GNSS denied situations  such as nut and fruit orchards  where foliage causes interference for agriculture equipment that would otherwise utilize a precise GNSS fix  Lidar sensors can detect and track the relative position of rows  plants  and other markers so that farming equipment can continue operating until a GNSS fix is reestablished 
Controlling weeds requires identifying plant species  This can be done by using   D lidar and machine learning              Lidar produces plant contours as a  point cloud  with range and reflectance values  This data is transformed  and features are extracted from it  If the species is known  the features are added as new data  The species is labelled and its features are initially stored as an example to identify the species in the real environment  This method is efficient because it uses a low resolution lidar and supervised learning  It includes an easy to compute feature set with common statistical features which are independent of the plant size             

Archaeology edit 
Lidar has many uses in archaeology  including planning of field campaigns  mapping features under forest canopy  and overview of broad  continuous features indistinguishable from the ground              Lidar can produce high resolution datasets quickly and cheaply  Lidar derived products can be easily integrated into a Geographic Information System  GIS  for analysis and interpretation 
Lidar can also help to create high resolution digital elevation models  DEMs  of archaeological sites that can reveal micro topography that is otherwise hidden by vegetation  The intensity of the returned lidar signal can be used to detect features buried under flat vegetated surfaces such as fields  especially when mapping using the infrared spectrum  The presence of these features affects plant growth and thus the amount of infrared light reflected back              For example  at Fort Beaus jour   Fort Cumberland National Historic Site  Canada  lidar discovered archaeological features related to the siege of the Fort in       Features that could not be distinguished on the ground or through aerial photography were identified by overlaying hill shades of the DEM created with artificial illumination from various angles  Another example is work at Caracol by Arlen Chase and his wife Diane Zaino Chase              In       lidar was used to search for the legendary city of La Ciudad Blanca or  City of the Monkey God  in the La Mosquitia region of the Honduran jungle  During a seven day mapping period  evidence was found of man made structures                          In June       the rediscovery of the city of Mahendraparvata was announced              In southern New England  lidar was used to reveal stone walls  building foundations  abandoned roads  and other landscape features obscured in aerial photography by the region s dense forest canopy                                      In Cambodia  lidar data was used by Damian Evans and Roland Fletcher to reveal anthropogenic changes to Angkor landscape             
In       lidar revealed that the Pur pecha settlement of Angamuco in Michoac n  Mexico had about as many buildings as today s Manhattan              while in       its use in mapping ancient Maya causeways in northern Guatemala  revealed    elevated roads linking the ancient city of El Mirador to other sites                          In       archaeologists using lidar discovered more than        man made structures in the Maya Biosphere Reserve  a  major breakthrough  that showed the Maya civilization was much larger than previously thought                                                                                                                                      In       archaeologists using lidar discovered the Upano Valley sites                         

Autonomous vehicles edit

Autonomous vehicles may use lidar for obstacle detection and avoidance to navigate safely through environments                         The introduction of lidar was a pivotal occurrence that was the key enabler behind Stanley  the first autonomous vehicle to successfully complete the DARPA Grand Challenge              Point cloud output from the lidar sensor provides the necessary data for robot software to determine where potential obstacles exist in the environment and where the robot is in relation to those potential obstacles  Singapore s Singapore MIT Alliance for Research and Technology  SMART  is actively developing technologies for autonomous lidar vehicles             
The very first generations of automotive adaptive cruise control systems used only lidar sensors 
In transportation systems  to ensure vehicle and passenger safety and to develop electronic systems that deliver driver assistance  understanding the vehicle and its surrounding environment is essential  Lidar systems play an important role in the safety of transportation systems  Many electronic systems which enhance driver assistance and vehicle safety such as Adaptive Cruise Control  ACC   Emergency Brake Assist  and Anti lock Braking System  ABS  depend on the detection of a vehicle s environment to act autonomously or semi autonomously  Lidar mapping and estimation achieve this 
Current lidar systems use rotating hexagonal mirrors which split the laser beam  The upper three beams are used for vehicle and obstacles ahead  and the lower beams are used to detect lane markings and road features              The major advantage of using lidar is that the spatial structure is obtained and this data can be fused with other sensors such as radar  etc  to get a better picture of the vehicle environment in terms of static and dynamic properties of the objects present in the environment  Conversely  a significant issue with lidar is the difficulty in reconstructing point cloud data in poor weather conditions  In heavy rain  for example  the light pulses emitted from the lidar system are partially reflected off of rain droplets which adds noise to the data  called  echoes              
Obstacle detection and road environment recognition using lidar  proposed by Kun Zhou et al              not only focuses on object detection and tracking but also recognizes lane marking and road features  As mentioned earlier  the lidar systems use rotating hexagonal mirrors that split the laser beam into six beams  The upper three layers are used to detect the forward objects such as vehicles and roadside objects  The sensor is made of weather resistant material  The data detected by lidar are clustered to several segments and tracked by Kalman filter  Data clustering here is done based on characteristics of each segment based on object model  which distinguish different objects such as vehicles  signboards  etc  These characteristics include the dimensions of the object  etc  The reflectors on the rear edges of vehicles are used to differentiate vehicles from other objects  Object tracking is done using a two stage Kalman filter considering the stability of tracking and the accelerated motion of objects             Lidar reflective intensity data is also used for curb detection by making use of robust regression to deal with occlusions  Road marking is detected using a modified Otsu method by distinguishing rough and shiny surfaces             
Roadside reflectors that indicate lane border are sometimes hidden due to various reasons  Therefore  other information is needed to recognize the road border  The lidar used in this method can measure the reflectivity from the object  Hence  with this data the road border can also be recognized  Also  the usage of a sensor with a weather robust head helps to detect the objects even in bad weather conditions  Canopy Height Model before and after a flood is a good example  Lidar can detect highly detailed canopy height data as well as its road border  Lidar measurements help identify the spatial structure of the obstacle  This helps distinguish objects based on size and estimate the impact of driving over it              Lidar systems provide better range and a large field of view  which helps in detecting obstacles on the curves  This is one of its major advantages over RADAR systems  which have a narrower field of view  The fusion of lidar measurement with different sensors makes the system robust and useful in real time applications  since lidar dependent systems cannot estimate the dynamic information about the detected object              It has been shown that lidar can be manipulated  such that self driving cars are tricked into taking evasive action             

Ecology and conservation edit 
Lidar imaging comparing old growth forest  right  to a new plantation of trees  left 
Lidar has also found many applications for mapping natural and managed landscapes such as forests  wetlands              and grasslands  Canopy heights  biomass measurements  and leaf area can all be studied using airborne lidar systems                                                  Similarly  lidar is also used by many industries  including Energy and Railroad  and the Department of Transportation as a faster way of surveying  Topographic maps can also be generated readily from lidar  including for recreational use such as in the production of orienteering maps              Lidar has also been applied to estimate and assess the biodiversity of plants  fungi  and animals                                         Using southern bull kelp in New Zealand  coastal lidar mapping data has been compared with population genomic evidence to form hypotheses regarding the occurrence and timing of prehistoric earthquake uplift events              

Forestry edit 
A typical workflow to derive forest information at individual tree or plot levels from lidar point clouds             
Lidar systems have also been applied to improve forestry management               Measurements are used to take inventory in forest plots as well as calculate individual tree heights  crown width and crown diameter  Other statistical analysis use lidar data to estimate total plot information such as canopy volume  mean  minimum and maximum heights  vegetation cover  biomass  and carbon density               Aerial lidar was used to map the bush fires in Australia in early       The data was manipulated to view bare earth  and identify healthy and burned vegetation              

Geology and soil science edit 
High resolution digital elevation maps generated by airborne and stationary lidar have led to significant advances in geomorphology  the branch of geoscience concerned with the origin and evolution of the Earth surface topography   The lidar abilities to detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks               glacial landforms               to measure the land surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy  to better resolve spatial derivatives of elevation  to rockfall detection                            to detect elevation changes between repeat surveys              have enabled many novel studies of the physical and chemical processes that shape landscapes              
In      the Tour Ronde in the Mont Blanc massif became the first high alpine mountain on which lidar was employed to monitor the increasing occurrence of severe rock fall over large rock faces allegedly caused by climate change and degradation of permafrost at high altitude              
Lidar is also used in structural geology and geophysics as a combination between airborne lidar and GNSS for the detection and study of faults  for measuring uplift               The output of the two technologies can produce extremely accurate elevation models for terrain   models that can even measure ground elevation through trees  This combination was used most famously to find the location of the Seattle Fault in Washington  United States               This combination also measures uplift at Mount St  Helens by using data from before and after the      uplift               Airborne lidar systems monitor glaciers and have the ability to detect subtle amounts of growth or decline  A satellite based system  the NASA ICESat  includes a lidar sub system for this purpose  The NASA Airborne Topographic Mapper              is also used extensively to monitor glaciers and perform coastal change analysis 
The combination is also used by soil scientists while creating a soil survey  The detailed terrain modeling allows soil scientists to see slope changes and landform breaks which indicate patterns in soil spatial relationships 

Atmosphere edit 
Near range lidar at Institute of Geophysics  Warsaw  Poland
Main article  Atmospheric lidar
Initially  based on ruby lasers  lidar for meteorological applications was constructed shortly after the invention of the laser and represents one of the first applications of laser technology  Lidar technology has since expanded vastly in capability and lidar systems are used to perform a range of measurements that include profiling clouds  measuring winds  studying aerosols  and quantifying various atmospheric components  Atmospheric components can in turn provide useful information including surface pressure  by measuring the absorption of oxygen or nitrogen   greenhouse gas emissions  carbon dioxide and methane   photosynthesis  carbon dioxide   fires  carbon monoxide   and humidity  water vapor   Atmospheric lidars can be either ground based  airborne or satellite based depending on the type of measurement 
Atmospheric lidar remote sensing works in two ways 

by measuring backscatter from the atmosphere  and
by measuring the scattered reflection off the ground  when the lidar is airborne  or other hard surface 
Backscatter from the atmosphere directly gives a measure of clouds and aerosols  Other derived measurements from backscatter such as winds or cirrus ice crystals require careful selecting of the wavelength and or polarization detected  Doppler lidar and Rayleigh Doppler lidar are used to measure temperature and wind speed along the beam by measuring the frequency of the backscattered light  The Doppler broadening of gases in motion allows the determination of properties via the resulting frequency shift               Scanning lidars  such as NASA s conical scanning HARLIE  have been used to measure atmospheric wind velocity               The ESA wind mission ADM Aeolus will be equipped with a Doppler lidar system in order to provide global measurements of vertical wind profiles               A doppler lidar system was used in the      Summer Olympics to measure wind fields during the yacht competition              
Doppler lidar systems are also now beginning to be successfully applied in the renewable energy sector to acquire wind speed  turbulence  wind veer  and wind shear data  Both pulsed and continuous wave systems are being used  Pulsed systems use signal timing to obtain vertical distance resolution  whereas continuous wave systems rely on detector focusing 
The term eolics has been proposed to describe the collaborative and interdisciplinary study of wind using computational fluid mechanics simulations and Doppler lidar measurements              
The ground reflection of an airborne lidar gives a measure of surface reflectivity  assuming the atmospheric transmittance is well known  at the lidar wavelength  however  the ground reflection is typically used for making absorption measurements of the atmosphere   Differential absorption lidar   DIAL  measurements utilize two or more closely spaced  less than        nm  wavelengths to factor out surface reflectivity as well as other transmission losses  since these factors are relatively insensitive to wavelength  When tuned to the appropriate absorption lines of a particular gas  DIAL measurements can be used to determine the concentration  mixing ratio  of that particular gas in the atmosphere  This is referred to as an Integrated Path Differential Absorption  IPDA  approach  since it is a measure of the integrated absorption along the entire lidar path  IPDA lidars can be either pulsed                           or CW              and typically use two or more wavelengths               IPDA lidars have been used for remote sensing of carbon dioxide                                        and methane              
Synthetic array lidar allows imaging lidar without the need for an array detector  It can be used for imaging Doppler velocimetry  ultra fast frame rate imaging  millions of frames per second   as well as for speckle reduction in coherent lidar              An extensive lidar bibliography for atmospheric and hydrospheric applications is given by Grant              

Law enforcement edit

Lidar speed guns are used by the police to measure the speed of vehicles for speed limit enforcement purposes  Additionally  it is used in forensics to aid in crime scene investigations  Scans of a scene are taken to record exact details of object placement  blood  and other important information for later review  These scans can also be used to determine bullet trajectory in cases of shootings 

Military edit 
Few military applications are known to be in place and are classified  such as the lidar based speed measurement of the AGM     ACM stealth nuclear cruise missile   but a considerable amount of research is underway in their use for imaging  Higher resolution systems collect enough detail to identify targets  such as tanks  Examples of military applications of lidar include the Airborne Laser Mine Detection System  ALMDS  for counter mine warfare by Aret  Associates              
A NATO report  RTO TR SET      evaluated the potential technologies to do stand off detection for the discrimination of biological warfare agents  The potential technologies evaluated were Long Wave Infrared  LWIR   Differential Scattering  DISC   and Ultraviolet Laser Induced Fluorescence  UV LIF   The report concluded that        Based upon the results of the lidar systems tested and discussed above  the Task Group recommends that the best option for the near term             application of stand off detection systems is UV LIF                however  in the long term  other techniques such as stand off Raman spectroscopy may prove to be useful for identification of biological warfare agents 
Short range compact spectrometric lidar based on Laser Induced Fluorescence  LIF  would address the presence of bio threats in aerosol form over critical indoor  semi enclosed and outdoor venues such as stadiums  subways  and airports  This near real time capability would enable rapid detection of a bioaerosol release and allow for timely implementation of measures to protect occupants and minimize the extent of contamination              
The Long Range Biological Standoff Detection System  LR BSDS  was developed for the U S  Army to provide the earliest possible standoff warning of a biological attack  It is an airborne system carried by helicopter to detect synthetic aerosol clouds containing biological and chemical agents at long range  The LR BSDS  with a detection range of         km or more  was fielded in June                    Five lidar units produced by the German company Sick AG were used for short range detection on Stanley  the autonomous car that won the      DARPA Grand Challenge 
A robotic Boeing AH   performed a fully autonomous flight in June       including avoiding obstacles using lidar                           

Mining edit 
The calculation of ore volumes is accomplished by periodic  monthly  scanning in areas of ore removal  then comparing surface data to the previous scan              
Lidar sensors may also be used for obstacle detection and avoidance for robotic mining vehicles such as in the Komatsu Autonomous Haulage System  AHS               used in Rio Tinto s Mine of the Future 

Physics and astronomy edit 
A worldwide network of observatories uses lidars to measure the distance to reflectors placed on the Moon  allowing the position of the Moon to be measured with millimeter precision and tests of general relativity to be done  MOLA  the Mars Orbiting Laser Altimeter  used a lidar instrument in a Mars orbiting satellite  the NASA Mars Global Surveyor  to produce a spectacularly precise global topographic survey of the red planet  Laser altimeters produced global elevation models of Mars  the Moon  Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter  LOLA    and Mercury  Mercury Laser Altimeter  MLA   NEAR Shoemaker Laser Rangefinder  NLR                 Future missions will also include laser altimeter experiments such as the Ganymede Laser Altimeter  GALA  as part of the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer  JUICE  mission              
In September        the NASA Phoenix lander used lidar to detect snow in the atmosphere of Mars              
In atmospheric physics  lidar is used as a remote detection instrument to measure densities of certain constituents of the middle and upper atmosphere  such as potassium  sodium  or molecular nitrogen and oxygen  These measurements can be used to calculate temperatures  Lidar can also be used to measure wind speed and to provide information about vertical distribution of the aerosol particles              
At the JET nuclear fusion research facility in the UK near Abingdon  Oxfordshire  lidar Thomson scattering is used to determine electron density and temperature profiles of the plasma              

Rock mechanics edit 
Lidar has been widely used in rock mechanics for rock mass characterization and slope change detection  Some important geomechanical properties from the rock mass can be extracted from the   D point clouds obtained by means of the lidar  Some of these properties are  

Discontinuity orientation                                       
Discontinuity spacing and RQD                                       
Discontinuity aperture
Discontinuity persistence                                       
Discontinuity roughness             
Water infiltration
Some of these properties have been used to assess the geomechanical quality of the rock mass through the RMR index  Moreover  as the orientations of discontinuities can be extracted using the existing methodologies  it is possible to assess the geomechanical quality of a rock slope through the SMR index               In addition to this  the comparison of different   D point clouds from a slope acquired at different times allows researchers to study the changes produced on the scene during this time interval as a result of rockfalls or any other landsliding processes                                        

THOR edit 
THOR is a laser designed toward measuring Earth s atmospheric conditions  The laser enters a cloud cover              and measures the thickness of the return halo  The sensor has a fiber optic aperture with a width of             inches          cm  that is used to measure the return light 

Robotics edit 
Lidar technology is being used in robotics for the perception of the environment as well as object classification               The ability of lidar technology to provide three dimensional elevation maps of the terrain  high precision distance to the ground  and approach velocity can enable safe landing of robotic and crewed vehicles with a high degree of precision              Lidar is also widely used in robotics for simultaneous localization and mapping and is well integrated into robot simulators               Refer to the Military section above for further examples 

Spaceflight edit 
Lidar is increasingly being utilized for rangefinding and orbital element calculation of relative velocity in proximity operations and stationkeeping of spacecraft  Lidar has also been used for atmospheric studies from space  Short pulses of laser light beamed from a spacecraft can reflect off tiny particles in the atmosphere and back to a telescope aligned with the spacecraft laser  By precisely timing the lidar echo  and by measuring how much laser light is received by the telescope  scientists can accurately determine the location  distribution and nature of the particles  The result is a revolutionary new tool for studying constituents in the atmosphere  from cloud droplets to industrial pollutants  which are difficult to detect by other means                           
Laser altimetry is used to make digital elevation maps of planets  including the Mars Orbital Laser Altimeter  MOLA  mapping of Mars               the Lunar Orbital Laser Altimeter  LOLA               and Lunar Altimeter  LALT  mapping of the Moon  and the Mercury Laser Altimeter  MLA  mapping of Mercury               It is also used to help navigate the helicopter Ingenuity in its record setting flights over the terrain of Mars            

Surveying edit 
This TomTom mapping van is fitted with five lidar sensors on its roof rack 
Airborne lidar sensors are used by companies in the remote sensing field  They can be used to create a DTM  Digital Terrain Model  or DEM  Digital Elevation Model   this is quite a common practice for larger areas as a plane can acquire          km                     mi  wide swaths in a single flyover  Greater vertical accuracy of below         mm         in  can be achieved with a lower flyover  even in forests  where it is able to give the height of the canopy as well as the ground elevation  Typically  a GNSS receiver configured over a georeferenced control point is needed to link the data in with the WGS  World Geodetic System               
Lidar is also in use in hydrographic surveying  Depending upon the clarity of the water lidar can measure depths from     to         m    to          ft  with a vertical accuracy of         cm         in  and horizontal accuracy of          m         ft               

Transport edit 
A point cloud generated from a moving car using a single Ouster OS  lidar
Lidar has been used in the railroad industry to generate asset health reports for asset management and by departments of transportation to assess their road conditions  CivilMaps com is a leading company in the field               Lidar has been used in adaptive cruise control  ACC  systems for automobiles  Systems such as those by Siemens  Hella  Ouster and Cepton use a lidar device mounted on the front of the vehicle  such as the bumper  to monitor the distance between the vehicle and any vehicle in front of it               In the event where the vehicle in front slows down or is too close  the ACC applies the brakes to slow the vehicle  When the road ahead is clear  the ACC allows the vehicle to accelerate to a speed preset by the driver  Refer to the Military section above for further examples  A lidar based device  the Ceilometer  is used at airports worldwide to measure the height of clouds on runway approach paths              

Wind farm optimization edit 
Lidar can be used to increase the energy output from wind farms by accurately measuring wind speeds and wind turbulence                            Experimental lidar systems                           can be mounted on the nacelle              of a wind turbine or integrated into the rotating spinner              to measure oncoming horizontal winds               winds in the wake of the wind turbine               and proactively adjust blades to protect components and increase power  Lidar is also used to characterise the incident wind resource for comparison with wind turbine power production to verify the performance of the wind turbine              by measuring the wind turbine s power curve               Wind farm optimization can be considered a topic in applied eolics  Another aspect of lidar in wind related industry is to use computational fluid dynamics over lidar scanned surfaces in order to assess the wind potential               which can be used for optimal wind farm placement 

Solar photovoltaic deployment optimization edit 
Lidar can also be used to assist planners and developers in optimizing solar photovoltaic systems at the city level by determining appropriate roof tops                            and for determining shading losses               Recent airborne laser scanning efforts have focused on ways to estimate the amount of solar light hitting vertical building facades               or by incorporating more detailed shading losses by considering the influence from vegetation and larger surrounding terrain              

Video games edit 
Recent simulation racing games such as rFactor Pro  iRacing  Assetto Corsa and Project CARS increasingly feature race tracks reproduced from   D point clouds acquired through lidar surveys  resulting in surfaces replicated with centimeter or millimeter precision in the in game   D environment                                        
The      exploration game Scanner Sombre  by Introversion Software  uses lidar as a fundamental game mechanic 
In Build the Earth  lidar is used to create accurate renders of terrain in Minecraft to account for any errors  mainly regarding elevation  in the default generation  The process of rendering terrain into Build the Earth is limited by the amount of data available in region as well as the speed it takes to convert the file into block data 

Other uses edit 
Lidar scanner on a  th generation iPad Pro
The video for the      song  House of Cards  by Radiohead was believed to be the first use of real time   D laser scanning to record a music video  The range data in the video is not completely from a lidar  as structured light scanning is also used              
In       Apple introduced the fourth generation of iPad Pro with a lidar sensor integrated into the rear camera module  especially developed for augmented reality  AR  experiences               The feature was later included in the iPhone    Pro lineup and subsequent Pro models               On Apple devices  lidar empowers portrait mode pictures with night mode  quickens auto focus and improves accuracy in the Measure app 
In       Wheel of Fortune started using lidar technology to track when Vanna White moves her hand over the puzzle board to reveal letters  The first episode to have this technology was in the season    premiere              

Variants edit 
In flash lidar  the entire field of view is illuminated with a wide diverging laser beam in a single pulse  This is in contrast to conventional scanning lidar  which uses a collimated laser beam that illuminates a single point at a time  and the beam is raster scanned to illuminate the field of view point by point  This illumination method requires a different detection scheme as well  In both scanning and flash lidar  a time of flight camera is used to collect information about both the   D location and intensity of the light incident on it in every frame  However  in scanning lidar  this camera contains only a point sensor  while in flash lidar  the camera contains either a   D or a   D sensor array  each pixel of which collects   D location and intensity information  In both cases  the depth information is collected using the time of flight of the laser pulse  i e   the time it takes each laser pulse to hit the target and return to the sensor   which requires the pulsing of the laser and acquisition by the camera to be synchronized               The result is a camera that takes pictures of distance  instead of colors              Flash lidar is especially advantageous  when compared to scanning lidar  when the camera  scene  or both are moving  since the entire scene is illuminated at the same time  With scanning lidar  motion can cause  jitter  from the lapse in time as the laser rasters over the scene 
As with all forms of lidar  the onboard source of illumination makes flash lidar an active sensor  The signal that is returned is processed by embedded algorithms to produce a nearly instantaneous   D rendering of objects and terrain features within the field of view of the sensor               The laser pulse repetition frequency is sufficient for generating   D videos with high resolution and accuracy                            The high frame rate of the sensor makes it a useful tool for a variety of applications that benefit from real time visualization  such as highly precise remote landing operations               By immediately returning a   D elevation mesh of target landscapes  a flash sensor can be used to identify optimal landing zones in autonomous spacecraft landing scenarios              
Seeing at a distance requires a powerful burst of light  The power is limited to levels that do not damage human retinas  Wavelengths must not affect human eyes  However  low cost silicon imagers do not read light in the eye safe spectrum  Instead  gallium arsenide imagers are required  which can boost costs to                       Gallium arsenide is the same compound used to produce high cost  high efficiency solar panels usually used in space applications
