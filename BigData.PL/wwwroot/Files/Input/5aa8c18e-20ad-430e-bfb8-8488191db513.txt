Applications of machine learning  ML  in earth sciences include geological mapping  gas leakage detection and geological feature identification  Machine learning is a subdiscipline of artificial intelligence aimed at developing programs that are able to classify  cluster  identify  and analyze vast and complex data sets without the need for explicit programming to do so             Earth science is the study of the origin  evolution  and future            of the Earth  The earth s system can be subdivided into four major components including the solid earth  atmosphere  hydrosphere  and biosphere            
A variety of algorithms may be applied depending on the nature of the task  Some algorithms may perform significantly better than others for particular objectives  For example  convolutional neural networks  CNNs  are good at interpreting images  whilst more general neural networks may be used for soil classification             but can be more computationally expensive to train than alternatives such as support vector machines  The range of tasks to which ML  including deep learning  is applied has been ever growing in recent decades  as has the development of other technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles  UAVs              ultra high resolution remote sensing technology  and high performance computing             This has led to the availability of large high quality datasets and more advanced algorithms 


Significance edit 
Complexity of earth science edit 
Problems in earth science are often complex             It is difficult to apply well known and described mathematical models to the natural environment  therefore machine learning is commonly a better alternative for such non linear problems             Ecological data are commonly non linear and consist of higher order interactions  and together with missing data  traditional statistics may underperform as unrealistic assumptions such as linearity are applied to the model                         A number of researchers found that machine learning outperforms traditional statistical models in earth science  such as in characterizing forest canopy structure              predicting climate induced range shifts              and delineating geologic facies              Characterizing forest canopy structure enables scientists to study vegetation response to climate change              Predicting climate induced range shifts enable policy makers to adopt suitable conversation method to overcome the consequences of climate change              Delineating geologic facies helps geologists to understand the geology of an area  which is essential for the development and management of an area             

Inaccessible data edit 
In Earth Sciences  some data are often difficult to access or collect  therefore inferring data from data that are easily available by machine learning method is desirable              For example  geological mapping in tropical rainforests is challenging because the thick vegetation cover and rock outcrops are poorly exposed              Applying remote sensing with machine learning approaches provides an alternative way for rapid mapping without the need of manually mapping in the unreachable areas             

Reduce time costs edit 
Machine learning can also reduce the efforts done by experts  as manual tasks of classification and annotation etc  are the bottlenecks in the workflow of the research of earth science              Geological mapping  especially in a vast  remote area is labour  cost and time intensive with traditional methods              Incorporation of remote sensing and machine learning approaches can provide an alternative solution to eliminate some field mapping needs             

Consistent and bias free edit 
Consistency and bias free is also an advantage of machine learning compared to manual works by humans  In research comparing the performance of human and machine learning in the identification of dinoflagellates  machine learning is found to be not as prone to systematic bias as humans              A recency effect that is present in humans is that the classification often biases towards the most recently recalled classes              In a labelling task of the research  if one kind of dinoflagellates occurs rarely in the samples  then expert ecologists commonly will not classify it correctly              The systematic bias strongly deteriorate the classification accuracies of humans             

Optimal machine learning algorithm edit 
The extensive usage of machine learning in various fields has led to a wide range of algorithms of learning methods being applied  Choosing the optimal algorithm for a specific purpose can lead to a significant boost in accuracy              for example  the lithological mapping of gold bearing granite greenstone rocks in Hutti  India with AVIRIS NG hyperspectral data  shows more than     difference in overall accuracy between using support vector machines  SVMs  and random forest             
Some algorithms can also reveal hidden important information  white box models are transparent models  the outputs of which can be easily explained  while black box models are the opposite              For example  although an SVM yielded the best result in landslide susceptibility assessment accuracy  the result cannot be rewritten in the form of expert rules that explain how and why an area was classified as that specific class             In contrast  decision trees are transparent and easily understood  and the user can observe and fix the bias if any is present in such models            
If computational resource is a concern  more computationally demanding learning methods such as deep neural networks are less preferred  despite the fact that they may outperform other algorithms  such as in soil classification            

Usage edit 
Mapping edit 
Geological or lithological mapping and mineral prospectivity mapping edit 
Geological or lithological mapping produces maps showing geological features and geological units  Mineral prospectivity mapping utilizes a variety of datasets such as geological maps and aeromagnetic imagery to produce maps that are specialized for mineral exploration              Geological  lithological  and mineral prospectivity mapping can be carried out by processing data with ML techniques  with the input of spectral imagery obtained from remote sensing and geophysical data              Spectral imaging is also used   the imaging of wavelength bands in the electromagnetic spectrum  while conventional imaging captures three wavelength bands  red  green  blue  in the electromagnetic spectrum             
Random forests and SVMs are some algorithms commonly used with remotely sensed geophysical data  while Simple Linear Iterative Clustering Convolutional Neural Network  SLIC CNN             and Convolutional Neural Networks  CNNs              are commonly applied to aerial imagery  Large scale mapping can be carried out with geophysical data from airborne and satellite remote sensing geophysical data              and smaller scale mapping can be carried out with images from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  UAVs  for higher resolution            
Vegetation cover is one of the major obstacles for geological mapping with remote sensing  as reported in various research  both in large scale and small scale mapping  Vegetation affects the quality of spectral images              or obscures the rock information in aerial images

Methods of Splitting of the Datasets into Training Dataset and Testing Dataset As the training of machine learning for landslide susceptibility mapping requires both training and testing datasets  splitting the dataset is required  Two splitting methods for the datasets are presented on the geological map of the east Cumberland Gap  The method presented on the left   Splitting into two adjacent areas   is more useful as the automation algorithm can carry out mapping of a new area with the input of expert processed data of adjacent land  The cyan pixels show the training dataset while the remaining show the testing 
Landslide susceptibility and hazard mapping edit 
Landslide susceptibility refers to the probability of landslide of a certain geographical location  which is dependent on local terrain conditions              Landslide susceptibility mapping can highlight areas prone to landslide risks  which is useful for urban planning and disaster management             Such datasets for ML algorithms usually include topographic information  lithological information  satellite images  etc   and some may include land use  land cover  drainage information  and vegetation cover                                                according to the study requirements  As usual  for training an ML model for landslide susceptibility mapping  training and testing datasets are required             There are two methods of allocating datasets for training and testing  one is to randomly split the study area for the datasets  another is to split the whole study into two adjacent parts for the two datasets  To test classification models  the common practice is to split the study area randomly                         however  it is more useful if the study area can be split into two adjacent parts so that an automation algorithm can carry out mapping of a new area with the input of expert processed data of adjacent land

Feature identification and detection edit 
Data Augmentation TechniqueIn the preparation of the dataset for rock fracture recognition  data augmentation was performed  This technique is commonly used for increasing the training dataset size and variability  Although the randomly cropped samples and the flipped samples come from the same image  the processed samples are unique  This technique can prevent the problem of data scarcity and overfitting the model 
Discontinuity analyses edit 
Discontinuities such as fault planes and bedding planes have important implications in civil engineering              Rock fractures can be recognized automatically by machine learning through photogrammetric analysis  even with the presence of interfering objects such as vegetation              In ML training for classifying images  data augmentation is a common practice to avoid overfitting and increase the training dataset size and variability              For example  in a study of rock fracture recognition     images for training and    images for testing were prepared via random splitting              Data augmentation was performed  increasing the training dataset size to      images by flipping and random cropping              The approach was able to recognize rock fractures accurately in most cases              Both the negative prediction value  NPV  and the specificity were over                   This demonstrated the robustness of discontinuity analyses with machine learning

Carbon dioxide leakage detection edit 
Quantifying carbon dioxide leakage from a geological sequestration site has gained increased attention as the public is interested in whether carbon dioxide is stored underground safely and effectively              Carbon dioxide leakage from a geological sequestration site can be detected indirectly with the aid of remote sensing and an unsupervised clustering algorithm such as Iterative Self Organizing Data Analysis Technique  ISODATA               The increase in soil CO  concentration causes a stress response for plants by inhibiting plant respiration  as oxygen is displaced by carbon dioxide              The vegetation stress signal can be detected with the Normalized Difference Red Edge Index  NDRE               The hyperspectral images are processed by the unsupervised algorithm  clustering pixels with similar plant responses              The hyperspectral information in areas with known CO  leakage is extracted so that areas with leakage can be matched with the clustered pixels with spectral anomalies              Although the approach can identify CO  leakage efficiently  there are some limitations that require further study              The NDRE may not be accurate due to reasons like higher chlorophyll absorption  variation in vegetation  and shadowing effects  therefore  some stressed pixels can be incorrectly classed as healthy              Seasonality  groundwater table height may also affect the stress response to CO  of the vegetation

Quantification of water inflow edit 
The rock mass rating  RMR              system is a widely adopted rock mass classification system by geomechanical means with the input of six parameters  The amount of water inflow is one of the inputs of the classification scheme  representing the groundwater condition  Quantification of the water inflow in the faces of a rock tunnel was traditionally carried out by visual observation in the field  which is labour and time consuming  and fraught with safety concerns              Machine learning can determine water inflow by analyzing images taken on the construction site              The classification of the approach mostly follows the RMR system  but combining damp and wet states  as it is difficult to distinguish only by visual inspection                          The images were classified into the non damaged state  wet state  dripping state  flowing state  and gushing state              The accuracy of classifying the images was approximately

Classification edit 
Soil classification edit 
The most popular cost effective method od soil investigation method is cone penetration testing  CPT               The test is carried out by pushing a metallic cone through the soil  the force required to push at a constant rate is recorded as a quasi continuous log             Machine learning can classify soil with the input of CPT data             In an attempt to classify with ML  there are two tasks required to analyze the data  namely segmentation and classification             Segmentation can be carried out with the Constraint Clustering and Classification  CONCC  algorithm to split a single series data into segments             Classification can then be carried out by algorithms such as decision trees  SVMs  or neural networks

Geological structure classification edit 
Effect of Colour Image and Greyscale ImageThe figure shows an image of a fold  The left image shows a colour image  while the one in the right shows a grayscale image  The difference in the accuracy of classifying the geological structure between colour images and grayscale images is little 
Exposed geological structures such as anticlines  ripple marks  and xenoliths can be identified automatically with deep learning models              Research has demonstrated that three layer CNNs and transfer learning have strong accuracy  about     and     respectively   while others like k nearest neighbors  k NN   regular neural nets  and extreme gradient boosting  XGBoost  have low accuracies  ranging from                         The grayscale images and colour images were both tested  with the accuracy difference being little  implying that colour is not very important in identifying geological structures

Forecast and predictions edit 
Earthquake early warning systems and forecasting edit 
Earthquake warning systems are often vulnerable to local impulsive noise  therefore giving out false alerts              False alerts can be eliminated by discriminating the earthquake waveforms from noise signals with the aid of ML methods  The method consists of two parts  the first being unsupervised learning with a generative adversarial network  GAN  to learn and extract features of first arrival P waves  and the second being use of a random forest to discriminate P waves  This approach achieved       in recognizing P waves  and can avoid false triggers by noise signals with       accuracy             
Earthquakes can be produced in a laboratory settings to mimic real world ones  With the help of machine learning  the patterns of acoustic signals as precursors for earthquakes can be identified  Predicting the time remaining before failure was demonstrated in a study with continuous acoustic time series data recorded from a fault  The algorithm applied was a random forest  trained with a set of slip events  performing strongly in predicting the time to failure  It identified acoustic signals to predict failures  with one of them being previously unidentified  Although this laboratory earthquake is not as complex as a natural one  progress was made that guides future earthquake prediction work

Streamflow discharge prediction edit 
Real time streamflow data is integral for decision making  e g   evacuations  or regulation of reservoir water levels during flooding               Streamflow data can be estimated by data provided by stream gauges  which measure the water level of a river  However  water and debris from flooding may damage stream gauges  resulting in lack of essential real time data  The ability of machine learning to infer missing data             enables it to predict streamflow with both historical stream gauge data and real time data 
Streamflow Hydrology Estimate using Machine Learning  SHEM  is a model that can serve this purpose  To verify its accuracies  the prediction result was compared with the actual recorded data  and the accuracies were found to be between      and

Challenge edit 
Inadequate training data edit 
An adequate amount of training and validation data is required for machine learning              However  some very useful products like satellite remote sensing data only have decades of data since the     s  If one is interested in the yearly data  then only less than    samples are available              Such amount of data may not be adequate  In a study of automatic classification of geological structures  the weakness of the model is the small training dataset  even though with the help of data augmentation to increase the size of the dataset              Another study of predicting streamflow found that the accuracies depend on the availability of sufficient historical data  therefore sufficient training data determine the performance of machine learning              Inadequate training data may lead to a problem called overfitting  Overfitting causes inaccuracies in machine learning             as the model learns about the noise and undesired details 

Limited by data input edit 
Machine learning cannot carry out some of the tasks as a human does easily  For example  in the quantification of water inflow in rock tunnel faces by images for Rock Mass Rating system  RMR               the damp and the wet state was not classified by machine learning because discriminating the two only by visual inspection is not possible  In some tasks  machine learning may not able to fully substitute manual work by a human 

Black box operation edit 
Black box Operation of some Machine Learning Algorithms  In a black box operation  a user only know about the input and output but not the process  Artificial Neural Network  ANN  is an example of a black box operation  The user has no way to understand the logic of the hidden layers 
In many machine learning algorithms  for example  Artificial Neural Network  ANN   it is considered as  black box  approach as clear relationships and descriptions of how the results are generated in the hidden layers are unknown               White box  approach such as decision tree can reveal the algorithm details to the users              If one wants to investigate the relationships  such  black box  approaches are not suitable  However  the performances of  black box  algorithms are usually better
