Waymo Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid undergoing testing in the San Francisco Bay Area       
Waymo LLC  formerly known as the Google Self Driving Car Project  is an American autonomous driving technology company headquartered in Mountain View  California  It is a subsidiary of Google s parent company  Alphabet Inc  
The company traces its origins to the Stanford Racing Team  which competed in the      and      Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  DARPA  Grand Challenges             Google s development of self driving technology began in January                             led by Sebastian Thrun  the former director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory  SAIL   and Anthony Levandowski  founder of     Systems and Anthony s Robots                        After almost two years of road testing  the project was revealed in October                                         
In fall       Google provided  the world s first fully driverless ride on public roads               In December       the project was renamed Waymo and spun out of Google as part of Alphabet              In October       Waymo became the first company to offer service to the public without safety drivers in the vehicle                                                  Waymo  as of       operates commercial robotaxi services in Phoenix  Arizona   San Francisco  California   Silicon Valley  California               Los Angeles  California                Miami  Florida            and Austin  Texas             with new services planned in Atlanta  Georgia and Tokyo  Japan                          As of April               update       it offers over         paid rides per week  totalling over   million miles weekly                         
Waymo is run by co CEOs Tekedra Mawakana and Dmitri Dolgov              The company raised US          billion in multiple outside funding rounds             by      and raised      billion funding in                   Waymo has or had partnerships with multiple vehicle manufacturers  including Stellantis              Mercedes Benz Group AG              Jaguar Land Rover              and Volvo Cars             


History edit 
Ground work edit 
Google s development of self driving technology began on January                          non primary source needed      at Google X lab  run by co founder Sergey Brin             The project was launched at Google by Sebastian Thrun  the former director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory  SAIL  and Anthony Levandowski  founder of     Systems and Anthony s Robots                       
The initial software code and artificial intelligence  AI  design of the effort started before the team worked at Google  when Thrun and    engineers  including Dmitri Dolgov  Mike Montemerlo  Hendrik Dahlkamp  Sven Strohband  and David Stavens  built Stanley and Junior  Stanford s entries in the      and      DARPA Challenges  Later  aspects of this technology were used in a digital mapping project for SAIL called VueTool                                     In       Google acqui hired the entire VueTool team to help advance Google s Street View technology                                                 
As part of Street View development      Toyota Priuses            were outfitted with Topcon digital mapping hardware developed by     Systems                                    
In       the Street View team launched project Ground Truth              to create accurate road maps by extracting data from satellites and street views             

Pribot edit 
In February       a Discovery Channel producer for the documentary series Prototype This  phoned Levandowski                          The producer requested to borrow Levandowski s Ghost Rider  the autonomous two wheeled motorcycle Levandowski s Berkeley team had built for the      DARPA Grand Challenge            that Levandowski had later donated to the Smithsonian              Since the motorcycle was not available  Levandowski offered to retrofit a Toyota Prius as a self driving pizza delivery car for the show             
As a Google employee  Levandowski asked Larry Page and Thrun whether Google was interested in participating in the show  Both declined  citing liability issues             However  they authorized Levandowski to move forward with the project  as long as it was not associated with Google                          Within weeks Levandowski founded Anthony s Robots to do so              He retrofitted the car with light detection and ranging technology  lidar   sensors  and cameras  The Stanford team  Stanley  vehicle   provided its code base to the project             The ensuing episode depicting Pribot delivering pizza across the San Francisco Bay Bridge under police escort aired in December                                                     
The project success led Google to greenlight Google s self driving car program in January                  In       Google acquired     Systems  co founded by Levandowski  Pierre Yves Droz and Andrew Schultz   and Anthony s Robots for an estimated US         million                                                             Levandowski s vehicle and hardware  and Stanford s AI technology and software  became the nucleus of the project

Project Chauffeur edit 
After almost two years of road testing with seven vehicles  the New York Times revealed the existence of Google s project on October                     Google announced its initiative later the same day                         
Starting in       lawmakers in various states expressed concerns over how to regulate autonomous vehicles  A related Nevada law went into effect on March                      Google had been lobbying for such laws                                      A modified Prius was licensed by the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles  DMV  in May                   The car was  driven  by Chris Urmson with Levandowski in the passenger seat              This was the first US license for a self driven car             

In January                  Google was granted a patent for a transportation service funded by advertising that included autonomous vehicles as a transport method              In late May  Google revealed an autonomous prototype  which had no steering wheel  gas pedal  or brake pedal                          In December  Google unveiled a Firefly prototype that was planned to be tested on San Francisco Bay Area roads beginning in early                               A self driving car with the previous Google branding       In       Levandowski left the project  In August       Google hired former Hyundai Motor executive  John Krafcik  as CEO              In fall       Google provided  the world s first fully driverless ride on public roads  in Austin  Texas to Steve Mahan  former CEO of the Santa Clara Valley Blind Center  who was a legally blind friend of principal engineer Nathaniel Fairfield              It was the first entirely autonomous trip on a public road  It was not accompanied by a test driver or police escort              The car had no steering wheel or floor pedals              By the end of       Project Chauffeur had covered more than a million miles             
Google spent           billion on the project between      and       For comparison  the acquisition of Cruise Automation by General Motors in March      was for           million  and Uber s acquisition of Otto in August      was for           million             

Waymo edit 
In May       Google and Stellantis announced an order of     Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans to test the self driving technology              In December       the project changed its name to Waymo and span out of Google as part of Alphabet              The name was derived from  a new way forward in mobility               In May       the company opened a        square foot             m   technology center in Novi  Michigan             
In       Waymo sued Uber for allegedly stealing trade secrets              Waymo began testing minivans without a safety driver on public roads in Chandler  Arizona  in October                   In       Waymo unveiled new sensors and chips that are less expensive to manufacture  cameras that improve visibility  and wipers to clear the lidar system              At the beginning of the self driving car program  they used a         lidar system from Velodyne              In       the cost decreased approximately    percent  as Waymo converted to in house built lidar              Waymo has applied its technology to various cars including the Prius  Audi TT  Fiat Chrysler Pacifica  and Lexus RX   h                          Waymo partners with Lyft on pilot projects and product development              Waymo ordered an additional     Pacifica hybrids in      

Waymo operated Jaguar I Pace in San Francisco       
In March       Jaguar Land Rover announced that Waymo had ordered up to        of its I Pace electric SUVs at an estimated cost of more than         billion                          In late May       Alphabet announced plans to add up to        Pacifica Hybrid minivans to the fleet                          Also in May       Waymo established Huimo Business Consulting subsidiary in Shanghai             
In April       Waymo announced plans for vehicle assembly in Detroit at the former American Axle  amp  Manufacturing plant  bringing between     and     jobs to the area  Waymo used vehicle assembler Magna to turn Jaguar I PACE electric SUVs and Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans into Waymo Level   autonomous vehicles                          Waymo subsequently reverted to retrofitting existing models rather than a custom design             
In March       Waymo Via was launched after the company s announcement that it had raised            billion from investors              In May       Waymo raised an additional           million              In July       the company announced an exclusive partnership with auto manufacturer Volvo to integrate Waymo technology                         
In April       Krafcik was replaced by two co CEOs  Waymo s COO Tekedra Mawakana and CTO Dmitri Dolgov              Waymo raised           billion in another funding round in June                               with total funding of           billion              Waymo launched a consumer testing program in San Francisco in August                              
In May       Waymo started a pilot program seeking riders in downtown Phoenix  Arizona                          In May       Waymo announced that it would expand the program to more areas of Phoenix              In       coverage of the Waymo One area was increased by    square miles           km    expanding to include downtown Mesa  uptown Phoenix  and South Mountain Village                                     
In June       Waymo announced a partnership with Uber  under which Waymo will integrate its autonomous technology into Uber s freight truck service              Plans to expand the program to Los Angeles were announced in late                   On December           Waymo applied for the final permit necessary to operate fully autonomous taxis  without a backup driver present  within the state of California             
In January       The Information reported that Waymo staff were among those affected by Google s layoffs of around        workers  TechCrunch reported that Waymo was set to kill its trucking program             
In July       Waymo began testing its sixth generation robotaxis which are based on electric vehicles by Chinese automobile company Zeekr  developed in a partnership first announced in                               They were anticipated to reduce costs  at a time when Waymo was operating at a loss             
In October       Waymo closed a      billion funding round led by Alphabet  aimed at expanding its robotaxi services  bringing its total capital to over     billion              Around that time  the New York Times described Waymo as being  far ahead of the competition   in particular after Cruise had to suspend its operations after an accident in                  

Technology edit 
A Lexus RX   h retrofitted by Google for its self driving car project       
Google has invested heavily in matrix multiplication and video processing hardware such as the Tensor Processing Unit  TPU  to augment Nvidia s graphics processing units  GPUs  and Intel central processing units  CPUs               Much of this is kept as trade secrets  but transformer technology is likely involved             
Waymo manufactures a suite of self driving hardware developed in house              This includes sensors and hardware enhanced vision system  radar  and lidar                          Sensors give     degree views while lidar detects objects up to     metres           ft  away              Short range lidar images objects near the vehicle  while radar is used to see around other vehicles and track objects in motion             
Riders push a button to  start ride   and have optional  help    lock   and  pull over  buttons  if needed  The ride usually completes without pressing any button after starting the ride  The car s steering wheel turns as the car makes turns  and a passenger may sit in the right front passenger seat  if desired  Passengers see on a screen some of what the car s sensors see  including pedestrians      citation needed     
Waymo s deep learning architecture VectorNet predicts vehicle trajectories in complex traffic scenarios  It uses a graph neural network to model the interactions between vehicles and has demonstrated state of the art performance on several benchmark datasets for trajectory prediction             
Waymo Carcraft is a virtual world in which Waymo simulates driving conditions                          The simulator was named after the video game World of Warcraft                          With Carcraft         virtual self driving cars navigate through models of Austin  Texas  Mountain View  California  Phoenix  Arizona  and other cities             
As of       Waymo s fifth generation robotaxis were based on customized Jaguar I Pace electric vehicles that according to Dolgov adds up to          to vehicle costs              Other costs include technicians that monitor rides  service personnel  and real estate for storing and charging the vehicles             

Road testing edit 
Chronology edit 
A Toyota Prius modified to operate as a Google driverless car  navigating a test course                    
In       Google began testing its self driving cars in the San Francisco Bay Area              
By December       Nevada  Florida  California  and Michigan had passed laws permitting autonomous cars               A law proposed in Texas allowed testing                           
In June       Waymo announced that their vehicles had driven over                mi                 km  and that in the process they had encountered         stop signs          traffic lights  and     million other vehicles               Prototype vehicles were driving in Mountain View               Speeds were limited to         mph          km h  and had safety drivers aboard               Google took its first driverless ride on public roads in October       when Mahan took a    minute ride around Austin in a Google  pod car  with no steering wheel or pedals               Google expanded its road testing to Texas  where regulations did not prohibit cars without pedals or a steering wheel              
In       road testing expanded to Phoenix and Kirkland  Washington  which has a wet climate               As of June               update       Google had test driven its fleet of vehicles in autonomous mode a total of                mi                 km                In August      alone  their cars traveled a  total of         miles  of those          miles were autonomous  i e   the car was fully in control                
In       Waymo reported a total of         miles covered by the fleet in autonomous mode  and the associated     disengagements  for the period from December          through November                        In November Waymo altered its Arizona testing by removing safety drivers              The cars were geofenced within a     square mile           km   region surrounding Chandler  Arizona             
In       Waymo began testing its level   cars in Arizona to take advantage of good weather  simple roads  and permissive laws with minimal disclosure requirements             
In       Waymo began testing in Michigan               Also  in       Waymo unveiled its Castle test facility in Central Valley  California  Castle  a former airbase  has served as the project s training course since                  
In March       Waymo announced its plans for experiments with the company s self driving trucks delivering freight to Google data centers in Atlanta  Georgia               In October       the California Department of Motor Vehicles issued a permit for Waymo to operate cars without safety drivers  Waymo was the first company to receive a permit that allowed day and night testing on public roads and highways  Waymo announced that its service would include Mountain View  Sunnyvale  Los Altos  and Palo Alto                            In July       Waymo received permission to transport passengers              
In December       Waymo launched Waymo One  transporting passengers  The service used safety drivers to monitor some rides  with others provided in select areas without them  In November       Waymo One became the first autonomous service worldwide to operate without safety drivers                                        
By January       Waymo had completed twenty million miles                  km  of driving on public roads                           
In August       commercial Waymo One test service started in San Francisco  beginning with a  trusted tester  rollout              
In March       Waymo began offering rides for Waymo staff in San Francisco without a driver              
As of October               update       Waymo is offering         paid rides per week across its Phoenix  San Francisco  and Los Angeles markets              
In December       Waymo announced its first international expansion with testing in Tokyo  Japan in the neighborhoods of Shinjuku  Shibuya  Minato  Chiyoda  Ch    Shinagawa  and K t  in partnership with Nihon Kotsu and Japan s GO taxi app             
As of March       Waymo is offering         paid rides per week in its existing markets  including Phoenix  San Francisco and Los Angeles             
In March       Waymo expanded its commercial robotaxi services to Silicon Valley and Austin  Texas  The Silicon Valley rollout included Mountain View  Palo Alto  Los Altos  and parts of Sunnyvale  marking the company s first official service in the region              Meanwhile  in Austin  Waymo partnered with Uber  allowing riders to hail its self driving vehicles through the Uber app               The expansion is part of Waymo s broader growth strategy  as the company continues scaling its autonomous ride hailing operations  On March     Waymo announced it will launch a commercial robotaxi service in Washington D C  in       pending regulatory approval               The company is currently operating a small test fleet in the capital and plans to work with local policymakers to allow fully driverless vehicles on public roads 
As of April       Waymo s robotaxi program is operating in Miami s Downtown  Brickell   Edgewater  Wynwood  Midtown and  Design District   Additionally  preparatory testing is taking place in Coral Gables              In Tokyo  Waymo is launching its preparatory testing in  Minato  Shinjuku  Shibuya   Chiyoda   Ch    and K t                And in Atlanta  Waymo has announced its intent to launch robotaxi services during Summer                   

Crashes edit 
By July       Google s    self driving cars had been involved in    minor collisions on public roads               Google maintained that  in all but one case  the vehicle was not at fault because the cars were either driven manually or the driver of another vehicle was at fault                                        
By July       the NHTSA had found     crashes by Waymo  Under NHTSA rules  crashes were reported if the system was in use in the prior    seconds  though most crashes did not have injuries              
Waymo regularly publishes safety reports               Waymo is required by the California DMV to report the number of incidents where the safety driver took control for safety reasons  Some incidents were not reported when simulations indicated that the car would have stopped safely on its own               In       Waymo claimed only   crashes with injuries over          million miles driven  nearly twice as safe as a human driver              
A Waymo robotaxi killed a dog in San Francisco while in  autonomous mode  in May                   
In February       a driverless Waymo robotaxi struck a cyclist in San Francisco               Later that same month  Waymo issued recalls for     of its vehicles after two hit the same truck being towed on a highway                                        
By the end of       the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  had received     reports              documenting     incidents involving Waymo vehicles              
On January           a Tesla traveling at         mph           km h  in San Francisco struck multiple vehicles  including an unoccupied Waymo car  The crash resulted in the death of    year old Mikhael Romanenko and his dog  with seven others injured  The Tesla driver was arrested on charges including vehicular manslaughter                           

Limitations edit 
Waymo operates in some of its testing markets  such as Chandler  Arizona  at L  autonomy with no one sitting behind the steering wheel  sharing roadways with other drivers and pedestrians                           Waymo s earlier testing focused on areas without harsh weather  extreme density  or complicated road systems  but it has moved on to test under new conditions                            As a result  beginning in       Waymo began testing in areas with harsher conditions  such as its winter testing in Michigan              
In       a critic wrote in the MIT Technology Review that unmapped stoplights would cause problems with Waymo s technology and the self driving technology could not detect potholes  Additionally  the lidar technology cannot spot some potholes or discern when humans  such as a police officer  signal the car to stop  the critic wrote               Waymo has worked to improve how its technology responds in construction zones                           
California regulators do not require Waymo to disclose every incident involving erratic behavior in its fleet  In the first five months of       San Francisco officials said they had logged more than     incidents in which a Cruise or Waymo vehicle might have created a safety hazard              
In       it was noted that Waymo cars kept routing through the Richmond District of San Francisco  with up to    cars each day driving to a dead end street before turning around               In       ABC  News Bay Area posted a video of a journalist taking a ride in a Waymo vehicle  which stopped at a green light and dropped the journalist at the wrong stop twice  despite support intervention              

Backlash edit 
In       the San Francisco group Safe Street Rebel used a practice called  coning  to trap Waymo and Cruise cars with traffic cones as a form of protest after claiming that the cars had been involved in hundreds of incidents               During the      Lunar New Year in San Francisco Chinatown  a mob of vandals attacked  graffitied  and set fire to a Waymo car  No one was injured                            In       passengers during a Waymo ride described an attack by an onlooker who attempted to cover the car s sensors              
In       the city attorney of San Francisco attempted to sue to prevent expansion of driverless vehicles including Waymo into San Francisco               San Mateo County government soon after also sent a letter to regulators opposing expansion to its county              
In May       the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  launched an investigation into potential flaws in Waymo vehicles  focusing on    incidents that included Waymo vehicles ramming into a closing gate  driving on the wrong side of the road  and at least    crashes or fires              
In August of       residents of San Francisco s SoMa district began to complain about noise pollution from Waymo vehicles honking at each other in a local parking lot  Residents reported that the car horns could be heard daily  with varying levels of activity  usually peaking at around   AM and during evening rush hour  The honking appears to have been triggered by the self driving cars backing in and out of the lot               The story caught attention after a resident began live streaming the cars with lofi hip hop music  Since then  Waymo Director of Product  amp  Ops  Vishay Nihalani has appeared on the live stream to apologize and offer an explanation  Nihalani has assured locals that the honking will be fixed as further software updates are implemented              

Services edit 
In       Waymo highlighted four specific business uses for its autonomous tech  robotaxis  trucking and logistics  urban public transportation  and passenger cars              

Robotaxis edit

Waymo offers robotaxi services in Phoenix  Arizona  San Francisco               and Los Angeles  California              

Trucking and delivery edit 
Waymo Via  launched in      to work with OEMs to get its technology into vehicles                                        The company is testing Class   tractor trailers              in Atlanta               and southwest shipping routes across Texas  New Mexico  Arizona  and California               The company operates a trucking hub in Dallas  Texas               It is partnering with Daimler to integrate autonomous technology into a fleet of Freightliner Cascadia trucks              
Waymo operates    Class   autonomous trucks with safety drivers               In      Waymo issued a joint application along with Aurora Innovation to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration for a five year exemption from rules that require drivers to place reflective triangles or a flare around a stopped tractor trailer truck  to avoid needing human drivers  in favor of warning beacons mounted on the truck cab              
Waymo tested its technology in commercial delivery vehicles with United Parcel Service                            In July      Waymo and Stellantis expanded their partnership  including the development of Ram ProMaster delivery vehicles              

Legal matters edit 
Waymo LLC v  Uber Technologies  Inc  et al  edit 
In February       Waymo sued Uber and its subsidiary self driving trucking company  Otto  alleging trade secret theft and patent infringement  The company claimed that three ex Google employees  including Anthony Levandowski  had stolen trade secrets  including thousands of files  from Google before joining Uber               The alleged infringement was related to Waymo s proprietary lidar technology                            Google accused Uber of colluding with Levandowski               Levandowski allegedly downloaded   gigabytes of data that included over a hundred trade secrets  eight of which were at stake during the trial                           
An ensuing settlement gave Waymo       of Uber stock               the equivalent of           million  Uber agreed not to infringe Waymo s intellectual property               Part of the agreement included a guarantee that  Waymo confidential information is not being incorporated in Uber Advanced Technologies Group hardware and software                In statements released after the settlement  Uber maintained that it received no trade secrets               In May  according to an Uber spokesman  Uber had fired Levandowski  which resulted in the loss of roughly           million of his equity in Uber  which almost exactly equaled the settlement               Uber announced that it was halting production of self driving trucks through Otto in July       and the subsidiary company was shuttered              

California disclosure dispute edit 
In January       Waymo sued the California Department of Motor Vehicles  DMV  to prevent data on driverless crashes from being released to the public  Waymo maintained that such information constituted a trade secret               According to The Los Angeles Times  the  topics Waymo wants to keep hidden include how it plans to handle driverless car emergencies  what it would do if a robot taxi started driving itself where it wasn t supposed to go  and what constraints there are on the car s ability to traverse San Francisco s tunnels  tight curves and steep hills               
In February       Waymo was successful in preventing the release of robotaxi safety records  A Waymo spokesperson affirmed that the company would be transparent about its safety record
