Set of beliefs or values
An ideology is a set of beliefs or values attributed to a person or group of persons  especially those held for reasons that are not purely about belief in certain knowledge                        in which  practical elements are as prominent as theoretical ones              Formerly applied primarily to economic  political  or religious theories and policies  in a tradition going back to Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels  more recent use treats the term as mainly condemnatory            
The term was coined by Antoine Destutt de Tracy  a French Enlightenment aristocrat and philosopher  who conceived it in      as the  science of ideas  to develop a rational system of ideas to oppose the irrational impulses of the mob  In political science  the term is used in a descriptive sense to refer to political belief systems            


Etymology edit 
Antoine Destutt de Tracy coined the term ideology 
The term ideology originates from French id ologie  itself coined from combining Greek  id               notion  pattern       close to the Lockean sense of idea  and  log                  the study of       

History edit 
The term  ideology  and the system of ideas associated with it were developed in      by Antoine Destutt de Tracy              who crystallised his ideas while in prison  November      to October       pending trial during the Reign of Terror of c             to July       While imprisoned he read the works of Locke and  tienne Bonnot de Condillac            
Hoping to form a secure foundation for the moral and political sciences  Tracy devised the term for a  science of ideas   basing such upon two things      the sensations that people experience as they interact with the material world  and     the ideas that form in their minds due to those sensations  Tracy conceived of ideology as a liberal philosophy that would defend individual liberty  property  free markets  and constitutional limits on state power  He argues that  among these aspects  ideology is the most generic term because the  science of ideas  also contains the study of their expression and deduction             The coup d  tat that overthrew Maximilien Robespierre in July      allowed Tracy to pursue his work                 need quotation to verify      Tracy reacted to the terroristic phase of the revolution  during the Napoleonic regime of      to      as part of the Napoleonic Wars      clarification needed      by trying to work out a rational system of ideas to oppose the irrational mob impulses that had nearly destroyed him 
A subsequent early source for the near original meaning of ideology is Hippolyte Taine s work on the Ancien R gime  Origins of Contemporary France  French  Les Origines de la France Contemporaine  volume I         He describes ideology as rather like teaching philosophy via the Socratic method  though without extending the vocabulary beyond what the general reader already possessed  and without the examples from observation that practical science would require  Taine identifies it not just with Tracy but also with his milieu  and includes Condillac as one of its precursors 
Napoleon Bonaparte             came to view ideology as a term of abuse  which he often hurled against his liberal foes in Tracy s Institut national      citation needed      According to Karl Mannheim s historical reconstruction of the shifts in the meaning of ideology  the modern meaning of the word was born when Napoleon used it to describe his opponents as  the ideologues       citation needed      Tracy s major book  The Elements of Ideology  French   l mens d id ologie  published             was soon translated into major European languages 
In the century following Tracy s formulations  the term ideology moved back and forth between positive and negative connotations  When post Napoleonic governments adopted a reactionary stance  the concept influenced the Italian  Spanish and Russian thinkers who had begun to describe themselves as liberals and who attempted to reignite revolutionary activity in the early     s  including the Carbonari societies in France and Italy and the Decembrists in Russia  Karl Marx             adopted Napoleon s negative sense of the term  using it in his writings  in which he once described Tracy as a fischbl tige Bourgeoisdoktrin r  a  fish blooded bourgeois doctrinaire               The term has since dropped some of its pejorative sting  euphemism treadmill   and has become a neutral term in the analysis of differing political opinions and views of social groups             While Marx situated the term within class struggle and domination                         others believed it was a necessary part of institutional functioning and social integration             
In parallel with post Soviet Russian ideas about the mono ideologies of  for example  monotheism  Walter Brueggemann          has examined  ideological extension  in historical religious political contexts             

Definitions and analysis edit 
There are many different kinds of ideologies  including political  social  epistemological  and ethical  Recent analysis tends to posit that ideology is a  coherent system of ideas  that rely on a few basic assumptions about reality that may or may not have any factual basis  Through this system  ideas become coherent  repeated patterns through the subjective ongoing choices that people make  These ideas serve as the seed around which further thought grows  The belief in an ideology can range from passive acceptance up to fervent advocacy  Definitions  such as by Manfred Steger and Paul James  emphasize both the issue of patterning and contingent claims to truth  They wrote   Ideologies are patterned clusters of normatively imbued ideas and concepts  including particular representations of power relations  These conceptual maps help people navigate the complexity of their political universe and carry claims to social truth              
Studies of the concept of ideology itself  rather than specific ideologies  have been carried out under the name of systematic ideology in the works of George Walford and Harold Walsby  who attempt to explore the relationships between ideology and social systems      example needed      David W  Minar describes six different ways the word ideology has been used             

As a collection of certain ideas with certain kinds of content  usually normative 
As the form or internal logical structure that ideas have within a set 
By the role ideas play in human social interaction 
By the role ideas play in the structure of an organization 
As meaning  whose purpose is persuasion  and
As the locus of social interaction 
For Willard A  Mullins  an ideology should be contrasted with the related  but different  issues of utopia and historical myth  An ideology is composed of four basic characteristics             

it must have power over cognition 
it must be capable of guiding one s evaluations 
it must provide guidance towards action  and
it must be logically coherent 
Terry Eagleton outlines  more or less in no particular order  some definitions of ideology             

The process of production of meanings  signs and values in social life
A body of ideas characteristic of a particular social group or class
Ideas that help legitimate a dominant political power
False ideas that help legitimate a dominant political power
Systematically distorted communication
Ideas that offer a position for a subject
Forms of thought motivated by social interests
Identity thinking
Socially necessary illusion
The conjuncture of discourse and power
The medium in which conscious social actors make sense of their world
Action oriented sets of beliefs
The confusion of linguistic and phenomenal reality
Semiotic closure                                  
The indispensable medium in which individuals live out their relations to a social structure
The process that converts social life to a natural reality
German philosopher Christian Duncker called for a  critical reflection of the ideology concept               In his work  he strove to bring the concept of ideology into the foreground  as well as the closely connected concerns of epistemology and history  defining ideology in terms of a system of presentations that explicitly or implicitly lay claim to absolute truth 

Marxist interpretation edit 
Karl Marx posits that a society s dominant ideology is integral to its superstructure 
Marx s analysis sees ideology as a system of false consciousness that arises from the economic relationships  reflecting and perpetuating the interests of the dominant class             
In the Marxist base and superstructure model of society  base denotes the relations of production and modes of production  and superstructure denotes the dominant ideology  i e  religious  legal  political systems   The economic base of production determines the political superstructure of a society  Ruling class interests determine the superstructure and the nature of the justifying ideology actions feasible because the ruling class control the means of production  For example  in a feudal mode of production  religious ideology is the most prominent aspect of the superstructure  while in capitalist formations  ideologies such as liberalism and social democracy dominate  Hence the great importance of ideology justifies a society and politically confuses the alienated groups of society via false consciousness  Some explanations have been presented  Antonio Gramsci uses cultural hegemony to explain why the working class have a false ideological conception of what their best interests are  Marx argued   The class which has the means of material production at its disposal has control at the same time over the means of mental production              
The Marxist formulation of  ideology as an instrument of social reproduction  is conceptually important to the sociology of knowledge              viz  Karl Mannheim  Daniel Bell  and J rgen Habermas et al  Moreover  Mannheim has developed and progressed from the  total  but  special  Marxist conception of ideology to a  general  and  total  ideological conception acknowledging that all ideology  including Marxism  resulted from social life  an idea developed by the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu  Slavoj  i ek and the earlier Frankfurt School added to the  general theory  of ideology a psychoanalytic insight that ideologies do not include only conscious but also unconscious ideas 

Ideology and the commodity  Debord  edit 
The French Marxist theorist Guy Debord  founding member of the Situationist International  argued that when the commodity becomes the  essential category  of society  i e  when the process of commodification has been consummated to its fullest extent  the image of society propagated by the commodity  as it describes all of life as constituted by notions and objects deriving their value only as commodities tradeable in terms of exchange value   colonizes all of life and reduces society to a mere representation  The Society of the Spectacle             

Unifying agents  Hoffer  edit 
The American philosopher Eric Hoffer identified several elements that unify followers of a particular ideology             

Hatred   Mass movements can rise and spread without a God  but never without belief in a devil               The  ideal devil  is a foreigner                                  
Imitation   The less satisfaction we derive from being ourselves  the greater is our desire to be like others the more we mistrust our judgment and luck  the more are we ready to follow the example of others                                      
Persuasion  The proselytizing zeal of propagandists derives from  a passionate search for something not yet found more than a desire to bestow something we already have                                    
Coercion  Hoffer asserts that violence and fanaticism are interdependent  People forcibly converted to Islamic or communist beliefs become as fanatical as those who did the forcing  He says   It takes fanatical faith to rationalize our cowardice                                      
Leadership  Without the leader  there is no movement  Often the leader must wait long in the wings until the time is ripe  He calls for sacrifices in the present  to justify his vision of a breathtaking future  The skills required include  audacity  brazenness  iron will  fanatical conviction  passionate hatred  cunning  a delight in symbols  ability to inspire blind faith in the masses  and a group of able lieutenants                                      Charlatanism is indispensable  and the leader often imitates both friend and foe   a single minded fashioning after a model   He will not lead followers towards the  promised land   but only  away from their unwanted selves                                      
Action  Original thoughts are suppressed  and unity encouraged  if the masses are kept occupied through great projects  marches  exploration and industry                                     
Suspicion   There is prying and spying  tense watching and a tense awareness of being watched   This pathological mistrust goes unchallenged and encourages conformity  not dissent                                   
Ronald Inglehart edit 
Ronald Inglehart of the University of Michigan is author of the World Values Survey  which  since       has mapped social attitudes in     countries representing     of global population  Results indicate that where people live is likely to closely correlate with their ideological beliefs  In much of Africa  South Asia and the Middle East  people prefer traditional beliefs and are less tolerant of liberal values  Protestant Europe  at the other extreme  adheres more to secular beliefs and liberal values  Alone among high income countries  the United States is exceptional in its adherence to traditional beliefs  in this case Christianity 

Political ideologies edit 
See also  List of political ideologies
In political science  a political ideology is a certain ethical set of ideals  principles  doctrines  myths  or symbols of a social movement  institution  class  or large group that explains how society should work  offering some political and cultural blueprint for a certain social order  Political ideologies are concerned with many different aspects of a society  including but not limited to  the economy  the government  the environment  education  health care  labor law  criminal law  the justice system  social security and welfare  public policy and administration  foreign policy  rights  freedoms and duties  citizenship  immigration  culture and national identity  military administration  and religion 
Political ideologies have two dimensions 

Goals  how society should work  and
Methods  the most appropriate ways to achieve the ideal arrangement 
A political ideology largely concerns itself with how to allocate power and to what ends power should be used  Some parties follow a certain ideology very closely  while others may take broad inspiration from a group of related ideologies without specifically embracing any one of them  Each political ideology contains certain ideas on what it considers the best form of government  e g   democracy  demagogy  theocracy  caliphate etc    scope of government  e g  authoritarianism  libertarianism  federalism  etc   and the best economic system  e g  capitalism  socialism  etc    Sometimes the same word is used to identify both an ideology and one of its main ideas  For instance  socialism may refer to an economic system  or it may refer to an ideology that supports that economic system  Post       many commentators claim that we are living in a post ideological age              in which redemptive  all encompassing ideologies have failed  This view is often associated with Francis Fukuyama s writings on the end of history              Contrastly  Nienhueser        sees research  in the field of human resource management  as ongoingly  generating ideology              
There are many proposed methods for the classification of political ideologies  Ideologies can identify themselves by their position on the political spectrum  e g  left  center  or right   They may also be distinguished by single issues around which they may be built  e g  civil libertarianism  support or opposition to European integration  legalization of marijuana   They may also be distinguished by political strategies  e g  populism  personalism   The classification of political ideology is difficult  however  due to cultural relativity in definitions  For example   what Americans now call conservatism much of the world calls liberalism or neoliberalism   a conservatism in Finland would be labeled socialism in the United States             
Philosopher Michael Oakeshott defines single issue ideologies as  the formalized abridgment of the supposed sub stratum of the rational truth contained in the tradition   Moreover  Charles Blattberg offers an account that distinguishes political ideologies from political philosophies             
Slavoj  i ek argues how the very notion of post ideology can enable the deepest  blindest form of ideology  A sort of false consciousness or false cynicism  engaged in for the purpose of lending one s point of view the respect of being objective  pretending neutral cynicism  without truly being so  Rather than help avoiding ideology  this lapse only deepens the commitment to an existing one  Zizek calls this  a post modernist trap               Peter Sloterdijk advanced the same idea already in                  
Studies have shown that political ideology is somewhat genetically heritable                                                                                     

Ideology and state edit 
Main article  Ideocracy
When a political ideology becomes a dominantly pervasive component within a government  one can speak of an ideocracy              Different forms of government use ideology in various ways  not always restricted to politics and society  Certain ideas and schools of thought become favored  or rejected  over others  depending on their compatibility with or use for the reigning social order 
In The Anatomy of Revolution  Crane Brinton said that new ideology spreads when there is discontent with an old regime              The may be repeated during revolutions itself  extremists such as Vladimir Lenin and Robespierre may thus overcome more moderate revolutionaries              This stage is soon followed by Thermidor  a reining back of revolutionary enthusiasm under pragmatists like Napoleon and Joseph Stalin  who bring  normalcy and equilibrium               Brinton s sequence   men of ideas gt fanatics gt practical men of action   is reiterated by J  William Fulbright              while a similar form occurs in Eric Hoffer s The True Believer             

Epistemological ideologies edit 
Even when the challenging of existing beliefs is encouraged  as in scientific theories  the dominant paradigm or mindset can prevent certain challenges  theories  or experiments from being advanced  A special case of science that has inspired ideology is ecology  which studies the relationships among living things on Earth  Perceptual psychologist James J  Gibson believed that human perception of ecological relationships was the basis of self awareness and cognition itself              Linguist George Lakoff has proposed a cognitive science of mathematics wherein even the most fundamental ideas of arithmetic would be seen as consequences or products of human perception which is itself necessarily evolved within an ecology             
Deep ecology and the modern ecology movement  and  to a lesser degree  Green parties  appear to have adopted ecological sciences as a positive ideology              Some notable economically based ideologies include neoliberalism  monetarism  mercantilism  mixed economy  social Darwinism  communism  laissez faire economics  and free trade  There are also current theories of safe trade and fair trade that can be seen as ideologies 

Psychological explanations of ideology edit 
A large amount of research in psychology is concerned with the causes  consequences and content of ideology                                      with humans being dubbed the  ideological animal  by Althusser                                    Many theories have tried to explain the existence of ideology in human societies                                   
Jost  Ledgerwood  and Hardin        propose that ideologies may function as prepackaged units of interpretation that spread because of basic human motives to understand the world  avoid existential threat  and maintain valued interpersonal relationships              The authors conclude that such motives may lead disproportionately to the adoption of system justifying worldviews              Psychologists generally agree that personality traits  individual difference variables  needs  and ideological beliefs seem to have something in common             
Just world theory posits that people want to believe in a fair world for a sense of control and security and generate ideologies in order to maintain this belief  for example by justifiying inequality or unfortunate events  A critique of just world theory as a sole explanation of ideology is that it does not explain the differences between ideologies                                       
Terror management theory posits that ideology is used as a defence mechanism against threats to their worldview which in turn protect and individuals sense of self esteem and reduce their awareness of mortality  Evidence shows that priming individuals with an awareness of mortality does not cause individuals to respond in ways underpinned by any particular ideology  but rather the ideology that they are currently aware of                                   
System justification theory posits that people tend to defend existing society  even at times against their interest  which in turn causes people to create ideological explanations to justify the status quo  Jost  Fitzimmons and Kay argue that the motivation to protect a preexisting system is due to a desire for cognitive consistency  being able to think in similar ways over time   reducing uncertainty and reducing effort  illusion of control and fear of equality                                    According to system justification theory              ideologies reflect  unconscious  motivational processes  as opposed to the view that political convictions always reflect independent and unbiased thinking             

Ideology and the social sciences edit 
Semiotic theory edit 
According to semiotician Bob Hodge              Ideology  identifies a unitary object that incorporates complex sets of meanings with the social agents and processes that produced them  No other term captures this object as well as  ideology   Foucault s  episteme  is too narrow and abstract  not social enough  His  discourse   popular because it covers some of ideology s terrain with less baggage  is too confined to verbal systems   Worldview  is too metaphysical   propaganda  too loaded  Despite or because of its contradictions   ideology  still plays a key role in semiotics oriented to social  political life Authors such as Michael Freeden have also recently incorporated a semantic analysis to the study of ideologies 
Sociology edit 
Sociologists define ideology as  cultural beliefs that justify particular social arrangements  including patterns of inequality               Dominant groups use these sets of cultural beliefs and practices to justify the systems of inequality that maintain their group s social power over non dominant groups  Ideologies use a society s symbol system to organize social relations in a hierarchy  with some social identities being superior to other social identities  which are considered inferior  The dominant ideology in a society is passed along through the society s major social institutions  such as the media  the family  education  and religion              As societies changed throughout history  so did the ideologies that justified systems of inequality             
Sociological examples of ideologies include racism  sexism  heterosexism  ableism  and ethnocentrism             

Quotations edit 
 We do not need to believe in an ideology  All that is necessary is for each of us to develop our good human qualities  The need for a sense of universal responsibility affects every aspect of modern life     Dalai Lama            
 The function of ideology is to stabilize and perpetuate dominance through masking or illusion     Sally Haslanger            
  A n ideology differs from a simple opinion in that it claims to possess either the key to history  or the solution for all the  riddles of the universe   or the intimate knowledge of the hidden universal laws  which are supposed to rule nature and man     Hannah Arendt
