							As incidents escalate in reaction to the offensive movie about prophet Muhammed  columnists continue to analyse the mounting anger of Egyptians

Wael Qandil
What after invading the US embassy 
Al Shorouk newspaper

Recalling the latest chaos that took place within the margins of the US embassy in Cairo in reaction to the US anti Islam movie  Wael Qandil asks if Egyptians have eventually succeeded in passing their strong wave of frustration  The writer questions whether the topic was worth the violence and bloodshed  He states that our reaction is similar to the performance of a poor lawyer who has failed to win a lawsuit  Condemning those who have promoted to the offensive movie  the writer states it was even better that we criticise those who promoted it and ignited more hatred in our hearts 
After global news had focused attention Egypt  Qandil states that the country s reaction prompted Jewish people to feel victorious over our religion  The writer expresses his concern that Egyptians will pay the price of this incident as the new constitution is currently being drafted  Extremist Islamists have tarnished Islam       s image of tolerance and acceptance  Today  nobody dares to defend freedom of expression in our nation

Emad Al Din Hussein
 We will bring American down 
Al Shorouk newspaper

Hussein remembers when he passed through a protest against the US government and condemns the political manipulation exerted by Americans while providing Egypt with aid  He voices his support for the demonstrators who wish to witness the day when the US stops adding pressures on the Egyptian government as a price for the financial aid  The writer says that no foreign country would grant another with annual donations and aids without an expected return  Hussein believes that the Americans expect Egypt to maintain the peace treaty with Israel in return for the support 
While ordinary protesters are not to be blamed for their repeating slogans  Hussein condemns the spokesperson of ex presidential candidate Hazem Abu Ismail  Gamal Saber  who prayed in Tahrir Sqaure last Friday calling on Muslims to get ready as if the country is preparing for war  Simply  Egyptians are not entering a serious battle with the Americans as a result of the offensive movie  Figures such as Saber  who are frequently counted as politicians  contribute to the already inflammatory situation  Even if the sheikh is voicing his anger against the movie  the writer states that to provoke more hatred will lead to deterioration of the situation

Amr Hamzawy
Two faces for politics
Al  Watan newspaper

Keeping an eye on the political preparations that precede parliamentary elections  Hamzawy censures politicians who prefer their personal interests to their partisan devotion  The writer states that many activists intensify their efforts on widening their popularity while working on the ground with ordinary Egyptians  The main challenge lying ahead is the fact that while attempting to attract as many voters as possible  many drive Egyptians away from the correct political path 
As dates for parliamentary elections come closer  political forces are capable of utilising all mechanisms to increase their popularity  In many cases  using religion could be a magnet to attract the largest amount of Egyptians to the ballot box  In other cases  some politicians call for violence and the importance of protesting against the leader  It is only according to their profits that they play around with circumstances around them 
In Hamzawy s estimation  such powers destroy all building stones for a proper democratic process  Many politicians aim at nothing but winning in elections even if that would be at the expense of their ideological and political independence  The columnist praises other political figures  who have condemned the IMF loan  killing of diplomats in Libya  and invading of embassies  despite their political inclinations  The writer states that such politicians are the ones needed to build the infrastructure of democracy in Egypt

Ammar Ali Hassan
A Christian responds to the offensive movie
Al Watan newspaper

Hassan cites a message he has received from a Christian friend in reaction to the offensive film  The writer believes that the letter refutes all stereotypes about a sectarian strife currently being sparked within the community  The offensive movie is a massive incident that incited the anger of all Egyptians  regardless of their religion  However  Egyptians have to be aware that rushing into illogical reactions would mean nothing but more of violence and chaos  sAfter the recent incidents at the location of the US embassy  the world has been looking at Egyptians as barbarians  Hassan s friend then condemns those who insisted bringing this movie to light 
It has been produced for more than two years now  then why it has been decided to place emphasis on it these days  In his message  the writer s friend insists that the timing of the movie that coincides with      aims at provoking the Muslims and Christians at the same time  It could have been wiser that Egyptians react with a similar movie that correctively sends a message of tolerance and understanding   If we need to understand the world  then it is better for us to speak an understandable language in order to get a response   the message reads  In all cases  Egyptians must have responded to the offense directed to Islam and their prophet  The important aspect in the whole incident is the search for a calmer way to react and positive attitude towards the situation

Ibrahim Mansour
Inciters of the  offensive incidents 
Al Tahrir newspaper

After the recent offensive incidents erupting in reaction to the anti prophet Muhammed movie  Mansour condemns all Islamist political forces on inciting more violence in the country  Instead of focusing on the content of the movie  the writer argues that more attention is centered on the chaos occurring around the US embassy in Cairo  Calls for protests have been initiated by extremist figures practicing politics  A general hostile atmosphere has been hitting Egyptians against America  its government  and its people 
Mansour condemns that even after the US officially reacted to the issue  President Morsy has hailed Egyptians to respect international treaties  sSince that  Egyptian officials have taken their hands out of the protests that are increasingly growing in the area  where as demonstrators continue to clash with the security soldiers  Finally  Mansour affirms the right of Egyptians to protest against such an offensive movie  He censures the maltreatment of security officers while confronting angry demonstrators  The writer calls upon officials to fetch the genuine perpetuators of the offence
