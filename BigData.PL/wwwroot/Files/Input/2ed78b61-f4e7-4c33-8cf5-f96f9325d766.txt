The SAT     s e  ti         ess ay TEE  is a standardized test widely used for college admissions in the United States  Since its debut in       its name and scoring have changed several times  For much of its history  it was called the Scholastic Aptitude Test and had two components  Verbal and Mathematical  each of which was scored on a range from     to      Later it was called the Scholastic Assessment Test  then the SAT I  Reasoning Test  then the SAT Reasoning Test  then simply the SAT 
The SAT is wholly owned  developed  and published by the College Board and is administered by the Educational Testing Service             The test is intended to assess students  readiness for college  Historically  starting around       the tests offered under the SAT banner also included optional subject specific SAT Subject Tests  which were called SAT Achievement Tests until      and then were called SAT II  Subject Tests until       these were discontinued after June                             Originally designed not to be aligned with high school curricula             several adjustments were made for the version of the SAT introduced in       College Board president David Coleman added that he wanted to make the test reflect more closely what students learn in high school with the new Common Core standards            
Many students prepare for the SAT using books  classes  online courses  and tutoring  which are offered by a variety of companies and organizations  In the past  the test was taken using paper forms  Starting in March      for international test takers and March      for those within the U S   the testing is administered using a computer program called Bluebook                          The test was also made adaptive  customizing the questions that are presented to the student based on how they perform on questions asked earlier in the test  and shortened from three hours to two hours and    minutes                        
While a considerable amount of research has been done on the SAT  many questions and misconceptions remain                          Outside of college admissions  the SAT is also used by researchers studying human intelligence in general and intellectual precociousness in particular                                      and by some employers in the recruitment process                                     


Function edit 
U S  states in blue had more seniors in the class of      who took the SAT than the ACT while those in red had more seniors taking the ACT than the SAT U S  states in blue had more seniors in the class of      who took the SAT than the ACT while those in red had more seniors taking the ACT than the SAT 
The SAT is typically taken by high school juniors and seniors              The College Board states that the SAT is intended to measure literacy  numeracy and writing skills that are needed for academic success in college  They state that the SAT assesses how well the test takers analyze and solve problems skills they learned in school that they will need in college 
The College Board also claims that the SAT  in combination with high school grade point average  GPA   provides a better indicator of success in college than high school grades alone  as measured by college freshman GPA  Various studies conducted over the lifetime of the SAT show a statistically significant increase in correlation of high school grades and college freshman grades when the SAT is factored in              The predictive validity and powers of the SAT are topics of research in psychometrics             
The SAT is a norm referenced test intended to yield scores that follow a bell curve distribution among test takers  To achieve this distribution  test designers include challenging multiple choice questions with plausible but incorrect options  known as  distractors   exclude questions that a majority of students answer correctly  and impose tight time constraints during the examination             
There are substantial differences in funding  curricula  grading  and difficulty among U S  secondary schools due to U S  federalism  local control  and the prevalence of private  distance  and home schooled students  SAT  and ACT  scores are intended to supplement the secondary school record and help admission officers put local data such as course work  grades  and class rank in a national perspective             
Historically  the SAT was more widely used by students living in coastal states and the ACT was more widely used by students in the Midwest and South  in recent years  however  an increasing number of students on the East and West coasts have been taking the ACT                          Since       all four year colleges and universities in the United States that require a test as part of an application for admission will accept either the SAT or ACT  and as of Fall       more than      four year colleges and universities did not require any standardized test scores at all for admission  though some of them were planning to apply this policy only temporarily due to the coronavirus pandemic                         
SAT test takers are given two hours and    minutes to complete the test  plus a    minute break between the Reading and Writing section and the Math section               and as of          update      the test costs US        plus additional fees for late test registration  registration by phone  registration changes  rapid delivery of results  delivery of results to more than four institutions  result deliveries ordered more than nine days after the test  and testing administered outside the United States  as applicable  and fee waivers are offered to low income students within the U S  and its territories                                      Scores on the SAT range from     to       combining test results from two     to     point sections  the Mathematics section and the Evidence Based Reading and Writing section  Although taking the SAT  or its competitor the ACT  is required for freshman entry to many colleges and universities in the United States              during the late     s  many institutions made these entrance exams optional                                      but this did not stop the students from attempting to achieve high scores             as they and their parents are skeptical of what  optional  means in this context                          In fact  the test taking population was increasing steadily              And while this may have resulted in a long term decline in scores                                      experts cautioned against using this to gauge the scholastic levels of the entire U S  population             
Scores are typically released two to four weeks after the exam  SAT weekends are typically released after two weeks  with SAT school day being more variable              Students may be able to cancel their scores up to one week after their exam             

Structure edit 
The current digitally administered SAT has two main sections  Reading and Writing  and Math  Each of these sections is further broken down into two equal length  modules    Until the summer of       the test taker was also optionally able to write an essay as part of an additional test section  The essay was dropped after June       except in a few states and school districts               The total time for the scored portion of the SAT is two hours and    minutes            
A score for each section is reported on a scale of     to      and each section score is a multiple of ten  A total score for the SAT is calculated by adding the two section scores  resulting in total scores that range from     to       In addition to the two section scores  several subsection  performance  scores  example subsections   Craft and Structure  in Reading and Writing  and  Algebra  in Math  are also reported for each section  There is no penalty or negative marking for guessing on the SAT  scores are based on the number of questions answered correctly                         
The essay  if taken as part of an SAT School Day administration  is scored separately from the two section scores                          Two people score each essay by each awarding   to   points in each of three categories  Reading  Analysis  and Writing              These two scores from the different examiners are then combined to give a total score from   to   points per category  Though sometimes people quote their essay score out of     the College Board themselves do not combine the different categories to give one essay score  instead giving a score for each category 
The optional essay was last featured nationally in the June      administration                        College Board said it discontinued the essay section because  there are other ways for students to demonstrate their mastery of essay writing   including the test s reading and writing portion                        It also acknowledged that the COVID    pandemic had played a role in the change  accelerating  a process already underway             

Reading Test edit 
The Reading Test of the SAT contains one section of    questions and a time limit of    minutes              All questions are multiple choice and based on reading passages  Tables  graphs  and charts may accompany some passages  but no math is required to correctly answer the corresponding questions  There are five passages  up to two of which may be a pair of smaller passages  on the Reading Test and ten or eleven questions per passage or passage pair   SAT Reading passages draw from three main fields  history  social studies  and science  Each SAT Reading Test always includes  one passage from U S  or world literature  one passage from either a U S  founding document or a related text  one passage about economics  psychology  sociology  or another social science  and  two science passages  Answers to all of the questions are based only on the content stated in or implied by the passage or passage pair             
The Reading Test contributes  with the Writing and Language Test  to two subscores  each ranging from   to    points

Writing and Language Test edit 
The Writing and Language Test of the SAT is made up of one section with    multiple choice questions and a time limit of    minutes              As with the Reading Test  all questions are based on reading passages which may be accompanied by tables  graphs  and charts  The test taker will be asked to read the passages and suggest corrections or improvements for the contents underlined  Reading passages on this test range in content from topic arguments to nonfiction narratives in a variety of subjects  The skills being evaluated include  increasing the clarity of argument  improving word choice  improving analysis of topics in social studies and science  changing sentence or word structure to increase organizational quality and impact of writing  and  fixing or improving sentence structure  word usage  and punctuation             
The Writing and Language Test reports two subscores  each ranging from   to    points

Mathematics edit 
An example of an SAT  grid in  math question and the correctly gridded answer
The mathematics portion of the SAT is divided into two sections  Math Test   No Calculator and Math Test   Calculator  In total  the SAT math test is    minutes long and includes    questions     multiple choice questions and    grid in questions              The multiple choice questions have four possible answers  the grid in questions are free response and require the test taker to provide an answer 

The Math Test   No Calculator section has    questions     multiple choice and   grid in  and lasts    minutes 
The Math Test   Calculator section has    questions     multiple choice and   grid in  and lasts    minutes 
Several scores are provided to the test taker for the math test  A subscore  on a scale of   to     is reported for each of three categories of math content 

 Heart of Algebra   linear equations  systems of linear equations  and linear functions 
 Problem Solving and Data Analysis   statistics  modeling  and problem solving skills 
 Passport to Advanced Math   non linear expressions  radicals  exponentials and other topics that form the basis of more advanced math  
A test score for the math test is reported on a scale of    to     with an increment of      and a section score  equal to the test score multiplied by     is reported on a scale of     to                                         

Calculator use edit 
All scientific and most graphing calculators  including computer algebra system  CAS  calculators  are permitted on the SAT Math   Calculator section only  However  with the change to the Digital SAT during      and       a graphing calculator may be used throughout the entire test and is accessible through the test application program              All four function calculators are allowed as well  however  these devices are not recommended  Mobile phone and smartphone calculators  calculators with typewriter like  QWERTY  keyboards  laptops and other portable computers  and calculators capable of accessing the Internet are not permitted                         
Research was conducted by the College Board to study the effect of calculator use on SAT I  Reasoning Test math scores  The study found that performance on the math section was associated with the extent of calculator use  those using calculators on about one third to one half of the items averaged higher scores than those using calculators more or less frequently  However  the effect was  more likely to have been the result of able students using calculators differently than less able students rather than calculator use per se               There is some evidence that the frequent use of a calculator in school outside of the testing situation has a positive effect on test performance compared to those who do not use calculators in school             

Style of questions edit 
Most of the questions on the SAT  except for the student produced responses  SPR  in the math section  are multiple choice  all multiple choice questions have four answer choices  one of which is correct  About     of the math section is SPR  They instead require the test taker to enter in a number             
Not all questions on each section of the SAT are weighted equally  harder questions are weighted less and easier problems are weighted more              There are experimental problems which are used by College Board to test future test questions  Answering experimental questions  either correctly or incorrectly   does not impact the test score

The SAT is offered seven times a year in the United States  in August  October  November  December  March  May  and June  For international students SAT is offered four times a year  in October  December  March and May       exception  To cover worldwide May cancelation  an additional September exam was introduced  and August was made available to international test takers as well   The test is typically offered on the first Saturday of the month for the October  November  December  May  and June administrations                          The test was taken by           high school graduates in the class of                 
Candidates wishing to take the test may register online at the College Board s website or by mail at least three weeks before the test date 
There are also SAT School Day tests for students taking the SAT during school              They are offered from March to April and October             

Fees edit 
As of       the SAT costs US        plus additional fees if testing outside the United States              The College Board makes fee waivers available for low income students  Additional fees apply for late registration  standby testing  registration changes  scores by telephone  and extra score reports  beyond the four provided for free  

Accommodation for candidates with disabilities edit 
Students with verifiable disabilities  including physical and learning disabilities  are eligible to take the SAT with accommodations  The standard time increase for students requiring additional time due to learning disabilities or physical handicaps is time        time        is also offered 

Change from paper based to digital edit 
In January       College Board announced that the SAT would change from paper based to digital  computer based               International  non U S   testing centers began using the digital format on March           The December      SAT was the last SAT test offered on paper  The switch to the digital format occurred on March          in the U S              The digital SAT takes about an hour less to do than the paper based test  two hours vs  three   It is administered in an official test center  as before  but the students use their own testing devices  a portable computer or tablet   If a student cannot bring his or her own device  one can be requested from College Board              Before the test  College Board s  Bluebook  app must have been successfully installed on the testing device             
The new test is adaptive  meaning that students have two modules per section  reading writing and math   with the second module being adaptive to the demonstrated level based on the results from the first module  On the reading and writing sections  the questions will have shorter passages for each question  On the math sections  the word problems will be more concise  Students have a ten minute break after the first two English modules and before the two math modules  A timer is built into the testing software and will automatically begin once the student finishes the second English module  New tools such as a question flagger  a timer  and an integrated graphing calculator are included in the new test as well             

Scaled scores and percentiles edit 
Students receive their online score reports approximately two to three weeks after test administration  longer for mailed  paper scores               Included in the report is the total score  the sum of the two section scores  with each section graded on a scale of          and three subscores  in reading  writing  and analysis  each on a scale of      for the optional essay              Students may also receive  for an additional fee  various score verification services  including  for select test administrations  the Question and Answer Service  which provides the test questions  the student s answers  the correct answers  and the type and difficulty of each question             
In addition  students receive two percentile scores  each of which is defined by the College Board as the percentage of students in a comparison group with equal or lower test scores  One of the percentiles  called the  Nationally Representative Sample Percentile   uses as a comparison group all   th and   th graders in the United States  regardless of whether or not they took the SAT  This percentile is theoretical and is derived using methods of statistical inference  The second percentile  called the  SAT User Percentile   uses actual scores from a comparison group of recent United States students that took the SAT  For example  for the school year            the SAT User Percentile was based on the test scores of students in the graduating classes of      and      who took the SAT  specifically  the      revision  during high school  Students receive both types of percentiles for their total score as well as their section scores

The mean verbal score was     for students taking the SAT      for the sample of all students             
The mathematical scores for         were broken out by gender rather than reported as a whole  the mean math score for boys was      for girls       The differences for the nationally sampled population for math  not shown in table  were similar to those for the verbal section             

Ceilings and trends edit 
The version of the SAT administered before April      had a very high ceiling  For example  in the           school year  only   students out of     million test takers obtained a score of                  
In      the average score for the Class of      was      out of a maximum       That was down   points from the previous class s mark and was the lowest composite score of the past decade             

SAT ACT score comparisons edit 
The College Board and ACT  Inc   conducted a joint study of students who took both the SAT and the ACT between September       for the ACT  or March       for the SAT  and June       Tables were provided to concord scores for students taking the SAT after January      and before March                               In May       the College Board released concordance tables to concord scores on the SAT used from March      through January      to the SAT used since March       as well as tables to concord scores on the SAT used since March      to the ACT             
In       the College Board  in partnership with the ACT  introduced a new concordance table to better compare how a student would fare one test to another              This is now considered the official concordance to be used by college professionals and is replacing the one from       The new concordance no longer features the old SAT  out of         just the new SAT  out of        and the ACT  out of     
As of       the most appropriate corresponding SAT score point for the given ACT score is also shown in the table below

Elucidation edit 
Preparation edit 
Pioneered by Stanley Kaplan in      with a    hour course              SAT preparation has become a highly lucrative field              Many companies and organizations offer test preparation in the form of books  classes  online courses  and tutoring              The test preparation industry began almost simultaneously with the introduction of university entrance exams in the U S  and flourished from the start              Test preparation scams are a genuine problem for parents and students              In general  East Asian Americans  especially Korean Americans  are the most likely to take private SAT preparation courses while African Americans typically rely more one on one tutoring for remedial learning             
Nevertheless  the College Board maintains that the SAT is essentially uncoachable and research by the College Board and the National Association of College Admission Counseling suggests that tutoring courses result in an average increase of about    points on the math section and    points on the verbal section              Indeed  researchers have shown time and again that preparation courses tend to offer at best a modest boost to test scores                                      Like IQ scores  which are a strong correlate  SAT scores tend to be stable over time  meaning SAT preparation courses offer only a limited advantage              An early meta analysis  from       found similar results and noted  the size of the coaching effect estimated from the matched or randomized studies     points  seems too small to be practically important               Statisticians Ben Domingue and Derek C  Briggs examined data from the Education Longitudinal Survey of      and found that the effects of coaching were only statistically significant for mathematics  moreover  coaching had a greater effect on certain students than others  especially those who have taken rigorous courses and those of high socioeconomic status               A      systematic literature review estimated a coaching effect of    and    points for the math and verbal tests  respectively              A      meta analysis estimated the effect size to be      and      for the verbal and math sections respectively  although there was a large degree of heterogeneity               Meanwhile  a      study found that the effects of one on one tutoring to be minimal among all ethnic groups              Public misunderstanding of how to prepare for the SAT continues to be exploited by the preparation industry             
While there is a link between family background and taking an SAT preparation course  not all students benefit equally from such an investment  In fact  any average gains in SAT scores due to such courses are primarily due to improvements among East Asian Americans               When this group is broken down even further  Korean Americans are more likely to take SAT prep courses than Chinese Americans  taking full advantage of their Church communities and ethnic economy              
The College Board announced a partnership with the non profit organization Khan Academy to offer free test preparation materials starting in the         academic year to help level the playing field for students from low income families                           Students may also bypass costly preparation programs using the more affordable official guide from the College Board and with solid studying habits              
The College Board also offers a test called the Preliminary SAT National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test  PSAT NMSQT   and there is some evidence that taking the PSAT at least once can help students do better on the SAT               moreover  like the case for the SAT  top scorers on the PSAT could earn scholarships              According to cognitive scientist Sian Beilock   choking   or substandard performance on important occasions  such as taking the SAT  can be prevented by doing plenty of practice questions and proctored exams to improve procedural memory  making use of the booklet to write down intermediate steps to avoid overloading working memory  and writing a diary entry about one s anxieties on the day of the exam to enhance self empathy and positive self image               Sleep hygiene is important as the quality of sleep during the days leading to the exam can improve performance  Moreover  it has been shown that later class times       am rather than     am   which better suits the shifted circadian rhythm of teenagers  can raise SAT scores enough to change the tier of the colleges and universities student might be admitted to                           
In the wake of the COVID    pandemic  a large number of American colleges and universities decided to make standardized test scores optional for prospective students  Nevertheless  many students still chose to take the SAT and to enroll in preparation programs  which continued to be profitable              

Predictive validity and powers edit 
In       education researchers Richard C  Atkinson and Saul Geiser from the University of California  UC  system argued that high school GPA is better than the SAT at predicting college grades regardless of high school type or quality               In its      report  the UC academic senate found that the SAT was better than high school GPA at predicting first year GPA  and just as good as high school GPA at predicting undergraduate GPA  first year retention  and graduation   This predictive validity was found to hold across demographic groups  with the report noting that standardized test scores were actually  better predictors of success for students who are Underrepresented Minority students  URMs   who are first generation  or whose families are low income                A series of College Board reports point to similar predictive validity across demographic groups                           
But a month after the UC academic senate report  Saul Geiser disputed the UC academic senate s findings  saying  that the Senate claims are  spurious   based on a fundamental error of omitting student demographics in the prediction model   Indicating when high school GPA is combined with demographics in the prediction  the SAT is less reliable  Li Cai  a UCLA professor who directs the National Center for Research on Evaluation  Standards  and Student Testing  indicated that the UC Academic Senate did include student demographics by using a different and simpler model for the public to understand and that the discriminatory impacts of the SAT are compensated during the admissions process  Jesse Rothstein  a UC Berkeley professor of public policy and economics  countered Li s claim  mentioning that the UC academic senate  got a lot of things wrong about the SAT   overstates the value of the SAT  and  no basis for its conclusion that UC admissions  compensate  for test score gaps between groups                However  by analyzing their own institutional data  Brown  Yale  and Dartmouth universities reached the conclusion that SAT scores are more reliable predictors of collegiate success than GPA  Furthermore  the scores allow them to identify more potentially qualified students from disadvantaged backgrounds than they otherwise would               At the University of Texas at Austin  students who declined to submit SAT scores when such scores were optional performed more poorly than their peers who did               These results were replicated by a study conducted by the non profit organization Opportunity Insights analyzing data from Ivy League institutions  Brown University  Columbia University  Cornell University  Dartmouth College  Harvard University  Princeton University  the University of Pennsylvania  and Yale University  plus Stanford University  the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  and the University of Chicago                            A      study found that SAT or ACT scores along with high school GPAs are strong predictors of cumulative university GPAs  In particular  those with standardized test scores in the   th percentile or better had a two thirds chance of having a cumulative university GPA in the top half                           A      meta analysis by researchers from the University of Minnesota offered evidence that standardized admissions tests such as the SAT predicted not only freshman GPA but also overall collegiate GPA                           A      study from the same university using a multi institutional data set revealed that even after controlling for socioeconomic status and high school GPA  SAT scores were still as capable of predicting freshman GPA among university or college students               A      study with a sample size of around a quarter of a million students suggests that together  SAT scores and high school GPA offer an excellent predictor of freshman collegiate GPA and second year retention              In       psychologists Oren R  Shewach  Kyle D  McNeal  Nathan R  Kuncel  and Paul R  Sackett showed that both high school GPA and SAT scores predict enrollment in advanced collegiate courses  even after controlling for Advanced Placement credits                          
Education economist Jesse M  Rothstein indicated in      that high school average SAT scores were better at predicting freshman university GPAs compared to individual SAT scores  In other words  a student s SAT scores were not as informative with regards to future academic success as his or her high school s average  In contrast  individual high school GPAs were a better predictor of collegiate success than average high school GPAs                            Furthermore  an admissions officer who failed to take average SAT scores into account would risk overestimating the future performance of a student from a low scoring school and underestimating that of a student from a high scoring school              
While the SAT is correlated with intelligence and as such estimates individual differences  it does not have anything to say about  effective cognitive performance  or what intelligent people do              Nor does it measure non cognitive traits associated with academic success such as positive attitudes or conscientiousness                           Psychometricians Thomas R  Coyle and David R  Pillow showed in      that the SAT predicts college GPA even after removing the general factor of intelligence  g   with which it is highly correlated              
Like other standardized tests such as the ACT or the GRE  the SAT is a traditional method for assessing the academic aptitude of students who have had vastly different educational experiences and as such is focused on the common materials that the students could reasonably be expected to have encountered throughout the course of study  As such the mathematics section contains no materials above the precalculus level  for instance  Psychologist Raymond Cattell referred to this as testing for  historical  rather than  current  crystallized intelligence               Psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman further noted that the SAT can only measure a snapshot of a person s performance at a particular moment in time               Educational psychologists Jonathan Wai  David Lubinski  and Camilla Benbow observed that one way to increase the predictive validity of the SAT is by assessing the student s spatial reasoning ability  as the SAT at present does not contain any questions to that effect  Spatial reasoning skills are important for success in STEM               A      study led by psychometrician Robert Sternberg found that the ability of SAT scores and high school GPAs to predict collegiate performance could further be enhanced by additional assessments of analytical  creative  and practical thinking                           
Experimental psychologist Meredith Frey noted that while advances in education research and neuroscience can help incrementally improve the ability to predict scholastic achievement in the future  the SAT or other standardized tests likely will remain a valuable tool to build upon              In a      op ed for The New York Times  psychologist John D  Mayer called the predictive powers of the SAT  an astonishing achievement  and cautioned against making it and other standardized tests optional                           Research by psychometricians David Lubinsky  Camilla Benbow  and their colleagues has shown that the SAT could even predict life outcomes beyond university             

Difficulty and relative weight edit 
The SAT rigorously assesses students  mental stamina  memory  speed  accuracy  and capacity for abstract and analytical reasoning               For American universities and colleges  standardized test scores are the most important factor in admissions  second only to high school GPAs               By international standards  however  the SAT is not that difficult               For example  South Korea s College Scholastic Ability Test  CSAT  and Finland s Matriculation Examination are both longer  tougher  and count for more towards the admissibility of a student to university               In many countries around the world  exams  including university entrance exams  are the sole deciding factor of admission  school grades are simply irrelevant               In China and India  doing well on the Gaokao or the IIT JEE  respectively  enhances the social status of the students and their families              
In an article from       educational psychologist Jonathan Wai argued that the SAT was too easy to be useful to the most competitive of colleges and universities  whose applicants typically had brilliant high school GPAs and standardized test scores  Admissions officers therefore had the burden of differentiating the top scorers from one another  not knowing whether or not the students  perfect or near perfect scores truly reflected their scholastic aptitudes  He suggested that the College Board make the SAT more difficult  which would raise the measurement ceiling of the test  allowing the top schools to identify the best and brightest among the applicants               At that time  the College Board was already working on making the SAT tougher               The changes were announced in      and implemented in                   
After realizing the June      test was easier than usual  the College Board made adjustments resulting in lower than expected scores  prompting complaints from the students  though some understood this was to ensure fairness               In its analysis of the incident  the Princeton Review supported the idea of curving grades  but pointed out that the test was incapable of distinguishing students in the   th percentile      points  or higher in mathematics  The Princeton Review also noted that this particular curve was unusual in that it offered no cushion against careless or last minute mistakes for high achieving students               The Review posted a similar blog post for the SAT of August       when a similar incident happened and the College Board responded in the same manner  noting   A student who misses two questions on an easier test should not get as good a score as a student who misses two questions on a hard test  Equating takes care of that issue   It also cautioned students against retaking the SAT immediately  for they might be disappointed again  and recommended that instead  they give themselves some  leeway  before trying again              

Recognition edit 
The College Board claims that outside of the United States  the SAT is considered for university admissions in approximately    countries  as of the         academic year              

Association with general cognitive ability edit 
In a      study  psychometrician Ann M  Gallagher and her colleagues found that only the top students made use of intuitive reasoning in solving problems encountered on the mathematics section of the SAT               Cognitive psychologists Brenda Hannon and Mary McNaughton Cassill discovered that having a good working memory  the ability of knowledge integration  and low levels of test anxiety predicts high performance on the SAT              
Frey and Detterman        investigated associations of SAT scores with intelligence test scores  Using an estimate of general mental ability  or g  based on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery  they found SAT scores to be highly correlated with g  r     in their sample       when adjusted for non linearity  in their sample taken from a      national probability survey  Additionally  they investigated the correlation between SAT results  using the revised and recentered form of the test  and scores on the Raven s Advanced Progressive Matrices  a test of fluid intelligence  reasoning   this time using a non random sample   They found that the correlation of SAT results with scores on the Raven s Advanced Progressive Matrices was       they estimated that this correlation would have been about      were it not for the restriction of ability range in the sample  They also noted that there appeared to be a ceiling effect on the Raven s scores which may have suppressed the correlation               Beaujean and colleagues        have reached similar conclusions to those reached by Frey and Detterman               Because the SAT is strongly correlated with general intelligence  it can be used as a proxy to measure intelligence  especially when the time consuming traditional methods of assessment are unavailable             
Psychometrician Linda Gottfredson noted that the SAT is effective at identifying intellectually gifted college bound students              
For decades many critics have accused designers of the verbal SAT of cultural bias as an explanation for the disparity in scores between poorer and wealthier test takers               with the biggest critics coming from the University of California system                            A famous example of this perceived bias in the SAT I was the oarsman regatta analogy question  which is no longer part of the exam  The object of the question was to find the pair of terms that had the relationship most similar to the relationship between  runner  and  marathon   The correct answer was  oarsman  and  regatta   The choice of the correct answer was thought to have presupposed students  familiarity with rowing  a sport popular with the wealthy               However  for psychometricians  analogy questions are a useful tool to gauge the mental abilities of students  for  even if the meaning of two words are unclear  a student with sufficiently strong analytical thinking skills should still be able to identify their relationships               Analogy questions were removed in                    In their place are questions that provide more contextual information should the students be ignorant of the relevant definition of a word  making it easier for them to guess the correct answer              

Association with college or university majors and rankings edit 
In       physicists Stephen Hsu and James Schombert of the University of Oregon examined five years of student records at their school and discovered that the academic standing of students majoring in mathematics or physics  but not biology  English  sociology  or history  was strongly dependent on SAT mathematics scores  Students with SAT mathematics scores below     were highly unlikely to excel as a mathematics or physics major  Nevertheless  they found no such patterns between the SAT verbal  or combined SAT verbal and mathematics and the other aforementioned subjects                           

In       educational psychologist Jonathan Wai of Duke University analyzed average test scores from the Army General Classification Test in              students   the Selective Service College Qualification Test in                Project Talent in the early     s            the Graduate Record Examination between      and       over     million   and the SAT Math and Verbal in           million   Wai identified one consistent pattern  those with the highest test scores tended to pick the physical sciences and engineering as their majors while those with the lowest were more likely to choose education and agriculture   See figure below                            A      paper by Laura H  Gunn and her colleagues examining data from      institutions across the United States unveiled strong positive correlations between the average SAT percentiles of incoming students and the shares of graduates majoring in STEM and the social sciences  On the other hand  they found negative correlations between the former and the shares of graduates in psychology  theology  law enforcement  recreation and fitness              
Various researchers have established that average SAT or ACT scores and college ranking in the U S  News  amp  World Report are highly correlated  almost                                               b      Between the     s and the     s  the U S  population grew while universities and colleges did not expand their capacities as substantially  As a result  admissions rates fell considerably  meaning it has become more difficult to get admitted to a school whose alumni include one s parents  On top of that  high scoring students nowadays are much more likely to leave their hometowns in pursuit of higher education at prestigious institutions  Consequently  standardized tests  such as the SAT  are a more reliable measure of selectivity than admissions rates  Still  when Michael J  Petrilli and Pedro Enamorado analyzed the SAT composite scores  math and verbal  of incoming freshman classes of      and      of the top universities and liberal arts colleges in the United States  they found that the median scores of new students increased by    points for their sample  from      to       In particular  fourteen institutions saw an increase of at least     points  including the University of Notre Dame  from      to       or     points  and Elon College  from     to       or     points               

Association with types of schooling edit 
While there seems to be evidence that private schools tend to produce students who do better on standardized tests such as the ACT or the SAT  Keven Duncan and Jonathan Sandy showed  using data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth  that when student characteristics  such as age  race  and sex       family background        school quality        and other factors were taken into account  the advantage of private schools diminished by      The researchers concluded that students attending private schools already had the attributes associated with high scores on their own              

Association with educational and societal standings and outcomes edit 

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
Research from the University of California system published in      analyzing data of their undergraduates between Fall      through Fall       inclusive  found that the SAT II     c      was the single best predictor of collegiate success in the sense of freshman GPA  followed by high school GPA  and finally the SAT I  After controlling for family income and parental education  the already low ability of the SAT to measure aptitude and college readiness fell sharply while the more substantial aptitude and college readiness measuring abilities of high school GPA and the SAT II each remained undiminished  and even slightly increased   The University of California system required both the SAT I and the SAT II from applicants to the UC system during the four academic years of the study               This analysis is heavily publicized but is contradicted by many studies              
There is evidence that the SAT is correlated with societal and educational outcomes               including finishing a four year university program               A      paper from psychologists at the University of Minnesota analyzing multi institutional data sets suggested that the SAT maintained its ability to predict collegiate performance even after controlling for socioeconomic status  as measured by the combination of parental educational attainment and income  and high school GPA  This means that SAT scores were not merely a proxy for measuring socioeconomic status  the researchers concluded                            This finding has been replicated and shown to hold across racial or ethnic groups and for both sexes              Moreover  the Minnesota researchers found that the socioeconomic status distributions of the student bodies of the schools examined reflected those of their respective applicant pools               Because of what it measures  a person s SAT scores cannot be separated from their socioeconomic background               However  the correlation between SAT scores and parental income or socioeconomic status should not be taken to mean causation  It could be that high scorers have intelligent parents who work cognitively demanding jobs and as such earn higher salaries               In addition  the correlation is only significant between biological families  not adoptive ones  suggesting that this might be due to genetic heritage  not economic wealth                           
In       Rebecca Zwick and Jennifer Greif Green observed that a typical analysis did not take into account that heterogeneity of the high schools attended by the students in terms of not just the socioeconomic statuses of the student bodies but also the standards of grading  Zwick and Greif Green proceeded to show that when these were accounted for  the correlation between family socioeconomic status and classroom grades and rank increased whereas that between socioeconomic status and SAT scores fell  They concluded that school grades and SAT scores were similarly associated with family income              
According to the College Board  in           of the test takers had parents with a university degree      parents with no more than a high school diploma  and about    who did not graduate from high school      did not respond to the question              

Association with family structures edit 
One of the proposed partial explanations for the gap between Asian  and European American students in educational achievement  as measured for example by the SAT   is the general tendency of Asians to come from stable two parent households               In their      analysis of data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of the Bureau of Labor Statistics  economists Adam Blandin  Christopher Herrington  and Aaron Steelman concluded that family structure played an important role in determining educational outcomes in general and SAT scores in particular  Families with only one parent who has no degrees were designated  L  with two parents but no degrees  L  and two parents with at least one degree between them  H  Children from  H families held a significant advantage of those from  L families  and this gap grew between      and       Because the median SAT composite scores  verbal and mathematics  for  H families grew by    points while those of  L families fell by one point  the gap between them increased by    points  or a fifth of one standard deviation              

Sex differences edit 
In performance edit 
Sex and race differences exist in SAT scores
In       the American College Testing Board released a report stating that boys outperformed girls on the mathematics section of the test               a significant gap that has persisted for over    years               As of       boys on average earned    points more than girls on the SAT mathematics section  Among those scoring in the         range  the male to female ratio was                     In       psychologist Stephen Ceci and his collaborators found boys did better than girls across the percentiles  For example  a girl scoring in the top     of her sex would only be in the top     among the boys                            In       psychologist Jonathan Wai and his colleagues showed  by analyzing data from three decades involving     million intellectually gifted seventh graders from the Duke University Talent Identification Program  TIP   that in the     s the gender gap in the mathematics section of the SAT among students scoring in the top       was        in favor of boys but dropped to       by the     s                            The dramatic sex ratio from the     s replicates a different study using a sample from Johns Hopkins University               This ratio is similar to that observed for the ACT mathematics and science scores between the early     s and the late     s               It remained largely unaltered at the end of the     s                                         Sex differences in SAT mathematics scores began making themselves apparent at the level of     points and above               In the late     s  for every female who scored a perfect     on the SAT mathematics test  there were two males                           
Some researchers point to evidence in support of greater male variability in verbal and quantitative reasoning skills               Greater male variability has been found in body weight  height  and cognitive abilities across cultures  leading to a larger number of males in the lowest and highest distributions of testing               Consequently  a higher number of males are found in both the upper and lower extremes of the performance distributions of the mathematics sections of standardized tests such as the SAT  resulting in the observed gender discrepancy                                         Paradoxically  this is at odds with the tendency of girls to have higher classroom scores than boys               proving that they do not lack scholastic aptitude  However  boys tend to do better on standardized test questions not directly related to the curriculum              
On the other hand  Wai and his colleagues found that both sexes in the top    appeared to be more or less at parity when it comes to the verbal section of the SAT  though girls have gained a slight but noticeable edge over boys starting in the mid     s               Psychologist David Lubinski  who conducted longitudinal studies of seventh graders who scored exceptionally high on the SAT  found a similar result  Girls generally had better verbal reasoning skills and boys mathematical skills               This reflects other research on the cognitive ability of the general population rather than just the   th percentile and up                           
Although aspects of testing such as stereotype threat are a concern  research on the predictive validity of the SAT has demonstrated that it tends to be a more accurate predictor of female GPA in university as compared to male GPA              

In strategizing edit 
SAT mathematics questions can be answered intuitively or algorithmically 
Mathematical problems on the SAT can be broadly categorized into two groups  conventional and unconventional  Conventional problems can be handled routinely via familiar formulas or algorithms while unconventional ones require more creative thought in order to make unusual use of familiar methods of solution or to come up with the specific insights necessary for solving those problems  In       ETS psychometrician Ann M  Gallagher and her colleagues analyzed how students handled disclosed SAT mathematics questions in self reports  They found that for both sexes  the most favored approach was to use formulas or algorithms learned in class  When that failed  however  males were more likely than females to identify the suitable methods of solution  Previous research suggested that males were more likely to explore unusual paths to solution whereas females tended to stick to what they had learned in class and that females were more likely to identify the appropriate approaches if such required nothing more than mastery of classroom materials              

In confidence edit 
Older versions of the SAT did ask students how confident they were in their mathematical aptitude and verbal reasoning ability  specifically  whether or not they believed they were in the top      Devin G  Pope analyzed data of over four million test takers from the late     s to the early     s and found that high scorers were more likely to be confident they were in the top      with the top scorers reporting the highest levels of confidence  But there were some noticeable gaps between the sexes  Men tended to be much more confident in their mathematical aptitude than women  For example  among those who scored     on the mathematics section      of men answered they believed they were in the top     whereas only     of women did the same  Women  on the other hand  were slightly more confident in their verbal reasoning ability than men

Cognitive neuroscientists Richard Haier and Camilla Persson Benbow employed positron emission tomography  PET  scans to investigate the rate of glucose metabolism among students who have taken the SAT  They found that among men  those with higher SAT mathematics scores exhibited higher rates of glucose metabolism in the temporal lobes than those with lower scores  contradicting the brain efficiency hypothesis  This trend  however  was not found among women  for whom the researchers could not find any cortical regions associated with mathematical reasoning  Both sexes scored the same on average in their sample and had the same rates of cortical glucose metabolism overall  According to Haier and Benbow  this is evidence for the structural differences of the brain between the sexes                          

Association with race and ethnicity edit

A      meta analysis of the results of           participants tested for cognitive ability or aptitude found a difference in average scores between black and white students of around     standard deviation  with comparable results for the SAT      million test takers                Similarly  on average  Hispanic and Amerindian students perform on the order of one standard deviation lower on the SAT than white and Asian students                                                      Mathematics appears to be the more difficult part of the exam              In       the black white gap in the mathematics section was      standard deviations  but by       it fell to                    In       Asian Americans as a group scored      standard deviations higher than whites in the mathematics section              


Some researchers believe that the difference in scores is closely related to the overall achievement gap in American society between students of different racial groups  This gap may be explainable in part by the fact that students of disadvantaged racial groups tend to go to schools that provide lower educational quality  This view is supported by evidence that the black white gap is higher in cities and neighborhoods that are more racially segregated               Other research cites poorer minority proficiency in key coursework relevant to the SAT  English and math   as well as peer pressure against students who try to focus on their schoolwork   acting white                 Cultural issues are also evident among black students in wealthier households  with high achieving parents  John Ogbu  a Nigerian American professor of anthropology  concluded that instead of looking to their parents as role models  black youth chose other models like rappers and did not make an effort to be good students              
One set of studies has reported differential item functioning  namely  that some test questions function differently based on the racial group of the test taker  reflecting differences in ability to understand certain test questions or to acquire the knowledge required to answer them between groups  In       Freedle published data showing that black students have had a slight advantage on the verbal questions that are labeled as difficult on the SAT  whereas white and Asian students tended to have a slight advantage on questions labeled as easy  Freedle argued that these findings suggest that  easy  test items use vocabulary that is easier to understand for white middle class students than for minorities  who often use a different language in the home environment  whereas the difficult items use complex language learned only through lectures and textbooks   giving both student groups equal opportunities to acquiring it                                          The study was severely criticized by the ETS board  but the findings were replicated in a subsequent study by Santelices and Wilson in                                


There is no evidence that SAT scores systematically underestimate future performance of minority students  However  the predictive validity of the SAT has been shown to depend on the dominant ethnic and racial composition of the college               Some studies have also shown that African American students under perform in college relative to their white peers with the same SAT scores  researchers have argued that this is likely because white students tend to benefit from social advantages outside of the educational environment  for example  high parental involvement in their education  inclusion in campus academic activities  positive bias from same race teachers and peers  which result in better grades              
Christopher Jencks concludes that as a group  African Americans have been harmed by the introduction of standardized entrance exams such as the SAT  This  according to him  is not because the tests themselves are flawed  but because of labeling bias and selection bias  the tests measure the skills that African Americans are less likely to develop in their socialization  rather than the skills they are more likely to develop  Furthermore  standardized entrance exams are often labeled as tests of general ability  rather than of certain aspects of ability  Thus  a situation is produced in which African American ability is consistently underestimated within the education and workplace environments  contributing in turn to selection bias against them which exacerbates underachievement              

     SAT combined scores by race and ethnicity
Among the major racial or ethnic groups of the United States  gaps in SAT mathematics scores are the greatest at the tails  with Hispanic and Latino Americans being the most likely to score at the lowest range and Asian Americans the highest  In addition  there is some evidence suggesting that if the test contains more questions of both the easy and difficult varieties  which would increase the variability of the scores  the gaps would be even wider  Given the distribution for Asians  for example  many could score higher than     if the test allowed them to   See figure below               


     was the year in which education worldwide was disrupted by the COVID    pandemic and indeed  the performance of students in the United States on standardized tests  such as the SAT  suffered  Yet the gaps persisted               According to the College Board  in       while     of Asian students met the benchmark of college readiness in reading and writing and     in mathematics  only     and     of black students did those respective categories  Among whites      met the benchmark for reading and writing and     did mathematics  For Hispanics and Latinos  the numbers were     and      respectively   See figure below               


Test taking population edit

By analyzing data from the National Center for Education Statistics  economists Ember Smith and Richard Reeves of the Brookings Institution deduced that the number of students taking the SAT increased at a rate faster than population and high school graduation growth rates between      and       The increase was especially pronounced among Hispanics and Latinos  Even among whites  whose number of high school graduates was shrinking  the number of SAT takers rose               In       for example      million students took the SAT              up from     million in                    But in       a record breaking     million students took the exam  compared to     million in       another record breaking year              The rise in the number of students taking the SAT was due in part to many school districts offering to administer the SAT during school days often at no further costs to the students              Some require students to take the SAT  regardless of whether or not they are going to college               However  in       in the wake of the COVID    pandemic and the optional status of the SAT at many colleges and universities  only     million students took the test              But as testing centers reopened  ambitious students chose to take the SAT or the ACT to make themselves stand out from the competition regardless of the admissions policies of their preferred schools                            Among the class of           million students took the test

  and found that after correcting for education  the use of sophisticated vocabulary has declined between the mid     s and the mid     s across all levels of education  from below high school to graduate school  However  they cautioned against the use of SAT verbal scores to track the decline for while the College Board reported that SAT verbal scores had been decreasing  these scores were an imperfect measure of the vocabulary level of the nation as a whole because the test taking demographic has changed and because more students took the SAT in the     s than in the     s  meaning there were more with limited ability who took it              However  as the frequency of reading for pleasure and the level of reading comprehension among American high school students continue to decline  students who take the SAT might struggle to do well  even if reforms have been introduced to shorten the duration of the test and to reduce the number of questions associated with a given passage in the verbal portion of the test              

Use in non collegiate contexts edit 
By high IQ societies edit 
Certain high IQ societies  like Mensa  Intertel  the Prometheus Society and the Triple Nine Society  use scores from certain years as one of their admission tests  For instance  Intertel accepts scores  verbal and math combined  of at least      on tests taken through January                    the Triple Nine Society accepts scores of      or greater on SAT tests taken before April       and scores of at least      on tests taken between April      and February                    Mensa accepts qualifying SAT scores earned on or before January          

By researchers edit 
Because it is strongly correlated with general intelligence  the SAT has often been used as a proxy to measure intelligence by researchers  especially since                   In particular  scientists studying mathematically gifted individuals have been using the mathematics section of the SAT to identify subjects for their research             
A growing body of research indicates that SAT scores can predict individual success decades into the future  for example in terms of income and occupational achievements                                      A longitudinal study published in      by educational psychologists Jonathan Wai  David Lubinski  and Camilla Benbow suggests that among the intellectually precocious  the top      those with higher scores in the mathematics section of the SAT at the age of    were more likely to earn a PhD in the STEM fields  to have a publication  to register a patent  or to secure university tenure                            Wai further showed that an individual s academic ability  as measured by the average SAT or ACT scores of the institution attended  predicted individual differences in income  even among the richest people of all  and being a member of the  American elite   namely Fortune     CEOs  billionaires  federal judges  and members of Congress                           Wai concluded that the American elite was also the cognitive elite               Gregory Park  Lubinski  and Benbow gave statistical evidence that intellectually gifted adolescents  as identified by SAT scores  could be expected to accomplish great feats of creativity in the future  both in the arts and in STEM                          
The SAT is sometimes given to students at age    or    by organizations such as the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth  SMPY   Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth  and the Duke University Talent Identification Program  TIP  to select  study  and mentor students of exceptional ability  that is  those in the top one percent              Among SMPY participants  those within the top quartile  as indicated by the SAT composite score  mathematics and verbal   were markedly more likely to have a doctoral degree  to have at least one publication in STEM  to earn income in the   th percentile  to have at least one literary publication  or to register at least one patent than those in the bottom quartile  Duke TIP participants generally picked career tracks in STEM should they be stronger in mathematics  as indicated by SAT mathematics scores  or the humanities if they possessed greater verbal ability  as indicated by SAT verbal scores  For comparison  the bottom SMPY quartile is five times more likely than the average American to have a patent  Meanwhile  as of       the shares doctorates among SMPY participants was     and Duke TIP      compared to two percent among the general U S  population              Consequently  the notion that beyond a certain point  differences in cognitive ability as measured by standardized tests such as the SAT cease to matter is gainsaid by the evidence              
In the      paper which showed that the sex gap in SAT mathematics scores had dropped dramatically between the early     s and the early     s but had persisted for the next two decades or so  Wai and his colleagues argued that  sex differences in abilities in the extreme right tail should not be dismissed as no longer part of the explanation for the dearth of women in math intensive fields of science                            

By employers edit 
Cognitive ability is correlated with job training outcomes and job performance                           As such  some employers rely on SAT scores to assess the suitability of a prospective recruit              especially if the person has limited work experience              There is nothing new about this practice              Major companies and corporations have spent princely sums on learning how to avoid hiring errors and have decided that standardized test scores are a valuable tool in deciding whether or not a person is fit for the job  In some cases  a company might need to hire someone to handle proprietary materials of its own making  such as computer software  But since the ability to work with such materials cannot be assessed via external certification  it makes sense for such a firm to rely on something that is a proxy of measuring general intelligence                           In other cases  a firm may not care about academic background but needs to assess a prospective recruit s quantitative reasoning ability  and what makes standardized test scores necessary              Several companies  especially those considered to be the most prestigious in industries such as investment banking and management consulting such as Goldman Sachs and McKinsey  have been reported to ask prospective job candidates about their SAT scores                                                     
Nevertheless  some other top employers  such as Google  have eschewed the use of SAT or other standardized test scores unless the potential employee is a recent graduate  Google s Laszlo Bock explained to The New York Times   We found that they don t predict anything   Educational psychologist Jonathan Wai suggested this might be due to the inability of the SAT to differentiate the intellectual capacities of those at the extreme right end of the distribution of intelligence  Wai told The New York Times   Today the SAT is actually too easy  and that s why Google doesn t see a correlation  Every single person they get through the door is a super high scorer

Math verbal achievement gap edit 
Main article  Math verbal achievement gap
In       New York Times columnist Richard Rothstein argued that the U S  math averages on the SAT and ACT continued their decade long rise over national verbal averages on the tests while the averages of verbal portions on the same tests were floundering              

Optional SAT edit 
During the     s and     s  there was a movement to drop achievement scores  After some time  the countries  states  and provinces that reintroduced them agreed that academic standards had dropped  students had studied less  and had taken their education less seriously  Testing requirements were reinstated in some places after research concluded that these high stakes tests produced benefits that outweighed the costs               However  in a      speech to the American Council on Education  Richard C  Atkinson  the president of the University of California  urged the dropping of aptitude tests such as the SAT I but not achievement tests such as the SAT II     c      as a college admissions requirement               Atkinson s critique of the predictive validity and powers of the SAT has been contested by the University of California academic senate               In April       the academic senate  which consisted of faculty members  voted      to restore the requirement of standardized test scores  but the governing board overruled the academic senate and did not reinstate the test requirement anyway  Because of the size of the Californian population  this decision might have an impact on U S  higher education at large  schools looking to admit Californian students could have a harder time              
During the     s  over       American universities and colleges opted to stop requiring the SAT and the ACT for admissions  according to FairTest  an activist group opposing standardized entrance exams  Most  however  were small colleges  with the notable exceptions of the University of California system and the University of Chicago               Also on the list are institutions catering to niche students  such as religious colleges  arts and music conservatories  or nursing schools  and the majority of institutions in the Northeastern United States              In the wake of the COVID    pandemic  around       institutions decided to waive the requirement of the SAT or the ACT for admissions because it was challenging both to administer and to take these tests  resulting in many cancellations               Some schools chose to make them optional on a temporary basis only  either for just one year  as in the case of Princeton University  or three  like the College of William  amp  Mary  Others dropped the requirement completely              Some schools extended their moratorium on standardized entrance exams in                    This did not stop highly ambitious students from taking them  however                          as many parents and teenagers were skeptical of the  optional  status of university entrance exams             and wanted to make their applications more likely to catch the attention of admission officers              This led to complaints of registration sites crashing in the summer of                    On the other hand  the number of students applying to the more competitive of schools that had made SAT and ACT scores optional increased dramatically because the students thought they stood a chance                                         Ivy League institutions saw double digit increases in the number of applications  as high as     in the case of Columbia University  while their admission rates  already in the single digits  fell  e g  from      in      to just      in      at Harvard University                            At the same time  interest in lower status schools that did the same thing dropped precipitously               the college application process remains driven primarily by the preference for elite schools                   of students who used the Common Application accepted by over     colleges and universities as of      submitted SAT or ACT scores in the         academic year  down from     in          Those who did submit their test scores tended to hail from high income families  to have at least one university educated parent  and to be white or Asian              
Despite the fallout from Operation Varsity Blues  which found many wealthy parents illegally intervening to raise their children s standardized test scores  the SAT and the ACT remain popular among American parents and college bound seniors               who are skeptical of the process of  holistic admissions  because they think it is rather opaque  as schools try to access characteristics not easily discerned via a number  hence the growth in the number of test takers attempting to make themselves more competitive even if this parallels an increase in the number of schools declaring it optional                          While holistic admissions might seem like a plausible alternative  the process of applying can be rather stressful for students and parents  and many get upset once they learn that someone else got into the school that rejected them despite having lower SAT scores and GPAs                            Holistic admissions notwithstanding  when merit based scholarships are considered  standardized test scores might be the tiebreakers  as these are highly competitive              Scholarships and financial aid could help students and their parents significantly cut the cost of higher education  especially in times of economic hardship              Moreover  the most selective of schools might have no better options than using standardized test scores in order to quickly prune the number of applications worth considering  for holistic admissions consume valuable time and other resources              
Following the      ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States against race based admissions as a form of affirmative action  a number of schools have signaled their intent to continue pursuing ethnic diversity  One way for them to adapt to the new legal reality is to drop the requirement of standardized testing  making it more difficult for potential plaintiffs  Asian Americans in the twin cases of SFFA v  Harvard and SFFA v UNC  to find concrete evidence for their allegations of discrimination              
On one hand  making the SAT and the ACT optional for admissions enables schools to attract a larger pool of applicants of a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds              On the other hand  letters of recommendation are not a good indicator of collegiate performance              and grade inflation is a genuine problem                                        If standardized tests were taken out of the picture  school grades would become more important  thereby incentivizing grade inflation               In fact  grades in American high schools have been inflating by noticeable amounts due to pressure from parents  creating an apparent oversupply of high achievers that makes actual high performing students struggle to stand out  especially if they are from low income families               Schools that made the SAT optional therefore lost an objective measure of academic aptitude and readiness              and they will have to formulate a new methodology for admissions or to develop their own entrance exams               Given that the selectivity of a school a student applies to is correlated with the resources of his or her high school measured in terms of the availability of rigorous courses  such as AP classes  and the socioeconomic statuses of the student body   making the SAT optional might exacerbate social inequities  Furthermore  since the costs of attending institutions of higher learning in the United States are high  eliminating the SAT requirement could make said institutions more likely to admit under performing students  who might have to be removed for their low academic standing and who might be saddled with debt after attending              Another criticism of making the SAT optional is that subjective measures of an applicant s suitability  such as application essays  could become more important  making it easier for the rich to gain admissions at the expense of the poor because their school counselors are more capable of writing good letters of recommendation and they can afford to hire external help to boost their applications              
It was due to these concerns that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  MIT  decided to reinstate its SAT requirement in                    Many other universities across the U S  followed suit in                                              However  the University of North Carolina system will only require SAT or ACT scores from applicants whose high school GPA is below                  while the University of California system will continue to be test blind              

Writing section edit 
In       MIT Writing Director Les Perelman plotted essay length versus essay score on the new SAT from released essays and found a high correlation between them  After studying over    graded essays  he found that longer essays consistently produced higher scores  In fact  he argues that by simply gauging the length of an essay without reading it  the given score of an essay could likely be determined correctly over     of the time  He also discovered that several of these essays were full of factual errors  the College Board does not claim to grade for factual accuracy 
Perelman  along with the National Council of Teachers of English  also criticized the    minute writing section of the test for damaging standards of writing teaching in the classroom  They say that writing teachers training their students for the SAT will not focus on revision  depth  accuracy  but will instead produce long  formulaic  and wordy pieces                You re getting teachers to train students to be bad writers   concluded Perelman              
On January           the College Board announced that the SAT would no longer offer the optional essay section after the June      administration                       

History edit 
Main article  History of the SAT
Historical average SAT scores of college bound seniors 
The College Board  the not for profit organization that owns the SAT  was organized at the beginning of the   th century to provide uniform entrance exams for its member colleges  whose matriculating students often came from boarding and private day schools found in the Northeastern United States  The exams were essay based  graded by hand  and required several days for the student to take them                            By the early     s  the increasing interest in intelligence tests as a means of selection convinced the College Board to form a commission to produce such a test for college admission purposes  The leader of the commission was Carl Brigham  a psychologist at Princeton University  who originally saw the value of these types of tests through the lens of eugenic thought              
On June           the first SAT  then known as the Scholastic Aptitude Test  was administered to       students      of whom were male  many of whom were applying to Yale University       and Smith College                     In       James Conant and Henry Chauncey used the SAT as a means to identify recipients  besides those from the traditional northeastern private schools  for scholarships to Harvard University  By       the College Board suspended the use of the essay exams  replacing them with the SAT  due in part to the success of Harvard s SAT program as well as because of the constraints from the onset of World War II               At this time  the SAT was standardized so that a test score received by a student in one year could be directly compared to a score received by a student in another year  Test scores ranged from     to     on each of two test sections  verbal and math  and the same reference group of students was used to standardize the SAT until

After the war  due to several factors including the formation of the Educational Testing Service               the use of the SAT increased rapidly  by       about        SATs were taken  rising to about     million in                    During this time  changes made to the content of the SAT were relatively minor  and included the introduction of sentence completion questions and  quantitative comparison  math questions as well as changes in the timing of the test  In       however  the SAT was substantially changed in an attempt to make the test more closely reflect the work done by students in school and the skills that they would need in college  Among other changes  antonym questions were removed from the verbal section  and free response questions were added to the math section along with the use of calculators               In       after nearly forty years of declining scores  the SAT was recalibrated by the addition of approximately     points to each score to compensate for the decline in what constituted an average score 
In       the SAT was changed again  in part due to criticism of the test by the University of California system  which said that the test was not closely enough aligned to high school curricula               Along with the elimination of analogies from the verbal section and quantitative comparison items from the math section               a new writing section with an essay was added               The changes introduced an additional section score  increasing the maximum SAT score to                   
In early       the SAT would change again in the interest of alignment with typical high school curricula                            The changes included making the essay optional  and returning the maximum score to        changing all multiple choice questions from having five answer options to four  and the removal of penalty for wrong answers  rights only scoring                             The essay was completely removed from the SAT by mid       in the interest of reducing demands on students in the context of the COVID    pandemic

The SAT has been renamed several times since its introduction in       It was originally known as the Scholastic Aptitude Test                            In       a commission set up by the College Board to review the proposed changes to the SAT program recommended that the meaning of the initialism SAT be changed to  Scholastic Assessment Test  because a  test that integrates measures of achievement as well as developed ability can no longer be accurately described as a test of aptitude                             In       the College Board changed the name of the test to SAT I  Reasoning Test  at the same time  the name of the SAT Achievement Tests was changed to SAT II  Subject Tests               The Reasoning Test and Subject Tests were to be collectively known as the Scholastic Assessment Tests  According to the president of the College Board at the time  the name change was meant  to correct the impression among some people that the SAT measures something that is innate and impervious to change regardless of effort or instruction                The new SAT debuted in March       and was referred to as the Scholastic Assessment Test by major news organizations                            However  in       the College Board announced that the SAT could not properly be called the Scholastic Assessment Test  and that the letters SAT did not stand for anything               In       the Roman numeral in SAT I  Reasoning Test was dropped  making SAT Reasoning Test the name of the SAT               The  Reasoning Test  portion of the name was eliminated following the exam s      redesign  it is now simply called the SAT              

Reuse of old SAT exams edit 
The College Board has been accused of completely reusing old SAT papers previously given in the United States                The recycling of questions from previous exams has been exploited to allow for cheating on exams and impugned the validity of some students  test scores   Test preparation companies in Asia have been found to provide test questions to students within hours of a new SAT exam s administration                           
On August           the SAT test given in the United States was discovered to be a recycled October      international SAT test given in China  The leaked PDF file was on the internet before the August           exam
