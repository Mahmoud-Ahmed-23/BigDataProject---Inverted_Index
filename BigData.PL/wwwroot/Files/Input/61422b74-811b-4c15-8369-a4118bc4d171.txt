							Excavations at the Tel Abu Seifi site in North Sinai have uncovered extensive remains of ancient military fortifications  soldiers  quarters  a wide paved road  and a large moat offering new insights into the strategic role of Sinai as Egypt s eastern defensive frontier across successive eras 
The discoveries were made by an Egyptian archaeological mission affiliated with the Supreme Council of Antiquities  Preliminary findings suggest the possible existence of a third  previously unknown fortress at the site  predating both the Ptolemaic and Roman fortresses already identified 
Sherif Fathi  Minister of Tourism and Antiquities  hailed the findings as a breakthrough in understanding Egypt s eastern military defences during the Greco Roman period  He described Tel Abu Seifi as a long standing military and industrial center whose significance evolved over time 
Mohamed Ismail Khaled  Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities  noted that the discoveries help redraw Egypt s ancient eastern defence map   Sinai has always been Egypt s eastern gateway and first line of defence   he said  He added that the mission unearthed distinctive architectural elements of the eastern gates belonging to the Ptolemaic and Roman fortresses  which will allow historians to reimagine ancient military entryways more accurately

Among the most notable finds is a deep defensive moat over two meters in depth at the entrance to the Ptolemaic fortress  Researchers believe it formed part of a broader protective system activated in times of threat 
Mohamed Abdel Badi         Head of the Egyptian Antiquities Sector  said the team also uncovered a wide limestone paved road  measuring    meters in width and extending more than     meters from the eastern gate of the Roman fortress into the heart of the site  Beneath this lies an older  Ptolemaic era road made from similar materials  suggesting continuity in site planning across centuries 


On either side of the road  archaeologists found more than     clay planting circles likely used for cultivating trees that once lined the fortress s grand entrance during the Ptolemaic period  Additionally  well preserved Roman era soldiers  dwellings were unearthed  offering rare glimpses into daily life at the fortress during the reigns of Emperors Diocletian and Maximian

The site also revealed four large kilns used for producing quicklime  confirming the site s transformation into an industrial hub in the late Roman period an expansion that ultimately led to the destruction of earlier stone structures 
Dr  Hisham Hussein  Head of the archaeological mission and Director General of the General Administration of Sinai Antiquities  noted the discovery of another moat  likely linked to an earlier fortress  The four corners of this structure have been identified  and work is underway to determine its precise age  Excavators also uncovered overlapping layers of rectangular residential buildings from the Ptolemaic period  indicating extended occupation 
Once a key stronghold  Tel Abu Seifi rose in strategic importance following shifts in the Nile s course and the retreat of the coastline  which led to the decline of nearby Tel Habuwa  the ancient city of Tharu   The latest discoveries further reinforce Tel Abu Seifi s pivotal role in Egypt s military history and its enduring significance in understanding life and defence strategies in the Sinai Peninsula
