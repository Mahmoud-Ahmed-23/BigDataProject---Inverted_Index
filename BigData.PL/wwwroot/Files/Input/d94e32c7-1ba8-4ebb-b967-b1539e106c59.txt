							CAIRO  A military court decided Tuesday to drop a three year prison sentence handed down to Maikel Nabil  who he will be retried in another district 
While lawyers and Nabil rsquo s family demanded he be released until his retrial  a decision to release him had not been taken by the court until press time  The location of his retrial has also not yet been revealed 
Nabil  who has been on a hunger strike for    days  was previously charged with insulting the armed forces and spreading false news for a blog her wrote titled  quot The army and the people are not one hand quot  last March 
 quot We presented an official request to the court to release my son who has been on a hunger strike  hellip  his health condition is deteriorating and he has to be transferred immediately to the intensive care unit  quot  Maikel       s father Nabil Sanad told Daily News Egypt on Tuesday 
 quot My son refused to attend the court session in protest of his military trial  in addition to his bad health condition that does not allow him to move out of the prison hospital  quot  Sanad added 
Lawyer from the Front to Defend Egypt       s Protesters Ramy Ghanem told DNE that the defense team questioned the fact that Nabil wrote the blog post in the first place 
 quot The fact that the blog post was written on his blog or his Facebook account does not prove that he is the one who wrote it  quot  Ghanem said  adding that the prosecution did not present any evidence proving he wrote the blog post 
 quot The only evidence presented by the prosecution was that Maikel Nabil has an internet connection at home  The prosecution did not prove that the post was written from his home connection rsquo s IP address  quot  he added 
The blog post in question gathers evidence of what is said to be violations by the army and the military police during and after the revolution  and recounts what Nabil calls  ldquo the army       s conspiracy against the revolution  rdquo 
Nabil decided to go on a hunger strike in protest of what he considers discrimination against him  after the ruling military council pardoned activists Asmaa Mahfouz and Loai Nagati for similar charges 
Nabil was detained by military intelligence during the revolution and claimed in a complaint he filed to the Prosecutor General afterwards that he was tortured during his interrogation 
Meanwhile  activist Sahar Maher who was arrested by military police in front of C   last Tuesday at a solidarity demo for Nabil  was released and charges against her dropped 
Maher was filming a scuffle between one of the protesters and a military soldier when she was arrested and interrogated by military prosecution and charged of filming in front of a no photo military zone
