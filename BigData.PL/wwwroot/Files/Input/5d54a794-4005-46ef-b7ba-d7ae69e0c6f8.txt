History edit 
DistBelief edit 
Starting in       Google Brain built DistBelief as a proprietary machine learning system based on deep learning neural networks  Its use grew rapidly across diverse Alphabet companies in both research and commercial applications                          Google assigned multiple computer scientists  including Jeff Dean  to simplify and refactor the codebase of DistBelief into a faster  more robust application grade library  which became TensorFlow              In       the team  led by Geoffrey Hinton  had implemented generalized backpropagation and other improvements  which allowed generation of neural networks with substantially higher accuracy  for instance a     reduction in errors in speech recognition             

TensorFlow edit 
TensorFlow is Google Brain s second generation system  Version       was released on February                       While the reference implementation runs on single devices  TensorFlow can run on multiple CPUs and GPUs  with optional CUDA and SYCL extensions for general purpose computing on graphics processing units               TensorFlow is available on    bit Linux  macOS  Windows  and mobile computing platforms including Android and iOS                         
Its flexible architecture allows for easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms  CPUs  GPUs  TPUs   and from desktops to clusters of servers to mobile and edge devices 
TensorFlow computations are expressed as stateful dataflow graphs  The name TensorFlow derives from the operations that such neural networks perform on multidimensional data arrays  which are referred to as tensors              During the Google I O Conference in June       Jeff Dean stated that       repositories on GitHub mentioned TensorFlow  of which only   were from Google

TensorFlow     edit 
As TensorFlow s market share among research papers was declining to the advantage of PyTorch              the TensorFlow Team announced a release of a new major version of the library in September       TensorFlow     introduced many changes  the most significant being TensorFlow eager  which changed the automatic differentiation scheme from the static computational graph to the  Define by Run  scheme originally made popular by Chainer and later PyTorch              Other major changes included removal of old libraries  cross compatibility between trained models on different versions of TensorFlow  and significant improvements to the performance on GPU             

Features edit 
AutoDifferentiation edit 
AutoDifferentiation is the process of automatically calculating the gradient vector of a model with respect to each of its parameters  With this feature  TensorFlow can automatically compute the gradients for the parameters in a model  which is useful to algorithms such as backpropagation which require gradients to optimize performance              To do so  the framework must keep track of the order of operations done to the input Tensors in a model  and then compute the gradients with respect to the appropriate parameters             

Eager execution edit 
TensorFlow includes an  eager execution  mode  which means that operations are evaluated immediately as opposed to being added to a computational graph which is executed later              Code executed eagerly can be examined step by step through a debugger  since data is augmented at each line of code rather than later in a computational graph              This execution paradigm is considered to be easier to debug because of its step by step transparency             

Distribute edit 
In both eager and graph executions  TensorFlow provides an API for distributing computation across multiple devices with various distribution strategies              This distributed computing can often speed up the execution of training and evaluating of TensorFlow models and is a common practice in the field of AI                         

Losses edit 
To train and assess models  TensorFlow provides a set of loss functions  also known as cost functions               Some popular examples include mean squared error  MSE  and binary cross entropy  BCE               

Metrics edit 
In order to assess the performance of machine learning models  TensorFlow gives API access to commonly used metrics  Examples include various accuracy metrics  binary  categorical  sparse categorical  along with other metrics such as Precision  Recall  and Intersection over Union  IoU              

TF nn edit 
TensorFlow nn is a module for executing primitive neural network operations on models              Some of these operations include variations of convolutions       D  Atrous  depthwise   activation functions  Softmax  RELU  GELU  Sigmoid  etc   and their variations  and other operations  max pooling  bias add  etc               

Optimizers edit 
TensorFlow offers a set of optimizers for training neural networks  including ADAM  ADAGRAD  and Stochastic Gradient Descent  SGD               When training a model  different optimizers offer different modes of parameter tuning  often affecting a model s convergence and performance             

Usage and extensions edit 
TensorFlow edit 
TensorFlow serves as a core platform and library for machine learning  TensorFlow s APIs use Keras to allow users to make their own machine learning models                          In addition to building and training their model  TensorFlow can also help load the data to train the model  and deploy it using TensorFlow Serving             
TensorFlow provides a stable Python Application Program Interface  API               as well as APIs without backwards compatibility guarantee for Javascript              C                and Java                          Third party language binding packages are also available for C                           Haskell              Julia              MATLAB              Object Pascal              R              Scala              Rust              OCaml              and Crystal              Bindings that are now archived and unsupported include Go             and Swift
