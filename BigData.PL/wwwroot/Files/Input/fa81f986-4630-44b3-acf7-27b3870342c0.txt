In computability theory and computational complexity theory  an undecidable problem is a decision problem for which it is proved to be impossible to construct an algorithm that always leads to a correct yes or no answer  The halting problem is an example  it can be proven that there is no algorithm that correctly determines whether an arbitrary program eventually halts when run            


Background edit 
A decision problem is a question which  for every input in some infinite set of inputs  requires a  yes  or  no  answer             Those inputs can be numbers  for example  the decision problem  is the input a prime number    or values of some other kind  such as strings of a formal language  
The formal representation of a decision problem is a subset of the natural numbers  For decision problems on natural numbers  the set consists of those numbers that the decision problem answers  yes  to  For example  the decision problem  is the input even   is formalized as the set of even numbers  A decision problem whose input consists of strings or more complex values is formalized as the set of numbers that  via a specific G del numbering  correspond to inputs that satisfy the decision problem s criteria 
A decision problem A is called decidable or effectively solvable if the formalized set of A is a recursive set  Otherwise  A is called undecidable  A problem is called partially decidable  semi decidable  solvable  or provable if A is a recursively enumerable set      nb       

Example  the halting problem in computability theory edit 
In computability theory  the halting problem is a decision problem which can be stated as follows 

Given the description of an arbitrary program and a finite input  decide whether the program finishes running or will run forever 
Alan Turing proved in      that a general algorithm running on a Turing machine that solves the halting problem for all possible program input pairs necessarily cannot exist  Hence  the halting problem is undecidable for Turing machines

The concepts raised by G del s incompleteness theorems are very similar to those raised by the halting problem  and the proofs are quite similar  In fact  a weaker form of the First Incompleteness Theorem is an easy consequence of the undecidability of the halting problem  This weaker form differs from the standard statement of the incompleteness theorem by asserting that an axiomatization of the natural numbers that is both complete and sound is impossible  The  sound  part is the weakening  it means that we require the axiomatic system in question to prove only true statements about natural numbers  Since soundness implies consistency  this weaker form can be seen as a corollary of the strong form  It is important to observe that the statement of the standard form of G del s First Incompleteness Theorem is completely unconcerned with the truth value of a statement  but only concerns the issue of whether it is possible to find it through a mathematical proof 
The weaker form of the theorem can be proved from the undecidability of the halting problem as follows             Assume that we have a sound  and hence consistent  and complete axiomatization of all true first order logic statements about natural numbers  Then we can build an algorithm that enumerates all these statements  This means that there is an algorithm N n  that  given a natural number n  computes a true first order logic statement about natural numbers  and that for all true statements  there is at least one n such that N n  yields that statement  Now suppose we want to decide if the algorithm with representation a halts on input i   We know that this statement can be expressed with a first order logic statement  say H a  i    Since the axiomatization is complete it follows that either there is an n such that N n     H a  i  or there is an n  such that N n       H a  i    So if we iterate over all n until we either find H a  i  or its negation  we will always halt  and furthermore  the answer it gives us will be true  by soundness   This means that this gives us an algorithm to decide the halting problem  Since we know that there cannot be such an algorithm  it follows that the assumption that there is a consistent and complete axiomatization of all true first order logic statements about natural numbers must be false 

Examples of undecidable problems edit 
Main article  List of undecidable problems
Undecidable problems can be related to different topics  such as logic  abstract machines or topology  Since there are uncountably many undecidable problems      nb        any list  even one of infinite length  is necessarily incomplete 

Examples of undecidable statements edit 
See also  List of statements independent of ZFC and Independence  mathematical logic 
There are two distinct senses of the word  undecidable  in contemporary use  The first of these is the sense used in relation to G del s theorems  that of a statement being neither provable nor refutable in a specified deductive system  The second sense is used in relation to computability theory and applies not to statements but to decision problems  which are countably infinite sets of questions each requiring a yes or no answer  Such a problem is said to be undecidable if there is no computable function that correctly answers every question in the problem set   The connection between these two is that if a decision problem is undecidable  in the recursion theoretical sense  then there is no consistent  effective formal system which proves for every question A in the problem either  the answer to A is yes  or  the answer to A is no  
Because of the two meanings of the word undecidable  the term independent is sometimes used instead of undecidable for the  neither provable nor refutable  sense  The usage of  independent  is also ambiguous  however  It can mean just  not provable   leaving open whether an independent statement might be refuted 
Undecidability of a statement in a particular deductive system does not  in and of itself  address the question of whether the truth value of the statement is well defined  or whether it can be determined by other means  Undecidability only implies that the particular deductive system being considered does not prove the truth or falsity of the statement  Whether there exist so called  absolutely undecidable  statements  whose truth value can never be known or is ill specified  is a controversial point among various philosophical schools 
One of the first problems suspected to be undecidable  in the second sense of the term  was the word problem for groups  first posed by Max Dehn in       which asks if there is a finitely presented group for which no algorithm exists to determine whether two words are equivalent   This was shown to be the case in                 
The combined work of G del and Paul Cohen has given two concrete examples of undecidable statements  in the first sense of the term   The continuum hypothesis can neither be proved nor refuted in ZFC  the standard axiomatization of set theory   and the axiom of choice can neither be proved nor refuted in ZF  which is all the ZFC axioms except the axiom of choice    These results do not require the incompleteness theorem    G del proved in      that neither of these statements could be disproved in ZF or ZFC set theory  In the     s  Cohen proved that neither is provable from ZF  and the continuum hypothesis cannot be proven from ZFC 
In       Russian mathematician Yuri Matiyasevich showed that Hilbert s Tenth Problem  posed in      as a challenge to the next century of mathematicians  cannot be solved     Hilbert s challenge sought an algorithm which finds all solutions of a Diophantine equation   A Diophantine equation is a more general case of Fermat s Last Theorem  we seek the integer roots of a polynomial in any number of variables with integer coefficients   Since we have only one equation but n variables  infinitely many solutions exist  and are easy to find  in the complex plane  however  the problem becomes impossible if solutions are constrained to integer values only   Matiyasevich showed this problem to be unsolvable by mapping a Diophantine equation to a recursively enumerable set and invoking G del s Incompleteness Theorem            
In       Alan Turing proved that the halting problem the question of whether or not a Turing machine halts on a given program is undecidable  in the second sense of the term  This result was later generalized by Rice s theorem 
In       Saharon Shelah showed the Whitehead problem in group theory is undecidable  in the first sense of the term  in standard set theory            
In       Paris and Harrington proved that the Paris Harrington principle  a version of the Ramsey theorem  is undecidable in the axiomatization of arithmetic given by the Peano axioms but can be proven to be true in the larger system of second order arithmetic 
Kruskal s tree theorem  which has applications in computer science  is also undecidable from the Peano axioms but provable in set theory  In fact Kruskal s tree theorem  or its finite form  is undecidable in a much stronger system codifying the principles acceptable on basis of a philosophy of mathematics called predicativism 
Goodstein s theorem is a statement about the Ramsey theory of the natural numbers that Kirby and Paris showed is undecidable in Peano arithmetic 
Gregory Chaitin produced undecidable statements in algorithmic information theory and proved another incompleteness theorem in that setting  Chaitin s theorem states that for any theory that can represent enough arithmetic  there is an upper bound c such that no specific number can be proven in that theory to have Kolmogorov complexity greater than c  While G del s theorem is related to the liar paradox  Chaitin s result is related to Berry s paradox 
In       researchers Kurtz and Simon  building on earlier work by J H  Conway in the     s  proved that a natural generalization of the Collatz problem is undecidable            
In       Ben David and colleagues constructed an example of a learning model  named EMX   and showed a family of functions whose learnability in EMX is undecidable in standard set theory
