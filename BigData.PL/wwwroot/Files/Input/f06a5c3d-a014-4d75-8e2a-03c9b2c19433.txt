Siri    s ri        SEER ee  backronym  Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface  is a digital assistant purchased  developed  and popularized by Apple Inc   which is included in the iOS  iPadOS  watchOS  macOS  Apple TV  audioOS  and visionOS operating systems                        It uses voice queries  gesture based control  focus tracking and a natural language user interface to answer questions  make recommendations  and perform actions by delegating requests to a set of Internet services  With continued use  it adapts to users  individual language usages  searches  and preferences  returning individualized results 
Siri is a spin off from a project developed by the SRI International Artificial Intelligence Center  Its speech recognition engine was provided by Nuance Communications  and it uses advanced machine learning technologies to function  Its original American  British  and Australian voice actors recorded their respective voices around       unaware of the recordings  eventual usage  Siri was released as an app for iOS in February       Two months later  Apple acquired it and integrated it into the iPhone  s at its release on   October       removing the separate app from the iOS App Store  Siri has since been an integral part of Apple s products  having been adapted into other hardware devices including newer iPhone models  iPad  iPod Touch  Mac  AirPods  Apple TV  HomePod  and Apple Vision Pro 
Siri supports a wide range of user commands  including performing phone actions  checking basic information  scheduling events and reminders  handling device settings  searching the Internet  navigating areas  finding information on entertainment  and being able to engage with iOS integrated apps  With the release of iOS     in       Apple opened up limited third party access to Siri  including third party messaging apps  as well as payments  ride sharing  and Internet calling apps  With the release of iOS     Apple updated Siri s voice and added support for follow up questions  language translation  and additional third party actions 
iOS    and iPadOS    enabled users to activate Siri by simply saying  Siri   while the previous command   Hey Siri    is still supported  Siri was upgraded to using Apple Intelligence on iOS     iPadOS     and macOS Sequoia  replacing the logo 
Siri s original release on iPhone  s in October      received mixed reviews  It received praise for its voice recognition and contextual knowledge of user information  including calendar appointments  but was criticized for requiring stiff user commands and having a lack of flexibility  It was also criticized for lacking information on certain nearby places and for its inability to understand certain English accents  In      and       a number of media reports said that Siri lacked innovation  particularly against new competing voice assistants  The reports concerned Siri s limited set of features   bad  voice recognition  and undeveloped service integrations as causing trouble for Apple in the field of artificial intelligence and cloud based services  the basis for the complaints reportedly due to stifled development  as caused by Apple s prioritization of user privacy and executive power struggles within the company             Its launch was also overshadowed by the death of Steve Jobs  which occurred one day after the launch 


Development edit 
Siri is a spin out from the Stanford Research Institute s Artificial Intelligence Center and is an offshoot of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency s  DARPA  funded CALO project             SRI International used the NABC Framework to define the value proposition for Siri             It was co founded by Dag Kittlaus  Tom Gruber  and Adam Cheyer             Kittlaus named Siri after a co worker in Norway  the name is a short form of the name Sigrid  from Old Norse Sigr  r  composed of the elements sigr  victory  and fr  r  beautiful             
Siri s speech recognition engine was provided by Nuance Communications  a speech technology company             Neither Apple nor Nuance acknowledged this for years                        until Nuance CEO Paul Ricci confirmed it at a      technology conference             The speech recognition system uses sophisticated machine learning techniques  including convolutional neural networks and long short term memory             
The initial Siri prototype was implemented using the Active platform  a joint project between the Artificial Intelligence Center of SRI International and the Vrai Group at Ecole Polytechnique F d rale de Lausanne  The Active platform was the focus of a Ph D  thesis led by Didier Guzzoni  who joined Siri as its chief scientist             
Siri was acquired by Apple Inc  in April      under the direction of Steve Jobs              Apple s first notion of a digital personal assistant appeared in a      concept video  Knowledge Navigator                         

Apple Intelligence edit 
Main article  Apple IntelligenceSiri has been updated with enhanced capabilities made possible by Apple Intelligence  In macOS Sequoia  iOS     and iPadOS     Siri features an updated user interface  improved natural language processing  and the option to interact via text by double tapping the home bar without enabling the feature in the Accessibility menu on iOS and iPadOS  According to Apple  it adds the ability for Siri to use the context of device activities to make conversations more natural  Siri can give users device support and will have larger app support via the Siri App Intents API  Siri will be able to deliver intelligence that s tailored to the user and their on device information using personal context  For example  a user can say   When is Mom s flight landing   and Siri will find the flight details and try to cross reference them with real time flight tracking to give an arrival time                          For more day to day interactions with Apple devices  Siri will now summarize messages  on more apps than just Messages  such as Discord and Slack   According to users  this feature can be helpful but can also be inappropriate in certain situations  
Voices edit 
The original American voice of Siri was recorded in July      by Susan Bennett  who was unaware it would eventually be used for the voice assistant                          A report from The Verge in September      about voice actors  their work  and machine learning developments  hinted that Allison Dufty was the voice behind Siri                          but this was disproven when Dufty wrote on her website that she was  absolutely  positively not the voice of Siri               Citing growing pressure  Bennett revealed her role as Siri in October  and her claim was confirmed by Ed Primeau  an American audio forensics expert              Apple has never acknowledged it             
The original British male voice was provided by Jon Briggs  a former technology journalist and for    years narrated for the hit BBC quiz show The Weakest Link              After discovering he was Siri s voice by watching television  he first spoke about the role in November       He acknowledged that the voice work was done  five or six years ago   and that he didn t know how the recordings would be used                         
The original Australian voice was provided by Karen Jacobsen  a voice over artist known in Australia as the GPS girl                         
In an interview between all three voice actors and The Guardian  Briggs said that  the original system was recorded for a US company called Scansoft  who were then bought by Nuance  Apple simply licensed it              
For iOS     Apple auditioned hundreds of candidates to find new female voices  then recorded several hours of speech  including different personalities and expressions  to build a new text to speech voice based on deep learning technology              In February       Apple added Quinn  its first gender neutral voice as a fifth user option  to the iOS      developer release             

Integration edit 
Siri released as a stand alone application for the iOS operating system in February       and at the time  the developers were also intending to release Siri for Android and BlackBerry devices              Two months later  Apple acquired Siri                                      On October          Apple introduced the iPhone  S with a beta version of Siri                          After the announcement  Apple removed the existing standalone Siri app from App Store              TechCrunch wrote that  though the Siri app supports iPhone    its removal from App Store might also have had a financial aspect for the company  in providing an incentive for customers to upgrade devices              Third party developer Steven Troughton Smith  however  managed to port Siri to iPhone    though without being able to communicate with Apple s servers              A few days later  Troughton Smith  working with an anonymous person nicknamed  Chpwn   managed to fully hack Siri  enabling its full functionalities on iPhone   and iPod Touch devices              Additionally  developers were also able to successfully create and distribute legal ports of Siri to any device capable of running iOS    though a proxy server was required for Apple server interaction             

Siri Remote for the Apple TV
Over the years  Apple has expanded the line of officially supported products  including newer iPhone models              as well as iPad support in June                   iPod Touch support in September                   Apple TV support  and the stand alone Siri Remote  in September                   Mac and AirPods support in September                               and HomePod support in February

Initially limited to female voices  Apple announced in June      that Siri would feature a gender option  adding a male voice counterpart             
In September       Apple added the ability for users to speak  Hey Siri  to enable the assistant without the requirement of physically handling the device             
In September       the  Hey Siri  feature was updated to include individualized voice recognition  a presumed effort to prevent non owner activation                         
With the announcement of iOS    in June       Apple opened up limited third party developer access to Siri through a dedicated application programming interface  API   The API restricts the usage of Siri to engaging with third party messaging apps  payment apps  ride sharing apps  and Internet calling apps                         
In iOS     Siri is able to handle follow up questions  supports language translation  and opens up to more third party actions  including task management                          Additionally  users are able to type to Siri              and a new  privacy minded  on device learning  technique improves Siri s suggestions by privately analyzing personal usage of different iOS applications             
iOS    and iPadOS    allows users to simply say  Siri  to initiate Siri  and the virtual assistant now supports back to back requests  allowing users to issue multiple requests and conversations without reactivating it              In the public beta versions of iOS     iPadOS     and macOS Sonoma  Apple added support for bilingual queries to Siri             
iOS     iPadOS    and MacOS    Sequoia brought artificial intelligence  integrated with ChatGPT  to Siri              Apple calls this  Apple Intelligence              

Reception edit 
Siri received mixed reviews during its beta release as an integrated part of the iPhone  S in October      
MG Siegler of TechCrunch wrote that Siri was  great   understood much more  but had  no API that any developer can use                Writing for The New York Times  David Pogue also praised Siri s ability to understand context             Jacqui Cheng of Ars Technica wrote that Apple s claims of what Siri could do were bold  and the early demos  even bolder   this was still in beta             
While praising its ability to  decipher our casual language  and deliver  very specific and accurate result   sometimes even providing additional information  Cheng noted and criticized its restrictions  particularly when the language moved away from  stiffer commands  into more human interactions  One example included the phrase  Send a text to Jason  Clint  Sam  and Lee saying we re having dinner at Silver Cloud   which Siri interpreted as sending a message to Jason only  containing the text  Clint Sam and Lee saying we re having dinner at Silver Cloud   She also noted a lack of proper editability              
Google s executive chairman and former chief  Eric Schmidt  conceded that Siri could pose a competitive threat to the company s core search business             
Siri was criticized by pro abortion rights organizations  including the American Civil Liberties Union  ACLU  and NARAL Pro Choice America  after users found that Siri could not provide information about the location of birth control or abortion providers nearby  sometimes directing users to crisis pregnancy centers instead                                     
Natalie Kerris  a spokeswoman for Apple  told The New York Times that    These are not intentional omissions                In January       Fast Company reported that  in then recent months  Siri had begun to confuse the word  abortion  with  adoption   citing  health experts  who stated that the situation had  gotten worse   However  at the time of Fast Company     s report  the situation had changed slightly  with Siri offering  a more comprehensive list of Planned Parenthood facilities   although  Adoption clinics continue to pop up  but near the bottom of the list                          
Siri has also not been well received by some English speakers with distinctive accents  including Scottish             and Americans from Boston or the South             
In March       Frank M  Fazio filed a class action lawsuit against Apple on behalf of the people who bought the iPhone  S and felt misled about the capabilities of Siri  alleging its failure to function as depicted in Apple s Siri commercials  Fazio filed the lawsuit in California and claimed that the iPhone  S was merely a  more expensive iPhone    if Siri fails to function as advertised                          On July           U S  District Judge Claudia Wilken in San Francisco dismissed the suit but said the plaintiffs could amend at a later time  The reason given for dismissal was that plaintiffs did not sufficiently document enough misrepresentations by Apple for the trial to proceed             

Perceived lack of innovation edit 
In June       The Verge     s Sean O Kane wrote about the then upcoming major iOS    updates  with a headline stating  Siri s big upgrades won t matter if it can t understand its users  

What Apple didn t talk about was solving Siri s biggest  most basic flaws  it s still not very good at voice recognition  and when it gets it right  the results are often clunky  And these problems look even worse when you consider that Apple now has full fledged competitors in this space  Amazon s Alexa  Microsoft s Cortana  and Google s Assistant              Also writing for The Verge  Walt Mossberg had previously questioned Apple s efforts in cloud based services  writing             
         perhaps the biggest disappointment among Apple s cloud based services is the one it needs most today  right now  Siri  Before Apple bought it  Siri was on the road to being a robust digital assistant that could do many things  and integrate with many services even though it was being built by a startup with limited funds and people  After Apple bought Siri  the giant company seemed to treat it as a backwater  restricting it to doing only a few  slowly increasing number of tasks  like telling you the weather  sports scores  movie and restaurant listings  and controlling the device s functions  Its unhappy founders have left Apple to build a new AI service called Viv  And  on too many occasions  Siri either gets things wrong  doesn t know the answer  or can t verbalize it  Instead  it shows you a web search result  even when you re not in a position to read it 
In October       Bloomberg reported that Apple had plans to unify the teams behind its various cloud based services  including a single campus and reorganized cloud computing resources aimed at improving the processing of Siri s queries              although another report from The Verge  in June       once again called Siri s voice recognition  bad              
In June       The Wall Street Journal published an extensive report on the lack of innovation with Siri following competitors  advancement in the field of voice assistants  Noting that Apple workers  anxiety levels  went up a notch  on the announcement of Amazon s Alexa  the Journal wrote   Today  Apple is playing catch up in a product category it invented  increasing worries about whether the technology giant has lost some of its innovation edge   The report gave the primary causes being Apple s prioritization of user privacy  including randomly tagged six month Siri searches  whereas Google and Amazon keep data until actively discarded by the user      clarification needed      and executive power struggles within Apple  Apple did not comment on the report  while Eddy Cue said   Apple often uses generic data rather than user data to train its systems and has the ability to improve Siri s performance for individual users with information kept on their iPhones                         

Privacy controversy edit 
In July       a then anonymous whistleblower and former Apple contractor Thomas le Bonniec said that Siri regularly records some of its users  conversations even when it was not activated  The recordings are sent to Apple contractors grading Siri s responses on a variety of factors  Among other things  the contractors regularly hear private conversations between doctors and patients  business and drug deals  and couples having sex  Apple did not disclose this in its privacy documentation and did not provide a way for its users to opt in or out             

An example of a conversation with Siri 
In August       Apple apologized  halted the Siri grading program  and said that it plans to resume  later this fall when software updates are released to  its  users               The company also announced  it would no longer listen to Siri recordings without your permission               iOS       released in October       introduced the ability to opt out of the grading program and to delete all the voice recordings that Apple has stored on its servers              Users were given the choice of whether their audio data was received by Apple or not  with the ability to change their decision as often as they like  It was then made an opt in program 
In May       Thomas le Bonniec revealed himself as the whistleblower and sent a letter to European data protection regulators  calling on them to investigate Apple s  past and present  use of Siri recordings  He argued that  even though Apple has apologized  it has never faced the consequences for its years long grading program                         
In December       Apple agreed to a     million class action settlement  compensating users of Siri enabled from the past ten years  Additionally  Apple must confirm the deletion of Siri recordings before       when the feature became opt in  and issue new guidance on how data is collected and how users can participate in efforts to improve Siri             

Social impacts and awareness edit 
Disability edit 
Apple has introduced various accessibility features aimed at making its devices more inclusive for individuals with disabilities  The company provides users the opportunity to share feedback on accessibility features through email              Some of the new functionalities include live speech  personal voice  Siri s atypical speech pattern recognition  and much more               
Accessibility features  

VoiceOver  This feature provides visual feedback for Siri responses  allowing users to engage with Siri through both visual and auditory channels             
Voice to text and text to voice  Siri can transcribe spoken words into and text as well as read text typed by the user out loud             
Text commands  Users can type what they want Siri to do             
Personal voice  This allows users to create a synthesized voice that sounds like them             
Minority bias edit 
Siri  like many AI systems  can perpetuate gender and racial biases through its design and functionality  According to an article from The Conversation  Siri  reinforces the role of women as secondary and submissive to men  due to the fact that the default is a soft  female voice              Although Apple now offers a larger variety of voices with different accents and languages  this original narrative perpetuates the idea of women servicing men  Not only this but the article also explains how different settings of Siri s voice result in different responses  specifically the female voice being programmed with more flirtatious statements than the male voice  Additionally  Siri may misinterpret certain accents or dialects  particularly those spoken by people from marginalized racial or ethnic backgrounds  making it less accessible to these groups  According to an article from The Scientific American  Claudia Lloreda explains that non native English speakers have to  adapt our way of speaking to interact with speech recognition technologies               Furthermore  due to repetitive  learnings  from a larger user base  Siri may unintentionally produce a Western perspective  limiting representation and furthering biases in everyday interactions  Despite these perpetuated issues  Siri does not provides several benefits as well  especially for those with disabilities that typically limit their abilities to use technology and access the internet 

Swearing edit 
The iOS version of Siri ships with a vulgar content filter  however  it is disabled by default and must be enabled by the user manually             
In       Ars Technica reported a new glitch that could be exploited by a user requesting the definition of  mother  be read out loud  Siri would issue a response and ask the user if they would like to hear the next definition  when the user replies with  yes   Siri would mention  mother  as being short for  motherfucker                This resulted in multiple YouTube videos featuring the responses and or how to trigger them  Apple fixed the issue silently  The content is picked up from third party sources such as the Oxford English Dictionary and not a supplied message from the corporation              

In popular culture edit 
Siri provided the voice of  Puter in The Lego Batman Movie
