The history of artificial intelligence  AI  began in antiquity  with myths  stories  and rumors of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen  The study of logic and formal reasoning from antiquity to the present led directly to the invention of the programmable digital computer in the     s  a machine based on abstract mathematical reasoning  This device and the ideas behind it inspired scientists to begin discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain 
The field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College in                  Attendees of the workshop became the leaders of AI research for decades  Many of them predicted that machines as intelligent as humans would exist within a generation  The U S  government provided millions of dollars with the hope of making this vision come true            
Eventually  it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of this feat             In       criticism from James Lighthill and pressure from the U S A  Congress led the U S  and British Governments to stop funding undirected research into artificial intelligence  Seven years later  a visionary initiative by the Japanese Government and the success of expert systems  reinvigorated investment in AI  and by the late     s  the industry had grown into a billion dollar enterprise  However  investors  enthusiasm waned in the     s  and the field was criticized in the press and avoided by industry  a period known as an  AI winter    Nevertheless  research and funding continued to grow under other names 
In the early     s  machine learning was applied to a wide range of problems in academia and industry  The success was due to the availability of powerful computer hardware  the collection of immense data sets  and the application of solid mathematical methods  Soon after  deep learning proved to be a breakthrough technology  eclipsing all other methods  The transformer architecture debuted in      and was used to produce impressive generative AI applications  amongst other use cases 
Investment in AI boomed in the     s  The recent AI boom  initiated by the development of transformer architecture  led to the rapid scaling and public releases of large language models  LLMs  like ChatGPT  These models exhibit human like traits of knowledge  attention  and creativity  and have been integrated into various sectors  fueling exponential investment in AI  However  concerns about the potential risks and ethical implications of advanced AI have also emerged  prompting debate about the future of AI and its impact on society 


Precursors edit 
Mythical  fictional  and speculative precursors edit 
Myth and legend edit 
In Greek mythology  Talos was a giant made of bronze who acted as guardian for the island of Crete  He would throw boulders at the ships of invaders and would complete   circuits around the island s perimeter daily             According to pseudo Apollodorus  Bibliotheke  Hephaestus forged Talos with the aid of a cyclops and presented the automaton as a gift to Minos             In the Argonautica  Jason and the Argonauts defeated Talos by removing a plug near his foot  causing the vital ichor to flow out from his body and rendering him lifeless            
Pygmalion was a legendary king and sculptor of Greek mythology  famously represented in Ovid s Metamorphoses  In the   th book of Ovid s narrative poem  Pygmalion becomes disgusted with women when he witnesses the way in which the Propoetides prostitute themselves  Despite this  he makes offerings at the temple of Venus asking the goddess to bring to him a woman just like a statue he carved            

Medieval legends of artificial beings edit 
Depiction of a homunculus from Goethe s Faust
In Of the Nature of Things  the Swiss alchemist Paracelsus describes a procedure that he claims can fabricate an  artificial man   By placing the  sperm of a man  in horse dung  and feeding it the  Arcanum of Mans blood  after    days  the concoction will become a living infant            
The earliest written account regarding golem making is found in the writings of Eleazar ben Judah of Worms in the early   th century             During the Middle Ages  it was believed that the animation of a Golem could be achieved by insertion of a piece of paper with any of God s names on it  into the mouth of the clay figure              Unlike legendary automata like Brazen Heads              a Golem was unable to speak             
Takwin  the artificial creation of life  was a frequent topic of Ismaili alchemical manuscripts  especially those attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan  Islamic alchemists attempted to create a broad range of life through their work  ranging from plants to animals             
In Faust  The Second Part of the Tragedy by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe  an alchemically fabricated homunculus  destined to live forever in the flask in which he was made  endeavors to be born into a full human body  Upon the initiation of this transformation  however  the flask shatters and the homunculus dies             

Modern fiction edit 
Main article  Artificial intelligence in fiction
By the   th century  ideas about artificial men and thinking machines became a popular theme in fiction  Notable works like Mary Shelley s Frankenstein  and Karel  apek s R U R   Rossum s Universal Robots             
explored the concept of artificial life  Speculative essays  such as Samuel Butler s  Darwin among the Machines               and Edgar Allan Poe s  Maelzel s Chess Player              reflected society s growing interest in machines with artificial intelligence  AI remains a common topic in science fiction today             

Automata edit 
Main article  Automaton
Al Jazari s programmable automata       CE 
Realistic humanoid automata were built by craftsman from many civilizations  including Yan Shi              Hero of Alexandria              Al Jazari              Haroun al Rashid              Jacques de Vaucanson                          Leonardo Torres y Quevedo              Pierre Jaquet Droz and Wolfgang von Kempelen                         
The oldest known automata were the sacred statues of ancient Egypt and Greece                          The faithful believed that craftsman had imbued these figures with very real minds  capable of wisdom and emotion Hermes Trismegistus wrote that  by discovering the true nature of the gods  man has been able to reproduce it               English scholar Alexander Neckham asserted that the Ancient Roman poet Virgil had built a palace with automaton statues             
During the early modern period  these legendary automata were said to possess the magical ability to answer questions put to them  The late medieval alchemist and proto Protestant Roger Bacon was purported to have fabricated a brazen head  having developed a legend of having been a wizard                          These legends were similar to the Norse myth of the Head of M mir  According to legend  M mir was known for his intellect and wisdom  and was beheaded in the  sir Vanir War  Odin is said to have  embalmed  the head with herbs and spoke incantations over it such that M mir s head remained able to speak wisdom to Odin  Odin then kept the head near him for counsel             

Formal reasoning edit 
Artificial intelligence is based on the assumption that the process of human thought can be mechanized  The study of mechanical or  formal  reasoning has a long history  Chinese  Indian and Greek philosophers all developed structured methods of formal deduction by the first millennium BCE  Their ideas were developed over the centuries by philosophers such as Aristotle  who gave a formal analysis of the syllogism               Euclid  whose Elements was a model of formal reasoning   al Khw rizm   who developed algebra and gave his name to the word algorithm  and European scholastic philosophers such as William of Ockham and Duns Scotus             
Spanish philosopher Ramon Llull             developed several logical machines devoted to the production of knowledge by logical means                          Llull described his machines as mechanical entities that could combine basic and undeniable truths by simple logical operations  produced by the machine by mechanical meanings  in such ways as to produce all the possible knowledge              Llull s work had a great influence on Gottfried Leibniz  who redeveloped his ideas             

Gottfried Leibniz  who speculated that human reason could be reduced to mechanical calculation
In the   th century  Leibniz  Thomas Hobbes and Ren  Descartes explored the possibility that all rational thought could be made as systematic as algebra or geometry              Hobbes famously wrote in Leviathan   For reason     is nothing but reckoning  that is adding and subtracting               Leibniz envisioned a universal language of reasoning  the characteristica universalis  which would reduce argumentation to calculation so that  there would be no more need of disputation between two philosophers than between two accountants  For it would suffice to take their pencils in hand  down to their slates  and to say each other  with a friend as witness  if they liked   Let us calculate               These philosophers had begun to articulate the physical symbol system hypothesis that would become the guiding faith of AI research 
The study of mathematical logic provided the essential breakthrough that made artificial intelligence seem plausible  The foundations had been set by such works as Boole s The Laws of Thought and Frege s Begriffsschrift              Building on Frege s system  Russell and Whitehead presented a formal treatment of the foundations of mathematics in their masterpiece  the Principia Mathematica in       Inspired by Russell s success  David Hilbert challenged mathematicians of the     s and   s to answer this fundamental question   can all of mathematical reasoning be formalized               His question was answered by G del s incompleteness proof              Turing s machine             and Church s Lambda calculus      a     

US Army photo of the ENIAC at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering            
Their answer was surprising in two ways  First  they proved that there were  in fact  limits to what mathematical logic could accomplish  But second  and more important for AI  their work suggested that  within these limits  any form of mathematical reasoning could be mechanized  The Church Turing thesis implied that a mechanical device  shuffling symbols as simple as   and    could imitate any conceivable process of mathematical deduction              The key insight was the Turing machine a simple theoretical construct that captured the essence of abstract symbol manipulation              This invention would inspire a handful of scientists to begin discussing the possibility of thinking machines 

Computer science edit 
Main articles  History of computer hardware and History of computer science
Calculating machines were designed or built in antiquity and throughout history by many people  including 
Gottfried Leibniz                         
Joseph Marie Jacquard              
Charles Babbage                         
Percy Ludgate             
Leonardo Torres Quevedo             
Vannevar Bush             
and others  Ada Lovelace speculated that Babbage s machine was  a thinking or     reasoning machine   but warned  It is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that arise as to the powers  of the machine                         
The first modern computers were the massive machines of the Second World War  such as Konrad Zuse s Z   Alan Turing s Heath Robinson and Colossus  Atanasoff and Berry s ABC and ENIAC at the University of Pennsylvania               ENIAC was based on the theoretical foundation laid by Alan Turing and developed by John von Neumann              and proved to be the most influential             

Birth of artificial intelligence           edit 
The IBM      a computer used by the first generation of AI researchers 
The earliest research into thinking machines was inspired by a confluence of ideas that became prevalent in the late     s      s  and early     s  Recent research in neurology had shown that the brain was an electrical network of neurons that fired in all or nothing pulses  Norbert Wiener s cybernetics described control and stability in electrical networks  Claude Shannon s information theory described digital signals  i e   all or nothing signals   Alan Turing s theory of computation showed that any form of computation could be described digitally  The close relationship between these ideas suggested that it might be possible to construct an  electronic brain  
In the     s and   s  a handful of scientists from a variety of fields  mathematics  psychology  engineering  economics and political science  explored several research directions that would be vital to later AI research              Alan Turing was among the first people to seriously investigate the theoretical possibility of  machine intelligence               The field of  artificial intelligence research  was founded as an academic discipline in                  

Turing test            
Turing Test edit 
Main article  Turing test
In      Turing published a landmark paper  Computing Machinery and Intelligence   in which he speculated about the possibility of creating machines that think                  b      In the paper  he noted that  thinking  is difficult to define and devised his famous Turing Test  If a machine could carry on a conversation  over a teleprinter  that was indistinguishable from a conversation with a human being  then it was reasonable to say that the machine was  thinking               This simplified version of the problem allowed Turing to argue convincingly that a  thinking machine  was at least plausible and the paper answered all the most common objections to the proposition              The Turing Test was the first serious proposal in the philosophy of artificial intelligence 

Neuroscience and Hebbian theory edit 
Donald Hebb was a Canadian psychologist whose work laid the foundation for modern neuroscience  particularly in understanding learning  memory  and neural plasticity  His most influential book  The Organization of Behavior         introduced the concept of Hebbian learning  often summarized as  cells that fire together wire together  
            
Hebb began formulating the foundational ideas for this book in the early     s  particularly during his time at the Yerkes Laboratories of Primate Biology from      to       He made extensive notes between June      and March      and sent a complete draft to his mentor Karl Lashley in       The manuscript for The Organization of Behavior wasn t published until       The delay was due to various factors  including World War II and shifts in academic focus  By the time it was published  several of his peers had already published related ideas  making Hebb s work seem less groundbreaking at first glance  However  his synthesis of psychological and neurophysiological principles became a cornerstone of neuroscience and machine learning 
            
            

Artificial neural networks edit 
Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch analyzed networks of idealized artificial neurons and showed how they might perform simple logical functions in       They were the first to describe what later researchers would call a neural network              The paper was influenced by Turing s paper  On Computable Numbers  from      using similar two state boolean  neurons   but was the first to apply it to neuronal function              One of the students inspired by Pitts and McCulloch was Marvin Minsky who was a    year old graduate student at the time  In      Minsky and Dean Edmonds built the first neural net machine  the SNARC              Minsky would later become one of the most important leaders and innovators in AI 

Cybernetic robots edit 
Experimental robots such as W  Grey Walter s turtles and the Johns Hopkins Beast  were built in the     s  These machines did not use computers  digital electronics or symbolic reasoning  they were controlled entirely by analog circuitry             

Game AI edit 
In       using the Ferranti Mark   machine of the University of Manchester  Christopher Strachey wrote a checkers program             and Dietrich Prinz wrote one for chess              Arthur Samuel s checkers program  the subject of his      paper  Some Studies in Machine Learning Using the Game of Checkers   eventually achieved sufficient skill to challenge a respectable amateur              Samuel s program was among the first uses of what would later be called machine learning              Game AI would continue to be used as a measure of progress in AI throughout its history 

Symbolic reasoning and the Logic Theorist edit 
Herbert Simon  left  in a chess match against Allen Newell c            
Main article  Logic theorist
When access to digital computers became possible in the mid fifties  a few scientists instinctively recognized that a machine that could manipulate numbers could also manipulate symbols and that the manipulation of symbols could well be the essence of human thought  This was a new approach to creating thinking machines                         
In       Allen Newell and future Nobel Laureate Herbert A  Simon created the  Logic Theorist   with help from J  C  Shaw  The program would eventually prove    of the first    theorems in Russell and Whitehead s Principia Mathematica  and find new and more elegant proofs for some              Simon said that they had  solved the venerable mind body problem  explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties of mind                   c      The symbolic reasoning paradigm they introduced would dominate AI research and funding until the middle   s  as well as inspire the cognitive revolution 

Dartmouth Workshop edit 
Main article  Dartmouth workshop
The Dartmouth workshop of      was a pivotal event that marked the formal inception of AI as an academic discipline              It was organized by Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy  with the support of two senior scientists Claude Shannon and Nathan Rochester of IBM  The proposal for the conference stated they intended to test the assertion that  every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it                   d      The term  Artificial Intelligence  was introduced by John McCarthy at the workshop      e      
The participants included Ray Solomonoff  Oliver Selfridge  Trenchard More  Arthur Samuel  Allen Newell and Herbert A  Simon  all of whom would create important programs during the first decades of AI research                  f      At the workshop Newell and Simon debuted the  Logic Theorist               The workshop was the moment that AI gained its name  its mission  its first major success and its key players  and is widely considered the birth of AI      g     

Cognitive revolution edit 
Main article  cognitive revolution
In the autumn of       Newell and Simon also presented the Logic Theorist at a meeting of the Special Interest Group in Information Theory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  MIT   At the same meeting  Noam Chomsky discussed his generative grammar  and George Miller described his landmark paper  The Magical Number Seven  Plus or Minus Two   Miller wrote  I left the symposium with a conviction  more intuitive than rational  that experimental psychology  theoretical linguistics  and the computer simulation of cognitive processes were all pieces from a larger whole                          
This meeting was the beginning of the  cognitive revolution  an interdisciplinary paradigm shift in psychology  philosophy  computer science and neuroscience  It inspired the creation of the sub fields of symbolic artificial intelligence  generative linguistics  cognitive science  cognitive psychology  cognitive neuroscience and the philosophical schools of computationalism and functionalism  All these fields used related tools to model the mind and results discovered in one field were relevant to the others 
The cognitive approach allowed researchers to consider  mental objects  like thoughts  plans  goals  facts or memories  often analyzed using high level symbols in functional networks  These objects had been forbidden as  unobservable  by earlier paradigms such as behaviorism      h      Symbolic mental objects would become the major focus of AI research and funding for the next several decades 

Early successes             edit 
The programs developed in the years after the Dartmouth Workshop were  to most people  simply  astonishing       i      computers were solving algebra word problems  proving theorems in geometry and learning to speak English  Few at the time would have believed that such  intelligent  behavior by machines was possible at all                                      Researchers expressed an intense optimism in private and in print  predicting that a fully intelligent machine would be built in less than    years              Government agencies like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  DARPA  then known as  ARPA   poured money into the field              Artificial Intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and US universities in the latter     s and early     s             

Approaches edit 
There were many successful programs and new directions in the late   s and     s  Among the most influential were these 

Reasoning  planning and problem solving as search edit 
Many early AI programs used the same basic algorithm  To achieve some goal  like winning a game or proving a theorem   they proceeded step by step towards it  by making a move or a deduction  as if searching through a maze  backtracking whenever they reached a dead end              The principal difficulty was that  for many problems  the number of possible paths through the  maze  was astronomical  a situation known as a  combinatorial explosion    Researchers would reduce the search space by using heuristics that would eliminate paths that were unlikely to lead to a solution             
Newell and Simon tried to capture a general version of this algorithm in a program called the  General Problem Solver                            Other  searching  programs were able to accomplish impressive tasks like solving problems in geometry and algebra  such as Herbert Gelernter s Geometry Theorem Prover                     and Symbolic Automatic Integrator  SAINT   written by Minsky s student James Slagle in                                 Other programs searched through goals and subgoals to plan actions  like the STRIPS system developed at Stanford to control the behavior of the robot Shakey              

Natural language edit 
An example of a semantic network
An important goal of AI research is to allow computers to communicate in natural languages like English  An early success was Daniel Bobrow s program STUDENT  which could solve high school algebra word problems              
A semantic net represents concepts  e g   house    door   as nodes  and relations among concepts as links between the nodes  e g   has a    The first AI program to use a semantic net was written by Ross Quillian              and the most successful  and controversial  version was Roger Schank s Conceptual dependency theory              
Joseph Weizenbaum s ELIZA could carry out conversations that were so realistic that users occasionally were fooled into thinking they were communicating with a human being and not a computer program  see ELIZA effect   But in fact  ELIZA simply gave a canned response or repeated back what was said to it  rephrasing its response with a few grammar rules  ELIZA was the first chatbot                           

Micro worlds edit 
In the late   s  Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert of the MIT AI Laboratory proposed that AI research should focus on artificially simple situations known as micro worlds      j      They pointed out that in successful sciences like physics  basic principles were often best understood using simplified models like frictionless planes or perfectly rigid bodies  Much of the research focused on a  blocks world   which consists of colored blocks of various shapes and sizes arrayed on a flat surface              
This paradigm led to innovative work in machine vision by Gerald Sussman  Adolfo Guzman  David Waltz  who invented  constraint propagation    and especially Patrick Winston  At the same time  Minsky and Papert built a robot arm that could stack blocks  bringing the blocks world to life  Terry Winograd s SHRDLU could communicate in ordinary English sentences about the micro world  plan operations and execute them              

Perceptrons and early neural networks edit 
Main article  Perceptron
In the     s funding was primarily directed towards laboratories researching symbolic AI  however several people still pursued research in neural networks 

The Mark   Perceptron The perceptron  a single layer neural network was introduced in      by Frank Rosenblatt               who had been a schoolmate of Marvin Minsky at the Bronx High School of Science                Like most AI researchers  he was optimistic about their power  predicting that a perceptron  may eventually be able to learn  make decisions  and translate languages                Rosenblatt was primarily funded by Office of Naval Research              
Bernard Widrow and his student Ted Hoff built ADALINE        and MADALINE         which had up to      adjustable weights                            A group at Stanford Research Institute led by Charles A  Rosen and Alfred E   Ted  Brain built two neural network machines named MINOS I        and II         mainly funded by U S  Army Signal Corps  MINOS II              had      adjustable weights               and was controlled with an SDS     computer in a configuration named MINOS III         which could classify symbols on army maps  and recognize hand printed characters on Fortran coding sheets                            Most of neural network research during this early period involved building and using bespoke hardware  rather than simulation on digital computers      k     
However  partly due to lack of results and partly due to competition from symbolic AI research  the MINOS project ran out of funding in       Rosenblatt failed to secure continued funding in the     s               In       research came to a sudden halt with the publication of Minsky and Papert s      book Perceptrons               It suggested that there were severe limitations to what perceptrons could do and that Rosenblatt s predictions had been grossly exaggerated  The effect of the book was that virtually no research was funded in connectionism for    years               The competition for government funding ended with the victory of symbolic AI approaches over neural networks                           
Minsky  who had worked on SNARC  became a staunch objector to pure connectionist AI  Widrow  who had worked on ADALINE  turned to adaptive signal processing  The SRI group  which worked on MINOS  turned to symbolic AI and robotics                           
The main problem was the inability to train multilayered networks  versions of backpropagation had already been used in other fields but it was unknown to these researchers                             The AI community became aware of backpropogation in the   s               and  in the   st century  neural networks would become enormously successful  fulfilling all of Rosenblatt s optimistic predictions  Rosenblatt did not live to see this  however  as he died in a boating accident in                   

Optimism edit 
The first generation of AI researchers made these predictions about their work 

      H  A  Simon and Allen Newell   within ten years a digital computer will be the world s chess champion  and  within ten years a digital computer will discover and prove an important new mathematical theorem               
      H  A  Simon   machines will be capable  within twenty years  of doing any work a man can do               
      Marvin Minsky   Within a generation    the problem of creating  artificial intelligence  will substantially be solved               
      Marvin Minsky  in Life magazine    In from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being                    l     
Financing edit 
In June       MIT received a      million grant from the newly created Advanced Research Projects Agency  ARPA  later known as DARPA   The money was used to fund project MAC which subsumed the  AI Group  founded by Minsky and McCarthy five years earlier  DARPA continued to provide    million each year until the   s               DARPA made similar grants to Newell and Simon s program at Carnegie Mellon University and to Stanford University s AI Lab  founded by John McCarthy in                    Another important AI laboratory was established at Edinburgh University by Donald Michie in                    These four institutions would continue to be the main centers of AI research and funding in academia for many years                   m     
The money was given with few strings attached  J  C  R  Licklider  then the director of ARPA  believed that his organization should  fund people  not projects   and allowed researchers to pursue whatever directions might interest them                This created a freewheeling atmosphere at MIT that gave birth to the hacker culture               but this  hands off  approach did not last 

First AI Winter             edit 
In the     s  AI was subject to critiques and financial setbacks  AI researchers had failed to appreciate the difficulty of the problems they faced  Their tremendous optimism had raised public expectations impossibly high  and when the promised results failed to materialize  funding targeted at AI was severely reduced               The lack of success indicated the techniques being used by AI researchers at the time were insufficient to achieve their goals                           
These setbacks did not affect the growth and progress of the field  however  The funding cuts only impacted a handful of major laboratories              and the critiques were largely ignored               General public interest in the field continued to grow               the number of researchers increased dramatically               and new ideas were explored in logic programming  commonsense reasoning and many other areas  Historian Thomas Haigh argued in      that there was no winter               and AI researcher Nils Nilsson described this period as the most  exciting  time to work in AI              

Problems edit 
In the early seventies  the capabilities of AI programs were limited  Even the most impressive could only handle trivial versions of the problems they were supposed to solve      n      all the programs were  in some sense   toys                AI researchers had begun to run into several limits that would be only conquered decades later  and others that still stymie the field in the     s 

Limited computer power  There was not enough memory or processing speed to accomplish anything truly useful      o      For example  Ross Quillian s successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only    words  because that was all that would fit in memory               Hans Moravec argued in      that computers were still millions of times too weak to exhibit intelligence  He suggested an analogy  artificial intelligence requires computer power in the same way that aircraft require horsepower  Below a certain threshold  it s impossible  but  as power increases  eventually it could become easy   With enough horsepower   he wrote   anything will fly                    p     
Intractability and the combinatorial explosion  In      Richard Karp  building on Stephen Cook s      theorem  showed there are many problems that can only be solved in exponential time  Finding optimal solutions to these problems requires extraordinary amounts of computer time  except when the problems are trivial  This limitation applied to all symbolic AI programs that used search trees and meant that many of the  toy  solutions used by AI would never scale to useful systems                           
Moravec s paradox  Early AI research had been very successful at getting computers to do  intelligent  tasks like proving theorems  solving geometry problems and playing chess  Their success at these intelligent tasks convinced them that the problem of intelligent behavior had been largely solved                            However  they utterly failed to make progress on  unintelligent  tasks like recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into anything                            By the     s  researchers would realize that symbolic reasoning was utterly unsuited for these perceptual and sensorimotor tasks and that there were limits to this approach              
The breadth of commonsense knowledge  Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require enormous amounts of information about the world  the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about  This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does  Researchers soon discovered that this was a vast amount of information with billions of atomic facts  No one in      could build a database large enough and no one knew how a program might learn so much information              
Representing commonsense reasoning  A number of related problems     q      appeared when researchers tried to represent commonsense reasoning using formal logic or symbols   Descriptions of very ordinary deductions tended to get longer and longer the more one worked on them  as more and more exceptions  clarifications and distinctions were required      r      However  when people thought about ordinary concepts they did not rely on precise definitions  rather they seemed to make hundreds of imprecise assumptions  correcting them when necessary using their entire body of commonsense knowledge  Gerald Sussman observed that  using precise language to describe essentially imprecise concepts doesn t make them any more precise               
Decrease in funding edit

The agencies which funded AI research  such as the British government  DARPA and the National Research Council  NRC  became frustrated with the lack of progress and eventually cut off almost all funding for undirected AI research  The pattern began in      when the Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee  ALPAC  report criticized machine translation efforts  After spending     million  the NRC ended all support               In       the Lighthill report on the state of AI research in the UK criticized the failure of AI to achieve its  grandiose objectives  and led to the dismantling of AI research in that country                The report specifically mentioned the combinatorial explosion problem as a reason for AI s failings                                 s      DARPA was deeply disappointed with researchers working on the Speech Understanding Research program at CMU and canceled an annual grant of    million                   t     
Hans Moravec blamed the crisis on the unrealistic predictions of his colleagues   Many researchers were caught up in a web of increasing exaggeration                    u      However  there was another issue  since the passage of the Mansfield Amendment in       DARPA had been under increasing pressure to fund  mission oriented direct research  rather than basic undirected research   Funding for the creative  freewheeling exploration that had gone on in the   s would not come from DARPA  which instead directed money at specific projects with clear objectives  such as autonomous tanks and battle management systems                   v     
The major laboratories  MIT  Stanford  CMU and Edinburgh  had been receiving generous support from their governments  and when it was withdrawn  these were the only places that were seriously impacted by the budget cuts  The thousands of researchers outside these institutions and the many more thousands that were joining the field were unaffected              

Philosophical and ethical critiques edit 
See also  Philosophy of artificial intelligence
Several philosophers had strong objections to the claims being made by AI researchers  One of the earliest was John Lucas  who argued that G del s incompleteness theorem showed that a formal system  such as a computer program  could never see the truth of certain statements  while a human being could               Hubert Dreyfus ridiculed the broken promises of the     s and critiqued the assumptions of AI  arguing that human reasoning actually involved very little  symbol processing  and a great deal of embodied  instinctive  unconscious  know how       w                   John Searle s Chinese Room argument  presented in       attempted to show that a program could not be said to  understand  the symbols that it uses  a quality called  intentionality    If the symbols have no meaning for the machine  Searle argued  then the machine can not be described as  thinking               
These critiques were not taken seriously by AI researchers  Problems like intractability and commonsense knowledge seemed much more immediate and serious  It was unclear what difference  know how  or  intentionality  made to an actual computer program  MIT s Minsky said of Dreyfus and Searle  they misunderstand  and should be ignored                Dreyfus  who also taught at MIT  was given a cold shoulder  he later said that AI researchers  dared not be seen having lunch with me                Joseph Weizenbaum  the author of ELIZA  was also an outspoken critic of Dreyfus  positions  but he  deliberately made it plain that  his AI colleagues  treatment of Dreyfus  was not the way to treat a human being       x      and was unprofessional and childish              
Weizenbaum began to have serious ethical doubts about AI when Kenneth Colby wrote a  computer program which can conduct psychotherapeutic dialogue  based on ELIZA                                y      Weizenbaum was disturbed that Colby saw a mindless program as a serious therapeutic tool  A feud began  and the situation was not helped when Colby did not credit Weizenbaum for his contribution to the program  In       Weizenbaum published Computer Power and Human Reason which argued that the misuse of artificial intelligence has the potential to devalue human life              

Logic at Stanford  CMU and Edinburgh edit 
Logic was introduced into AI research as early as       by John McCarthy in his Advice Taker proposal                            In       J  Alan Robinson had discovered a simple method to implement deduction on computers  the resolution and unification algorithm               However  straightforward implementations  like those attempted by McCarthy and his students in the late     s  were especially intractable  the programs required astronomical numbers of steps to prove simple theorems                            A more fruitful approach to logic was developed in the     s by Robert Kowalski at the University of Edinburgh  and soon this led to the collaboration with French researchers Alain Colmerauer and Philippe Roussel           fr      who created the successful logic programming language Prolog               Prolog uses a subset of logic  Horn clauses  closely related to  rules  and  production rules   that permit tractable computation  Rules would continue to be influential  providing a foundation for Edward Feigenbaum s expert systems and the continuing work by Allen Newell and Herbert A  Simon that would lead to Soar and their unified theories of cognition              
Critics of the logical approach noted  as Dreyfus had  that human beings rarely used logic when they solved problems  Experiments by psychologists like Peter Wason  Eleanor Rosch  Amos Tversky  Daniel Kahneman and others provided proof      z      McCarthy responded that what people do is irrelevant  He argued that what is really needed are machines that can solve problems not machines that think as people do      aa     

MIT s  anti logic  approach edit 
Among the critics of McCarthy s approach were his colleagues across the country at MIT  Marvin Minsky  Seymour Papert and Roger Schank were trying to solve problems like  story understanding  and  object recognition  that required a machine to think like a person  In order to use ordinary concepts like  chair  or  restaurant  they had to make all the same illogical assumptions that people normally made  Unfortunately  imprecise concepts like these are hard to represent in logic  MIT chose instead to focus on writing programs that solved a given task without using high level abstract definitions or general theories of cognition  and measured performance by iterative testing  rather than arguments from first principles  Schank described their  anti logic  approaches as scruffy  as opposed to the neat paradigm used by McCarthy  Kowalski  Feigenbaum  Newell and Simon                   ab     
In       in a seminal paper  Minsky noted that many of his fellow researchers were using the same kind of tool  a framework that captures all our common sense assumptions about something  For example  if we use the concept of a bird  there is a constellation of facts that immediately come to mind  we might assume that it flies  eats worms and so on  none of which are true for all birds   Minsky associated these assumptions with the general category and they could be inherited by the frames for subcategories and individuals  or over ridden as necessary  He called these structures frames  Schank used a version of frames he called  scripts  to successfully answer questions about short stories in English               Frames would eventually be widely used in software engineering under the name object oriented programming 
The logicians rose to the challenge  Pat Hayes claimed that  most of  frames  is just a new syntax for parts of first order logic   But he noted that  there are one or two apparently minor details which give a lot of trouble  however  especially defaults               
Ray Reiter admitted that  conventional logics  such as first order
logic  lack the expressive power to adequately represent the knowledge required for reasoning by default                He proposed augmenting first order logic with a closed world assumption that a conclusion holds  by default  if its contrary cannot be shown  He showed how such an assumption corresponds to the common sense assumption made in reasoning with frames  He also showed that it has its  procedural equivalent  as negation as failure in Prolog  The closed world assumption  as formulated by Reiter   is not a first order notion   It is a meta notion                 However  Keith Clark showed that negation as finite failure can be understood as reasoning implicitly with definitions in first order logic including a unique name assumption that different terms denote different individuals              
During the late     s and throughout the     s  a variety of logics and extensions of first order logic were developed both for negation as failure in logic programming and for default reasoning more generally  Collectively  these logics have become known as non monotonic logics 

Boom             edit 
In the     s  a form of AI program called  expert systems  was adopted by corporations around the world and knowledge became the focus of mainstream AI research  Governments provided substantial funding  such as Japan s fifth generation computer project and the U S  Strategic Computing Initiative   Overall  the AI industry boomed from a few million dollars in      to billions of dollars in                    

Expert systems become widely used edit 
An expert system is a program that answers questions or solves problems about a specific domain of knowledge  using logical rules that are derived from the knowledge of experts              
The earliest examples were developed by Edward Feigenbaum and his students  Dendral  begun in       identified compounds from spectrometer readings                            MYCIN  developed in       diagnosed infectious blood diseases               They demonstrated the feasibility of the approach 
Expert systems restricted themselves to a small domain of specific knowledge  thus avoiding the commonsense knowledge problem               and their simple design made it relatively easy for programs to be built and then modified once they were in place  All in all  the programs proved to be useful  something that AI had not been able to achieve up to this point              
In       an expert system called R  was completed at CMU for the Digital Equipment Corporation  It was an enormous success  it was saving the company    million dollars annually by                    Corporations around the world began to develop and deploy expert systems and by      they were spending over a billion dollars on AI  most of it to in house AI departments               An industry grew up to support them  including hardware companies like Symbolics and Lisp Machines and software companies such as IntelliCorp and Aion              

Government funding increases edit 
In       the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry set aside      million for the Fifth generation computer project  Their objectives were to write programs and build machines that could carry on conversations  translate languages  interpret pictures  and reason like human beings               Much to the chagrin of scruffies  they initially chose Prolog as the primary computer language for the project              
Other countries responded with new programs of their own  The UK began the      million Alvey project               A consortium of American companies formed the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation  or  MCC   to fund large scale projects in AI and information technology                            DARPA responded as well  founding the Strategic Computing Initiative and tripling its investment in AI between      and                                

Knowledge revolution edit 
The power of expert systems came from the expert knowledge they contained  They were part of a new direction in AI research that had been gaining ground throughout the   s   AI researchers were beginning to suspect reluctantly  for it violated the scientific canon of parsimony that intelligence might very well be based on the ability to use large amounts of diverse knowledge in different ways                writes Pamela McCorduck    T he great lesson from the     s was that intelligent behavior depended very much on dealing with knowledge  sometimes quite detailed knowledge  of a domain where a given task lay                Knowledge based systems and knowledge engineering became a major focus of AI research in the     s               It was hoped that vast databases would solve the commonsense knowledge problem and provide the support that commonsense reasoning required 
In the     s some researchers attempted to attack the commonsense knowledge problem directly  by creating a massive database that would contain all the mundane facts that the average person knows  Douglas Lenat  who started a database called Cyc  argued that there is no shortcut   the only way for machines to know the meaning of human concepts is to teach them  one concept at a time  by hand              

New directions in the     s edit 
Although symbolic knowledge representation and logical reasoning produced useful applications in the   s and received massive amounts of funding  it was still unable to solve problems in perception  robotics  learning and common sense  A small number of scientists and engineers began to doubt that the symbolic approach would ever be sufficient for these tasks and developed other approaches  such as  connectionism   robotics   soft  computing and reinforcement learning  Nils Nilsson called these approaches  sub symbolic  

Revival of neural networks   connectionism  edit 
A Hopfield net with four nodes
In       physicist John Hopfield was able to prove that a form of neural network  now called a  Hopfield net   could learn and process information  and provably converges after enough time under any fixed condition  It was a breakthrough  as it was previously thought that nonlinear networks would  in general  evolve chaotically               Around the same time  Geoffrey Hinton and David Rumelhart popularized a method for training neural networks called  backpropagation       ac      These two developments helped to revive the exploration of artificial neural networks                           
Neural networks  along with several other similar models  received widespread attention after the      publication of the Parallel Distributed Processing  a two volume collection of papers edited by Rumelhart and psychologist James McClelland  The new field was christened  connectionism  and there was a considerable debate between advocates of symbolic AI and the  connectionists                Hinton called symbols the  luminous aether of AI    that is  an unworkable and misleading model of intelligence               This was a direct attack on the principles that inspired the cognitive revolution 
In       Yann LeCun at Bell Labs used convolutional neural networks to recognize handwritten digits  The system was used widely in   s  reading zip codes and personal checks  This was the first genuinely useful application of neural networks                           

Robotics and embodied reason edit 
Main articles  Nouvelle AI  behavior based AI  situated AI  and embodied cognitive science
Rodney Brooks  Hans Moravec and others argued that  in order to show real intelligence  a machine needs to have a body   it needs to perceive  move  survive and deal with the world               Sensorimotor skills are essential to higher level skills such as commonsense reasoning  They can t be efficiently implemented using abstract symbolic reasoning  so AI should solve the problems of perception  mobility  manipulation and survival without using symbolic representation at all  These robotics researchers advocated building intelligence  from the bottom up       ad     
A precursor to this idea was David Marr  who had come to MIT in the late     s from a successful background in theoretical neuroscience to lead the group studying vision  He rejected all symbolic approaches  both McCarthy s logic and Minsky s frames   arguing that AI needed to understand the physical machinery of vision from the bottom up before any symbolic processing took place   Marr s work would be cut short by leukemia in                    
In his      paper  Elephants Don t Play Chess                robotics researcher Brooks took direct aim at the physical symbol system hypothesis  arguing that symbols are not always necessary since  the world is its own best model  It is always exactly up to date  It always has every detail there is to be known  The trick is to sense it appropriately and often enough               
In the     s and     s  many cognitive scientists also rejected the symbol processing model of the mind and argued that the body was essential for reasoning  a theory called the  embodied mind thesis               

Soft computing and probabilistic reasoning edit 
Soft computing uses methods that work with incomplete and imprecise information  They do not attempt to give precise  logical answers  but give results that are only  probably  correct  This allowed them to solve problems that precise symbolic methods could not handle  Press accounts often claimed these tools could  think like a human                            
Judea Pearl s Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems  Networks of Plausible Inference  an influential      book              brought probability and decision theory into AI               Fuzzy logic  developed by Lofti Zadeh in the   s  began to be more widely used in AI and robotics  Evolutionary computation and artificial neural networks also handle imprecise information  and are classified  as  soft   In the   s and early     s many other soft computing tools were developed and put into use  including Bayesian networks               hidden Markov models               information theory and stochastic modeling  These tools in turn depended on advanced mathematical techniques such as classical optimization  For a time in the     s and early     s  these soft tools were studied by a subfield of AI called  computational intelligence               

Reinforcement learning edit 
Reinforcement learning              gives an agent a reward every time it performs a desired action well  and may give negative rewards  or  punishments   when it performs poorly  It was described in the first half of the twentieth century by psychologists using animal models  such as Thorndike                            Pavlov              and Skinner               In the     s  Alan Turing                           and Arthur Samuel              foresaw the role of reinforcement learning in AI 
A successful and influential research program was led by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto beginning       Their collaboration revolutionized the study of reinforcement learning and decision making over the four decades                            In       Sutton described machine learning in terms of decision theory  i e   the Markov decision process   This gave the subject a solid theoretical foundation and access to a large body of theoretical results developed in the field of operations research              
Also in       Sutton and Barto developed the  temporal difference   TD  learning algorithm  where the agent is rewarded only when its predictions about the future show improvement  It significantly outperformed previous algorithms               TD learning was used by Gerald Tesauro in      in the program TD Gammon  which played backgammon as well as the best human players  The program learned the game by playing against itself with zero prior knowledge               In an interesting case of interdisciplinary convergence  neurologists discovered in      that the dopamine reward system in brains also uses a version of the TD learning algorithm                                         TD learning would be become highly influential in the   st century  used in both AlphaGo and AlphaZero              

Second AI winter edit 
The business community s fascination with AI rose and fell in the     s in the classic pattern of an economic bubble  As dozens of companies failed  the perception in the business world was that the technology was not viable               The damage to AI s reputation would last into the   st century  Inside the field there was little agreement on the reasons for AI s failure to fulfill the dream of human level intelligence that had captured the imagination of the world in the     s  Together  all these factors helped to fragment AI into competing subfields focused on particular problems or approaches  sometimes even under new names that disguised the tarnished pedigree of  artificial intelligence               
Over the next    years  AI consistently delivered working solutions to specific isolated problems  By the late     s  it was being used throughout the technology industry  although somewhat behind the scenes  The success was due to increasing computer power  by collaboration with other fields  such as mathematical optimization and statistics  and using the highest standards of scientific accountability                                                                             By       AI had achieved some of its oldest goals  The field was both more cautious and more successful than it had ever been 

AI winter edit 
The term  AI winter  was coined by researchers who had survived the funding cuts of      when they became concerned that enthusiasm for expert systems had spiraled out of control and that disappointment would certainly follow      ae      Their fears were well founded  in the late     s and early     s  AI suffered a series of financial setbacks              
The first indication of a change in weather was the sudden collapse of the market for specialized AI hardware in       Desktop computers from Apple and IBM had been steadily gaining speed and power and in      they became more powerful than the more expensive Lisp machines made by Symbolics and others  There was no longer a good reason to buy them  An entire industry worth half a billion dollars was demolished overnight              
Eventually the earliest successful expert systems  such as XCON  proved too expensive to maintain  They were difficult to update  they could not learn  and they were  brittle   i e   they could make grotesque mistakes when given unusual inputs   Expert systems proved useful  but only in a few special contexts              
In the late     s  the Strategic Computing Initiative cut funding to AI  deeply and brutally   New leadership at DARPA had decided that AI was not  the next wave  and directed funds towards projects that seemed more likely to produce immediate results              
By       the impressive list of goals penned in      for Japan s Fifth Generation Project had not been met  Indeed  some of them  like  carry on a casual conversation  would not be accomplished for another    years  As with other AI projects  expectations had run much higher than what was actually possible                   af     
Over     AI companies had shut down  gone bankrupt  or been acquired by the end of       effectively ending the first commercial wave of AI               In       HP Newquist stated in The Brain Makers that  The immediate future of artificial intelligence in its commercial form seems to rest in part on the continued success of neural networks               

AI behind the scenes edit 
In the     s  algorithms originally developed by AI researchers began to appear as parts of larger systems  AI had solved a lot of very difficult problems     ag      and their solutions proved to be useful throughout the technology industry                            such as data mining  industrial robotics  logistics  speech recognition               banking software               medical diagnosis              and Google s search engine                           
The field of AI received little or no credit for these successes in the     s and early     s  Many of AI s greatest innovations have been reduced to the status of just another item in the tool chest of computer science               Nick Bostrom explains   A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications  often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it s not labeled AI anymore               
Many researchers in AI in the     s deliberately called their work by other names  such as informatics  knowledge based systems   cognitive systems  or computational intelligence  In part  this may have been because they considered their field to be fundamentally different from AI  but also the new names help to procure funding                                         In the commercial world at least  the failed promises of the AI Winter continued to haunt AI research into the     s  as the New York Times reported in        Computer scientists and software engineers avoided the term artificial intelligence for fear of being viewed as wild eyed dreamers               

Mathematical rigor  greater collaboration and a narrow focus edit 
AI researchers began to develop and use sophisticated mathematical tools more than they ever had in the past                            Most of the new directions in AI relied heavily on mathematical models  including artificial neural networks  probabilistic reasoning  soft computing and reinforcement learning  In the   s and     s  many other highly mathematical tools were adapted for AI  These tools were applied to machine learning  perception and mobility 
There was a widespread realization that many of the problems that AI needed to solve were already being worked on by researchers in fields like statistics  mathematics  electrical engineering  economics or operations research  The shared mathematical language allowed both a higher level of collaboration with more established and successful fields and the achievement of results which were measurable and provable  AI had become a more rigorous  scientific  discipline 
Another key reason for the success in the   s was that AI researchers focussed on specific problems with verifiable solutions  an approach later derided as narrow AI   This provided useful tools in the present  rather than speculation about the future 

Intelligent agents edit 
A new paradigm called  intelligent agents  became widely accepted during the     s                                ah      Although earlier researchers had proposed modular  divide and conquer  approaches to AI      ai      the intelligent agent did not reach its modern form until Judea Pearl  Allen Newell  Leslie P  Kaelbling  and others brought concepts from decision theory and economics into the study of AI               When the economist s definition of a rational agent was married to computer science s definition of an object or module  the intelligent agent paradigm was complete 
An intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success  By this definition  simple programs that solve specific problems are  intelligent agents   as are human beings and organizations of human beings  such as firms  The intelligent agent paradigm defines AI research as  the study of intelligent agents       aj      This is a generalization of some earlier definitions of AI  it goes beyond studying human intelligence  it studies all kinds of intelligence 
The paradigm gave researchers license to study isolated problems and to disagree about methods  but still retain hope that their work could be combined into an agent architecture that would be capable of general intelligence              

Milestones and Moore s law edit 
On May           Deep Blue became the first computer chess playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion  Garry Kasparov               In       a Stanford robot won the DARPA Grand Challenge by driving autonomously for     miles along an unrehearsed desert trail  Two years later  a team from CMU won the DARPA Urban Challenge by autonomously navigating    miles in an urban environment while responding to traffic hazards and adhering to traffic laws              
These successes were not due to some revolutionary new paradigm  but mostly on the tedious application of engineering skill and on the tremendous increase in the speed and capacity of computers by the   s      ak      In fact  Deep Blue s computer was    million times faster than the Ferranti Mark   that Christopher Strachey taught to play chess in           al      This dramatic increase is measured by Moore s law  which predicts that the speed and memory capacity of computers doubles every two years  The fundamental problem of  raw computer power  was slowly being overcome 

Big data  deep learning  AGI             edit 
In the first decades of the   st century  access to large amounts of data  known as  big data    cheaper and faster computers and advanced machine learning techniques were successfully applied to many problems throughout the economy  A turning point was the success of deep learning around      which improved the performance of machine learning on many tasks  including image and video processing  text analysis  and speech recognition               Investment in AI increased along with its capabilities  and by       the market for AI related products  hardware  and software reached more than    billion  and the New York Times reported that interest in AI had reached a  frenzy               
In       Ben Goertzel and others became concerned that AI had largely abandoned its original goal of producing versatile  fully intelligent machines  and argued in favor of more direct research into artificial general intelligence  By the mid     s several companies and institutions had been founded to pursue Artificial General Intelligence  AGI   such as OpenAI and Google s DeepMind  During the same period  new insights into superintelligence raised concerns that AI was an existential threat  The risks and unintended consequences of AI technology became an area of serious academic research after      

Big data and big machines edit

The success of machine learning in the     s depended on the availability of vast amounts of training data and faster computers               Russell and Norvig wrote that the  improvement in performance obtained by increasing the size of the data set by two or three orders of magnitude outweighs any improvement that can be made by tweaking the algorithm                Geoffrey Hinton recalled that back in the   s  the problem was that  our labeled datasets were thousands of times too small   And  our computers were millions of times too slow                This was no longer true by      
The most useful data in the     s came from curated  labeled data sets created specifically for machine learning and AI  In       a group at UMass Amherst released Labeled Faces in the Wild  an annotated set of images of faces that was widely used to train and test face recognition systems for the next several decades               Fei Fei Li developed ImageNet  a database of three million images captioned by volunteers using the Amazon Mechanical Turk  Released in       it was a useful body of training data and a benchmark for testing for the next generation of image processing systems                            Google released word vec in      as an open source resource  It used large amounts of data text scraped from the internet and word embedding to create a numeric vector to represent each word  Users were surprised at how well it was able to capture word meanings  for example  ordinary vector addition would give equivalences like China   River   Yangtze  London England France   Paris               This database in particular would be essential for the development of large language models in the late     s 
The explosive growth of the internet gave machine learning programs access to billions of pages of text and images that could be scraped  And  for specific problems  large privately held databases contained the relevant data  McKinsey Global Institute reported that  by       nearly all sectors in the US economy had at least an average of     terabytes of stored data                This collection of information was known in the     s as big data 
In a Jeopardy  exhibition match in February       IBM s question answering system Watson defeated the two best Jeopardy  champions  Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings  by a significant margin               Watson s expertise would have been impossible without the information available on the internet              

Deep learning edit 
Main article  Deep learning
In       AlexNet  a deep learning model      am      developed by Alex Krizhevsky  won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge  with significantly fewer errors than the second place winner                            Krizhevsky worked with Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto      an      This was a turning point in machine learning  over the next few years dozens of other approaches to image recognition were abandoned in favor of deep learning              
Deep learning uses a multi layer perceptron  Although this architecture has been known since the   s  getting it to work requires powerful hardware and large amounts of training data               Before these became 
available  improving performance of image processing systems required hand crafted ad hoc features that were difficult to implement               Deep learning was simpler and more general      ao     
Deep learning was applied to dozens of problems over the next few years  such as speech recognition  machine translation  medical diagnosis  and game playing   In every case it showed enormous gains in performance               Investment and interest in AI boomed as a result              

The alignment problem edit 
It became fashionable in the     s to begin talking about the future of AI again and several popular books considered the possibility of superintelligent machines and what they might mean for human society  Some of this was optimistic  such as Ray Kurzweil s The Singularity is Near   but others warned that a sufficiently powerful AI was existential threat to humanity  such as Nick Bostrom and Eliezer Yudkowsky               The topic became widely covered in the press and many leading intellectuals and politicians commented on the issue 
AI programs in the   st century are defined by their goals   the specific measures that they are designed to optimize  Nick Bostrom s influential      book Superintelligence argued that  if one isn t careful about defining these goals  the machine may cause harm to humanity in the process of achieving a goal  Stuart J  Russell used the example of an intelligent robot that kills its owner to prevent it from being unplugged  reasoning  you can t fetch the coffee if you re dead                 This problem is known by the technical term  instrumental convergence    The solution is to align the machine s goal function with the goals of its owner and humanity in general  Thus  the problem of mitigating the risks and unintended consequences of AI became known as  the value alignment problem  or AI alignment              
At the same time  machine learning systems had begun to have disturbing unintended consequences  Cathy O Neil explained how statistical algorithms had been among the causes of the      economic crash               Julia Angwin of ProPublica argued that the COMPAS system used by the criminal justice system exhibited racial bias under some measures                   ap      others showed that many machine learning systems exhibited some form of racial bias               and there were many other examples of dangerous outcomes that had resulted from machine learning systems      aq     
In       the election of Donald Trump and the controversy over the COMPAS system illuminated several problems with the current technological infrastructure  including misinformation  social media algorithms designed to maximize engagement  the misuse of personal data and the trustworthiness of predictive models               Issues of fairness and unintended consequences became significantly more popular at AI conferences  publications vastly increased  funding became available  and many researchers re focussed their careers on these issues  The value alignment problem became a serious field of academic study                   ar     

Artificial general intelligence research edit 
In the early     s  several researchers became concerned that mainstream AI was too focused on  measurable performance in specific applications                known as  narrow AI   and had abandoned AI s original goal of creating versatile  fully intelligent machines  An early critic was Nils Nilsson in       and similar opinions were published by AI elder statesmen John McCarthy  Marvin Minsky  and Patrick Winston in            Minsky organized a symposium on  human level AI  in                    Ben Goertzel adopted the term  artificial general intelligence  for the new sub field  founding a journal and holding conferences beginning in                    The new field grew rapidly  buoyed by the continuing success of artificial neural networks and the hope that it was the key to AGI 
Several competing companies  laboratories and foundations were founded to develop AGI in the     s  DeepMind was founded in      by three English scientists  Demis Hassabis  Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman  with funding from Peter Thiel and later Elon Musk  The founders and financiers were deeply concerned about AI safety and the existential risk of AI  DeepMind s founders had a personal connection with Yudkowsky and Musk was among those who was actively raising the alarm               Hassabis was both worried about the dangers of AGI and optimistic about its power  he hoped they could  solve AI  then solve everything else                The New York Times wrote in       At the heart of this competition is a brain stretching paradox  The people who say they are most worried about AI are among the most determined to create it and enjoy its riches  They have justified their ambition with their strong belief that they alone can keep AI from endangering Earth               
In       Geoffrey Hinton  who been leading neural network research since the   s  was approached by Baidu  which wanted to hire him and all his students for an enormous sum  Hinton decided to hold an auction and  at a Lake Tahoe AI conference  they sold themselves to Google for a price of     million  Hassabis took notice and sold DeepMind to Google in       on the condition that it would not accept military contracts and would be overseen by an ethics board              
Larry Page of Google  unlike Musk and Hassabis  was an optimist about the future of AI  Musk and Paige became embroiled in an argument about the risk of AGI at Musk s      birthday party  They had been friends for decades but stopped speaking to each other shortly afterwards  Musk attended the one and only meeting of the DeepMind s ethics board  where it became clear that Google was uninterested in mitigating the harm of AGI  Frustrated by his lack of influence he founded OpenAI in       enlisting Sam Altman to run it and hiring top scientists  OpenAI began as a non profit   free from the economic incentives that were driving Google and other corporations                Musk became frustrated again and left the company in       OpenAI turned to Microsoft for continued financial support and Altman and OpenAI formed a for profit version of the company with more than    billion in financing              
In       Dario Amodei  and    other scientists left OpenAI over concerns that the company was putting profits above safety  They formed Anthropic  which soon had    billion in financing from Microsoft and Google              

Large language models  AI boom       present  edit 
Main article  AI boom
In       AI patents in China and the US numbered more than three fourths of AI patents worldwide               Though China had more AI patents  the US had     more patents per AI patent applicant company than China              
The number of Google searches for the term  AI  accelerated in      
The AI boom started with the initial development of key architectures and algorithms such as the transformer architecture in       leading to the scaling and development of large language models exhibiting human like traits of knowledge  attention and creativity  The new AI era began since       with the public release of scaled large language models  LLMs  such as ChatGPT              

Transformer architecture and large language models edit 
Main article  Large language models
In       the transformer architecture was proposed by Google researchers  It exploits an attention mechanism and became widely used in large language models              
Large language models  based on the transformer  were developed by AGI companies  OpenAI released GPT   in       and DeepMind released Gato in       These are foundation models  they are trained on vast quantities of unlabeled data and can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks      citation needed     
These models can discuss a huge number of topics and display general knowledge  The question naturally arises  are these models an example of artificial general intelligence  Bill Gates was skeptical of the new technology and the hype that surrounded AGI  However  Altman presented him with a live demo of ChatGPT  passing an advanced biology test  Gates was convinced               In       Microsoft Research tested the model with a large variety of tasks  and concluded that  it could reasonably be viewed as an early  yet still incomplete  version of an artificial general intelligence  AGI  system               
In       OpenAI o   a type of advanced reasoning model developed by OpenAI was announced  On the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence  ARC AGI  benchmark developed by Fran ois Chollet in       the model achieved an unofficial score of       on the semi private test  surpassing the typical human score of      The benchmark is supposed to be a necessary  but not sufficient test for AGI  Speaking of the benchmark  Chollet has said  You ll know AGI is here when the exercise of creating tasks that are easy for regular humans but hard for AI becomes simply impossible               

AI boom edit 
Main article  AI boom
Investment in AI grew exponentially after       with venture capital funding for generative AI companies increasing dramatically  Total AI investments rose from     billion in      to      billion in       with generative AI accounting for approximately     of investments by                    According to metrics from      to       the United States outranked the rest of the world in terms of venture capital funding  number of startups  and AI patents granted               The commercial AI scene became dominated by American Big Tech companies  whose investments in this area surpassed those from U S  based venture capitalists               OpenAI s valuation reached     billion by early                    while NVIDIA s market capitalization surpassed      trillion by mid       making it the world s largest company by market capitalization as the demand for AI capable GPUs surged              
   ai  launched in March                   by an anonymous MIT researcher                            was one of the earliest examples of generative AI gaining widespread public attention during the initial stages of the AI boom               The free web application demonstrated the ability to clone character voices using neural networks with minimal training data  requiring as little as    seconds of audio to reproduce a voice       a capability later corroborated by OpenAI in                    The service went viral on social media platforms in early                                 allowing users to generate speech for characters from popular media franchises  and became particularly notable for its pioneering role in popularizing AI voice synthesis for creative content and memes              



Contemporary AI systems are now becoming human competitive at general tasks  and we must ask ourselves  Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth  Should we automate away all the jobs  including the fulfilling ones  Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber  outsmart  obsolete and replace us  Should we risk loss of control of our civilization  Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders  Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable  This confidence must be well justified and increase with the magnitude of a system s potential effects  OpenAI s recent statement regarding artificial general intelligence  states that  At some point  it may be important to get independent review before starting to train future systems  and for the most advanced efforts to agree to limit the rate of growth of compute used for creating new models   We agree  That point is now 
Therefore  we call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least   months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT    This pause should be public and verifiable  and include all key actors  If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly  governments should step in and institute a moratorium 


Pause Giant AI Experiments  An Open Letter             

Advent of AI for public use edit 
ChatGPT was launched on November           marking a pivotal moment in artificial intelligence s public adoption  Within days of its release it went viral  gaining over     million users in two months and becoming the fastest growing consumer software application in history               The chatbot s ability to engage in human like conversations  write code  and generate creative content captured public imagination and led to rapid adoption across various sectors including education  business  and research               ChatGPT s success prompted unprecedented responses from major technology companies       Google declared a  code red  and rapidly launched Gemini  formerly known as Google Bard   while Microsoft incorporated the technology into Bing Chat               
The rapid adoption of these AI technologies sparked intense debate about their implications  Notable AI researchers and industry leaders voiced both optimism and concern about the accelerating pace of development  In March       over        signatories  including computer scientist Yoshua Bengio  Elon Musk  and Apple co founder Steve Wozniak  signed an open letter calling for a pause in advanced AI development  citing  profound risks to society and humanity                However  other prominent researchers like Juergen Schmidhuber took a more optimistic view  emphasizing that the majority of AI research aims to make  human lives longer and healthier and easier               
By mid       however  the financial sector began to scrutinize AI companies more closely  particularly questioning their capacity to produce a return on investment commensurate with their massive valuations  Some prominent investors raised concerns about market expectations becoming disconnected from fundamental business realities  Jeremy Grantham  co founder of GMO LLC  warned investors to  be quite careful  and drew parallels to previous technology driven market bubbles               Similarly  Jeffrey Gundlach  CEO of DoubleLine Capital  explicitly compared the AI boom to the dot com bubble of the late     s  suggesting that investor enthusiasm might be outpacing realistic near term capabilities and revenue potential               These concerns were amplified by the substantial market capitalizations of AI focused companies  many of which had yet to demonstrate sustainable profitability models 
In March       Anthropic released the Claude   family of large language models  including Claude   Haiku  Sonnet  and Opus               The models demonstrated significant improvements in capabilities across various benchmarks  with Claude   Opus notably outperforming leading models from OpenAI and Google               In June       Anthropic released Claude     Sonnet  which demonstrated improved performance compared to the larger Claude   Opus  particularly in areas such as coding  multistep workflows  and image analysis              

     Nobel Prizes edit 
In       the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Nobel Prizes in recognition of groundbreaking contributions to artificial intelligence  The recipients included 

In physics  John Hopfield for his work on physics inspired Hopfield networks  and Geoffrey Hinton for foundational contributions to Boltzmann machines and deep learning 
In chemistry  David Baker  Demis Hassabis  and John Jumper for their advancements in protein folding predictions  See AlphaFold               
Current developments edit 
In January       OpenAI announced a new AI  ChatGPT Gov  which would be specifically designed for US government agencies to use securely                Open AI said that agencies could utilize ChatGPT Gov on a Microsoft Azure cloud or Azure Government cloud   on top of Microsoft s Azure s OpenAI Service   OpenAI s announcement stated that  Self hosting ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security  privacy  and compliance requirements  such as stringent cybersecurity frameworks  IL   CJIS  ITAR  FedRAMP High   Additionally  we believe this infrastructure will expedite internal authorization of OpenAI s tools for the handling of non public sensitive data               
In January       a significant development in AI infrastructure investment occurred with the formation of Stargate LLC  The joint venture  created by OpenAI  SoftBank  Oracle  and MGX  announced plans to invest US     billion in AI infrastructure across the United States by       starting with US     billion  The venture was formally announced by U S  President Donald Trump on January           with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son appointed as chairman

Notes edit 


  The Lambda calculus was especially important to AI  since it was an inspiration for Lisp  the most important programming language used in   th century AI              

  Alan Turing was thinking about machine intelligence at least as early as       when he circulated a paper on machine intelligence which could be the earliest paper in the field of AI   although it is now lost  His      paper was followed by three radio broadcasts on AI by Turing  the two lectures  Intelligent Machinery  A Heretical Theory  and  Can Digital Computers Think   and the panel discussion  Can Automatic Calculating Machines be Said to Think              

  This was an early statement of the philosophical position John Searle would later call the  Strong AI hypothesis   that machines can contain minds just as human bodies do 

  
Daniel Crevier wrote   the proposal  later became known as the  physical symbol systems hypothesis                The physical symbol system hypothesis was articulated and named by Newell and Simon in their paper on GPS              It includes a more specific definition of a  machine  as an agent that manipulates symbols 

  
 I won t swear and I hadn t seen it before   McCarthy told Pamela McCorduck in                   However  McCarthy also stated unequivocally  I came up with the term  in a CNET interview              The term was chosen by McCarthy to avoid associations with cybernetics and the influence of Norbert Wiener    O ne of the reasons for inventing the term  artificial intelligence  was to escape association with  cybernetics   Its concentration on analog feedback seemed misguided  and I wished to avoid having either to accept Norbert  not Robert  Wiener as a guru or having to argue with him               

  Pamela McCorduck discusses how the Dartmouth conference alumni dominated the first two decades of AI research  calling them the  invisible college              

  Daniel Crevier wrote  the conference is generally recognized as the official birthdate of the new science              

  There were a few psychologists who avoided behaviorism and embraced a cognitive approach before it was fashionable  such as Frederic Bartlett and Kenneth Craig            

  Russell and Norvig wrote  it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything remotely clever               AI founder John McCarthy called this the  Look  Ma  no hands   era             

  This avoided the commonsense knowledge problem  discussed below 

  The hardware diversity was particularly clear in the different technologies used in implementing the adjustable weights  The perceptron machines and the SNARC used potentiometers moved by electric motors  ADALINE used memistors adjusted by electroplating  though they also used simulations on an IBM      computer  The MINOS machines used ferrite cores with multiple holes in them that could be individually blocked  with the degree of blockage representing the weights              

  Minsky strongly believes he was misquoted                           

  McCorduck also notes that funding was mostly under the direction of alumni of the Dartmouth workshop of                   

  Russell and Norvig wrote  in almost all cases  these early systems failed on more difficult tasks               

  Bruce Buchanan wrote   Early programs were necessarily limited in scope by the size and speed of memory              

  History would prove Moravec right about applications like computer vision  Moravec estimated that simply matching the edge and motion detection capabilities of the human retina in real time would require a general purpose computer capable of      million instructions per second  MIPS   In       the fastest supercomputer  the    million Cray   was only capable of     MIPS  and a typical desktop computer had   MIPS  As of       practical computer vision applications require        to           MIPS              

  Such as the frame  ramification and qualification problems  as well as the difficulty of default reasoning and word sense disambiguation 

  Russell and Norvig write    M any of the concepts we name in language fail  on closer inspection  to have the logically defined necessary and sufficient conditions that early AI researchers hoped to capture in axiomatic form               

  John McCarthy wrote in response that  the combinatorial explosion problem has been recognized in AI from the beginning              

  This account is based on Crevier       pp                Other views include McCorduck       pp               and NRC      under  Success in Speech Recognition  

  Moravec explains   Their initial promises to DARPA had been much too optimistic  Of course  what they delivered stopped considerably short of that  But they felt they couldn t in their next proposal promise less than in the first one  so they promised more               

  While the autonomous tank was a failure  the battle management system  called  DART   proved to be enormously successful  saving billions in the first Gulf War  repaying the investment and justifying the DARPA s pragmatic policy  at least as far as DARPA was concerned              

   Know how  is Dreyfus  term  Dreyfus makes a distinction between  knowing how  and  knowing that   a modern version of Heidegger s distinction of ready to hand and present at hand              

  Weizenbaum said   I became the only member of the AI community to be seen eating lunch with Dreyfus  And I deliberately made it plain that theirs was not the way to treat a human being               

  Colby and his colleagues later also developed chatterbot like  computer simulations of paranoid processes  PARRY   to  make intelligible paranoid processes in explicit symbol processing terms               

   Wason  amp  Shapiro        showed that people do poorly on completely abstract problems  but if the problem is restated to allow the use of intuitive social intelligence  performance dramatically improves   See Wason selection task  Kahneman  Slovic  amp  Tversky        have shown that people are terrible at elementary problems that involve uncertain reasoning   See list of cognitive biases for several examples   Eleanor Rosch s work is described in Lakoff       Kahnmann published a more general theory of symbolic cognition and other kinds of thinking in his book Thinking Fast and Slow       

   An early example of McCarthy s position was in the journal Science where he said  This is AI  so we don t care if it s psychologically real   Kolata        and he recently reiterated his position at the AI    conference where he said  Artificial intelligence is not  by definition  simulation of human intelligence   Maker       

  Another aspect of the conflict was called  the procedural declarative distinction  but did not prove to be influential in later AI research 

  Versions of backpropagation had been developed in several fields  most directly as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation published by Seppo Linnainmaa         It was  applied to neural networks in the     s by Paul Werbos              

  Hans Moravec wrote   I am confident that this bottom up route to artificial intelligence will one date meet the traditional top down route more than half way  ready to provide the real world competence and the commonsense knowledge that has been so frustratingly elusive in reasoning programs  Fully intelligent machines will result when the metaphorical golden spike is driven uniting the two efforts               

  AI winter was first used as the title of a seminar on the subject for the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence              

  McCorduck writes  Two and a half decades later  we can see that the Japanese didn t quite meet all of those ambitious goals

  Russell and Norvig wrote  The whole agent view is now widely accepted               

  Carl Hewitt s Actor model anticipated the modern definition of intelligent agents   Hewitt  Bishop  amp  Steiger       Both John Doyle  Doyle       and Marvin Minsky s popular classic The Society of Mind  Minsky       used the word  agent   Other  modular  proposals included Rodney Brook s subsumption architecture  object oriented programming and others 

  This is how the most widely used textbooks of the   st century define artificial intelligence  such as Russell and Norvig        Padgham and Winikoff        Jones        Poole and Mackworth                    

  Ray Kurzweil wrote
that the improvement in computer chess  is governed only by the brute force expansion of computer hardware               

  Cycle time of Ferranti Mark   was          milliseconds  which is arguably equivalent to about          flops  Deep Blue ran at            gigaflops  and this does not even take into account Deep Blue s special purpose hardware for chess   Very approximately  these differ by a factor of          citation needed     

  AlexNet had         neurons and trained using ImageNet  augmented with reversed  cropped and tinted images  The model also used Geoffrey Hinton s dropout technique and a rectified linear output function  both relatively new developments at the time              

  Several other laboratories had developed systems that  like AlexNet  used GPU chips and performed nearly as well as AlexNet               but AlexNet proved to be the most influential 

  See History of AI        The problems above  where Hans Moravec predicted that raw power would eventually make AI  easy  

  Later research showed that there was no way for system to avoid a measurable racist bias    fixing one form of bias would necessarily introduce another              

  A short summary of topics would include privacy  surveillance  copyright  misinformation and deep fakes  filter bubbles and partisanship  algorithmic bias  misleading results that go undetected without algorithmic transparency  the right to an explanation  misuse of autonomous weapons and technological unemployment  See Artificial intelligence        Ethics

  Brian Christian wrote  ProPublica s study  of COMPAS in       legitimated concepts like fairness as valid topics for research
