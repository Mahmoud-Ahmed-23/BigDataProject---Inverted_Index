Computer ability
Machine perception is the capability of a computer system to interpret data in a manner that is similar to the way humans use their senses to relate to the world around them                                   The basic method that the computers take in and respond to their environment is through the attached hardware   Until recently input was limited to a keyboard  or a mouse  but advances in technology  both in hardware and software  have allowed computers to take in sensory input in a way similar to humans                       
Machine perception allows the computer to use this sensory input  as well as conventional computational means of gathering information  to gather information with greater accuracy and to present it in a way that is more comfortable for the user             These include computer vision  machine hearing  machine touch  and machine smelling  as artificial scents are  at a chemical compound  molecular  atomic level  indiscernible and identical                       
The end goal of machine perception is to give machines the ability to see  feel and perceive the world as humans do and therefore for them to be able to explain in a human way why they are making their decisions  to warn us when it is failing and more importantly  the reason why it is failing             This purpose is very similar to the proposed purposes for artificial intelligence generally  except that machine perception would only grant machines limited sentience  rather than bestow upon machines full consciousness  self awareness  and intentionality 


Machine vision edit 
Main article  machine vision
Computer vision is a field that includes methods for acquiring  processing  analyzing  and understanding images and high dimensional data from the real world to produce numerical or symbolic information  e g   in the forms of decisions   Computer vision has many applications already in use today such as facial recognition  geographical modeling  and even aesthetic judgment            
However  machines still struggle to interpret visual impute accurately if it is blurry or if the viewpoint at which stimuli are viewed varies often  Computers also struggle to determine the proper nature of some stimulus if overlapped by or seamlessly touching another stimulus  This refers to the Principle of Good Continuation  Machines also struggle to perceive and record stimulus functioning according to the Apparent Movement principle which is a field of research in Gestalt psychology 

Machine hearing edit 
Machine hearing  also known as machine listening or computer audition is the ability of a computer or machine to take in and process sound data such as speech or music                       
This area has a wide range of application including music recording and compression  speech synthesis and speech recognition             
Moreover  this technology allows the machine to replicate the human brain s ability to selectively focus on a specific sound against many other competing sounds and background noise  This ability is called  auditory scene analysis   The technology enables the machine to segment several streams occurring at the same time                                    
Many commonly used devices such as a smartphones  voice translators and cars make use of some form of machine hearing  Present technology still has challenges in speech segmentation  This  means it is occasionally unable to correctly split words within sentences especially when spoken in an atypical accent 

Machine touch edit 
A tactile sensor
Machine touch is an area of machine perception where tactile information is processed by a machine or computer   Applications include tactile perception of surface properties and dexterity whereby tactile information can enable intelligent reflexes and interaction with the environment              Though this could possibly be done through measuring when and where friction occurs and also the nature and intensity of the friction  machines however still do not have any way of measuring few ordinary physical human experiences including physical pain  For example  scientists have yet to invent a mechanical substitute for the Nociceptors in the body and brain that are responsible for noticing and measuring physical human discomfort and suffering 

Machine olfaction edit 
Scientists are developing computers known as machine olfaction which can recognize and measure smells as well  Airborne chemicals are sensed and classified with a device sometimes known as an electronic nose                         

Machine taste edit 
This section is an excerpt from Electronic tongue  edit 
The electronic tongue is an instrument that measures and compares tastes  As per the IUPAC technical report  an  electronic tongue  as analytical instrument including an array of non selective chemical sensors with partial specificity to different solution components and an appropriate pattern recognition instrument  capable to recognize quantitative and qualitative compositions of simple and complex solutions                        
Chemical compounds responsible for taste are detected by human taste receptors  Similarly  the multi electrode sensors of electronic instruments detect the same dissolved organic and inorganic compounds  Like human receptors  each sensor has a spectrum of reactions different from the other  The information given by each sensor is complementary  and the combination of all sensors  results generates a unique fingerprint  Most of the detection thresholds of sensors are similar to or better than human receptors 
In the biological mechanism  taste signals are transduced by nerves in the brain into electric signals  E tongue sensors process is similar  they generate electric signals as voltammetric and potentiometric variations 

Taste quality perception and recognition are based on the building or recognition of activated sensory nerve patterns by the brain and the taste fingerprint of the product  This step is achieved by the e tongue s statistical software  which interprets the sensor data into taste patterns 
Future edit 
Other than those listed above  some of the future hurdles that the science of machine perception still has to overcome include  but are not limited to 
  Embodied cognition   The theory that cognition is a full body experience  and therefore can only exist  and therefore be measure and analyzed  in fullness if all required human abilities and processes are working together through a mutually aware and supportive systems network 
  The Moravec s paradox  see the link 
  The Principle of similarity   The ability young children develop to determine what family a newly introduced stimulus falls under even when the said stimulus is different from the members with which the child usually associates said family with   An example could be a child figuring that a chihuahua is a dog and house pet rather than vermin  
  The Unconscious inference  The natural human behavior of determining if a new stimulus is dangerous or not  what it is  and then how to relate to it without ever requiring any new conscious effort 
  The innate human ability to follow the likelihood principle in order to learn from circumstances and others over time 
  The recognition by components theory   being able to mentally analyze and break even complicated mechanisms into manageable parts with which to interact with  For example  A person seeing both the cup and the handle parts that make up a mug full of hot cocoa  in order to use the handle to hold the mug so as to avoid being burned 
  The free energy principle   determining long before hand how much energy one can safely delegate to being aware of things outside one s self without the loss of the needed energy one requires for sustaining their life and function satisfactorily  This allows one to become both optimally aware of the world around them self without depleting their energy so much that they experience damaging stress  decision fatigue  and or exhaustion
