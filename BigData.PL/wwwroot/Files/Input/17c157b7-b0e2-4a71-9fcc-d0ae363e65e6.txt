Deep Blue was     a      a supercomputer for chess playing based on a customized IBM RS      SP  It was the first computer to win a game  and the first to win a match  against a reigning world champion under regular time controls  Development began in      at Carnegie Mellon University under the name ChipTest  It then moved to IBM  where it was first renamed Deep Thought  then again in      to Deep Blue  It first played world champion Garry Kasparov in a six game match in       where it won one  drew two and lost three games  It was upgraded in       and in a six game re match it defeated Kasparov by winning two games and drawing three  Deep Blue s victory is considered a milestone in the history of artificial intelligence and has been the subject of several books and films 


History edit 
While a doctoral student at Carnegie Mellon University  Feng hsiung Hsu began development of a chess playing supercomputer under the name ChipTest  The machine won the North American Computer Chess Championship in      and Hsu and his team followed up with a successor  Deep Thought  in                             After receiving his doctorate in       Hsu and Murray Campbell joined IBM Research to continue their project to build a machine that could defeat a world chess champion             Their colleague Thomas Anantharaman briefly joined them at IBM before leaving for the finance industry and being replaced by programmer Arthur Joseph Hoane                        Jerry Brody  a long time employee of IBM Research  subsequently joined the team in                 
After Deep Thought s two game      loss to Kasparov  IBM held a contest to rename the chess machine  the winning name was  Deep Blue   submitted by Peter Fitzhugh Brown             was a play on IBM s nickname   Big Blue       b      After a scaled down version of Deep Blue played Grandmaster Joel Benjamin              Hsu and Campbell decided that Benjamin was the expert they were looking for to help develop Deep Blue s opening book  so hired him to assist with the preparations for Deep Blue s matches against Garry Kasparov              In       a Deep Blue prototype played in the eighth World Computer Chess Championship  playing Wchess to a draw before ultimately losing to Fritz in round five  despite playing as White             
Today  one of the two racks that made up Deep Blue is held by the National Museum of American History  having previously been displayed in an exhibit about the Information Age              while the other rack was acquired by the Computer History Museum in       and is displayed in the Revolution exhibit s  Artificial Intelligence and Robotics  gallery              Several books were written about Deep Blue  among them Behind Deep Blue  Building the Computer that Defeated the World Chess Champion by Deep Blue developer Feng hsiung Hsu             

Deep Blue versus Kasparov edit 
Main article  Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov
Garry Kasparov playing a simultaneous exhibition in     
Subsequent to its predecessor Deep Thought s      loss to Garry Kasparov  Deep Blue played Kasparov twice more  In the first game of the first match  which took place from    to    February       Deep Blue became the first machine to win a chess game against a reigning world champion under regular time controls  However  Kasparov won three and drew two of the following five games  beating Deep Blue by     at the close of the match                         
Deep Blue s hardware was subsequently upgraded                             c      doubling its speed before it faced Kasparov again in May       when it won the six game rematch        Deep Blue won the deciding game after Kasparov failed to secure his position in the opening  thereby becoming the first computer system to defeat a reigning world champion in a match under standard chess tournament time controls                          The version of Deep Blue that defeated Kasparov in      typically searched to a depth of six to eight moves  and twenty or more moves in some situations              David Levy and Monty Newborn estimate that each additional ply  half move  of forward insight increases the playing strength between    and    Elo points             
In the   th move of the first game of their second match  unknown to Kasparov  a bug in Deep Blue s code led it to enter an unintentional loop  which it exited by taking a randomly selected valid move              Kasparov did not take this possibility into account  and misattributed the seemingly pointless move to  superior intelligence               Subsequently  Kasparov experienced a decline in performance in the following game              though he denies this was due to anxiety in the wake of Deep Blue s inscrutable move             
After his loss  Kasparov said that he sometimes saw unusual creativity in the machine s moves  suggesting that during the second game  human chess players had intervened on behalf of the machine  IBM denied this  saying the only human intervention occurred between games                          Kasparov demanded a rematch  but IBM had dismantled Deep Blue after its victory and refused the rematch              The rules allowed the developers to modify the program between games  an opportunity they said they used to shore up weaknesses in the computer s play that were revealed during the course of the match  Kasparov requested printouts of the machine s log files  but IBM refused  although the company later published the logs on the Internet             
The      tournament awarded a          first prize to the Deep Blue team and a          second prize to Kasparov  Carnegie Mellon University awarded an additional          to the Deep Blue team  a prize created by computer science professor Edward Fredkin in      for the first computer program to beat a reigning world chess champion             

Aftermath edit 
Chess edit 
Kasparov initially called Deep Blue an  alien opponent   but later belittled it  stating that it was  as intelligent as your alarm clock               According to Martin Amis  two grandmasters who played Deep Blue agreed that it was  like a wall coming at you                           Hsu had the rights to use the Deep Blue design independently of IBM  but also independently declined Kasparov s rematch offer              In       the documentary film Game Over  Kasparov and the Machine investigated Kasparov s claims that IBM had cheated  In the film  some interviewees describe IBM s investment in Deep Blue as an effort to boost its stock value             

Other games edit 
Following Deep Blue s victory  AI specialist Omar Syed designed a new game  Arimaa  which was intended to be very simple for humans but very difficult for computers to master                          however  in       computers proved capable of defeating strong Arimaa players              Since Deep Blue s victory  computer scientists have developed software for other complex board games with competitive communities  The AlphaGo series  AlphaGo  AlphaGo Zero  AlphaZero  defeated top Go players in                                   

Computer science edit 
Computer scientists such as Deep Blue developer Campbell believed that playing chess was a good measurement for the effectiveness of artificial intelligence  and by beating a world champion chess player  IBM showed that they had made significant progress             Deep Blue is also responsible for the popularity of using games as a display medium for artificial intelligence  as in the cases of IBM Watson or AlphaGo             
While Deep Blue  with its capability of evaluating          million positions per second              was the first computer to face a world chess champion in a formal match             it was a then state of the art expert system  relying upon rules and variables defined and fine tuned by chess masters and computer scientists  In contrast  current chess engines such as Leela Chess Zero typically use reinforcement machine learning systems that train a neural network to play  developing its own internal logic rather than relying upon rules defined by human experts             
In a November      match between Deep Fritz and world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik  the program ran on a computer system containing a dual core Intel Xeon      CPU  capable of evaluating only        million positions per second  but searching to an average depth of    to    plies  half moves  in the middlegame thanks to heuristics  it won                             

Design edit

Software edit 
Deep Blue ran under the AIX operating system  and its chess playing program was written in C  
Its evaluation function was initially written in a generalized form  with many to be determined parameters  e g   how important is a safe king position compared to a space advantage in the center  etc    Values for these parameters were determined by analyzing thousands of master games  The evaluation function was then split into       parts  many of them designed for special positions  The opening book encapsulated more than       positions and         grandmaster games  while the endgame database contained many six piece endgames and all five and fewer piece endgames  An additional database named the  extended book  summarizes entire games played by Grandmasters  The system combines its searching ability of     million chess positions per second with summary information in the extended book to select opening moves             
Before the second match  the program s rules were fine tuned by grandmaster Joel Benjamin  The opening library was provided by grandmasters Miguel Illescas  John Fedorowicz  and Nick de Firmian              When Kasparov requested that he be allowed to study other games that Deep Blue had played so as to better understand his opponent  IBM refused  leading Kasparov to study many popular PC chess games to familiarize himself with computer gameplay             

Hardware edit 
Deep Blue used custom VLSI chips to parallelize the alpha beta search algorithm              an example of symbolic AI              The system derived its playing strength mainly from brute force computing power  It was an IBM RS      SP  a supercomputer with a massively parallel architecture based on    PowerPC    e processors and     custom          nm CMOS VLSI  chess chips  designed to execute the chess playing expert system  as well as FPGAs intended to allow patching of the VLSIs  which ultimately went unused  all housed in two cabinets  The chess chip has four parts  the move generator  the smart move stack  the evaluation function  and the search control  The move generator is a  x  combinational logic circuit  a chess board in miniature                                                 
In       Deep Blue was upgraded again to become the    th most powerful supercomputer according to the TOP    list  achieving       GFLOPS on the parallel high performance LINPACK benchmark  Deeper Blue was capable of evaluating          million positions per second  twice as many as the      version
