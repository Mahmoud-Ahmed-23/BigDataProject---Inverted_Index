Mohamed Hammouda started his career as a police officer in the narcotics department after graduating from the Police Academy with honours  A PhD holder from the University Pantheon Sorbonne in Paris  Hammouda has been called  the celebrities  lawyer  for serving as defence council for several infamous businessmen  Among his high profile yet controversial clients were Mamdouh Ismail  who he was able to prove innocent during the  Al Salam    ferry boat case  following the death of      of its passengers in       He is currently the lawyer for businessman Mohamed Al Ameen who owns CBC satellite channels  steel magnate Ahmed Ezz  owner of Ezz Dekheila who was a prominent member of the former National Democratic Party  and Ahmed Gaddaf Al Dam   ousted Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi s former special envoy to Egypt  among others  Hammouda was also briefly the defence lawyer for former president Hosni Mubarak  He is often a guest as a legal expert on prime time talk shows and has been a consistently tough critic for the    January Revolution and the government of the former President Mohamed Morsi 
DNE  What are the cases in which you represent Ahmed Ezz 
MH  I am representing Ezz in two cases  The first is the one regarding steel permits and the second is the money laundering case  but I am still considering whether I should take the Dekheila Factory case or not 
DNE  How do you see Ahmed Ezz s legal stance in the Daqhelya case 
MH  Ezz is innocent  his financial records are clean and would make him one of the greatest and most honourable businessmen in the history of Egypt  His only problem is that he got involved with politics which harmed him 
DNE  What is the reason behind the denial of Ezz s grievance release 
MH  Because he did not complete the duration of his preventative detention which is one year and a half  which will end on    February       He was released on bail in the first two cases and the only remaining case is that of the Dekheila Factory where his preventative detention ends on the    February 
DNE  What is your defence in Ezz s other cases 
MH  Ezz was sentenced then it was appealed  then the great prosecution that was not affected by the     January  revolution admitted that the steel permits are given for free and that the only thing to be debated whether his file deserves to be granted a permit or not  The file of Ahmed Ezz was then transferred to a committee of experts to determine whether he deserves to be granted a permit or not 
DNE  But other factories were only granted temporary permits 
MH  That is not true they were granted permits just like my client and that is why the prosecution admitted the truth that my client was innocent 
DNE  In your opinion  why did this happen to Ahmed Ezz 
MH  This was the case after    January       where all the prominent figures of the Mubarak regime were vulnerable to be tried as the public opinion was highly influential at that time  but this is over now and Ezz will be acquitted eventually 
DNE   Would there be a financial reconciliation for Ezz 
MH  Of course not  My client is not a criminal to have reconciliation  Ahmed Ezz told me that he would not leave prison nor agree to any reconciliation unless he is fully acquitted  because he never stole a penny

DNE  How did Ahmed Ezz accumulate his fortune 
MH  Ezz started the first Egyptian factory for ceramics called Al Jawhara in      when he was only     His father was the largest iron importer in Egypt since the     s  Ezz used to assist his father in his multimillion dollar business when he was a freshman student in the Faculty of Engineering  The Mubarak regime sought Ahmed Ezz in      not the other way around 
DNE  According to Ezz  did he make any mistakes 
MH  Politics is based on perspective  Ahmed Ezz did not commit any crimes  Let history judge Ahmed Ezz  the politician 
DNE  What about the      parliamentary elections 
MH  Ezz had nothing to do with this  it was the responsibility of the Cabinet and the Minister of Interior  as for Ahmed Ezz s record of his opinions about the Brotherhood that only proves his opinions to be correct about them 
DNE  What does Ahmed Ezz think of    June 
MH  He thinks it is a great revolution and that Abdel Fattah Al Sisi is a great man  Ezz loves his country and does not have any political ambitions  He will return to be a successful businessman and will leave his political past to be judged by history 
 nbsp 
DNE   What do you think of    January and    June uprisings 
MH  The revolution is that of    June  but    January is an angry uprising that took place due to the stubbornness of the Ministry of Interior with some citizens  That uprising was made by a group of youth who unknowingly joined a terrorist plan
The uprising of    January was planned by the Muslim Brotherhood and the West and the youth of the American University in Cairo  who were misled into a conspiracy that aimed to destroy Egypt s institutions  starting with the Police on its national day of    January  The mistakes of the Mubarak regime  like his remaining in power for    years and the  inheritance project  helped create the atmosphere that the Muslim Brotherhood and the West wanted for their conspiracy  The uprising was essential because of these mistakes  but in my opinion until    January was enough  Mubarak announced in   February that he was leaving his position and that is why the youth left and the Muslim Brotherhood made the Camel Battle to make the people go back to the square  The Brotherhood wanted to destroy the rest of the country s institutions through the slogan of  down with military rule  and then after Morsi was president they wanted to destroy the judiciary system by removing a thousand judges from their positions and replacing them with their lawyers 
Luckily  Egypt has its patriotic armed forces that took the side of the people in    June in a true revolution that rescued the country  Thus I believe that    January was an uprising with good intentions  but was used by traitors to destroy the country  while    June is the true revolution that salvaged the nation

DNE  You have previously mentioned in televised interviews that Mubarak made mistakes but was not corrupted  how do you define corruption 
MH  Someone who was corrupted means that he had received bribes and used his position  Mubarak did not do that  his fortune is only EGP  M  His children have more money  Gamal Mubarak has formed his fortune after working in a bank in the United States of America and after he returned to Egypt he owned an asset management company  Nobody can find illegitimately earned money for Mubarak or his family  because they do not exist  Mubarak made mistakes by not leaving his position in       he made a mistake by approving of the inheritance project  but he is an Egyptian patriot who preferred to leave rather than to fire a bullet 
DNE  According to the UNDP there are eight standards of Good Governance  none of them applied to the Mubarak s regime  how would you explain that 
MH  That is the United States Plot to divide Egypt  Merkel  Sarkozy and Obama allied against Egypt after they realised that its economy was booming and that it was about to become a developed country in    years  The US started talking about transparency through its organisations to justify its interference in Egypt  This disgraceful plot was fuelled by the talk about Mubarak s fortune as one American paper estimated it to    bn  and then said that this was just an estimate by an analyst  Mark my words I will sue Obama after he is out of office 
DNE  Why did you step down from Mubarak trial 
MH  It is the mistake of my life  I gave in to the people s will and left the case of an innocent man  I prepared his case for two months in Sharm El Sheikh and there was not a single flaw in neither his records nor those of his children  then I chose his current lawyer Farid Al Deeb  He made mistakes as I mentioned before but this does not mean that he was guilty of any of the alleged charges

DNE  You mentioned before that there is a group of wise Muslim Brotherhood members  would you accept to defend any of them  although they are now labelled as terrorists 
MH  None of those wise members are in custody or even charged  Like Mohamed Tosson  Mohamed Ali Beshr  Tharwat Al Kherbawy  Kamal Al Helbawy and others  They are considered from the wise members and they have already distanced themselves from the Muslim Brotherhood 
DNE  Would you consider taking over financial cases of the Brotherhood businessmen 
MH  If they are not accused of any terrorism charges  I would consider it  Some of their leaders wanted to assign me to their cases but I refused as I was among their opposition at the time of their regime and would have been executed if they had remained  therefore of course I would never take any of their terrorism cases 
DNE  You mentioned that several leaders of the Brotherhood received lucrative amounts of money to hand in Ahmed Gaddaf Al Dam to the Libyan side  what is the source of your information 
MH  I cannot reveal my source at the time being 
DNE  What is your philosophy in selecting your clients  And who is your role model as a lawyer 
MH  I need to believe that my client is innocent  be challenged with the difficulty of the case and of course the financial aspect is important that would be challenging to someone with my credentials and expertise  I also take several patriotic cases for free like the case of Nile University against Zewail City  which I won as well  As for my role model as a lawyer  I aspire to become like Mustafa Pacha Mar aey 
DNE  What is your definition of felool  remnants of the regime  
MH  I accept the definition of those who have worked with Mubarak in his government  but not those who loved him  otherwise that would include almost     of the Egyptian people  I agree that Mubarak s aides and officials would not return to get executive positions although some of them are irreplaceable such as his Minister of Finance Youssef Bouros Ghali and Ahmed Ezz who was responsible for the Budget Committee in Parliament  but I do not approve of the false imprisonment of these qualified calibers 
 nbsp 
DNE  What are the reasons for the break in ties between CBC and Bassem Youssef
MH  Of course  it was strictly political  Mohamed Al Ameen the owner of CBC channels is a patriotic man who told Bassem Youssef not to talk about General Abdel Fattah Al Sisi  but Youssef did not abide by that  I think that Al Ameen dealt with the problem in a wrong way  If it was up to me  I would have let Bassem Youssef say what he wants and the public opinion would have made him change his mind eventually 
DNE  You said before that Egypt needs a benevolent dictator that would be commissioned by the people 
MH  I still believe in that statement  Democracy is a lie that was invented by the American man to control the world  That can be easily proved by determining who is controlling the American public opinion  it is the media and those who control  it  
Democracy was only applied correctly in France and the United Kingdom because they have educated people  When we reach that level of education maybe we can have a democracy  but now we have     of the Egyptian people are illiterate      of the people are below poverty line      do not have the intellectual basics  of critical thinking  and     have no idea what is politics 
DNE  Who is responsible for this ignorance 
MH  Thirty years of Hosni Mubarak and it started with Gamal Abdel Nasser who allowed the free education policy for every Egyptian which ruined the economy and the education 
DNE  Cannot we label this as corruption 
MH  No  It is ignorance 
DNE  What do you think of human rights and the security apparatuses 
MH  There should be better education of human rights  Although I said that we need a benevolent dictator  but a benevolent dictator would consider human rights for respectful citizens 
DNE  Who do you think should be the better ruler for Egypt in this coming period 
MH  Abdel Fattah Al Sisi is the man suitable for this period  He is a dedicated man who is unanimously trusted by the average Egyptian man 
DNE  What do you think of the youth who do not approve of neither Al Sisi nor the Muslim Brotherhood 
MH  They do not exceed        and they are lead by the traitors  activists and human rights advocates who have received lucrative funds for misleading them  I advise the youth to focus on the best interest of their country
