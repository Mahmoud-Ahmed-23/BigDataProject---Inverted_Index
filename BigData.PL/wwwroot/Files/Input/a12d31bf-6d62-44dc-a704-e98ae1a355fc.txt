Google Translate is a multilingual neural machine translation service developed by Google to translate text  documents and websites from one language into another  It offers a website interface  a mobile app for Android and iOS  as well as an API that helps developers build browser extensions and software applications             As of May       Google Translate supports     languages and language varieties at various levels                        It served over     million people daily in May                  and over     million total users as of April               update                  with more than     billion words translated daily 
Launched in April      as a statistical machine translation service  it originally used United Nations and European Parliament documents and transcripts to gather linguistic data  Rather than translating languages directly  it first translated text to English and then pivoted to the target language in most of the language combinations it posited in its grid             with a few exceptions including Catalan Spanish             During a translation  it looked for patterns in millions of documents to help decide which words to choose and how to arrange them in the target language  In recent years  it has used a deep learning model to power its translations  Its accuracy  which has been criticized     by whom       on several occasions              has been measured to vary greatly across languages              In November       Google announced that Google Translate would switch to a neural machine translation engine   Google Neural Machine Translation  GNMT    which translated  whole sentences at a time  rather than just piece by piece  It uses this broader context to help it figure out the most relevant translation  which it then rearranges and adjusts to be more like a human speaking with proper grammar             


History
Google Translate is a web based free to use translation service developed by Google in April                   It translates multiple forms of texts and media such as words  phrases and webpages 
Originally  Google Translate was released as a statistical machine translation  SMT  service              The input text had to be translated into English first before being translated into the selected language              Since SMT uses predictive algorithms to translate text  it had poor grammatical accuracy  Despite this  Google initially did not hire experts to resolve this limitation due to the ever evolving nature of language             
In January       Google introduced an Android app and iOS version in February      to serve as a portable personal interpreter              As of February       it was integrated into browsers such as Chrome and was able to pronounce the translated text  automatically recognize words in a picture and spot unfamiliar text and languages             
In May       Google acquired Word Lens to improve the quality of visual and voice translation              It is able to scan text or a picture using the device and have it translated instantly  Moreover  the system automatically identifies foreign languages and translates speech without requiring individuals to tap the microphone button whenever speech translation is needed             
In November       Google transitioned its translating method to a system called neural machine translation              It uses deep learning techniques to translate whole sentences at a time  which has been measured to be more accurate between English and French  German  Spanish  and Chinese              No measurement results have been provided by Google researchers for GNMT from English to other languages  other languages to English  or between language pairs that do not include English  As of       it translates more than     billion words a day             
In       Google Translate was used during a court hearing when court officials at Teesside Magistrates  Court failed to book an interpreter for the Chinese defendant             
A petition for Google to add Cree to Google Translate was created in       but it was not one of the languages in development at the time of the Translate Community s closure                         
At the end of September       Google Translate was discontinued in mainland China  which Google said was due to  low usage                          
In       a record of     languages including Cantonese  Tok Pisin and some regional languages in Russia including Bashkir  Chechen  Ossetian and Crimean Tatar were added  The languages were added through the help of the PaLM   Generative AI model                         
In May       users across the web found that if you enter Traditional Chinese in the French section and ask it to translate to Traditional Chinese  Google Translate will provides you with some strange translations  For example  if you enter           Xi Jinping in naked style   the translation will be provided with           which means  what Chinese love

Web interface
Google Translate produces approximations across languages of multiple forms of text and media  including text  speech  websites  or text on display in still or live video images                          For some languages  Google Translate can synthesize speech from text              and in certain pairs it is possible to highlight specific corresponding words and phrases between the source and target text  Results are sometimes shown with dictional information below the translation box  but it is not a dictionary             and has been shown to invent translations in all languages for words it does not recognize              If  Detect language  is selected  text in an unknown language can be automatically identified  In the web interface  users can suggest alternate translations  such as for technical terms  or correct mistakes  These suggestions may be included in future updates to the translation process  If a user enters a URL in the source text  Google Translate will produce a hyperlink to a machine translation of the website              Users can save translation proposals in a  phrasebook  for later use  and a shareable URL is generated for each translation                          For some languages  text can be entered via an on screen keyboard  whether through handwriting recognition or speech recognition                          It is possible to enter searches in a source language that are first translated to a destination language allowing one to browse and interpret results from the selected destination language in the source language 
Texts written in the Arabic  Cyrillic  Devanagari and Greek scripts can be automatically transliterated from their phonetic equivalents written in the Latin alphabet  The browser version of Google Translate provides the option to show phonetic equivalents of text translated from Japanese to English  The same option is not available on the paid API version 

Accent of English that the  text to speech  audio of Google Translate of each country uses              British  Received Pronunciation   female              General American  female              General Australian  female              Indian  female              No Google translate service
Many of the more popular languages have a  text to speech  audio function that is able to read back a text in that language  up to several hundred words or so  In the case of pluricentric languages  the accent depends on the region  for English  in the Americas  most of the Asia Pacific and West Asia  the audio uses a female General American accent  whereas in Europe  Hong Kong  Malaysia  Singapore  Guyana and all other parts of the world  a female British  Received Pronunciation  accent is used  except for a special General Australian accent used in Australia  New Zealand and Norfolk Island  and an Indian English accent used in India  for Spanish  in the Americas  a Latin American accent is used  while in other parts of the world  a Castilian accent is used  for French  a Quebec accent is used in Canada  while in other parts of the world  a standard European accent is used  for Bengali  a male Bangladeshi accent is used  except in India  where a special female Indian Bengali accent is used instead  Until March       some less widely spoken languages used the open source eSpeak synthesizer for their speech  producing a robotic  awkward voice that may be difficult to understand 

Browser integration
Google Translate is available in some web browsers as an optional downloadable extension that can run the translation engine  which allow right click command access to the translation service                                      In February       Google Translate was integrated into the Google Chrome browser by default  for optional automatic webpage translation

The Google Translate app for Android and iOS supports     languages and can propose translations for    languages via photo     via voice in  conversation mode   and    via live video imagery in  augmented reality mode                          
The Android app was released in January       and for iOS on February                      after an HTML  web application was released for iOS users in August                   The Android app is compatible with devices running at least Android      while the iOS app is compatible with iPod Touches  iPads and iPhones updated to iOS                  
A January      Android version experimented with a  Conversation Mode  that aims to allow users to communicate fluidly with a nearby person in another language              Originally limited to English and Spanish  the feature received support for    new languages  still in testing  the following October                                     
The  Camera input  functionality allows users to take a photograph of a document  signboard  etc  Google Translate recognises the text from the image using optical character recognition  OCR  technology and gives the translation  Camera input is not available for all languages 
In January       the apps gained the ability to propose translations of physical signs in real time using the device s camera  as a result of Google s acquisition of the Word Lens app                                      The original January launch only supported seven languages  but a July update added support for    new languages  with the release of a new implementation that utilizes convolutional neural networks  and also enhanced the speed and quality of Conversation Mode translations  augmented reality                                                               The feature was subsequently renamed Instant Camera  The technology underlying Instant Camera combines image processing and optical character recognition  then attempts to produce cross language equivalents using standard Google Translate estimations for the text as it is perceived             
On May           Google introduced Tap to Translate for Google Translate for Android  Upon highlighting text in an app that is in a foreign language  Translate will pop up inside of the app and offer translations             

API
On May           Google announced that the Google Translate API for software developers had been deprecated and would cease functioning                                      The Translate API page stated the reason as  substantial economic burden caused by extensive abuse  with an end date set for December                      In response to public pressure  Google announced in June      that the API would continue to be available as a paid service                                     
Because the API was used in numerous third party websites and apps  the original decision to deprecate it led some developers to criticize Google and question the viability of using Google APIs in their products                         

Google Assistant
Google Translate also provides translations for Google Assistant and the devices that Google Assistant runs on such as Google Nest and Pixel Buds 

Supported languages
As of May                update      the following     languages  dialects and language varieties written in different scripts      unique languages and dialects  are supported by Google Translate

Translation methodology
In April       Google Translate launched with a statistical machine translation engine            
Google Translate does not apply grammatical rules  since its algorithms are based on statistical or pattern analysis rather than traditional rule based analysis  The system s original creator  Franz Josef Och  has criticized the effectiveness of rule based algorithms in favor of statistical approaches                          Original versions of Google Translate were based on a method called statistical machine translation  and more specifically  on research by Och who won the DARPA contest for speed machine translation in       Och was the head of Google s machine translation group until leaving to join Human Longevity  Inc  in July                  
Google Translate does not directly translate from one language to another  L    L    Instead  it often translates first to English and then to the target language  L    EN   L                                                                However  because English  like all human languages  is ambiguous and depends on context  this can cause translation errors  For example  translating vous from French to Russian gives vous   you      OR B                   If Google were using an unambiguous  artificial language as the intermediary  it would be vous   you   B     OR tu   thou       Such a suffixing of words disambiguates their different meanings  Hence  publishing in English  using unambiguous words  providing context  or using expressions such as  you all  may or may not make a better one step translation depending on the target language 
The following languages do not have a direct Google translation to or from English  These languages are translated through the indicated intermediate language  which in most cases is closely related to the desired language but more widely spoken  in addition to through English      citation needed     

Belarusian  be   ru   en   other  
Catalan  ca   es   en   other  
Galician  gl   pt   en   other  
Haitian Creole  ht   fr   en   other  
Korean  ko   ja   en   other  
Slovak  sk   cs   en   other  
Ukrainian  uk   ru   en   other               
Urdu  ur   hi   en   other  
According to Och  a solid base for developing a usable statistical machine translation system for a new pair of languages from scratch would consist of a bilingual text corpus  or parallel collection  of more than         million words  and two monolingual corpora each of more than a billion words              Statistical models from these data are then used to translate between those languages  To acquire this huge amount of linguistic data  Google used United Nations and European Parliament documents and transcripts                            The UN typically publishes documents in all six official UN languages  which has produced a very large   language corpus  Google representatives have been involved with domestic conferences in Japan where it has solicited bilingual data from researchers              
When Google Translate generates a translation proposal  it looks for patterns in hundreds of millions of documents to help decide on the best translation  By detecting patterns in documents that have already been translated by human translators  Google Translate makes informed guesses  AI  as to what an appropriate translation should be              
Before October       for languages other than Arabic  Chinese and Russian  Google Translate was based on SYSTRAN  a software engine which is still used by several other online translation services such as Babel Fish  now defunct   From October       Google Translate used proprietary  in house technology based on statistical machine translation instead                            before transitioning to neural machine translation 

Google Translate Community
Google used to have crowdsourcing features for volunteers to be a part of its  Translate Community   intended to help improve Google Translate s accuracy                                                                   Volunteers could select up to five languages to help improve translation  users could verify translated phrases and translate phrases in their languages to and from English  helping to improve the accuracy of translating more rare and complex phrases               In August       a Google Crowdsource app was released for Android users  in which translation tasks are offered                            There were three ways to contribute  First  Google showed a phrase that one should type in the translated version               Second  Google showed a proposed translation for a user to agree  disagree  or skip               Third  users could suggest translations for phrases where they think they can improve on Google s results  Tests in    languages showed that the  suggest an edit  feature led to an improvement in a maximum of     of cases over four years               Despite its role in improving translation quality and expanding language coverage  Google closed the Translate Community on March          

Statistical machine translation
Although Google has deployed a new system called neural machine translation for better quality translation  there are languages that still use the traditional translation method called statistical machine translation  It is a rule based translation method that uses predictive algorithms to guess ways to translate texts in foreign languages  It aims to translate whole phrases rather than single words then gather overlapping phrases for translation  Moreover  it also analyzes bilingual text corpora to generate a statistical model that translates texts from one language to another                           

Neural machine translation
In September       a research team at Google announced the development of the Google Neural Machine Translation system  GNMT  to increase fluency and accuracy in Google Translate                         and in November announced that Google Translate would switch to GNMT 
Google Translate s neural machine translation system used a large end to end artificial neural network that attempts to perform deep learning                                       in particular  long short term memory networks                                                     GNMT improved the quality of translation over SMT in some instances because it uses an example based machine translation  EBMT  method in which the system  learns from millions of examples                According to Google researchers  it translated  whole sentences at a time  rather than just piece by piece  It uses this broader context to help it figure out the most relevant translation  which it then rearranges and adjusts to be more like a human speaking with proper grammar              GNMT s  proposed architecture  of  system learning  has been implemented on over a hundred languages supported by Google Translate               With the end to end framework  Google states but does not demonstrate for most languages that  the system learns over time to create better  more natural translations              The GNMT network attempts interlingual machine translation  which encodes the  semantics of the sentence rather than simply memorizing phrase to phrase translations                            and the system did not invent its own universal language  but uses  the commonality found in between many languages                GNMT was first enabled for eight languages  to and from English and Chinese  French  German  Japanese  Korean  Portuguese  Spanish and Turkish                          In March       it was enabled for Hindi  Russian and Vietnamese               followed by Bengali  Gujarati  Indonesian  Kannada  Malayalam  Marathi  Punjabi  Tamil and Telugu in April              
Since       Google has phased out GNMT and has implemented deep learning networks based on transformers              

Accuracy
Google Translate is not as reliable as human translation  When text is well structured  written using formal language  with simple sentences  relating to formal topics for which training data is ample  it often produces conversions similar to human translations between English and a number of high resource languages                           Accuracy decreases for those languages when fewer of those conditions apply  for example when sentence length increases or the text uses familiar or literary language  For many other languages vis   vis English  it can produce the gist of text in those formal circumstances               Human evaluation from English to all     languages shows that the main idea of a text is conveyed more than     of the time for    languages  For    languages  a minimally comprehensible result is not achieved     of the time or greater              A few studies have evaluated Chinese      citation needed      French      citation needed      German      citation needed      and Spanish     citation needed      to English  but no systematic human evaluation has been conducted from most Google Translate languages to English  Speculative language to language scores extrapolated from English to other measurements             indicate that Google Translate will produce translation results that convey the gist of a text from one language to another more than half the time in about    of language pairs  where neither language is English               Research conducted in      showed that Google Translate got a slightly higher score than the UCLA minimum score for the English Proficiency Exam               Due to its identical choice of words without considering the flexibility of choosing alternative words or expressions  it produces a relatively similar translation to human translation from the perspective of formality  referential cohesion  and conceptual cohesion               Moreover  a number of languages are translated into a sentence structure and sentence length similar to a human translation               Furthermore  Google carried out a test that required native speakers of each language to rate the translation on a scale between   and    and Google Translate scored      on average             
When used as a dictionary to translate single words  Google Translate is highly inaccurate because it must guess between polysemic words  Among the top     words in the English language  which make up more than     of all written English  the average word has more than    senses               which makes the odds against a correct translation about    to   if each sense maps to a different word in the target language  Most common English words have at least two senses  which produces       odds in the likely case that the target language uses different words for those different senses  The odds are similar from other languages to English  Google Translate makes statistical guesses that raise the likelihood of producing the most frequent sense of a word  with the consequence that an accurate translation will be unobtainable in cases that do not match the majority or plurality corpus occurrence  The accuracy of single word predictions has not been measured for any language  Because almost all non English language pairs pivot through English  the odds against obtaining accurate single word translations from one non English language to another can be estimated by multiplying the number of senses in the source language with the number of senses each of those terms have in English  When Google Translate does not have a word in its vocabulary  it makes up a result as part of its algorithm             

Limitations
Google Translate  like other automatic translation tools  has its limitations  struggles with polysemy  the multiple meanings a word may have                           and multiword expressions  terms that have meanings that cannot be understood or translated by analyzing the individual word units that compose them                A word in a foreign language might have two different meanings in the translated language  This might lead to mistranslation  Additionally  grammatical errors remain a major limitation to the accuracy of Google Translate               Google Translate struggles to differentiate between imperfect and perfect aspects in Romance languages  The subjunctive mood is often erroneous      citation needed      Moreover  the formal second person  vous  is often chosen  whatever the context      citation needed      Since its English reference material contains only  you  forms  it has difficulty translating a language with  you all  or formal  you  variations 
Due to differences between languages in investment  research  and the extent of digital resources  the accuracy of Google Translate varies greatly among languages              Some languages produce better results than others  Most languages from Africa  Asia  and the Pacific  tend to score poorly in relation to the scores of many well financed European languages  Afrikaans and Chinese being the high scoring exceptions from their continents                           No languages indigenous to Australia are included within Google Translate  Higher scores for European can be partially attributed to the Europarl Corpus  a trove of documents from the European Parliament that have been professionally translated by the mandate of the European Union into as many as    languages  A      analysis indicated that French to English translation is relatively accurate               and      and      analyses showed that Italian to English translation is relatively accurate as well                            However  if the source text is shorter  rule based machine translations often perform better  this effect is particularly evident in Chinese to English translations  While edits of translations may be submitted  in Chinese specifically one cannot edit sentences as a whole  Instead  one must edit sometimes arbitrary sets of characters  leading to incorrect edits              
The service can be used as a dictionary by typing in words  One can translate from a book by using a scanner and an OCR like Google Drive  In its Written Words Translation function  there is a word limit on the amount of text that can be translated at once              Therefore  long text should be transferred to a document form and translated through its Document Translate function

Reviews
Shortly after launching the translation service for the first time  Google won an international competition for English Arabic and English Chinese machine translation              

Translation mistakes and oddities
Since Google Translate uses statistical matching to translate  translated text can often include apparently nonsensical and obvious errors               often swapping common terms for similar but nonequivalent common terms in the other language               as well as inverting sentence meaning               Novelty websites like Bad Translator and Translation Party have used the service to produce humorous text by translating back and forth between multiple languages               similar to the children s game telephone              

Replying to  sarah mcdonald s
