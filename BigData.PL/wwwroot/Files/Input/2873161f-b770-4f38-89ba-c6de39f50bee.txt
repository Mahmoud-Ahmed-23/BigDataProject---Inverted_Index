							Indian researchers have identified common metabolites linked to pancreatic and glioma cancers  which could lead to improved early diagnosis and more effective treatments for these diseases  The findings were reported by IANS  a partner of TV BRICS 
The study examined metabolites found in exosomes   nano sized vesicles carrying tumour derived compounds   from pancreatic  lung  and glioma cancer cell lines  These biomarkers offer a potential non invasive method for early detection  addressing a crucial need for diagnosing aggressive cancers that are often detected at advanced stages 
The research team used a multi technique approach  incorporating Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis  NTA   Electron Microscopy  EM   Western Blot  WB   Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy  FTIR   untargeted Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry  LC MS MS   and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance  NMR   According to the report  this comprehensive methodology provides a more precise characterisation of exosomes than conventional single method studies 
Experts suggest this discovery could significantly improve treatment efficacy  particularly through personalised therapies designed to interfere with dysregulated metabolic pathways in cancer cells  Such targeted interventions could reduce side effects and improve patient outcomes  representing a significant advance in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics  the source claims
