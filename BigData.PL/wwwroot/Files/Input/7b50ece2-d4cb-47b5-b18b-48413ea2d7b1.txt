Jeopardy  edit 
Original streak edit 
Before       Jeopardy  contestants were limited to five consecutive wins  At the beginning of the show s   th season in       the rules were changed to allow contestants to remain on the show as long as they continued to win              After this rule change  and until Jennings s run  the record winning streak was set by Tom Walsh  who won          in eight games in January                   Jennings took the contestant exam for Jeopardy  in       but did not hear back from the show for a year  He was given three weeks to prepare for his taping  and he prepared extensively  using a couch as a podium  his young child s toy as a buzzer  and having his wife use flash cards and keep score                         
Jennings s run began during Jeopardy      s   th season with the episode aired on June          in which he unseated two time returning champion Jerry Harvey  and continued into season     In that first episode  Jennings s entire winning streak nearly ended before it even began  The Final Jeopardy  answer was   She s the first female track and field athlete to win medals in five different events at a single Olympics   Jennings responded with  Who is Jones   using only the last name of Marion Jones  who was not stripped of her medals until December        Host Alex Trebek said   We will accept that  in terms of female athletes  there aren t that many   If the response had not been accepted  Jennings would have finished in third place  and challenger Julia Lazarus would have won the game instead 
His historic streak then underway  Jennings had taped    episodes before a single one made it to air             
His last program was taped in September  but did not air until November           coinciding with the end of the November sweeps              His reign as Jeopardy  champion ended when he lost his   th game to challenger Nancy Zerg              Jennings responded incorrectly to both Double Jeopardy  Daily Doubles  causing him to lose a combined                 and         respectively  and leaving him with         at the end of the round  As a result  for only the   th time in    games  Jennings did not have an insurmountable lead going into the Final Jeopardy  round              Only Jennings and Zerg  who ended Double Jeopardy  with          were able to play Final Jeopardy  as third place contestant David Hankins failed to finish with a positive score after the Double Jeopardy  round  The Final Jeopardy  category was Business  amp  Industry  and the clue was   Most of this firm s        seasonal white collar employees work only four months a year   Jennings appeared perplexed during the time allowed to write a response  while Zerg finished her response quickly  Zerg responded correctly with  What is H amp R Block   and wagered        of her          giving her a    lead over Jennings with his response still to be revealed  Jennings incorrectly responded with  What is FedEx   and lost the game with a final score of        after his        wager was deducted from his score              After his response was revealed to be incorrect  the audience audibly gasped  and Zerg appeared to be shocked after realizing that she won  Jennings was awarded        for his second place finish  which gave him a final total of            for his Jeopardy  run  Zerg  whom Jennings called a  formidable opponent   finished in third place on the next show  The audience gave a standing ovation in honor of both contestants  and Alex Trebek called Zerg a  giant killer  as Jennings embraced her              According to the Associated Press  rumor of Jennings s defeat began circulating shortly after the episode s original taping  and footage had leaked online by November                 
Overall  Jennings answered over       questions correctly on the program              Jennings s run was interrupted by the off season break  July until September        Kids  Week  the Tournament of Champions  aired from September           through October           the      United States presidential election  Tuesday  November          when no first run episode was scheduled  the remaining episodes of the week aired from that Wednesday to Saturday   and the College Championship  aired from November           to November            As a result  he went the entire five months without a loss  Jennings did not participate in the Tournament of Champions  as invitations are extended only to champions    wins or more  who have been defeated  with the exception of the winner s  of the College Championship   On December          the day after his defeat  Jennings made a guest appearance at the start of the broadcast  during which host Alex Trebek acknowledged his success and enumerated the various game show records he had broken             

Impact and television ratings edit 
It took a span of     calendar days to broadcast Jennings s    matches  His run on the show brought significant media attention and television ratings  According to the Nielsen TV National People Meter  Jeopardy      s ratings were    percent higher during Jennings s run than they were during the same period the previous year              For several weeks of the winnings  streak  Jeopardy  was ranked as TV s highest rated syndicated program              with ratings    percent higher than before his appearance              By the end of Jeopardy      s   th season several weeks later  the show had surpassed sister program Wheel of Fortune in the ratings  though Wheel still benefited from the streak in markets where Jeopardy  is its lead in in the common scheduling tactic for both shows              Jennings was credited with boosting the program s popularity as a whole  which at that point had been on the air for two decades but primarily attracted an older demographic             
The attention changed Jennings s life overnight  turning him into a household name              Jennings guested on several television programs  including The Tonight Show  Nightline              Live with Regis and Kelly              Sesame Street              and the Late Show with David Letterman  where he read the Top Ten List of Ways To Irritate Alex Trebek              Publicists for the program reportedly divided his appearances evenly between ABC and CBS the former a frequent affiliate for the show and the latter a sister company to the show s syndicator              Taking advantage of the notoriety of Jennings s losing Final Jeopardy  answer  H amp R Block offered Jennings free tax planning and financial services for the rest of his life              with a senior vice president for the company estimating that he owed about       million in taxes on his winnings                          BBDO created an advertisement for FedEx in the USA Today newspaper three days after his final game  stating  There s only one time FedEx has ever been the wrong answer  and congratulating Jennings for his streak              Barbara Walters named him one of her    Most Fascinating People of                   In a      Reddit AMA  Jennings recalled how in      the Democratic politicians Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid unsuccessfully asked Jennings to run for the United States Senate from Utah  He commented   That was when I realized the Democratic Party was  screwed  in                   At the end of the decade  Entertainment Weekly put his run on its  best of  list   Answer  A software engineer from Utah  he dominated the quizfest for a record    shows in       amassing             Question  Who is Ken Jennings              
Jennings donated ten percent of his winnings to the LDS Church                          His streak made an impact backstage at the show as well  with the producers implemented some changes during his run  Normally  players only get a short time to practice  but more rehearsal time was added so that the new players could get comfortable with the buzzers  Additionally  the person who managed the buzzer system was changed              In his book Brainiac  Jennings says that the consistency of the original manager s timing had given an increasing advantage to continuing players  and that the change made a noticeable difference in the second season that he was on the show  At one point  announcer Johnny Gilbert stopped announcing Jennings s total wins during the show s opening      citation needed
