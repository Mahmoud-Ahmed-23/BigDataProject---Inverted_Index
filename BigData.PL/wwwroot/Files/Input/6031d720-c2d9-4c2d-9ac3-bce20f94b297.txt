							CAIRO  Middlesbrough manager Gareth Southgate stated that Mido could rejoin the Riverside when his brief loan period with Wigan Athletic ends  
The Egyptian international  who fell down the pecking order at Boro  sealed a loan move to the Latics until the end of the season 
 There s nothing agreed with Wigan at this stage   Southgate was quoted by Sunday Sun as saying 
 All parties have felt a change for everybody would be good and it s for both the players  Marlon King moved in the opposite direction  under a similar deal  to prove to the two clubs that they       ve got something to add  
Southgate  who usually tends to rely on frontline duo of Afonso Alves and Tuncay  acclaimed Mido  saying the striker s stint at Wigan could help him redeem himself  
 We know his talent  I just felt for him  a different challenge would get more out of him   the    year old tactician said  
 But Mido s still our player  and we have to wait and see what the summer holds
