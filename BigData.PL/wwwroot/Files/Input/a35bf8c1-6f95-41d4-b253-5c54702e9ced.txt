Old Faithful is a cone geyser in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming  United States  It was named in      during the Washburn Langford Doane Expedition and was the first geyser in the park to be named                        It is a highly predictable geothermal feature and has erupted every    minutes to two hours since                  The geyser and the nearby Old Faithful Inn are part of the Old Faithful Historic District 


History edit 
In the afternoon of September           the members of the Washburn Langford Doane Expedition traveled down the Firehole River from the Kepler Cascades and entered the Upper Geyser Basin  The first geyser that they saw was Old Faithful  Nathaniel P  Langford wrote in his      Scribner s account of the expedition 

It spouted at regular intervals nine times during our stay  the columns of boiling water being thrown from ninety to one hundred and twenty five feet at each discharge  which lasted from fifteen to twenty minutes  We gave it the name of  Old Faithful          Nathaniel P  Langford                 
In the early days of the park  Old Faithful was often used as a laundry 

Old Faithful is sometimes degraded by being made a laundry  Garments placed in the crater during quiescence are ejected thoroughly washed when the eruption takes place  Gen  Sheridan s men  in       found that linen and cotton fabrics were uninjured by the action of the water  but woolen clothes were torn to shreds            
Eruptions edit 
   second video clip of an eruption
More than           eruptions have been recorded  Harry Woodward first described a mathematical relationship between the duration and intervals of the eruptions in                             Old Faithful is not the tallest or largest geyser in the park  those titles belong to the less predictable Steamboat Geyser              The reliability of Old Faithful can be attributed to the fact that it is not connected to any other thermal features of the Upper Geyser Basin             
Eruptions can shoot       to       US gallons         to             L  of boiling water to a height of     to     feet     to         m  lasting from    to   minutes  The average height of an eruption is     feet          m               Intervals between eruptions have ranged from    to     minutes  averaging     minutes in                               slowly increasing to an average of    minutes apart since       which may be the result of earthquakes affecting subterranean water levels              The disruptions have made earlier mathematical relationships inaccurate  but have actually made Old Faithful more predictable in terms of its next eruption      citation needed      After the Borah Peak earthquake in central Idaho in October       the eruption intervals of Old Faithful were noticeably lengthened             

Waiting time between eruptions and the duration of the eruption for Old Faithful 
The time between eruptions has a bimodal distribution  with the mean interval being either    or    minutes  and is dependent on the length of the prior eruption   Within a margin of error of     minutes  Old Faithful will erupt either    minutes after an eruption lasting less than    minutes  or    minutes after an eruption lasting more than    minutes             

Measurement edit 
Between      and       four probes containing temperature and pressure measurement devices and video equipment were lowered into Old Faithful  The probes were lowered as deep as    feet          m   Temperature measurements of the water at this depth were            F            C   the same as was measured in       The video probes were lowered to a maximum depth of    feet          m  to observe the conduit formation and the processes that took place in the conduit  Some of the processes observed include fog formation from the interaction of cool air from above mixing with heated air from below  the recharge processes of water entering into the conduit and expanding from below  and entry of superheated steam measuring as high as           F            C  into the conduit
