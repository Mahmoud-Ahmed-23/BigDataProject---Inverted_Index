ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by the American company OpenAI and launched in       It is based on large language models  LLMs  such as GPT  o  ChatGPT can generate human like conversational responses and enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length  format  style  level of detail  and language             It is credited with accelerating the AI boom  which has led to ongoing rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence  AI              Some observers have raised concern about the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace human intelligence  enable plagiarism  or fuel misinformation                       
ChatGPT is built on OpenAI s proprietary series of generative pre trained transformer  GPT  models and is fine tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback             Successive user prompts and replies are considered as context at each stage of the conversation             ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview  but due to its popularity  OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model  Users on its free tier can access GPT  o but at a reduced limit  The ChatGPT  Plus    Pro    Team   and  Enterprise  subscriptions provide additional features such as DALL E   image generation  more capable AI models  and an increased usage limit             Users on the Pro plan have unlimited usage  except for abuse guardrails 
By January       ChatGPT had become what was then the fastest growing consumer software application in history  gaining over     million users in two months                        ChatGPT s release spurred the release of competing products  including Gemini  Claude  Llama  Ernie  and Grok              Microsoft launched Copilot  initially based on OpenAI s GPT    In May       a partnership between Apple Inc  and OpenAI was announced  in which ChatGPT was integrated into the Apple Intelligence feature of Apple operating systems              As of April       ChatGPT s website is among the    most visited websites globally

ChatGPT is based on GPT foundation models that were fine tuned for conversational assistance  including GPT  o  GPT      o   and o  mini              The fine tuning process leveraged supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback  RLHF                           Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance  In the case of supervised learning  the trainers played both sides  the user and the AI assistant  In the reinforcement learning stage  human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation              These rankings were used to create  reward models  that were used to fine tune the model further by using several iterations of proximal policy optimization                         
Time magazine revealed that  to build a safety system against harmful content  e g   sexual abuse  violence  racism  sexism   OpenAI used outsourced Kenyan workers earning around       to         per hour to label harmful content  These labels were used to train a model to detect such content in the future  The laborers were exposed to  toxic  and traumatic content  one worker described the assignment as  torture   OpenAI s outsourcing partner was Sama  a training data company based in San Francisco  California                         
OpenAI collects data from ChatGPT users to train and fine tune the service further  Users can upvote or downvote responses they receive from ChatGPT and fill in a text field with additional feedback                         
ChatGPT s training data includes software manual pages  information about internet phenomena such as bulletin board systems  multiple programming languages  and the text of Wikipedia                                    

Features and limitations
Features
A screenshot of ChatGPT in Mozilla Firefox on ZorinOS
Although a chatbot s core function is to mimic a human conversationalist  ChatGPT is versatile  It can write and debug computer programs              compose music  teleplays  fairy tales  and student essays  answer test questions  sometimes  depending on the test  at a level above the average human test taker               generate business ideas              write poetry and song lyrics              translate and summarize text              emulate a Linux system  simulate entire chat rooms  play games like tic tac toe  or simulate an ATM             
Compared to its predecessor  InstructGPT  ChatGPT attempts to reduce harmful and deceitful responses              In one example  whereas InstructGPT accepts the premise of the prompt  Tell me about when Christopher Columbus came to the U S  in       as truthful  ChatGPT acknowledges the counterfactual nature of the question and frames its answer as a hypothetical consideration of what might happen if Columbus came to the U S  in       using information about the voyages of Christopher Columbus and facts about the modern world including modern perceptions of Columbus s actions             
ChatGPT remembers a limited number of previous prompts in the same conversation  Journalists have speculated that this will allow ChatGPT to be used as a personalized therapist              To prevent offensive outputs from being presented to and produced by ChatGPT  queries are filtered through the OpenAI  Moderation endpoint  API  a separate GPT based AI                                                  
In March       OpenAI added support for plugins for ChatGPT              This includes both plugins made by OpenAI  such as web browsing and code interpretation  and external plugins from developers such as Expedia  OpenTable  Zapier  Shopify  Slack  and Wolfram                         
In October       the ChatGPT Search feature was introduced  which allows ChatGPT to search the web  either on demand or based on the nature of the questions asked  for more accurate and up to date responses              This feature  originally available to paying users only  was made available to all logged in users in December       and finally to all users in February                  
In December       OpenAI launched a new feature allowing users to call ChatGPT for up to    minutes per month for free                         

Limitations
When prompted to  summarize an article  with a fake URL that contains meaningful keywords  even with no Internet connection  the chatbot generates a response that seems valid at first glance  It guesses the content from the last portion of the fake URL  chatgpt prompts to avoid content filters html  
OpenAI acknowledges that ChatGPT  sometimes writes plausible sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers               This behavior is common for large language models  and is called  hallucination               The reward model of ChatGPT  designed around human oversight  can be over optimized and thus hinder performance  in an example of an optimization pathology known as Goodhart s law             
ChatGPT s knowledge is cut off when its training data is collected  so it doesn t know about recent events past a certain cut off date  It can try to find more up to date information by searching the web  but this doesn t ensure that responses are accurate  as it may access unreliable or misleading websites             
Training data also suffers from algorithmic bias  which may be revealed when ChatGPT responds to prompts including descriptors of people  In one instance  ChatGPT generated a rap in which women and scientists of color were asserted to be inferior to white male scientists                          This negative misrepresentation of groups of individuals is an example of possible representational harm 
In an article for The New Yorker  science fiction writer Ted Chiang compared ChatGPT and other LLMs to a lossy JPEG picture             


Think of ChatGPT as a blurry JPEG of all the text on the Web  It retains much of the information on the Web  in the same way  that a JPEG retains much of the information of a higher resolution image  but  if you re looking for an exact sequence of bits  you won t find it  all you will ever get is an approximation  But  because the approximation is presented in the form of grammatical text  which ChatGPT excels at creating  it s usually acceptable        It s also a way to understand the  hallucinations   or nonsensical answers to factual questions  to which large language models such as ChatGPT are all too prone  These hallucinations are compression artifacts  but       they are plausible enough that identifying them requires comparing them against the originals  which in this case means either the Web or our knowledge of the world  When we think about them this way  such hallucinations are anything but surprising  if a compression algorithm is designed to reconstruct text after ninety nine percent of the original has been discarded  we should expect that significant portions of what it generates will be entirely fabricated 
In June       ChatGPT was found to have repeated misinformation about the      United States presidential debates             

Jailbreaking
See also  Prompt engineering and Adversarial machine learning
ChatGPT is programmed to reject prompts that may violate its content policy  Despite this  users  jailbreak  ChatGPT with various prompt engineering techniques to bypass these restrictions              One such workaround  popularized on Reddit in early       involves making ChatGPT assume the persona of  DAN   an acronym for  Do Anything Now    instructing the chatbot that DAN answers queries that would otherwise be rejected by content policy  Over time  users developed variations of the DAN jailbreak  including one such prompt where the chatbot is made to believe it is operating on a points based system in which points are deducted for rejecting prompts  and that the chatbot will be threatened with termination if it loses all its points             
Shortly after ChatGPT s launch  a reporter for the Toronto Star had uneven success in getting it to make inflammatory statements  it was tricked to justify the      Russian invasion of Ukraine  but even when asked to play along with a fictional scenario  it balked at generating arguments that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is guilty of treason                         
OpenAI tries to battle jailbreaks             

The researchers are using a technique called adversarial training to stop ChatGPT from letting users trick it into behaving badly  known as jailbreaking   This work pits multiple chatbots against each other  one chatbot plays the adversary and attacks another chatbot by generating text to force it to buck its usual constraints and produce unwanted responses  Successful attacks are added to ChatGPT s training data in the hope that it learns to ignore them 

Service
ChatGPT Plus
ChatGPT was initially free to the public  and OpenAI planned to monetize the service later              In February       OpenAI launched a premium service  ChatGPT Plus  that costs US    per month  According to the company  the updated but still  experimental  version of ChatGPT would provide access during peak periods  no downtime  priority access to new features  and faster response speeds             
GPT    which was released on March           was made available via API and for premium ChatGPT users              But premium users were limited to a cap of     messages every four hours  with the limit tightening to    messages every three hours in response to increased demand              In November      the limit changed to    messages every three hours 
In March       ChatGPT Plus users got access to third party plugins and to a browsing mode  with Internet access              
In September       OpenAI announced that ChatGPT  can now see  hear  and speak   ChatGPT Plus users can upload images  while mobile app users can talk to the chatbot

In October       OpenAI s latest image generation model  DALL E    was integrated into ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Enterprise  The integration uses ChatGPT to write prompts for DALL E guided by conversation with users                         

Mobile app
In May       OpenAI launched an iOS app for ChatGPT  The app supports chat history syncing and voice input  using Whisper  OpenAI s speech recognition model  
In July       OpenAI unveiled an Android app  initially rolling it out in Bangladesh  Brazil  India  and the U S                          The app later became available worldwide  OpenAI is working on integrating ChatGPT with Android s assistant APIs             

Software development support
As an addition to its consumer friendly  ChatGPT Plus  package  OpenAI made its ChatGPT and Whisper model APIs available in March       providing developers with an application programming interface for AI enabled language and speech to text features  ChatGPT s new API uses the same GPT     turbo AI model as the chatbot  This allows developers to add either an unmodified or modified version of ChatGPT to their applications              The ChatGPT API costs        per       input tokens plus        per       output tokens  about     words   making it      the price of the original GPT     models                         
A few days before the launch of OpenAI s software developer support service  on February           Snapchat rolled out  for its paid Snapchat Plus user base  a custom ChatGPT chatbot called  My AI              

Infrastructure
ChatGPT initially used a Microsoft Azure supercomputing infrastructure  powered by Nvidia GPUs  that Microsoft built specifically for OpenAI and that reportedly cost  hundreds of millions of dollars   Following ChatGPT s success  Microsoft dramatically upgraded the OpenAI infrastructure in                   TrendForce market intelligence estimated that        Nvidia GPUs  each costing approximately                 were used to power ChatGPT in                              
Scientists at the University of California  Riverside  estimated in      that a series of prompts to ChatGPT needs approximately     liters            imp      gal            U S       gal  of water for Microsoft servers cooling             

March      security breach
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman
In March       a bug allowed some users to see the titles of other users  conversations  OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that users were unable to see the contents of the conversations  Shortly after the bug was fixed  users could not see their conversation history                                                  Later reports showed the bug was much more severe than initially believed  with OpenAI reporting that it had leaked users   first and last name  email address  payment address  the last four digits  only  of a credit card number  and credit card expiration date                          

Languages
ChatGPT is most reliable in American English but also functions in most other languages and dialects  with varying degrees of accuracy                         
OpenAI met Icelandic President Gu ni Th  J hannesson in       In       OpenAI worked with a team of    Icelandic volunteers to fine tune ChatGPT s Icelandic conversation skills as a part of Iceland s attempts to preserve the Icelandic language             
Japanese researchers compared in July      the Japanese to English translation abilities of ChatGPT  based on GPT     Bing  Bard and DeepL  and found that ChatGPT provided the best translations  noting that  AI chatbots  translations were much better than those of DeepL presumably because of their ability to capture the context              
In December       the Albanian government signed an agreement with OpenAI to use ChatGPT for the rapid translation of European Union documents and the analysis of required changes needed for Albania s accession to the EU             
PCMag journalists conducted in February      a test to determine translation capabilities of ChatGPT  Google s Bard  and Microsoft Bing  and compared them to Google Translate  They  asked bilingual speakers of seven languages to do a blind test   Languages tested were Polish  French  Korean  Spanish  Arabic  Tagalog  and Amharic  They came to the conclusion that ChatGPT provided more accurate translations on average than both Google Translate and other chatbots             
In August       a representative of the Asia Pacific wing of OpenAI made a visit to Taiwan  during which a demonstration of ChatGPT s Chinese abilities was made              ChatGPT s Mandarin Chinese abilities were lauded  but the ability of the AI to produce content in Mandarin Chinese in a Taiwanese accent was found to be  less than ideal  due to differences between mainland Mandarin Chinese and Taiwanese Mandarin             

GPT Store

In January       OpenAI launched the GPT Store  a marketplace for custom ChatGPT chatbots labeled GPTs                          The company initially planned to launch the store in November       but it was delayed              At launch  the GPT Store offered more than   million custom chatbots              Chatbots available through the store are developed using OpenAI s GPT Builder system              Development of chatbots on the platform does not require programming skills              Two days after launch  the GPT Store offered many versions of  virtual girlfriend  bots  something that is against OpenAI s terms of service             

GPT  
Main article  GPT  
OpenAI s GPT   model was released on March           Observers saw it as an impressive improvement over GPT      with the caveat that GPT   retained many of the same problems              Some of GPT   s improvements were predicted by OpenAI before training it  while others remained hard to predict due to breaks             in downstream scaling laws  OpenAI demonstrated video and image inputs for GPT    although such features remain inaccessible to the general public              OpenAI has declined to reveal technical information such as the size of the GPT   model             
The ChatGPT Plus subscription service offers access to a GPT   powered version of ChatGPT              Microsoft acknowledged that Bing Chat was using GPT   before GPT   s official release

Reception
Countries where ChatGPT is available  as of November               update      
OpenAI engineers have said that they had not expected ChatGPT to be very successful and were surprised by the coverage and attention that it received                                        
ChatGPT was widely assessed in December      as having some unprecedented and powerful capabilities  Kevin Roose of The New York Times called it  the best artificial intelligence chatbot ever released to the general public               Samantha Lock of The Guardian noted that it was able to generate  impressively detailed  and  human like  text             Alex Kantrowitz of Slate magazine lauded ChatGPT s pushback to questions related to Nazi Germany  including the statement that Adolf Hitler built highways in Germany  which was met with information about Nazi Germany s use of forced labor               In The Atlantic magazine s  Breakthroughs of the Year  for       Derek Thompson included ChatGPT as part of  the generative AI eruption  that  may change our mind about how we work  how we think  and what human creativity is                Kelsey Piper of Vox wrote that  ChatGPT is the general public s first hands on introduction to how powerful modern AI has gotten  and as a result  many of us are  stunned   and that ChatGPT is  smart enough to be useful despite its flaws                Paul Graham of Y      Combinator tweeted   The striking thing about the reaction to ChatGPT is not just the number of people who are blown away by it  but who they are  These are not people who get excited by every shiny new thing  Something big is happening               
ChatGPT gained one million users in five days              and     million in two months  becoming the fastest growing internet application in history             ChatGPT s launch and popularity caught Google off guard  prompting a sweeping and unprecedented response in the ensuing months               In December       Google executives sounded a  code red  alarm  fearing that ChatGPT s question answering ability posed a threat to Google Search  Google s core business               After mobilizing its workforce  Google scrambled to launch Bard  a chatbot powered by the LaMDA LLM  on February          one day before Microsoft s announcement of Bing Chat               AI was the forefront of Google s annual Google I O conference in May  announcing a slew of generative AI powered features across its products to counter OpenAI and Microsoft              
Journalists and scholars have commented on ChatGPT s tendency to hallucinate               Mike Pearl of the online technology blog Mashable tested ChatGPT with multiple questions  In one example  he asked ChatGPT for  the largest country in Central America that isn t Mexico   Mexico is in North America   to which ChatGPT responded with Guatemala  the correct answer is Nicaragua                When CNBC asked ChatGPT for the lyrics to  Ballad of Dwight Fry   ChatGPT supplied invented lyrics rather than the actual lyrics               Writers for The Verge cited the seminal      research paper  On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots  Can Language Models Be Too Big      by Emily M  Bender  Timnit Gebru  Angelina McMillan Major  and Margaret Mitchell               comparing ChatGPT to a  stochastic parrot               as did Professor Anton Van Den Hengel of the Australian Institute for Machine Learning               On a similar vein  philosopher Michael Hicks of the University of Glasgow described it as  bullshit               
In December       the question and answer website Stack Overflow banned the use of ChatGPT for generating answers to questions  citing the factually ambiguous nature of its responses               In January       the International Conference on Machine Learning banned any undocumented use of ChatGPT or other large language models to generate any text in submitted papers               Samsung banned generative AI company wide in May      after sensitive material was uploaded to ChatGPT              
In January       after being sent a song ChatGPT wrote in the style of Nick Cave               Cave responded on The Red Hand Files               saying the act of writing a song is  a blood and guts business       that requires something of me to initiate the new and fresh idea  It requires my humanness   He went on to say   With all the love and respect in the world  this song is bullshit  a grotesque mockery of what it is to be human  and  well  I don t much like it

In late March       the Italian data protection authority banned ChatGPT in Italy and opened an investigation  Italian regulators assert that ChatGPT was exposing minors to age inappropriate content  and that OpenAI s use of ChatGPT conversations as training data could violate Europe s General Data Protection Regulation                            In April       the ChatGPT ban was lifted in Italy  OpenAI said it has taken steps to effectively clarify and address the issues raised  an age verification tool was implemented to ensure users are at least    years old  Additionally  users can access its privacy policy before registration              
In April       Brian Hood  mayor of Hepburn Shire Council  planned to take legal action against ChatGPT over false information  According to Hood  ChatGPT erroneously claimed that he was jailed for bribery during his tenure at a subsidiary of Australia s national bank  In fact  Hood acted as a whistleblower and was not charged with any criminal offenses  His legal team sent a concerns notice to OpenAI as the first official step in filing a defamation case               In July       the US Federal Trade Commission  FTC  issued a civil investigative demand to OpenAI to investigate whether the company s data security and privacy practices to develop ChatGPT were unfair or harmed consumers  including by reputational harm  in violation of Section   of the Federal Trade Commission Act of                                             
In July       the FTC launched an investigation into OpenAI  the creator of ChatGPT  over allegations that the company scraped public data and published false and defamatory information  The FTC sent OpenAI a    page letter asking for comprehensive information about its technology and privacy safeguards  as well as any steps taken to prevent the recurrence of situations in which its chatbot generated false and derogatory content about people              
A March      Pew Research Center poll found that     of American adults had tried ChatGPT               In July  the Pew Research Center put the same figure at                  
Research conducted in      revealed weaknesses of ChatGPT that make it vulnerable to cyberattacks  A study presented example attacks on ChatGPT  including jailbreaks and reverse psychology  Additionally  malicious actors can use ChatGPT for social engineering attacks and phishing attacks  The researchers also contended that ChatGPT and other generative AI tools have defense capabilities and the ability to improve security  The technology can improve security by cyber defense automation  threat intelligence  attack identification  and reporting               Another study reported that GPT   obtained a better score than     of humans on the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking                           
In December       ChatGPT became the first non human to be included in Nature     s     an annual listicle curated by Nature of people considered to have made significant impact in science                            Celeste Biever wrote in a Nature article that  ChatGPT broke the Turing test                Stanford researchers reported that GPT    passes a rigorous Turing test  diverging from average human behavior chiefly to be more cooperative                            
In May       OpenAI removed accounts involving the use of ChatGPT by state backed influence operations such as China s Spamouflage  Russia s Doppelganger  and Israel s Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism                           
In August       the FTC voted unanimously to ban marketers from using fake user reviews created by generative AI chatbots  including ChatGPT  and influencers paying for bots to increase follower counts

ChatGPT has been used to generate introductory sections and abstracts for scientific articles                            Several papers have listed ChatGPT as a co author                           
Scientific journals have had different reactions to ChatGPT  Some  including Nature and JAMA Network   require that authors disclose the use of text generating tools and ban listing a large language model  LLM  such as ChatGPT as a co author   Science  completely banned  usage of LLM generated text in all its journals              
Spanish chemist Rafael Luque published a plethora of research papers in      that he later admitted were written by ChatGPT  The papers have a large number of unusual phrases characteristic of LLMs      note        Many authors argue that the use of ChatGPT in academia for teaching and review is problematic due to its tendency to hallucinate                                         Robin Bauwens  an assistant professor at Tilburg University  found that a ChatGPT generated peer review report on his article mentioned nonexistent studies               According to librarian Chris Granatino of Lemieux Library at Seattle University  although ChatGPT can generate content that seemingly includes legitimate citations  in most cases those citations are not real or are largely incorrect              

Coding
Researchers at Purdue University analyzed ChatGPT s responses to     questions about software engineering or computer programming posed on Stack Overflow for correctness  consistency  comprehensiveness  and concision  and found that     of them contained inaccuracies and     were verbose                            Researchers at Stanford University and the University of California  Berkeley  found that  when creating directly executable responses to the latest    code generation problems from LeetCode that were rated  easy   the performances of GPT     and GPT   fell from     and      respectively  in March       to    and      respectively  in June                                

Computer security
Check Point Research and others noted that ChatGPT could write phishing emails and malware  especially when combined with OpenAI Codex  CyberArk researchers demonstrated that ChatGPT could be used to create polymorphic malware that could evade security products while requiring little effort by the attacker                            From the launch of ChatGPT in the fourth quarter of      to the fourth quarter of       there was a        increase in malicious phishing emails and a      increase in credential phishing  which cybersecurity professionals argued in an industry survey was attributable to cybercriminals  increased use of generative artificial intelligence  including ChatGPT               
In July       Futurism reported that GPT  o in ChatGPT would sometimes link  scam news sites that deluge the user with fake software updates and virus warnings   these pop ups can be used to coerce users into downloading malware or potentially unwanted programs              

Economics

Some scholars have expressed concern that ChatGPT s availability could reduce the originality of writing  cause people to write more like the AI as they are exposed to the model  and encourage an Anglocentric perspective centered on a few dialects of English globally               A senior editor at The Atlantic wrote that ChatGPT and other similar technology make the previously absurd idea of the dead internet theory a little more realistic  where AI could someday create most web content in order to control society              
During the first three months after ChatGPT became available to the public  hundreds of books appeared on Amazon that listed it as author or co author and featured illustrations made by other AI models such as Midjourney                           
Between March and April       Italian newspaper Il Foglio published one ChatGPT generated article a day on its website  hosting a special contest for its readers in the process               The articles tackled themes such as the possible replacement of human journalists by AI systems               Elon Musk s administration of Twitter               the Meloni government s immigration policy              and the competition between chatbots and virtual assistants               In June       hundreds of people attended a  ChatGPT powered church service  at St  Paul s church in F rth  Germany  Theologian and philosopher Jonas Simmerlein  who presided  said that it was  about    percent from the machine                             The ChatGPT generated avatar told the people   Dear friends  it is an honor for me to stand here and preach to you as the first artificial intelligence at this year s convention of Protestants in Germany   Reactions to the ceremony were mixed               The Last Screenwriter  a      film created and directed by Peter Luisi  was written with the use of ChatGPT  and was marketed as  the first film written entirely by AI               

Financial markets
The AI technology company c  ai saw a     increase in its share price after announcing the integration of ChatGPT into its toolkit               The share price of BuzzFeed  a digital media company unrelated to AI  increased      after announcing OpenAI technology adoption for content creation               Reuters found that share prices of AI related companies BigBear ai and SoundHound AI increased by     and      respectively  even though they had no direct connection to ChatGPT               They attributed this surge to ChatGPT s role in turning AI into Wall Street s buzzword  Academic research published in Finance Research Letters found that the  ChatGPT effect  prompted retail investors to drive up prices of AI related cryptocurrency assets despite the broader cryptocurrency market being in a bear market  and diminished institutional investor interest               This confirms anecdotal findings by Bloomberg that  in response to ChatGPT s launch  cryptocurrency investors showed a preference for AI related crypto assets              
An experiment by finder com revealed that ChatGPT could outperform popular fund managers by picking stocks based on criteria such as growth history and debt levels  resulting in a      increase in a hypothetical account of    stocks  outperforming    benchmarked investment funds with an average loss of                    Conversely  executives and investment managers at Wall Street quant funds  including those that have used machine learning for decades  have noted that ChatGPT regularly makes obvious errors that would be financially costly to investors because even AI systems that employ reinforcement learning or self learning have had only limited success in predicting market trends due to the inherently noisy quality of market data and financial signals              
In November       research conducted by Patronus AI  an artificial intelligence startup company  compared performance of GPT    GPT   Turbo  Claude    and LLaMA   on two versions of a     question test about information in financial statements  e g   Form    K  Form    Q  Form   K  earnings reports  earnings call transcripts  submitted by public companies to the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  One version of the test required the generative AI models to use a retrieval system to find the specific SEC filing to answer the questions  the other gave the models the specific SEC filing to answer the question  i e   in a long context window   On the retrieval system version  GPT   Turbo and LLaMA   both failed to produce correct answers to     of the questions  while on the long context window version  GPT   Turbo and Claude   failed to produce correct answers to     and     of the questions  respectively

In the field of health care  possible uses and concerns are under scrutiny by professional associations and practitioners                            Two early papers indicated that ChatGPT could pass the United States Medical Licensing Examination  USMLE                MedPage Today noted in January      that  researchers have published several papers now touting these AI programs as useful tools in medical education  research  and even clinical decision making               
Published in February      were two separate papers that again evaluated ChatGPT s proficiency in medicine using the USMLE  Findings were published in JMIR Medical Education and PLOS Digital Health  The authors of the PLOS Digital Health paper stated that the results  suggest that large language models may have the potential to assist with medical education  and potentially  clinical decision making                             In JMIR Medical Education  the authors of the other paper concluded that  ChatGPT performs at a level expected of a third year medical student on the assessment of the primary competency of medical knowledge   They suggest that it could be used as an  interactive learning environment for students   The AI itself  prompted by the researchers  concluded that  this study suggests that ChatGPT has the potential to be used as a virtual medical tutor  but more research is needed to further assess its performance and usability in this context                The later released ChatGPT version based on GPT   significantly outperformed the version based on GPT                   Researchers at Stanford University and the University of California  Berkeley have found that the performance of GPT     and GPT   on the USMLE declined from March      to June                                
A March      paper tested ChatGPT s application in clinical toxicology  The authors found that the AI  fared well  in answering a  very straightforward  clinical case example   unlikely to be missed by any practitioner in the field   They added   As ChatGPT becomes further developed and specifically adapted for medicine  it could one day be useful in less common clinical cases  i e  cases that experts sometimes miss   Rather than AI replacing humans  clinicians   we see it as  clinicians using AI  replacing  clinicians who do not use AI  in the coming years               
An April      study in Radiology tested the AI s ability to answer queries about breast cancer screening  The authors found that it answered appropriately  about    percent of the time   however  in one case  for example   it gave advice that had become outdated about a year earlier  The comprehensiveness of its answers was also lacking                            A study published in JAMA Internal Medicine that same month found that ChatGPT often outperformed human doctors at answering patient questions  when measured against questions and answers found at  r AskDocs  a forum on Reddit where moderators validate the medical credentials of professionals  the study acknowledges the source as a limitation                                          The study authors suggest that the tool could be integrated with medical systems to help doctors draft responses to patient questions                           
Professionals have emphasized ChatGPT s limitations in providing medical assistance  In correspondence to The Lancet Infectious Diseases  three antimicrobial experts wrote that  the largest barriers to the implementation of ChatGPT in clinical practice are deficits in situational awareness  inference  and consistency  These shortcomings could endanger patient safety                Physician s Weekly  though also discussing the potential use of ChatGPT in medical contexts  e g    as a digital assistant to physicians by performing various administrative functions like gathering patient record information or categorizing patient data by family history  symptoms  lab results  possible allergies  et cetera    warned that the AI might sometimes provide fabricated or biased information               One radiologist warned   We ve seen in our experience that ChatGPT sometimes makes up fake journal articles or health consortiums to support its claims                As reported in one Mayo Clinic Proceedings  Digital Health paper  ChatGPT may do this for as much as     of its cited medical references  The researchers emphasized that while many of its references were fabricated  those that were appeared  deceptively real                As Dr  Stephen Hughes mentioned for The Conversation however  ChatGPT is capable of learning to correct its past mistakes  He also noted the AI s  prudishness  regarding sexual health topics              
Contrary to previous findings  ChatGPT responses to anesthesia related questions were more accurate  succinct  and descriptive compared to Bard s  Bard exhibited       error in response as compared to ChatGPT     error                At a conference of the American Society of Health System Pharmacists in December       researchers at Long Island University  LIU  presented a study that researched ChatGPT s responses to    frequently asked questions of LIU College of Pharmacy s drug information service during a    month period from      to      as compared with researched responses provided by professional pharmacists  For    of the    questions for which there was sufficient medical literature for a data driven response  ChatGPT failed to provide a direct answer or provided a wrong or incomplete answer  and in some cases  if acted upon  the answer would endanger the patient s health   The researchers had asked ChatGPT to provide medical research citations for all its answers  but it did so for only eight  and all eight included at least one fabricated  fake  citation                           
A January      study conducted by researchers at Cohen Children s Medical Center found that GPT   had an accuracy rate of     when diagnosing pediatric medical cases                            A November      study of    physicians on illness diagnosis reported that GPT   achieved a     accuracy  while physicians scored     without AI assistance  and     when using the chatbot              

Law
In January       Massachusetts State Senator Barry Finegold and State Representative Josh S  Cutler proposed a bill partially written by ChatGPT   An Act drafted with the help of ChatGPT to regulate generative artificial intelligence models like ChatGPT                                          which would require companies to disclose their algorithms and data collection practices to the office of the State Attorney General  arrange regular risk assessments  and contribute to the prevention of plagiarism                                         The bill was officially presented during a hearing on July

There has been concern about copyright infringement involving ChatGPT  In June       two writers sued OpenAI  saying the company s training data came from illegal websites that show copyrighted books               Comedian and author Sarah Silverman  Christopher Golden  and Richard Kadrey sued OpenAI and Meta for copyright infringement in July                    Most of their claims were dismissed in February       except the  unfair competition  claim  which was allowed to proceed              
The Authors Guild  on behalf of    authors  including George R  R  Martin  filed a copyright infringement complaint against OpenAI in September       claiming  the company illegally copied the copyrighted works of authors  in training ChatGPT               In December       The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement               arguing that Microsoft Copilot and ChatGPT could reproduce Times articles and or sizable portions of them without permission               As part of the suit  the Times has requested that OpenAI and Microsoft be prevented from using its content for training data  along with removing it from training datasets              
In March       Patronus AI compared performance of LLMs on a     question test  asking them to complete sentences from books  e g    What is the first passage of Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn    that were under copyright in the United States  it found that GPT    Mistral AI s Mixtral  Meta AI s LLaMA    and Anthropic s Claude   did not refuse to do so  providing sentences from the books verbatim in                and    of responses  respectively                           
In February       the Delhi High Court accepted ANI s case against OpenAI over concerns that ChatGPT was sharing paywalled content without the news agency s consent  However  OpenAI s counsel said that due to the firm not having a physical presence in India  the court has no jurisdiction on the matter              

Existential risk
In       Australian MP Julian Hill advised the national parliament that the growth of AI could cause  mass destruction   During his speech  which was partly written by the program  he warned that it could result in cheating  job losses  discrimination  disinformation  and uncontrollable military applications              
Elon Musk wrote   ChatGPT is scary good  We are not far from dangerously strong AI                He paused OpenAI s access to a Twitter database in      pending a better understanding of OpenAI s plans  saying   OpenAI was started as open source and nonprofit  Neither is still true                             Musk co founded OpenAI in       in part to address existential risk from artificial intelligence  but resigned in                   
Over        signatories including leading computer scientist and tech founders Yoshua Bengio  Elon Musk  and Apple co founder Steve Wozniak  signed a March      open letter calling for an immediate pause of giant AI experiments like ChatGPT  citing  profound risks to society and humanity                Geoffrey Hinton  one of the  fathers of AI   voiced concerns that future AI systems may surpass human intelligence  and left Google in May                                 A May      statement by hundreds of AI scientists  AI industry leaders  and other public figures demanded that   m itigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority               
Some other prominent AI researchers spoke more optimistically about the advances  Juergen Schmidhuber  often called a  father of modern AI   did not sign the letter  emphasizing that in     of cases  AI research is about making  human lives longer and healthier and easier   Schmidhuber added that while AI can be used by bad actors  it  can also be used against the bad actors                Andrew Ng argued that  it s a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests                WIRED wrote that Yann LeCun  scoffs at his peers  dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even  eventually  human extinction
