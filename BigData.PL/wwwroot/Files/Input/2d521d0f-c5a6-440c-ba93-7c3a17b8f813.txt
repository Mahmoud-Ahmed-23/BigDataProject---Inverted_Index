Preventing personal identity from being revealed
While a person can usually be readily identified from a picture taken directly of them  the task of identifying them on the basis of limited data is harder  yet sometimes possible 
De identification is the process used to prevent someone s personal identity from being revealed   For example  data produced during human subject research might be de identified to preserve the privacy of research participants  Biological data may be de identified in order to comply with HIPAA regulations that define and stipulate patient privacy laws              
When applied to metadata or general data about identification  the process is also known as data anonymization  Common strategies include deleting or masking personal identifiers  such as personal name  and suppressing or generalizing quasi identifiers  such as date of birth  The reverse process of using de identified data to identify individuals is known as data re identification  Successful re identifications                                             cast doubt on de identification s effectiveness  A systematic review of fourteen distinct re identification attacks found  a high re identification rate     dominated by small scale studies on data that was not de identified according to existing standards             
De identification is adopted as one of the main approaches toward data privacy protection             It is commonly used in fields of communications  multimedia  biometrics  big data  cloud computing  data mining  internet  social networks  and audio video surveillance            


Examples edit 
In designing surveys edit 
When surveys are conducted  such as a census  they collect information about a specific group of people  To encourage participation and to protect the privacy of survey respondents  the researchers attempt to design the survey in a way that when people participate in a survey  it will not be possible to match any participant s individual response s  with any data published            

Before using information edit 
When an online shopping website wants to know its users  preferences and shopping habits  it decides to retrieve customers  data from its database and do analysis on them  The personal data information include personal identifiers which were collected directly when customers created their accounts  The website needs to pre handle the data through de identification techniques before analyzing data records to avoid violating their customers  privacy 

Anonymization edit 
Anonymization refers to irreversibly severing a data set from the identity of the data contributor in a study to prevent any future re identification  even by the study organizers under any condition                          De identification may also include preserving identifying information which can only be re linked by a trusted party in certain situations                                      There is a debate in the technology community on whether data that can be re linked  even by a trusted party  should ever be considered de identified             

Techniques edit 
Common strategies of de identification are masking personal identifiers and generalizing quasi identifiers  Pseudonymization is the main technique used to mask personal identifiers from data records  and k anonymization is usually adopted for generalizing quasi identifiers 

Pseudonymization edit 
Pseudonymization is performed by replacing real names with a temporary ID  It deletes or masks personal identifiers to make individuals unidentified  This method makes it possible to track the individual s record over time  even though the record will be updated  However  it can not prevent the individual from being identified if some specific combinations of attributes in the data record indirectly identify the individual             

k anonymization edit 
k anonymization defines attributes that indirectly points to the individual s identity as quasi identifiers  QIs  and deal with data by making at least k individuals have some combination of QI values              QI values are handled following specific standards  For example  the k anonymization replaces some original data in the records with new range values and keep some values unchanged  New combination of QI values prevents the individual from being identified and also avoid destroying data records 

Applications edit 
Research into de identification is driven mostly for protecting health information              Some libraries have adopted methods used in the healthcare industry to preserve their readers  privacy             
In big data  de identification is widely adopted by individuals and organizations             With the development of social media  e commerce  and big data  de identification is sometimes required and often used for data privacy when users  personal data are collected by companies or third party organizations who will analyze it for their own personal usage 
In smart cities  de identification may be required to protect the privacy of residents  workers and visitors  Without strict regulation  de identification may be difficult because sensors can still collect information without consent             

Data De identification edit 
PHI  Protected Health Information  can be present in various data and each format need specific techniques and tools for de identify it 

For Text de identification is using rule based and NLP  Natural language processing  approaches 
Pdf de identification is based on text de identification  also required in most cases OCR and specific techniques for hide PHI in PDF             
DICOM de identification required to clean metadata  pixel data  encapsulated documents 
Limits edit 
Whenever a person participates in genetics research  the donation of a biological specimen often results in the creation of a large amount of personalized data  Such data is uniquely difficult to de identify             
Anonymization of genetic data is particularly difficult because of the huge amount of genotypic
information in biospecimens              the ties that specimens often have to medical history              and the advent of modern bioinformatics tools for data mining              There have been demonstrations that data for individuals in aggregate collections of genotypic data sets can be tied to the identities of the specimen donors             
Some researchers have suggested that it is not reasonable to ever promise participants in genetics research that they can retain their anonymity  but instead  such participants should be taught the limits of using coded identifiers in a de identification process             

De identification laws in the United States of America edit 
In May       the United States President s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology found de identification  somewhat useful as an added safeguard  but not  a useful basis for policy  as  it is not robust against near term future re identification methods              
The HIPAA Privacy Rule provides mechanisms for using and disclosing health data responsibly without the need for patient consent  These mechanisms center on two HIPAA de identification standards   Safe Harbor and the Expert Determination Method  Safe harbor relies on the removal of specific patient identifiers  e g  name  phone number  email address  etc    while the Expert Determination Method requires knowledge and experience with generally accepted statistical and scientific principles and methods to render information not individually identifiable             

Safe harbor edit 
The safe harbor method uses a list approach to de identification and has two requirements 

The removal or generalization of    elements from the data 
That the Covered Entity or Business Associate does not have actual knowledge that the residual information in the data could be used alone  or in combination with other information  to identify an individual  Safe Harbor is a highly prescriptive approach to de identification  Under this method  all dates must be generalized to year and zip codes reduced to three digits  The same approach is used on the data regardless of the context  Even if the information is to be shared with a trusted researcher who wishes to analyze the data for seasonal variations in acute respiratory cases and  thus  requires the month of hospital admission  this information cannot be provided  only the year of admission would be retained 
Expert Determination edit 
Expert Determination takes a risk based approach to de identification that applies current standards and best practices from the research to determine the likelihood that a person could be identified from their protected health information  This method requires that a person with appropriate knowledge of and experience with generally accepted statistical and scientific principles and methods render the information not individually identifiable  It requires 

That the risk is very small that the information could be used alone  or in combination with other reasonably available information  by an anticipated recipient to identify an individual who is a subject of the information 
Documents the methods and results of the analysis that justify such a determination 
Research on decedents edit 
The key law about research in electronic health record data is HIPAA Privacy Rule  This law allows use of electronic health record of deceased subjects for research  HIPAA Privacy Rule  section         i     iii
