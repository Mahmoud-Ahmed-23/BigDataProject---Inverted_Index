							CAIRO  A recently discovered gas source in Egypt rsquo s Western Sahara desert could produce about    million cubic feet per day 
 ldquo It was a recent discovery made by Badr El Din Petroleum Co   and announced  at their general assembly meeting hellip as part of their         fiscal year financial results  rdquo  Kholoud Hussein  a press representative from the Ministry of Petroleum  told Daily News Egypt 
The site will produce about       barrels of condensed gas per day and production is expected to start in November  according to a report by Egynews net 
 ldquo I believe that this is a good amount  it may not be a lot  but if this is a new discovery that was not taken into reserves  which are about    trillion cubic feet  then this is a great new asset  rdquo  Mohab Hallouda  senior energy specialist at the World Bank  told Daily News Egypt 
According to Magda Kandil  executive director of the Egyptian Center for Economic Studies  Egypt has recently seen a shortage of gas and natural resources for a number reasons including high electricity usage  government subsidies on energy prices  and the country rsquo s exports of gas at undervalued prices 
While Jordan recently agreed to sign a new gas deal with Egypt that would modify the price  Israel continues to receive gas from Egypt under a    year deal signed since      
According to Noran Ali  petroleum analyst  Israel is said to receive gas from Egypt for     which is well under the standard international price of    
In May  the government said it would not raise electricity prices  thus  according to Kandil encouraging consumers to use more electricity instead of cutting back at a time when resources are scarce 
Hallouda pointed out that this new discovery  however  should help alleviate the situation as recent changes in the country have taken place 
 ldquo This should help  although these days  due to the disruption of gas imports to Jordan and Israel  we have not been really seeing a shortage like we were before  rdquo  he added 
The recent gas source is not Badr El Din Company rsquo s only discovery this year 
 ldquo Over the past year we have made three oil discoveries that produce at a rate of       barrels of oil per day  rdquo  said Mohamed Nagi  chairman of the company 
Nagi pointed out that the company had developed    wells on a new production map  producing about        barrels of crude oil per day and     million cubic feet of gas per day  according to Egynews net 
The new  ldquo production map rdquo  resulted in boosting the company rsquo s production to more than        barrels of crude oil per day as well as increasing the gas production levels to     million cubic feet 
According to Nagi  the company has been carrying extensive drilling in the area in order to increase their chances of finding new discoveries  So far  the company has drilled    wells during the last year 
The company aims to drill    exploratory and development wells during fiscal year         in order to further increase their production rates 
Seen as a rich area with potential for vast discoveries  several efforts have been made to excavate the natural resources hidden in the depths of Egypt rsquo s Western Sahara desert 
In June  American oil company Apache Corporation discovered five new oil wells in the Faghur Basin in the far southwest of Egypt rsquo s Western Desert oil and gas province 
According to a statement released by the company  in just one of their digging tests  the discoveries included       barrels of oil per day and      million cubic feet of gas per day 
Egypt rsquo s gas sources currently represent   percent of the total world rsquo s resource
