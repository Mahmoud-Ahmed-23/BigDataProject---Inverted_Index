Slavery is the ownership of a person as property  especially in regards to their labour             Slavery typically involves compulsory work  with the slave s location of work and residence dictated by the party that holds them in bondage  Enslavement is the placement of a person into slavery  and the person is called a slave or an enslaved person  see        Terminology  Photograph of a slave boy in the Sultanate of Zanzibar entitled  An Arab master s punishment for a slight offence   c            
Many historical cases of enslavement occurred as a result of breaking the law  becoming indebted  suffering a military defeat  or exploitation for cheaper labor  other forms of slavery were instituted along demographic lines such as race or sex  Slaves would be kept in bondage for life  or for a fixed period of time after which they would be granted freedom             Although slavery is usually involuntary and involves coercion  there are also cases where people voluntarily enter into slavery to pay a debt or earn money due to poverty  In the course of human history  slavery was a typical feature of civilization             and existed in most societies throughout history                        but it is now outlawed in most countries of the world  except as a punishment for a crime                       
In chattel slavery  the slave is legally rendered the personal property  chattel  of the slave owner  In economics  the term de facto slavery describes the conditions of unfree labour and forced labour that most slaves endure            
The Islamic Republic of Mauritania was the last country in the world to officially ban slavery  in                   with legal prosecution of slaveholders established in                   However  in       approximately    million people  of whom     were children  were still enslaved throughout the world despite slavery being illegal  In the modern world  more than     of slaves provide forced labour  usually in the factories and sweatshops of the private sector of a country s economy              In industrialised countries  human trafficking is a modern variety of slavery  in non industrialised countries  people in debt bondage are common             others include captive domestic servants  people in forced marriages  and child soldiers              Moreover  there have been many Islamic extremist groups and terrorist organizations who have periodically revived the practice of slavery based on their interpretation of Sha ria law             


Etymology
The word slave was borrowed into Middle English through the Old French esclave which ultimately derives from Byzantine Greek          skl bos  or              sklab nos  
According to the widespread view  which has been known since the   th century  the Byzantine            Skl binoi                sklab no    borrowed from a Slavic tribe self name  Slov ne  turned into                      Late Latin scl vus  in the meaning  prisoner of war slave    slave  in the  th  th century  because they often became captured and enslaved                                                  However this version has been disputed since the   th century                         
An alternative contemporary hypothesis states that Medieval Latin scl vus via      scyl vus derives from Byzantine         sk l    skyl    or          sk le    skyle    with the meaning  to strip the enemy  killed in a battle   or  to make booty   extract spoils of war                                                   This version has been criticized as well             

Terminology
There is a dispute among historians about whether terms such as  unfree labourer  or  enslaved person   rather than  slave   should be used when describing the victims of slavery  According to those proposing a change in terminology  slave perpetuates the crime of slavery in language by reducing its victims to a nonhuman noun instead of  carry ing  them forward as people  not the property that they were   see also People first language   Other historians prefer slave because the term is familiar and shorter  or because it accurately reflects the inhumanity of slavery  with person implying a degree of autonomy that slavery does not allow

As a social institution  chattel slavery classes slaves as chattels  personal property  owned by the enslaver  like livestock  they can be bought and sold at will              Chattel slavery was historically the normal form of slavery and was practiced in places such as the Roman Empire and classical Greece  where it was considered a keystone of society                                      Other places where it was extensively practiced include Medieval Egypt              Subsaharan Africa              Brazil  the Antebellum United States  and parts of the Caribbean such as Cuba and Haiti                           The Iroquois enslaved others in ways that  looked very like chattel slavery              
Beginning in the   th century  a series of abolitionist movements saw slavery as a violation of the slaves  rights as people   all men are created equal    and sought to abolish it  Abolitionism encountered extreme resistance but was eventually successful  Several of the states of the United States began abolishing slavery during the American Revolutionary War  The French Revolution tried to abolish slavery in       but a permanent abolition did not occur until       In much of the British Empire  slavery was subject to abolition in       throughout the United States it was abolished in      and in Cuba in       The last country in the Americas to abolish slavery was Brazil  in                  
Chattel slavery survived longest in the Middle East  After the trans Atlantic slave trade had been suppressed  the ancient trans Saharan slave trade  the Indian Ocean slave trade and the Red Sea slave trade continued to traffic slaves from the African continent to the Middle East  During the   th century  the issue of chattel slavery was addressed and investigated globally by international bodies created by the League of Nations and the United Nations  such as the Temporary Slavery Commission in            the Committee of Experts on Slavery in       and the Advisory Committee of Experts on Slavery in                        By the time of the UN Ad Hoc Committee on Slavery in            legal chattel slavery still existed only in the Arabian Peninsula  in Oman  in Qatar  in Saudi Arabia  in the Trucial States and in Yemen               Legal chattel slavery was finally abolished in the Arabian Peninsula in the     s  Saudi Arabia and Yemen in       in Dubai in       and Oman as the last in                  
The last country to abolish slavery  Mauritania  did so in       While slavery had technically been banned by colonial France in French West Africa  including Mauritania  already in                   this had been a purely nominal ban  The      ban on slavery was not enforced in practice  as there were no legal mechanisms to prosecute those who used slaves  these only came in                             

Bonded labour
Main article  Debt bondage
See also  Money marriage and Chukri system
Indenture  also known as bonded labour or debt bondage  is a form of unfree labour in which a person works to pay off a debt by pledging himself or herself as collateral  The services required to repay the debt  and their duration  may be undefined  Debt bondage can be passed on from generation to generation  with children required to pay off their progenitors  debt              It is the most widespread form of slavery today              Debt bondage is most prevalent in South Asia              Money marriage refers to a marriage where a girl  usually  is married off to a man to settle debts owed by her parents              The Chukri system is a debt bondage system found in parts of Bengal where a female can be coerced into prostitution in order to pay off debts             

Dependents
The word slavery has also been used to refer to a legal state of dependency to somebody else                          For example  in Persia  the situations and lives of such slaves could be better than those of common citizens

Forced labour
Main article  Forced labour
See also  Human trafficking 
Forced labour  or unfree labour  is sometimes used to describe an individual who is forced to work against their own will  under threat of violence or other punishment  This may also include institutions not commonly classified as slavery  such as serfdom  conscription and penal labour  As slavery has been legally outlawed in all countries  forced labour in the present day  frequently referred to as  modern slavery   revolves around illegal control 
Human trafficking primarily involves women and children forced into prostitution and is the fastest growing form of forced labour  with Thailand  Cambodia  India  Brazil and Mexico having been identified as leading hotspots of commercial sexual exploitation of children                         

Child soldiers and child labour
Main article  Child slavery
See also  Child labour and Military use of childrenIn       Human Rights Watch estimated that         to         children served as soldiers in then current conflicts                          More girls under    work as domestic workers than any other category of child labour  often sent to cities by parents living in rural poverty as with the Haitian restaveks             
Forced marriage
See also  Marriage by abduction and Child marriage
Forced marriages or early marriages are often considered types of slavery  Forced marriage continues to be practiced in parts of the world including some parts of Asia and Africa and in immigrant communities in the West                                                  Marriage by abduction occurs in many places in the world today  with a      study finding a national average of     of marriages in Ethiopia being through abduction             

Other uses of the term
The word slavery is often used as a pejorative to describe any activity in which one is coerced into performing  Some argue that military drafts and other forms of coerced government labour constitute  state operated slavery                           Some libertarians and anarcho capitalists view government taxation as a form of slavery             
 Slavery  has been used by some anti psychiatry proponents to define involuntary psychiatric patients  claiming there are no unbiased physical tests for mental illness and yet the psychiatric patient must follow the orders of the psychiatrist  They assert that instead of chains to control the slave  the psychiatrist uses drugs to control the mind              Drapetomania was a pseudoscientific psychiatric diagnosis for a slave who desired freedom   symptoms  included laziness and the tendency to flee captivity                         
Some proponents of animal rights have applied the term slavery to the condition of some or all human owned animals  arguing that their status is comparable to that of human slaves             
The labour market  as institutionalized under contemporary capitalist systems  has been criticized by mainstream socialists and by anarcho syndicalists  who utilise the term wage slavery as a pejorative or dysphemism for wage labour                                      Socialists draw parallels between the trade of labour as a commodity and slavery  Cicero is also known to have suggested such parallels             

Characteristics
Economics
Economists have modeled the circumstances under which slavery  and variants such as serfdom  appear and disappear  One theoretical model is that slavery becomes more desirable for landowners where land is abundant  but labour is scarce  such that rent is depressed and paid workers can demand high wages  If the opposite holds true  then it is more costly for landowners to guard the slaves than to employ paid workers who can demand only low wages because of the degree of competition              Thus  first slavery and then serfdom gradually decreased in Europe as the population grew  They were reintroduced in the Americas and in Russia as large areas of land with few inhabitants became available             
Slavery is more common when the tasks are relatively simple and thus easy to supervise  such as large scale monocrops such as sugarcane and cotton  in which output depended on economies of scale  This enables systems of labour  such as the gang system in the United States  to become prominent on large plantations where field hands toiled with factory like precision  Then  each work gang was based on an internal division of labour that assigned every member of the gang to a task and made each worker s performance dependent on the actions of the others  The slaves chopped out the weeds that surrounded the cotton plants as well as excess sprouts  Plow gangs followed behind  stirring the soil near the plants and tossing it back around the plants  Thus  the gang system worked like an assembly line             
Since the   th century  critics have argued that slavery hinders technological advancement because the focus is on increasing the number of slaves doing simple tasks rather than upgrading their efficiency  For example  it is sometimes argued that  because of this narrow focus  technology in Greece   and later in Rome   was not applied to ease physical labour or improve manufacturing                         

The work of the Mercedarians was in ransoming Christian slaves held in North Africa        
Scottish economist Adam Smith stated that free labour was economically better than slave labour  and that it was nearly impossible to end slavery in a free  democratic  or republican form of government since many of its legislators or political figures were slave owners and would not punish themselves  He further stated that slaves would be better able to gain their freedom under centralized government  or a central authority like a king or church                          Similar arguments appeared later in the works of Auguste Comte  especially given Smith s belief in the separation of powers  or what Comte called the  separation of the spiritual and the temporal  during the Middle Ages and the end of slavery  and Smith s criticism of masters  past and present  As Smith stated in the Lectures on Jurisprudence   The great power of the clergy thus concurring with that of the king set the slaves at liberty  But it was absolutely necessary both that the authority of the king and of the clergy should be great  Where ever any one of these was wanting  slavery still continues                

Sale and inspection of slaves
Even after slavery became a criminal offense  slave owners could get high returns  According to researcher Siddharth Kara  the profits generated worldwide by all forms of slavery in      were            billion  That was second only to drug trafficking  in terms of global criminal enterprises  At the time the weighted average global sales price of a slave was estimated to be approximately       with a high of        for the average trafficked sex slave  and a low of     to     for debt bondage slaves in part of Asia and Africa  The weighted average annual profits generated by a slave in      was         with a low of an average      for bonded labour and         for a trafficked sex slave  Approximately     of slave profits each year were generated by trafficked sex slaves  representing slightly more than    of the world s         million slaves             

Identification
Branding of a female slave

Slave branding  c            
A widespread practice was branding  either to explicitly mark slaves as property or as punishment 

Legal aspects
Private versus state owned slaves
Slaves have been owned privately by individuals but have also been under state ownership  For example  the kisaeng were women from low castes in pre modern Korea  who were owned by the state under government officials known as hojang and were required to provide entertainment to the aristocracy  In the     s  in North Korea  Kippumjo   Pleasure Brigades   are made up of women selected from the general population to serve as entertainers and as concubines to the rulers of North Korea                           Tribute labor  is compulsory labor for the state and has been used in various iterations such as corv e  mit a and repartimiento  The internment camps of totalitarian regimes such as the Nazis and the Soviet Union placed increasing importance on the labor provided in those camps  leading to a growing tendency among historians to designate such systems as slavery             
A combination of these include the encomienda where the Spanish Crown granted private individuals the right to the free labour of a specified number of natives in a given area              In the  Red Rubber System  of both the Congo Free State and French ruled Ubangi Shari              labour was demanded as taxation  private companies were conceded areas within which they were allowed to use any measures to increase rubber production              Convict leasing was common in the Southern United States where the state would lease prisoners for their free labour to companies 

Legal rights
Depending upon the era and the country  slaves sometimes had a limited set of legal rights  For example  in the Province of New York  people who deliberately killed slaves were punishable under a      statute              And  as already mentioned  certain legal rights attached to the nobi in Korea  to slaves in various African societies  and to black female slaves in the French colony of Louisiana  Giving slaves legal rights has sometimes been a matter of morality  but also sometimes a matter of self interest  For example  in ancient Athens  protecting slaves from mistreatment simultaneously protected people who might be mistaken for slaves  and giving slaves limited property rights incentivized slaves to work harder to get more property              In the southern United States prior to the extirpation of slavery in       a proslavery legal treatise reported that slaves accused of crimes typically had a legal right to counsel  freedom from double jeopardy  a right to trial by jury in graver cases  and the right to grand jury indictment  but they lacked many other rights such as white adults  ability to control their own lives

Slavery predates written records and has existed in many cultures             Slavery is rare among hunter gatherer populations because it requires economic surpluses and a substantial population density  Thus  although it has existed among unusually resource rich hunter gatherers  such as the American Indian peoples of the salmon rich rivers of the Pacific Northwest coast  slavery became widespread only with the invention of agriculture during the Neolithic Revolution about        years ago              Slavery was practiced in almost every ancient civilization             Such institutions included debt bondage  punishment for crime  the enslavement of prisoners of war  child abandonment  and the enslavement of slaves  offspring             

Africa
See also  Slavery in Africa
Slavery was widespread in Africa  which pursued both internal and external slave trade              In the Senegambia region  between      and       close to one third of the population was enslaved  In early Islamic states of the western Sahel  including Ghana  Mali  Segou  and Songhai  about a third of the population were enslaved             
In European courtly society  and European aristocracy  black African slaves and their children became visible in the late     s and     s  Starting with Frederick II  Holy Roman Emperor  black Africans were included in the retinue  In      an Ethiopian embassy reached Venice  In the     s black Africans were painted as court attendants in wall paintings that were displayed in Mantua and Ferrara  In the     s black Africans were included on the emblem of the Duke of Milan             

  th century slave market in Yemen             
During the trans Saharan slave trade  slaves from West Africa were transported across the Sahara desert to North Africa to be sold to Mediterranean and Middle eastern civilizations  During the Red Sea slave trade  slaves were transported from Africa across the Red Sea to the Arabian Peninsula  The Indian Ocean slave trade  sometimes known as the east African slave trade  was multi directional  Africans were sent as slaves to the Arabian Peninsula  to Indian Ocean islands  including Madagascar   to the Indian subcontinent  and later to the Americas  These traders captured Bantu peoples  Zanj  from the interior in present day Kenya  Mozambique and Tanzania and brought them to the coast                          There  the slaves gradually assimilated in rural areas  particularly on Unguja and Pemba islands             
Some historians assert that as many as         million people were sold into slavery on the coast of the Indian Ocean  the Middle East  and North Africa  and approximately        million African slaves were bought by Muslim slave traders and taken from Africa across the Red Sea  Indian Ocean  and Sahara Desert between      and                   The captives were sold throughout the Middle East  This trade accelerated as superior ships led to more trade and greater demand for labour on plantations in the region  Eventually  tens of thousands of captives were being taken every year                                      The Indian Ocean slave trade was multi directional and changed over time  To meet the demand for menial labour  Bantu slaves bought by east African slave traders from southeastern Africa were sold in cumulatively large numbers over the centuries to customers in Egypt  Arabia  the Persian Gulf  India  European colonies in the Far East  the Indian Ocean islands  Ethiopia and Somalia             
According to the Encyclopedia of African History   It is estimated that by the     s the largest slave population of the world  about   million people  was concentrated in the territories of the Sokoto Caliphate  The use of slave labour was extensive  especially in agriculture                           The Anti Slavery Society estimated there were        million slaves in Ethiopia in the early     s out of an estimated population of   to         million              
Slave labour in East Africa was drawn from the Zanj  Bantu peoples that lived along the East African coast                           The Zanj were for centuries shipped as slaves by Arab traders to all the countries bordering the Indian Ocean during the Indian Ocean slave trade  The Umayyad and Abbasid caliphs recruited many Zanj slaves as soldiers and  as early as      there were slave revolts of the Zanj against their Arab enslavers during their slavery in the Umayyad Caliphate in Iraq  The Zanj Rebellion  a series of uprisings that took place between     and     near Basra  also known as Basara   against the slavery in the Abbasid Caliphate situated in present day Iraq  is believed to have involved enslaved Zanj that had originally been captured from the African Great Lakes region and areas further south in East Africa               It grew to involve over         slaves and free men who were imported from across the Muslim empire and claimed over  tens of thousands of lives in lower Iraq               
The Zanj who were taken as slaves to the Middle East were often used in strenuous agricultural work               As the plantation economy boomed and the Arabs became richer  agriculture and other manual labour work was thought to be demeaning  The resulting labour shortage led to an increased slave market 

Slave market in Algiers      
In Algiers  the capital of Algeria  captured Christians and Europeans were forced into slavery  In about       there were as many as        Christian slaves in Algiers               By one estimate  raids by Barbary slave traders on coastal villages and ships extending from Italy to Iceland  enslaved an estimated   to           million Europeans between the   th and   th centuries                                         However  this estimate is the result of an extrapolation which assumes that the number of European slaves captured by Barbary pirates was constant for a     year period 

There are no records of how many men  women and children were enslaved  but it is possible to calculate roughly the number of fresh captives that would have been needed to keep populations steady and replace those slaves who died  escaped  were ransomed  or converted to Islam  On this basis it is thought that around       new slaves were needed annually to replenish numbers   about         captives over the century from      to       By extension  for the     years between      and       the figure could easily have been as high as                        
Davis  numbers have been refuted by other historians  such as David Earle  who cautions that true picture of Europeans slaves is clouded by the fact the corsairs also seized non Christian whites from eastern Europe               In addition  the number of slaves traded was hyperactive      clarification needed      with exaggerated estimates relying on peak years to calculate averages for entire centuries  or millennia  Hence  there were wide fluctuations year to year  particularly in the   th and   th centuries  given slave imports  and also given the fact that  prior to the     s  there are no consistent records  Middle East expert  John Wright  cautions that modern estimates are based on back calculations from human observation               Such observations  across the late   th and early   th century observers  account for around        European Christian slaves held throughout this period on the Barbary Coast  across Tripoli  Tunis  but mostly in Algiers  The majority were sailors  particularly those who were English   taken with their ships  but others were fishermen and coastal villagers  However  most of these captives were people from lands close to Africa  particularly Spain and Italy               This eventually led to the bombardment of Algiers by an Anglo Dutch fleet in

Under Omani Arabs  Zanzibar became East Africa s main slave port  with as many as        African slaves passing through every year during the   th century                            Some historians estimate that between    and         million African slaves crossed the Red Sea  Indian Ocean  and Sahara Desert from     to      AD                 failed verification                   Eduard R ppell described the losses of Sudanese slaves being transported on foot to Egypt   after the Daftardar bey s      campaign in the southern Nuba mountains  nearly        slaves were captured  However  through bad treatment  disease and desert travel barely       made it to Egypt                W A  Veenhoven wrote   The German doctor  Gustav Nachtigal  an eye witness  believed that for every slave who arrived at a market three or four died on the way          Keltie  The Partition of Africa  London        believes that for every slave the Arabs brought to the coast at least six died on the way or during the slavers  raid  Livingstone puts the figure as high as ten to one               
Systems of servitude and slavery were common in parts of Africa  as they were in much of the ancient world  In many African societies where slavery was prevalent  the slaves were not treated as chattel slaves and were given certain rights in a system similar to indentured servitude elsewhere in the world  The forms of slavery in Africa were closely related to kinship structures  In many African communities  where land could not be owned  enslavement of individuals was used as a means to increase the influence a person had and expand connections               This made slaves a permanent part of a master s lineage and the children of slaves could become closely connected with the larger family ties               Children of slaves born into families could be integrated into the master s kinship group and rise to prominent positions within society  even to the level of chief in some instances  However  stigma often remained attached and there could be strict separations between slave members of a kinship group and those related to the master               Slavery was practiced in many different forms  debt slavery  enslavement of war captives  military slavery  and criminal slavery were all practiced in various parts of Africa               Slavery for domestic and court purposes was widespread throughout Africa

When the Atlantic slave trade began  many of the local slave systems began supplying captives for chattel slave markets outside Africa  Although the Atlantic slave trade was not the only slave trade from Africa  it was the largest in volume and intensity  As Elikia M bokolo wrote in Le Monde diplomatique 

The African continent was bled of its human resources via all possible routes  Across the Sahara  through the Red Sea  from the Indian Ocean ports and across the Atlantic  At least ten centuries of slavery for the benefit of the Muslim countries  from the ninth to the nineteenth      Four million enslaved people exported via the Red Sea  another four million through the Swahili ports of the Indian Ocean  perhaps as many as nine million along the trans Saharan caravan route  and eleven to twenty million  depending on the author  across the Atlantic Ocean              
The trans Atlantic slave trade peaked in the late   th century  when the largest number of slaves were captured on raiding expeditions into the interior of West Africa 
These expeditions were typically carried out by African kingdoms  such as the Oyo Empire  Yoruba   the Ashanti Empire               the kingdom of Dahomey               and the Aro Confederacy               It is estimated that about    percent of slaves died during the voyage  with mortality rates considerably higher in Africa itself in the process of capturing and transporting indigenous peoples to the ships

Enslavement in the Americas existed before European arrival and was used for numerous reasons               Slavery in Mexico can be traced back to the Aztecs               Other Amerindians  such as the Inca of the Andes  the Tupinamb  of Brazil  the Creek of Georgia  and the Comanche of Texas  also practiced slavery            
Slavery in Canada was practiced by First Nations and by European settlers               Slave owning people of what became Canada were  for example  the fishing societies  such as the Yurok  that lived along the Pacific coast from Alaska to California               on what is sometimes described as the Pacific or Northern Northwest Coast  Some of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast  such as the Haida and Tlingit  were traditionally known as fierce warriors and slave traders  raiding as far as California  Slavery was hereditary  the slaves being prisoners of war and their descendants were slaves               Some nations in British Columbia continued to segregate and ostracize the descendants of slaves as late as the     s

Slavery in America remains a contentious issue and played a major role in the history and evolution of some countries  triggering a revolution  a civil war  and numerous rebellions 
The countries that controlled most of the transatlantic slave market in terms of number of slaves shipped were the UK  Portugal and France 

Slaves embarked to America from      until      by country
In order to establish itself as an American empire  Spain had to fight against the relatively powerful civilizations of the New World  The Spanish conquest of the indigenous peoples in the Americas included using the Natives as forced labour  The Spanish colonies were the first Europeans to use African slaves in the New World on islands such as Cuba and Hispaniola               It was argued by some contemporary writers to be intrinsically immoral                                         Bartolom  de las Casas  a   th century Dominican friar and Spanish historian  participated in campaigns in Cuba  at Bayamo and Camag ey  and was present at the massacre of Hatuey  his observation of that massacre led him to fight for a social movement away from the use of natives as slaves  Also  the alarming decline in the native population had spurred the first royal laws protecting the native population  The first African slaves arrived in Hispaniola in                    This era saw a growth in race based slavery               England played a prominent role in the Atlantic slave trade  The  slave triangle  was pioneered by Francis Drake and his associates  though English slave trading would not take off until the mid   th century 
Many whites who arrived in North America during the   th and   th centuries came under contract as indentured servants               The transformation from indentured servitude to slavery was a gradual process in Virginia  The earliest legal documentation of such a shift was in      where a black man  John Punch  was sentenced to lifetime slavery  forcing him to serve his master  Hugh Gwyn  for the remainder of his life  for attempting to run away  This case was significant because it established the disparity between his sentence as a black man and that of the two white indentured servants who escaped with him  one described as Dutch and one as a Scotchman   It is the first documented case of a black man sentenced to lifetime servitude and is considered one of the first legal cases to make a racial distinction between black and white indentured servants                           
After       planters started to ignore the expiration of indentured contracts and keep their servants as slaves for life  This was demonstrated by the      case Johnson v  Parker  where the court ruled that a black man  Anthony Johnson of Virginia  was granted ownership of another black man  John Casor  as the result of a civil case               This was the first instance of a judicial determination in the Thirteen Colonies holding that a person who had committed no crime could be held in servitude for life                           

Spanish colonial America
In       Hern n Cort s brought the first modern slave to Mexico               In the mid   th century  the Spanish New Laws  prohibited slavery of the indigenous people  including the Aztecs  A labour shortage resulted  This led to the African slaves being imported  as they were not susceptible to smallpox  In exchange  many Africans were afforded the opportunity to buy their freedom  while eventually others were granted their freedom by their masters               In Jamaica  the Spanish enslaved many of the Taino  some escaped  but most died from European diseases and overwork  The Spaniards also introduced the first African slaves              
Spain practically did not trade in slaves until      after the rebellions and independence of its American territories or viceroyalties  After the Napoleonic invasions  Spain had lost its industry and its American territories  except in Cuba and Puerto Rico  where the African slave trade to Cuba began on a massive scale from      onwards  It was started by French planters exiled from the French lost colony Saint Domingue  Haiti  who settled in the eastern part of Cuba 
In       the Spanish Crown led an effort to reform slavery  as the demand for slave labour in Cuba was growing  The Crown issued a decree  C digo Negro Espa ol  Spanish Black Code   that specified food and clothing provisions  put limits on the number of work hours  limited punishments  required religious instruction  and protected marriages  forbidding the sale of young children away from their mothers  The British made other changes to the institution of slavery in Cuba  However  planters often flouted the laws and protested against them  considering them a threat to their authority and an intrusion into their personal lives

In the early   th century  the majority of the labour in Barbados was provided by European indentured servants  mainly English  Irish and Scottish  with African and native American slaves providing little of the workforce  The introduction of sugar cane in      completely transformed society and the economy  Barbados eventually had one of the world s largest sugar industries               The workable sugar plantation required a large investment and a great deal of heavy labour  At first  Dutch traders supplied the equipment  financing  and African slaves  in addition to transporting most of the sugar to Europe  In       the population of Barbados was estimated at         of which about     were of African descent  with the remainder mainly of English descent  By       there were        free whites and        enslaved Africans  In Jamaica  although the African slave population in the     s and     s never exceeded         by      it had increased to over          The increased implementation of slave codes or black codes  which created differential treatment between Africans and the white workers and ruling planter class  In response to these codes  several slave rebellions were attempted or planned during this time  but none succeeded

The planters of the Dutch colony of Suriname relied heavily on African slaves to cultivate  harvest and process the commodity crops of coffee  cocoa  sugar cane and cotton plantations               The Netherlands abolished slavery in Suriname in      
Many slaves escaped the plantations  With the help of the native South Americans living in the adjoining rain forests  these runaway slaves established a new and unique culture in the interior that was highly successful in its own right  They were known collectively in English as Maroons  in French as N g Marrons  literally meaning  brown negroes   that is  pale skinned negroes    and in Dutch as Marrons  The Maroons gradually developed several independent tribes through a process of ethnogenesis  as they were made up of slaves from different African ethnicities  These tribes include the Saramaka  Paramaka  Ndyuka or Aukan  Kwinti  Aluku or Boni  and Matawai  The Maroons often raided plantations to recruit new members from the slaves and capture women  as well as to acquire weapons  food and supplies  They sometimes killed planters and their families in the raids               The colonists also mounted armed campaigns against the Maroons  who generally escaped through the rain forest  which they knew much better than did the colonists  To end hostilities  in the   th century the European colonial authorities signed several peace treaties with different tribes  They granted the Maroons sovereign status and trade rights in their inland territories  giving them autonomy

Slavery in Brazil began long before the first Portuguese settlement was established in       as members of one tribe would enslave captured members of another              
Later  Portuguese colonists were heavily dependent on indigenous labour during the initial phases of settlement to maintain the subsistence economy  and natives were often captured by expeditions called bandeiras  The importation of African slaves began midway through the   th century  but the enslavement of indigenous peoples continued well into the   th and   th centuries 
During the Atlantic slave trade era  Brazil imported more African slaves than any other country  Nearly        million slaves were brought from Africa to Brazil during the period from      to                    Until the early     s  most African slaves who arrived on Brazilian shores were forced to embark at West Central African ports  especially in Luanda  in present day Angola   Today  with the exception of Nigeria  the country with the largest population of people of African descent is Brazil              
Slave labour was the driving force behind the growth of the sugar economy in Brazil  and sugar was the primary export of the colony from      to       Gold and diamond deposits were discovered in Brazil in       which sparked an increase in the importation of African slaves to power this newly profitable market  Transportation systems were developed for the mining infrastructure  and population boomed from immigrants seeking to take part in gold and diamond mining  Demand for African slaves did not wane after the decline of the mining industry in the second half of the   th century  Cattle ranching and foodstuff production proliferated after the population growth  both of which relied heavily on slave labour           million slaves were imported to Brazil from Africa from      to       and the rise of coffee in the     s further enticed expansion of the slave trade 
Brazil was the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery  Forty percent of the total number of slaves brought to the Americas were sent to Brazil  For reference  the United States received    percent  Despite being abolished  there are still people working in slavery like conditions in Brazil in the   st century 

Haiti
Slavery in Haiti began at an unknown time with slavery being already practiced by the native populations when Christopher Columbus on the island in                     European colonists would go and institutionalize slavery on the island and turn it into a major business which was devastating to the native population               Following the indigenous Ta no s near decimation from forced labour  disease and war  the Spanish  under advisement of the Catholic priest Bartolom  de las Casas  and with the blessing of the Catholic church  who also wished to protect the indigenous people  began engaging in earnest in the use of African slaves      clarification needed      During the French colonial period beginning in       the economy of Haiti  then known as Saint Domingue  was based on slavery  and the practice there was regarded as the most brutal in the world

Following the Treaty of Ryswick of       Hispaniola was divided between France and Spain  France received the western third and subsequently named it Saint Domingue  To develop it into sugarcane plantations  the French imported thousands of slaves from Africa  Sugar was a lucrative commodity crop throughout the   th century  By       approximately        white colonists lived in Saint Domingue  The whites were vastly outnumbered by the tens of thousands of African slaves they had imported to work on their plantations  which were primarily devoted to the production of sugarcane  In the north of the island  slaves were able to retain many ties to African cultures  religion and language  these ties were continually being renewed by newly imported Africans  Blacks outnumbered whites by about ten to one 
The French enacted Code Noir   Black Code    prepared by Jean Baptiste Colbert and ratified by Louis XIV  had established rules on slave treatment and permissible freedoms  Saint Domingue has been described as one of the most brutally efficient slave colonies  one third of newly imported Africans died within a few years               Many slaves died from diseases such as smallpox and typhoid fever               They had birth rates around   percent  and there is evidence that some women aborted fetuses  or committed infanticide  rather than allow their children to live within the bonds of slavery                           
As in its Louisiana colony  the French colonial government allowed some rights to free people of color  the mixed race descendants of white male colonists and black female slaves  and later  mixed race women   Over time  many were released from slavery  They established a separate social class  White French Creole fathers frequently sent their mixed race sons to France for their education  Some men of color were admitted into the military  More of the free people of color lived in the south of the island  near Port au Prince  and many intermarried within their community  They frequently worked as artisans and tradesmen  and began to own some property  Some became slave holders  The free people of color petitioned the colonial government to expand their rights 
Slaves that made it to Haiti from the trans Atlantic journey and slaves born in Haiti were first documented in Haiti s archives and transferred to France s Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  As of          update       these records are in The National Archives of France  According to the      Census  Haiti s population consisted of nearly        whites         free coloureds and         slaves              
The Haitian Revolution of       the only successful slave revolt in human history  precipitated the end of slavery in all French colonies  which came in      

United States

Slavery in the United States was the legal institution of human chattel enslavement  primarily of Africans and African Americans  that existed in the United States of America in the   th and   th centuries  after it gained independence from the British and before the end of the American Civil War  Slavery had been practiced in British America from early colonial days and was legal in all Thirteen Colonies  at the time of the Declaration of Independence in       By the time of the American Revolution  the status of slave had been institutionalized as a racial caste associated with African ancestry               The United States became polarized over the issue of slavery  represented by the slave and free states divided by the Mason Dixon line  which separated free Pennsylvania from slave Maryland and Delaware 
Congress  during the Jefferson administration  prohibited the importation of slaves  effective       although smuggling  illegal importing  was not unusual               Domestic slave trading  however  continued at a rapid pace  driven by labour demands from the development of cotton plantations in the Deep South  Those states attempted to extend slavery into the new western territories to keep their share of political power in the nation  Such laws proposed to Congress to continue the spread of slavery into newly ratified states include the Kansas Nebraska Act 
The treatment of slaves in the United States varied widely depending on conditions  times  and places  The power relationships of slavery corrupted many whites who had authority over slaves  with children showing their own cruelty  Masters and overseers resorted to physical punishments to impose their wills  Slaves were punished by whipping  shackling  hanging  beating  burning  mutilation  branding and imprisonment  Punishment was most often meted out in response to disobedience or perceived infractions  but sometimes abuse was carried out to re assert the dominance of the master or overseer of the slave               Treatment was usually harsher on large plantations  which were often managed by overseers and owned by absentee slaveholders 
William Wells Brown  who escaped to freedom  reported that on one plantation  slave men were required to pick    pounds          kg  of cotton per day  while women were required to pick    pounds          kg  per day  if any slave failed in their quota  they were subject to whip lashes for each pound they were short  The whipping post stood next to the cotton scales               A New York man who attended a slave auction in the mid   th century reported that at least three quarters of the male slaves he saw at sale had scars on their backs from whipping               By contrast  small slave owning families had closer relationships between the owners and slaves  this sometimes resulted in a more humane environment but was not a given              
More than one million slaves were sold from the Upper South  which had a surplus of labour  and taken to the Deep South in a forced migration  splitting up many families  New communities of African American culture were developed in the Deep South  and the total slave population in the South eventually reached        million before liberation                            In the   th century  proponents of slavery often defended the institution as a  necessary evil   White people of that time feared that emancipation of black slaves would have more harmful social and economic consequences than the continuation of slavery  The French writer and traveler Alexis de Tocqueville  in Democracy in America         expressed opposition to slavery while observing its effects on American society  He felt that a multiracial society without slavery was untenable  as he believed that prejudice against black people increased as they were granted more rights  Others  like James Henry Hammond argued that slavery was a  positive good  stating   Such a class you must have  or you would not have that other class which leads progress  civilization  and refinement  
The Southern state governments wanted to keep a balance between the number of slave and free states to maintain a political balance of power in Congress  The new territories acquired from Britain  France  and Mexico were the subject of major political compromises  By       the newly rich cotton growing South was threatening to secede from the Union  and tensions continued to rise  Many white Southern Christians  including church ministers  attempted to justify their support for slavery as modified by Christian paternalism               The largest denominations  the Baptist  Methodist  and Presbyterian churches  split over the slavery issue into regional organizations of the North and South 

Slaves on a Virginia plantation  The Old Plantation  c              
When Abraham Lincoln won the      election on a platform of halting the expansion of slavery  according to the      U S  census  roughly         individuals  representing    of all U S  families  owned nearly           slaves               One third of Southern families owned slaves               The South was heavily invested in slavery  As such  upon Lincoln s election  seven states broke away to form the Confederate States of America  The first six states to secede held the greatest number of slaves in the South  Shortly after  over the issue of slavery  the United States erupted into an all out Civil War  with slavery legally ceasing as an institution following the war in December      
In       the United States ratified the   th Amendment to the United States Constitution  which banned slavery and involuntary servitude  except as punishment for a crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted   providing a legal basis for forced labor to continue in the country  This led to the system of convict leasing  which affected primarily African Americans  The Prison Policy Initiative  an American criminal justice think tank  cites the      US prison population as     million  and nearly all able bodied inmates work in some fashion  In Texas  Georgia  Alabama and Arkansas  prisoners are not paid at all for their work  In other states  prisoners are paid between       and       per hour  Federal Prison Industries paid inmates an average of       per hour in       Inmates who refuse to work may be indefinitely remanded into solitary confinement or have family visitation revoked  From      to      and again in      and in       some prisoners in the US refused to work  protesting for better pay  better conditions  and for the end of forced labor  Strike leaders were punished with indefinite solitary confinement  Forced prison labor occurs in both government run prisons and private prisons  CoreCivic and GEO Group constitute half the market share of private prisons  and they made a combined revenue of      billion in       The value of all labor by inmates in the United States is estimated to be in the billions  In California        incarcerated workers fought wildfires for only    per hour through the CDCR s Conservation Camp Program  which saves the state as much as      million a year

Slavery existed in ancient China as early as the Shang dynasty               Slavery was employed largely by governments as a means of maintaining a public labour force                             Until the Han dynasty  slaves were sometimes discriminated against but their legal status was guaranteed   As can be seen from the some historical records as  Duansheng  Marquis of Shouxiang  had his territory confiscated because he killed a female slave   Han dynasty records in DongGuan    Wang Mang s son Wang Huo murdered a slave  Wang Mang severely criticized him and forced him to commit suicide   Book of Han  Biography of Wang Mang   Murder against slaves was as taboo as murder against free people  and perpetrators were always severely punished  Han dynasty can be said to be very distinctive compared to other countries of the same period In most cases  lords were free to kill their slaves  in terms of slaves human rights 
After the Southern and Northern Dynasties   Due to years of poor harvests  the influx of foreign tribes  and the resulting wars   The number of slaves exploded  They became a class and were called  jianmin           zh       Chinese        The word literally means  inferior person    As stated in The commentary of Tang Code   Slaves and inferior people are legally equivalent to livestock products    They always had a low social status  and even if they were deliberately murdered  the perpetrators received only a year in prison  and were punished even when they reported the crimes of their lords                However  in the Later period of the dynasty  perhaps because the increase in the number of slaves slowed down again  the penalties for crimes against them became harsh again   For example  the famous contemporary female poet Yu Xuanji  she was publicly executed for murdering her own slave 
Many Han Chinese were enslaved in the process of the Mongol invasion of China proper               According to Japanese historians Sugiyama Masaaki        and Funada Yoshiyuki         Mongolian slaves were owned by Han Chinese during the Yuan dynasty                            Slavery has taken various forms throughout China s history  It was reportedly abolished as a legally recognized institution  including in a      law                           fully enacted in                    although the practice continued until at least                    Tang Chinese soldiers and pirates enslaved Koreans  Turks  Persians  Indonesians  and people from Inner Mongolia  central Asia  and northern India                            The greatest source of slaves came from southern tribes  including Thais and aboriginals from the southern provinces of Fujian  Guangdong  Guangxi  and Guizhou  Malays  Khmers  Indians  and  black skinned  peoples  who were either Austronesian Negritos of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands  or Africans  or both  were also purchased as slaves in the Tang dynasty              
In the   th century Qing dynasty  there was a hereditarily servile people called Booi Aha  Manchu      booi niyalma  Chinese transliteration         which is a Manchu word literally translated as  household person  and sometimes rendered as  nucai   The Manchu was establishing close personal and paternalist relationship between masters and their slaves  as Nurhachi said   The Master should love the slaves and eat the same food as him                However  booi aha  did not correspond exactly to the Chinese category of  bond servant slave   Chinese      instead  it was a relationship of personal dependency on a master which in theory guaranteed close personal relationships and equal treatment  even though many western scholars would directly translate  booi  as  bond servant   some of the  booi  even had their own servant                Chinese Muslim  Tungans  Sufis who were charged with practicing xiejiao  heterodox religion   were punished by exile to Xinjiang and being sold as a slave to other Muslims  such as the Sufi begs               Han Chinese who committed crimes such as those dealing with opium became slaves to the begs  this practice was administered by Qing law               Most Chinese in Altishahr were exile slaves to Turkestani Begs               While free Chinese merchants generally did not engage in relationships with East Turkestani women  some of the Chinese slaves belonging to begs  along with Green Standard soldiers  Bannermen  and Manchus  engaged in affairs with the East Turkestani women that were serious in nature

Slavery in Korea existed since before the Three Kingdoms of Korea period  in the first century BCE               Slavery has been described as  very important in medieval Korea  probably more important than in any other East Asian country  but by the   th century  population growth was making  it  unnecessary                Slavery went into decline around the   th century but came back in the late Goryeo period when Korea also experienced multiple slave rebellions               In the Joseon period of Korea  members of the slave class were known as nobi  The nobi were socially indistinct from freemen  i e   the middle and common classes  other than the ruling yangban class  and some possessed property rights  and legal and civil rights  Hence  some scholars argue that it is inappropriate to call them  slaves                while some scholars describe them as serfs                            The nobi population could fluctuate up to about one third of the total  but on average the nobi made up about     of the total population               In       the majority of government nobi were emancipated               and by       the nobi population stood at about     percent of the Korean population               During the Joseon period  the nobi population could fluctuate up to about one third of the population  but on average the nobi made up about     of the total population               The nobi system declined beginning in the   th century               Since the outset of the Joseon dynasty and especially beginning in the   th century  there was harsh criticism among prominent thinkers in Korea about the nobi system  Even within the Joseon government  there were indications of a shift in attitude toward the nobi               King Yeongjo implemented a policy of gradual emancipation in                    and he and his successor King Jeongjo made many proposals and developments that lessened the burden on nobi  which led to the emancipation of the vast majority of government nobi in                    In addition  population growth               numerous escaped slaves               growing commercialization of agriculture  and the rise of the independent small farmer class contributed to the decline in the number of nobi to about      of the total population by                    The hereditary nobi system was officially abolished around                                    and the rest of the nobi system was abolished with the Gabo Reform of                                 However  slavery did not completely disappear in Korea until       during Imperial Japanese rule  During the Imperial Japanese occupation of Korea around World War II  some Koreans were used in forced labour by the Imperial Japanese  in conditions which have been compared to slavery                            These included women forced into sexual slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army before and during World War II  known as  comfort women                            
After the Portuguese first made contact with Japan in       slave trade developed in which Portuguese purchased Japanese as slaves in Japan and sold them to various locations overseas  including Portugal  throughout the   th and   th centuries                            Many documents mention the slave trade along with protests against the enslavement of Japanese  Japanese slaves are believed to be the first of their nation to end up in Europe  and the Portuguese purchased numbers of Japanese slave girls to bring to Portugal for sexual purposes  as noted by the Church              in       Japanese slave women were even sold as concubines to Asian lascar and African crew members  along with their European counterparts serving on Portuguese ships trading in Japan  mentioned by Luis Cerqueira  a Portuguese Jesuit  in a      document               Japanese slaves were brought by the Portuguese to Macau  where they were enslaved to Portuguese or became slaves to other slaves                            Some Korean slaves were bought by the Portuguese and brought back to Portugal from Japan  where they had been among the tens of thousands of Korean prisoners of war transported to Japan during the Japanese invasions of Korea                                      Historians pointed out that at the same time Hideyoshi expressed his indignation and outrage at the Portuguese trade in Japanese slaves  he was engaging in a mass slave trade of Korean prisoners of war in Japan                           
Fillippo Sassetti saw some Chinese and Japanese slaves in Lisbon among the large slave community in       although most of the slaves were black                                                                  
The Portuguese also valued Oriental slaves more than the black Africans and the Moors for their rarity  Chinese slaves were more expensive than Moors and blacks and showed off the high status of the owner               The Portuguese attributed qualities like intelligence and industriousness to Chinese  Japanese and Indian slaves                            King Sebastian of Portugal feared rampant slavery was having a negative effect on Catholic proselytization  so he commanded that it be banned in                    Hideyoshi was so disgusted that his own Japanese people were being sold en masse into slavery on Kyushu  that he wrote a letter to Jesuit Vice Provincial Gaspar Coelho on July           to demand the Portuguese  Siamese  Thai   and Cambodians stop purchasing and enslaving Japanese and return Japanese slaves who ended up as far as India                                         Hideyoshi blamed the Portuguese and Jesuits for this slave trade and banned Christian proselytizing as a result                   self published source                   In       a law was passed by Portugal banning the selling and buying of Chinese and Japanese slaves

Slavery in India was widespread by the  th century BC  and perhaps even as far back as the Vedic period               Slavery intensified during the Muslim domination of northern India after the   th century               Slavery existed in Portuguese India after the   th century  The Dutch  too  largely dealt in Abyssian slaves  known in India as Habshis or Sheedes               Arakan Bengal  Malabar  and Coromandel remained the largest sources of forced labour until the     s 
Between      and       the Dutch exported on an average         slaves annually from the Arakan Bengal coast  During the first    years of Batavia s existence  Indian and Arakanese slaves provided the main labour force of the Dutch East India Company  Asian headquarters  An increase in Coromandel slaves occurred during a famine following the revolt of the Nayaka Indian rulers of South India  Tanjavur  Senji  and Madurai  against Bijapur overlordship        and the subsequent devastation of the Tanjavur countryside by the Bijapur army  Reportedly  more than         people were taken by the invading Deccani Muslim armies to Bijapur and Golconda  In             slaves were exported to Batavia  the overwhelming majority from southern Coromandel  Some slaves were also acquired further south at Tondi  Adirampatnam  and Kayalpatnam  Another increase in slaving took place between      and      from Tanjavur as a result of a series of successive Bijapuri raids  At Nagapatnam  Pulicat  and elsewhere  the company purchased              slaves  the bulk of whom were sent to Ceylon  while a small portion were exported to Batavia and Malacca  Finally  following a long drought in Madurai and southern Coromandel  in       which intensified the prolonged Madurai Maratha struggle over Tanjavur and punitive fiscal practices  thousands of people from Tanjavur  mostly children  were sold into slavery and exported by Asian traders from Nagapattinam to Aceh  Johor  and other slave markets 
In September           slaves were exported by the English from Fort St  George  Madras  And  in          when warfare once more ravaged South India  a total of       slaves were imported from Coromandel by private individuals into Ceylon                                                      The volume of the total Dutch Indian Ocean slave trade has been estimated to be about        of the Atlantic slave trade  slightly smaller than the trans Saharan slave trade  and one and a half to three times the size of the Swahili and Red Sea coast and the Dutch West India Company slave trades              
According to Sir Henry Bartle Frere  who sat on the Viceroy s Council   there were an estimated   or        million slaves in India in       About     of the population of Malabar were slaves  Slavery was legally abolished in the possessions of the East India Company by the Indian Slavery Act

Records of slavery in Ancient Greece begin with Mycenaean Greece  Classical Athens had the largest slave population  with as many as        in the  th and  th centuries BC               As the Roman Republic expanded outward  entire populations were enslaved  across Europe and the Mediterranean  Slaves were used for labour  as well as for amusement  e g   gladiators and sex slaves   This oppression by an elite minority eventually led to slave revolts  see Roman Servile Wars   the Third Servile War was led by Spartacus 
By the late Republican era  slavery had become an economic pillar of Roman wealth  as well as Roman society               It is estimated that     or more of the population of Ancient Rome was enslaved  although the actual percentage is debated by scholars and varied from region to region                            Slaves represented        of Italy s population               mostly war captives               especially from Gaul              and Epirus  Estimates of the number of slaves in the Roman Empire suggest that the majority were scattered throughout the provinces outside of Italy               Generally  slaves in Italy were indigenous Italians               Foreigners  including both slaves and freedmen  born outside of Italy were estimated to have peaked at    of the total in the capital  where their number was largest  Those from outside of Europe were predominantly of Greek descent  Jewish slaves never fully assimilated into Roman society  remaining an identifiable minority  These slaves  especially the foreigners  had higher death rates and lower birth rates than natives and were sometimes subjected to mass expulsions               The average recorded age at death for the slaves in Rome was seventeen and a half years       for males       for females

Slavery in early medieval Europe was so common that the Catholic Church repeatedly prohibited it  or at least the export of Christian slaves to non Christian lands  as for example at the Council of Koblenz        the Council of London         which aimed mainly at the sale of English slaves to Ireland               and the Council of Armagh         Serfdom  on the contrary  was widely accepted  In       Pope Nicholas V issued the papal bull Dum Diversas  granting the kings of Spain and Portugal the right to reduce any  Saracens  Muslims   pagans and any other unbelievers  to perpetual slavery  legitimizing the slave trade as a result of war               The approval of slavery under these conditions was reaffirmed and extended in his Romanus Pontifex bull of       Large scale trading in slaves was mainly confined to the South and East of early medieval Europe  the Byzantine Empire and the Muslim world were the destinations  while pagan Central and Eastern Europe  along with the Caucasus and Tartary  were important sources  Viking  Arab  Greek  and Radhanite Jewish merchants were all involved in the slave trade during the Early Middle Ages                                         The trade in European slaves reached a peak in the   th century following the Zanj Rebellion  which dampened the use of African slaves in the Arab world                           
In Britain  slavery continued to be practiced following the fall of Rome  while sections of  thelstan s and Hywel the Good s laws dealt with slaves in medieval England and medieval Wales respectively                            The trade particularly picked up after the Viking invasions  with major markets at Chester              and Bristol              supplied by Danish  Mercian  and Welsh raiding of one another s borderlands  At the time of the Domesday Book  nearly     of the English population were slaves               William the Conqueror introduced a law preventing the sale of slaves overseas               According to historian John Gillingham  by      slavery in the British Isles was non existent               Slavery had never been authorized by statute within England and Wales  and in       in the case Somerset v Stewart  Lord Mansfield declared that it was also unsupported within England by the common law  The slave trade was abolished by the Slave Trade Act       although slavery remained legal in possessions outside Europe until the passage of the Slavery Abolition Act      and the Indian Slavery Act                     However  when England began to have colonies in the Americas  and particularly from the     s  African slaves began to make their appearance in England and remained a presence until the eighteenth century  In Scotland  slaves continued to be sold as chattels until late in the eighteenth century  on the second May       an advertisement appeared in the Edinburgh Evening Courant  announcing that a stolen slave had been found  who would be sold to pay expenses  unless claimed within two weeks                For nearly two hundred years in the history of coal mining in Scotland  miners were bonded to their  maisters  by a      Act  Anent Coalyers and Salters   The Colliers and Salters  Scotland  Act      stated that  many colliers and salters are in a state of slavery and bondage  and announced emancipation  those starting work after July          would not become slaves  while those already in a state of slavery could  after   or    years depending on their age  apply for a decree of the Sheriff s Court granting their freedom  Few could afford this  until a further law in      established their freedom and made this slavery and bondage illegal

The Byzantine Ottoman wars and the Ottoman wars in Europe brought large numbers of slaves into the Islamic world               To staff its bureaucracy  the Ottoman Empire established a janissary system which seized hundreds of thousands of Christian boys through the dev irme system  They were well cared for but were legally slaves owned by the government and were not allowed to marry  They were never bought or sold  The empire gave them significant administrative and military roles  The system began about       there were         janissaries in       when the system ended               After the Battle of Lepanto         Christian galley slaves were recaptured and freed from the Ottoman fleet               Eastern Europe suffered a series of Tatar invasions  the goal of which was to loot and capture slaves for selling them to Ottomans as jasyr               Seventy five Crimean Tatar raids were recorded into Poland Lithuania between      and

Medieval Spain and Portugal were the scene of almost constant Muslim invasion of the predominantly Christian area  Periodic raiding expeditions were sent from Al Andalus to ravage the Iberian Christian kingdoms  bringing back booty and slaves  In a raid against Lisbon in       for example  the Almohad caliph Yaqub al Mansur took       female and child captives  while his governor of C rdoba  in a subsequent attack upon Silves  Portugal  in       took       Christian slaves               From the   th to the   th century  North African Barbary Pirates engaged in raids on European coastal towns to capture Christian slaves to sell at slave markets in places such as Algeria and Morocco              
The maritime town of Lagos was the first slave market created in Portugal  one of the earliest colonizers of the Americas  for the sale of imported African slaves        the Mercado de Escravos  opened in                                 In       the first slaves were brought to Portugal from northern Mauritania               By       black African slaves made up     of the population of Lisbon                            In the second half of the   th century  the Crown gave up the monopoly on slave trade  and the focus of European trade in African slaves shifted from import to Europe to slave transports directly to tropical colonies in the Americas        especially Brazil               In the   th century one third of the slaves were resold to the African market in exchange of gold              

Until the late   th century  the Crimean Khanate  a Muslim Tatar state  maintained a massive slave trade with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East               The slaves were captured in southern Russia  Poland Lithuania  Moldavia  Wallachia  and Circassia by Tatar horsemen              and sold in the Crimean port of Kaffa               About        million mostly Christian slaves were exported over the   th and   th centuries              until the Crimean Khanate was destroyed by the Russian Empire in                    Crimean Tatar raiders enslaved more than   million Eastern Europeans              
In Kievan Rus and Muscovy  slaves were usually classified as kholops  According to David P  Forsythe   In      up to three quarters of Muscovy s peasants  or    to    million people  were serfs whose material lives were barely distinguishable from slaves  Perhaps another     million were formally enslaved  with Russian slaves serving Russian masters                Slavery remained a major institution in Russia until       when Peter the Great converted the household slaves into house serfs  Russian agricultural slaves were formally converted into serfs earlier in                    Slavery in Poland was forbidden in the   th century  in Lithuania  slavery was formally abolished in       they were replaced by the second serfdom

During the Second World War  Nazi Germany effectively enslaved about    million people  both those considered undesirable and citizens of conquered countries  with the avowed intention of treating these Untermenschen  sub humans  as a permanent slave class of inferior beings who could be worked until they died  and who possessed neither the rights nor the legal status of members of the Aryan race              
Besides Jews  the harshest deportation and forced labour policies were applied to the populations of Poland               Belarus  Ukraine  and Russia  By the end of the war  half of Belarus  population had been killed or deported

Workers being forced to haul rocks up a hill in a Gulag
Between      and       the Soviet Union created a system of  according to Anne Applebaum and the  perspective of the Kremlin   slave labor camps called the Gulag  Russian         romanized       GULag               
Prisoners in these camps were worked to death by a combination of extreme production quotas  physical and psychological brutality  hunger  lack of medical care  and the harsh environment  Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn  who survived eight years of Gulag incarceration  provided firsthand testimony about the camps with the publication of The Gulag Archipelago  after which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature                            Fatality rate was as high as     during the first months in many camps  Hundreds of thousands of people  possibly millions  died as a direct result of forced labour under the Soviets              
Golfo Alexopoulos suggests comparing labor in the Gulag with  other forms of slave labor  and notes its  violence of human exploitation  in Illness and Inhumanity in Stalin s Gulag              


Stalin s Gulag was  in many ways  less a concentration camp than a forced labor camp and less a prison system than a system of slavery  The image of the slave appears often in Gulag memoir literature  As Varlam Shalamov wrote   Hungry and exhausted  we leaned into a horse collar  raising blood blisters on our chests and pulling a stone filled cart up the slanted mine floor  The collar was the same device used long ago by the ancient Egyptians   Thoughtful and rigorous historical comparisons of Soviet forced labor and other forms of slave labor would be worthy of scholarly attention  in my view  For as in the case of global slavery  the Gulag found legitimacy in an elaborate narrative of difference that involved the presumption of dangerousness and guilt  This ideology of difference and the violence of human exploitation have left lasting legacies in contemporary Russia 


Historian Anne Applebaum writes in the introduction of her book that the word GULAG has come to represent  the system of Soviet slave labor itself  in all its forms and varieties               


The word  GULAG  is an acronym for Glavnoe Upravlenie Lagerei  or Main Camp Administration  the institution which ran the Soviet camps  But over time  the word has also come to signify the system of Soviet slave labor itself  in all its forms and varieties  labor camps  punishment camps  criminal and political camps  women s camps  children s camps  transit camps  Even more broadly   Gulag  has come to mean the Soviet repressive system itself  the set of procedures that Alexander Solzhenitsyn once called  our meat grinder   the arrests  the interrogations  the transport in unheated cattle cars  the forced labor  the destruction of families  the years spent in exile  the early and unnecessary deaths 

Applebaum s introduction has been criticized by Gulag researcher Wilson Bell               stating that her book  is  aside from the introduction  a well done overview of the Gulag  but it did not offer an interpretative framework much beyond Solzhenitsyn s paradigms

In the earliest known records  slavery is treated as an established institution  The Code of Hammurabi  c                  BC   for example  prescribed death for anyone who helped a slave escape or who sheltered a fugitive               The Bible mentions slavery as an established institution             Slavery existed in Pharaonic Egypt  but studying it is complicated by terminology used by the Egyptians to refer to different classes of servitude over the course of history  Interpretation of the textual evidence of classes of slaves in ancient Egypt has been difficult to differentiate by word usage alone                            The three apparent types of enslavement in ancient Egypt were chattel slavery  bonded labour  and forced labour                                        
Historically  slaves in the Arab World came from many different regions  including Sub Saharan Africa  mainly Zanj                the Caucasus  mainly Circassians                Central Asia  mainly Tartars   and Central and Eastern Europe  mainly Slavs Saqaliba                
These slaves were trafficked to the Arab world from Africa via the Trans Saharan slave trade  the Baqt treaty  the Red Sea slave trade and the Indian Ocean slave trade  from Asia via the Bukhara slave trade  and from Europe via the Prague slave trade  the Venetian slave trade and the Barbary slave trade  respectively

Eastern European slaves were provided to the Ottoman Empire via the Crimean slave trade by Tatar raids on Slavic villages              but also by conquest and the suppression of rebellions  in the aftermath of which entire populations were sometimes enslaved and sold across the Empire  reducing the risk of future rebellion 
The Ottomans also purchased slaves from traders who brought slaves into the Empire from Europe and Africa  It has been estimated that some         slaves   mainly Circassians   were imported into the Ottoman Empire between      and

Ottoman anti slavery laws where not enforced in the late   th century  particularly not in Hejaz  the first attempt to ban the Red Sea slave trade in      resulted in a rebellion in the Hejaz Province  which resulted in Hejaz being exempted from the ban               The Anglo Ottoman Convention of      formally banned the Red Sea slave trade  but it was not enforced in the Ottoman Provinces in the Arabian Peninsula               In the late   th century  the Sultan of Morocco stated to Western diplomats that it was impossible for him to ban slavery because such a ban would not be enforceable  but the British asked him to ensure that the slave trade in Morocco would at least be handled discreet and away from the eyes of foreign witnesses              
Chattel slavery lasted in most of the Middle East until the   th century  The Red Sea slave trade still provided enslaved people from Africa to the Arabian Peninsula after World War II  As recently as the     s  Saudi Arabia s slave population was estimated at                       Along with Yemen  the Saudis abolished slavery in

Economics
While American slaves in      were sold for around          in inflation adjusted dollars   a slave nowadays can be bought for just      making replacement more economical than providing long term care               Slavery is a multibillion dollar industry with estimates of up to          billion generated annually

Americas
The Spanish colonization of the Americas sparked a discussion about the right to enslave Native Americans  A prominent critic of slavery in the Spanish New World colonies was the Spanish missionary and bishop  Bartolom  de las Casas  who was the first to document the European maltreatment of and cruelty towards American natives              
In the United States  all of the northern states had abolished slavery by       with New Jersey being the last to act               Abolitionist pressure produced a series of small steps towards emancipation  After the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves went into effect on January          the importation of slaves into the United States was prohibited               but not the internal slave trade  nor involvement in the international slave trade externally  Legal slavery persisted outside the northern states  most of those slaves already in the U S  were legally emancipated only in       Many American abolitionists took an active role in opposing slavery by supporting the Underground Railroad  Violent clashes between anti slavery and pro slavery Americans included Bleeding Kansas  a series of political and armed disputes in           as to whether Kansas would join the United States as a slave or free state  By       the total number of slaves reached almost four million  and the American Civil War  beginning in       led to the end of slavery in the United States               In       Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation  which freed slaves held in the Confederate States  the   th Amendment to the U S  Constitution prohibited most forms of slavery throughout the country 
Many of the freed slaves became sharecroppers and indentured servants  In this manner  some became tied to the very parcel of land into which they had been born a slave having little freedom or economic opportunity because of Jim Crow laws which perpetuated discrimination  limited education  promoted persecution without due process and resulted in continued poverty  Fear of reprisals such as unjust incarcerations and lynchings deterred upward mobility further

Europe
France abolished slavery in      during the Revolution               but it was restored in      under Napoleon               It has been asserted that  before the Revolution  slavery was illegal in metropolitan France  as opposed to its colonies                but this has been refuted              
One of the most significant milestones in the campaign to abolish slavery throughout the world occurred in England in       with British Judge Lord Mansfield  whose opinion in Somersett s Case was widely taken to have held that slavery was illegal in England  This judgement also laid down the principle that slavery contracted in other jurisdictions could not be enforced in England               The last person to be deemed a slave in a British court was Bell  Belinda  who was transported to the Americas in      as a  slave for life  by a Perth court              
Sons of Africa was a late   th century British group that campaigned to end slavery  Its members were Africans in London  freed slaves who included Ottobah Cugoano  Olaudah Equiano and other leading members of London s black community  It was closely connected to the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade  a non denominational group founded in       whose members included Thomas Clarkson  British Member of Parliament William Wilberforce led the anti slavery movement in the United Kingdom  although the groundwork was an anti slavery essay by Clarkson  Wilberforce was urged by his close friend  Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger  to make the issue his own and was also given support by reformed Evangelical John Newton  The Slave Trade Act was passed by the British Parliament on March           making the slave trade illegal throughout the British Empire               Wilberforce also campaigned for abolition of slavery in the British Empire  which he lived to see in the Slavery Abolition Act      
After the      act abolishing the slave trade was passed  these campaigners switched to encouraging other countries to follow suit  notably France and the British colonies  Between      and       the British West Africa Squadron seized approximately       slave ships and freed         Africans who were aboard               Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade  for example against  the usurping King of Lagos   deposed in       Anti slavery treaties were signed with over    African rulers              

Worldwide
In       the world s oldest international human rights organization  Anti Slavery International  was formed in Britain by Joseph Sturge  which campaigned to outlaw slavery in other countries               There were celebrations in      to commemorate the    th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade in the United Kingdom through the work of the British Anti Slavery Society 
In the     s  David Livingstone s reports of atrocities within the Arab slave trade in Africa stirred up the interest of the British public  reviving the flagging abolitionist movement  The Royal Navy throughout the     s attempted to suppress  this abominable Eastern trade   at Zanzibar in particular  In       the French abolished indigenous slavery in most of French West Africa              
On December           the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  which declared freedom from slavery is an internationally recognized human right  Article   of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states

Apologies
On May           the National Assembly of France passed the Taubira law  recognizing slavery as a crime against humanity  Apologies on behalf of African nations  for their role in trading their countrymen into slavery  remain an open issue since slavery was practiced in Africa even before the first Europeans arrived and the Atlantic slave trade was performed with a high degree of involvement of several African societies  The black slave market was supplied by well established slave trade networks controlled by local African societies and individuals              

There is adequate evidence citing case after case of African control of segments of the trade  Several African nations such as the Calabar and other southern parts of Nigeria had economies depended solely on the trade  African peoples such as the Imbangala of Angola and the Nyamwezi of Tanzania would serve as middlemen or roving bands warring with other African nations to capture Africans for Europeans              
Several historians have made important contributions to the global understanding of the African side of the Atlantic slave trade  By arguing that African merchants determined the assemblage of trade goods accepted in exchange for slaves  many historians argue for African agency and ultimately a shared responsibility for the slave trade              
In       President Mathieu K r kou of Benin issued a national apology for the central role Africans played in the Atlantic slave trade               Luc Gnacadja  minister of environment and housing for Benin  later said   The slave trade is a shame  and we do repent for it                Researchers estimate that        million slaves were exported out of the Slave Coast bordering the Bight of Benin               President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana also apologized for his country s involvement in the slave trade              
The issue of an apology is linked to reparations for slavery and is still being pursued by entities across the world  For example  the Jamaican Reparations Movement approved its declaration and action plan  In       British Prime Minister Tony Blair made a formal apology for Great Britain s involvement in slavery              
On February           the Commonwealth of Virginia resolved to  profoundly regret  and apologize for its role in the institution of slavery  Unique and the first of its kind in the U S   the apology was unanimously passed in both Houses as Virginia approached the    th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown              
On August           Mayor of London Ken Livingstone issued a public apology for London s role in Atlantic slave trade  which took place at an event commemorating the    th anniversary of the British slave trade s abolition  In his speech  Livingstone described the slave trade as  the racial murder of not just those who were transported but generations of enslaved African men  women and children  To justify this murder and torture black people had to be declared inferior or not human    We live with the consequences today                City officials in Liverpool  which was a large slave trading port  apologized in                   
On July           the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution apologizing for American slavery and subsequent discriminatory laws               In June       the U S  Senate passed a resolution apologizing to African Americans for the  fundamental injustice  cruelty  brutality  and inhumanity of slavery   The news was welcomed by President Barack Obama  the nation s first president of African descent               Some of President Obama s ancestors may have been slave owners              
In       Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi apologized for Arab involvement in the slave trade  saying   I regret the behavior of the Arabs    They brought African children to North Africa  they made them slaves  they sold them like animals  and they took them as slaves and traded them in a shameful way               

Reparations
Main article  Reparations for slavery
There have been movements to achieve reparations for those formerly held as slaves or for their descendants  Claims for reparations for being held in slavery are handled as a civil law matter in almost every country  This is often decried as a serious problem  since former slaves  relatives lack of money means they often have limited access to a potentially expensive and futile legal process  Mandatory systems of fines and reparations paid to an as yet undetermined group of claimants from fines  paid by unspecified parties  and collected by authorities have been proposed by advocates to alleviate this  civil court problem   Since in almost all cases there are no living ex slaves or living ex slave owners these movements have gained little traction  In nearly all cases the judicial system has ruled that the statute of limitations on these possible claims has long since expired 
In June       The Brattle Group presented a report at an event at the University of the West Indies in which reparations were estimated  for harms both during and after the period of transatlantic chattel slavery  at over     trillion dollars

Poster for Spartacus
Film has been the most influential medium in the presentation of the history of slavery to the general public around the world               The American film industry has had a complex relationship with slavery and until recent decades often avoided the topic  Films such as The Birth of a Nation                     and Gone with the Wind        became controversial because they gave a favourable depiction  In      The Santa Fe Trail gave a liberal but ambiguous interpretation of John Brown s attacks on slavery              
The Civil Rights Movement in the     s made defiant slaves into heroes               The question of slavery in American memory necessarily involves its depictions in feature films              
Most Hollywood films used American settings  although Spartacus         dealt with an actual revolt in the Roman Empire known as the Third Servile War  The revolt failed  and all the rebels were executed  but their spirit lived on according to the film               Spartacus stays surprisingly close to the historical record              
The Last Supper  La  ltima cena in Spanish  was a      film directed by Cuban Tom s Guti rrez Alea about the teaching of Christianity to slaves in Cuba  and emphasizes the role of ritual and revolt  Burn  takes place on the imaginary Portuguese island of Queimada  where the locals speak Spanish  and it merges historical events that took place in Brazil  Cuba  Santo Domingo  Jamaica  and elsewhere 
Historians agree that films have largely shaped historical memories  but they debate issues of accuracy  plausibility  moralism  sensationalism  how facts are stretched in search of broader truths  and suitability for the classroom                            Berlin argues that critics complain if the treatment emphasizes historical brutality  or if it glosses over the harshness to highlight the emotional impact of slavery
