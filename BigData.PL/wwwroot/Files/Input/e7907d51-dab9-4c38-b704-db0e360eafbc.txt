EleutherAI     lu   r              is a grass roots non profit artificial intelligence  AI  research group  The group  considered an open source version of OpenAI             was formed in a Discord server in July      by Connor Leahy  Sid Black  and Leo Gao            to organize a replication of GPT    In early       it formally incorporated as the EleutherAI Institute  a non profit research institute            


History edit 
EleutherAI began as a Discord server on July          under the tentative name  LibreAI  before rebranding to  EleutherAI  later that month             in reference to eleutheria  the Greek word for liberty             Its founding members are Connor Leahy  Len Gao  and Sid Black  They co wrote the code for Eleuther to serve as a collection of open source AI research  creating a machine learning model similar to GPT              
On December           EleutherAI released The Pile  a curated dataset of diverse text for training large language models             While the paper referenced the existence of the GPT Neo models  the models themselves were not released until March                      According to a retrospective written several months later  the authors did not anticipate that  people would care so much about our  small models               On June          EleutherAI followed this up with GPT J  B  a six billion parameter language model that was again the largest open source GPT   like model in the world              These language models were released under the Apache     free software license and are considered to have  fueled an entirely new wave of startups             
While EleutherAI initially turned down funding offers  preferring to use Google s TPU Research Cloud Program to source their compute              by early      they had accepted funding from CoreWeave  a small cloud computing company  and SpellML  a cloud infrastructure company  in the form of access to powerful GPU clusters that are necessary for large scale machine learning research  On Feb           they released GPT NeoX   B  a model similar to their prior work but scaled up thanks to the resources CoreWeave provided             
In       many EleutherAI members participated in the BigScience Research Workshop  working on projects including multitask finetuning                          training BLOOM              and designing evaluation libraries              Engineers at EleutherAI  Stability AI  and NVIDIA joined forces with biologists led by Columbia University and Harvard University            
to train OpenFold  an open source replication of DeepMind s AlphaFold              
In early       EleutherAI incorporated as a non profit research institute run by Stella Biderman  Curtis Huebner  and Shivanshu Purohit                         This announcement came with the statement that EleutherAI s shift of focus away from training larger language models was part of a deliberate push towards doing work in interpretability  alignment  and scientific research              While EleutherAI is still committed to promoting access to AI technologies  they feel that  there is substantially more interest in training and releasing LLMs than there once was   enabling them to focus on other projects             
In July       an investigation by Proof news found that EleutherAI s The Pile dataset includes subtitles from over         YouTube videos across more than        channels  The findings drew criticism and accusations of theft from YouTubers and others who had their work published on the platform                          In       Stella Biderman served as executive director  Aviya Skowron served as head of policy and ethics  Nora Belrose served as head of interpretability  and Quentin Anthony was head of HPC

According to their website  EleutherAI is a  decentralized grassroots collective of volunteer researchers  engineers  and developers focused on AI alignment  scaling  and open source AI research               While they do not sell any of their technologies as products  they publish the results of their research in academic venues  write blog posts detailing their ideas and methodologies  and provide trained models for anyone to use for free      citation needed     

The Pile edit 
Main article  The Pile  dataset 
The Pile is an     GB dataset designed for training large language models  It was originally developed to train EleutherAI s GPT Neo models but has become widely used to train other models  including Microsoft s Megatron Turing Natural Language Generation                          Meta AI s Open
Pre trained Transformers              LLaMA              and Galactica              Stanford University s BioMedLM    B              the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence s 
Chinese Transformer XL              and Yandex s YaLM    B              Compared to other datasets  the Pile s main distinguishing features are that it is a curated selection of data chosen by researchers at EleutherAI to contain information they thought language models should learn and that it is the only such dataset that is thoroughly documented by the researchers who developed it             

GPT models edit 
EleutherAI s most prominent research relates to its work to train open source large language models inspired by OpenAI s GPT                EleutherAI s  GPT Neo  model series has released     million      billion      billion    billion  and    billion parameter models 

GPT Neo     M     B     B               released in March       it was the largest open source GPT   style language model in the world at the time of release 
GPT J   B               released in March       it was the largest open source GPT   style language model in the world at the time of release             
GPT NeoX    B               released in February       it was the largest open source language model in the world at the time of release 
Pythia    B               While prior models focused on scaling larger to close the gap with closed sourced models like GPT    the Pythia model suite goes in another direction  The Pythia suite was designed to facilitate scientific research on the capabilities of and learning processes in large language models              Featuring     partially trained model checkpoints  fully public training data  and the ability to reproduce the exact training order  Pythia enables research on verifiable training              social biases              memorization              and more             
VQGAN CLIP edit

Following the release of DALL E by OpenAI in January       EleutherAI started working on text to image synthesis models  When OpenAI did not release DALL E publicly  EleutherAI s Katherine Crowson and digital artist Ryan Murdock developed a technique for using CLIP  another model developed by OpenAI  to convert regular image generation models into text to image synthesis ones                                                  Building on ideas dating back to Google s DeepDream              they found their first major success combining CLIP with another publicly available model called VQGAN and the resulting model is called VQGAN CLIP              Crowson released the technology by tweeting notebooks demonstrating the technique that people could run for free without any special equipment                                      This work was credited by Stability AI CEO Emad Mostaque as motivating the founding of Stability AI             

Public reception edit 
Praise edit 
EleutherAI s work to democratize GPT   won the UNESCO Netexplo Global Innovation Award in                   InfoWorld s Best of Open Source Software Award in                  and                   was nominated for VentureBeat s AI Innovation Award in                  
Gary Marcus  a cognitive scientist and noted critic of deep learning companies such as OpenAI and DeepMind              has repeatedly                         praised EleutherAI s dedication to open source and transparent research 
Maximilian Gahntz  a senior policy researcher at the Mozilla Foundation  applauded EleutherAI s efforts to give more researchers the ability to audit and assess AI technology   If models are open and if data sets are open  that ll enable much more of the critical research that s pointed out many of the flaws and harms associated with generative AI and that s often far too difficult to conduct              

Criticism edit 
Technology journalist Kyle Wiggers has raised concerns about whether EleutherAI is as independent as it claims  or  whether the involvement of commercially motivated ventures like Stability AI and Hugging Face both of which are backed by substantial venture capital might influence EleutherAI s research
