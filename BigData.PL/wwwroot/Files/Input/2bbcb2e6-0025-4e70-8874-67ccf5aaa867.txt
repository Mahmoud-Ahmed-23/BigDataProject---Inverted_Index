Multidisciplinary endeavour
Not to be confused with Creative computing

Computational creativity  also known as artificial creativity  mechanical creativity  creative computing or creative computation  is a multidisciplinary endeavour that is located at the intersection of the fields of artificial intelligence  cognitive psychology  philosophy  and the arts  e g   computational art as part of computational culture             
Is the application of computer systems to emulate human like creative processes  facilitating the generation of artistic and design outputs that mimic innovation and originality 
The goal of computational creativity is to model  simulate or replicate creativity using a computer  to achieve one of several ends            

To construct a program or computer capable of human level creativity 
To better understand human creativity and to formulate an algorithmic perspective on creative behavior in humans 
To design programs that can enhance human creativity without necessarily being creative themselves 
The field of computational creativity concerns itself with theoretical and practical issues in the study of creativity  Theoretical work on the nature and proper definition of creativity is performed in parallel with practical work on the implementation of systems that exhibit creativity  with one strand of work informing the other 
The applied form of computational creativity is known as media synthesis 


Theoretical issues edit 
Theoretical approaches concern the essence of creativity  Especially  under what circumstances it is possible to call the model a  creative  if eminent creativity is about rule breaking or the disavowal of convention  This is a variant of Ada Lovelace s objection to machine intelligence  as recapitulated by modern theorists such as Teresa Amabile             If a machine can do only what it was programmed to do  how can its behavior ever be called creative 
Indeed  not all computer theorists would agree with the premise that computers can only do what they are programmed to do            a key point in favor of computational creativity 

Defining creativity in Computational terms edit 
Because no single perspective or definition seems to offer a complete picture of creativity  the AI researchers Newell  Shaw and Simon            developed the combination of novelty and usefulness into the cornerstone of a multi pronged view of creativity  one that uses the following four criteria to categorize a given answer or solution as creative 

The answer is novel and useful  either for the individual or for society 
The answer demands that we reject ideas we had previously accepted
The answer results from intense motivation and persistence
The answer comes from clarifying a problem that was originally vague
Margaret Boden focused on the first two of these criteria  arguing instead that creativity  at least when asking whether computers could be creative  should be defined as  the ability to come up with ideas or artifacts that are new  surprising  and valuable             
Mihali Csikszentmihalyi argued that creativity had to be considered instead in a social context  and his DIFI  Domain Individual Field Interaction  framework has since strongly influenced the field             In DIFI  an individual produces works whose novelty and value are assessed by the field other people in society providing feedback and ultimately adding the work  now deemed creative  to the domain of societal works from which an individual might be later influenced 
Whereas the above reflects a top down approach to computational creativity  an alternative thread has developed among bottom up computational psychologists involved in artificial neural network research  During the late     s and early     s  for example  such generative neural systems were driven by genetic algorithms             Experiments involving recurrent nets            were successful in hybridizing simple musical melodies and predicting listener expectations 

Machine learning for Computational creativity edit

While traditional computational approaches to creativity rely on the explicit formulation of prescriptions by developers and a certain degree of randomness in computer programs  machine learning methods allow computer programs to learn on heuristics from input data enabling creative capacities within the computer programs              Especially  deep artificial neural networks allow to learn patterns from input data that allow for the non linear generation of creative artefacts  Before       artificial neural networks have been used to model certain aspects of creativity  Peter Todd        first trained a neural network to reproduce musical melodies from a training set of musical pieces  Then he used a change algorithm to modify the network s input parameters  The network was able to randomly generate new music in a highly uncontrolled manner                                     In       Todd             extended this work  using the so called distal teacher approach that had been developed by Paul Munro              Paul Werbos              D  Nguyen and Bernard Widrow              Michael I  Jordan and David Rumelhart              In the new approach  there are two neural networks  one of which is supplying training patterns to another  
In later efforts by Todd  a composer would select a set of melodies that define the melody space  position them on a   d plane with a mouse based graphic interface  and train a connectionist network to produce those melodies  and listen to the new  interpolated  melodies that the network generates corresponding to intermediate points in the   d plane 

Key concepts from literature edit 
Some high level and philosophical themes recur throughout the field of computational creativity  for example as follows 

Important categories of creativity edit 
Margaret Boden                        refers to creativity that is novel merely to the agent that produces it as  P creativity   or  psychological creativity    and refers to creativity that is recognized as novel by society at large as  H creativity   or  historical creativity   

Exploratory and transformational creativity edit 
Boden also distinguishes between the creativity that arises from an exploration within an established conceptual space  and the creativity that arises from a deliberate transformation or transcendence of this space  She labels the former as exploratory creativity and the latter as transformational creativity  seeing the latter as a form of creativity far more radical  challenging  and rarer than the former  Following the criteria from Newell and Simon elaborated above  we can see that both forms of creativity should produce results that are appreciably novel and useful  criterion     but exploratory creativity is more likely to arise from a thorough and persistent search of a well understood space  criterion       while transformational creativity should involve the rejection of some of the constraints that define this space  criterion    or some of the assumptions that define the problem itself  criterion     Boden s insights have guided work in computational creativity at a very general level  providing more an inspirational touchstone for development work than a technical framework of algorithmic substance  However  Boden s insights are also the subject of formalization  most notably in the work by Geraint Wiggins             

Generation and evaluation edit 
The criterion that creative products should be novel and useful means that creative computational systems are typically structured into two phases  generation and evaluation  In the first phase  novel  to the system itself  thus P Creative  constructs are generated  unoriginal constructs that are already known to the system are filtered at this stage  This body of potentially creative constructs is then evaluated  to determine which are meaningful and useful and which are not  This two phase structure conforms to the Geneplore model of Finke  Ward and Smith              which is a psychological model of creative generation based on empirical observation of human creativity 

Co creation edit 
While much of computational creativity research focuses on independent and automatic machine based creativity generation  many researchers are inclined towards a collaboration approach              This human computer interaction is sometimes categorized under the creativity support tools development  These systems aim to provide an ideal framework for research  integration  decision making  and idea generation                          Recently  deep learning approaches to imaging  sound and natural language processing  resulted in the modeling of productive creativity development frameworks                         

Innovation edit 
Computational creativity is increasingly being discussed in the innovation and management literature as the recent development in AI may disrupt entire innovation processes and fundamentally change how innovations will be created                          Philip Hutchinson             highlights the relevance of computational creativity for creating innovation and introduced the concept of  self innovating artificial intelligence   SAI  to describe how companies make use of AI in innovation processes to enhance their innovative offerings  SAI is defined as the organizational utilization of AI with the aim of incrementally advancing existing or developing new products  based on insights from continuously combining and analyzing multiple data sources  As AI becomes a general purpose technology  the spectrum of products to be developed with SAI will broaden from simple to increasingly complex  This implies that computational creativity leads to a shift of creativity related skills for humans 

Combinatorial creativity edit 
A great deal  perhaps all  of human creativity can be understood as a novel combination of pre existing ideas or objects              Common strategies for combinatorial creativity include 

Placing a familiar object in an unfamiliar setting  e g   Marcel Duchamp s Fountain  or an unfamiliar object in a familiar setting  e g   a fish out of water story such as The Beverly Hillbillies 
Blending two superficially different objects or genres  e g   a sci fi story set in the Wild West  with robot cowboys  as in Westworld  or the reverse  as in Firefly  Japanese haiku poems  etc  
Comparing a familiar object to a superficially unrelated and semantically distant concept  e g    Makeup is the Western burka    A zoo is a gallery with living exhibits  
Adding a new and unexpected feature to an existing concept  e g   adding a scalpel to a Swiss Army knife  adding a camera to a mobile phone 
Compressing two incongruous scenarios into the same narrative to get a joke  e g   the Emo Philips joke  Women are always using men to advance their careers  Damned anthropologists   
Using an iconic image from one domain in a domain for an unrelated or incongruous idea or product  e g   using the Marlboro Man image to sell cars  or to advertise the dangers of smoking related impotence  
The combinatorial perspective allows us to model creativity as a search process through the space of possible combinations  The combinations can arise from composition or concatenation of different representations  or through a rule based or stochastic transformation of initial and intermediate representations  Genetic algorithms and neural networks can be used to generate blended or crossover representations that capture a combination of different inputs 

Conceptual blending edit 
Main article  Conceptual blending
Mark Turner and Gilles Fauconnier                         propose a model called Conceptual Integration Networks that elaborates upon Arthur Koestler s ideas about creativity             as well as work by Lakoff and Johnson              by synthesizing ideas from Cognitive Linguistic research into mental spaces and conceptual metaphors  Their basic model defines an integration network as four connected spaces 

A first input space  contains one conceptual structure or mental space 
A second input space  to be blended with the first input 
A generic space of stock conventions and image schemas that allow the input spaces to be understood from an integrated perspective
A blend space in which a selected projection of elements from both input spaces are combined  inferences arising from this combination also reside here  sometimes leading to emergent structures that conflict with the inputs 
Fauconnier and Turner describe a collection of optimality principles that are claimed to guide the construction of a well formed integration network  In essence  they see blending as a compression mechanism in which two or more input structures are compressed into a single blend structure  This compression operates on the level of conceptual relations  For example  a series of similarity relations between the input spaces can be compressed into a single identity relationship in the blend 
Some computational success has been achieved with the blending model by extending pre existing computational models of analogical mapping that are compatible by virtue of their emphasis on connected semantic structures              In       Francisco C mara Pereira             presented an implementation of blending theory that employs ideas both from symbolic AI and genetic algorithms to realize some aspects of blending theory in a practical form  his example domains range from the linguistic to the visual  and the latter most notably includes the creation of mythical monsters by combining   D graphical models 

Linguistic creativity edit 
Language provides continuous opportunity for creativity  evident in the generation of novel sentences  phrasings  puns  neologisms  rhymes  allusions  sarcasm  irony  similes  metaphors  analogies  witticisms  and jokes              Native speakers of morphologically rich languages frequently create new word forms that are easily understood  and some have found their way to the dictionary              The area of natural language generation has been well studied  but these creative aspects of everyday language have yet to be incorporated with any robustness or scale 

Hypothesis of creative patterns edit 
In the seminal work of applied linguist Ronald Carter  he hypothesized two main creativity types involving words and word patterns  pattern reforming creativity  and pattern forming creativity              Pattern reforming creativity refers to creativity by the breaking of rules  reforming and reshaping patterns of language often through individual innovation  while pattern forming creativity refers to creativity via conformity to language rules rather than breaking them  creating convergence  symmetry and greater mutuality between interlocutors through their interactions in the form of repetitions             

Story generation edit 
Substantial work has been conducted in this area of linguistic creation since the     s  with the development of James Meehan s TALE SPIN
             system  TALE SPIN viewed stories as narrative descriptions of a problem solving effort  and created stories by first establishing a goal for the story s characters so that their search for a solution could be tracked and recorded  The MINSTREL             system represents a complex elaboration of this basic approach  distinguishing a range of character level goals in the story from a range of author level goals for the story  Systems like Bringsjord s BRUTUS             elaborate these ideas further to create stories with complex interpersonal themes like betrayal  Nonetheless  MINSTREL explicitly models the creative process with a set of Transform Recall Adapt Methods  TRAMs  to create novel scenes from old  The MEXICA             model of Rafael P rez y P rez and Mike Sharples is more explicitly interested in the creative process of storytelling  and implements a version of the engagement reflection cognitive model of creative writing 

Metaphor and simile edit 
Example of a metaphor   She was an ape  
Example of a simile   Felt like a tiger fur blanket  
The computational study of these phenomena has mainly focused on interpretation as a knowledge based process  Computationalists such as Yorick Wilks  James Martin              Dan Fass  John Barnden              and Mark Lee have developed knowledge based approaches to the processing of metaphors  either at a linguistic level or a logical level  Tony Veale and Yanfen Hao have developed a system  called Sardonicus  that acquires a comprehensive database of explicit similes from the web  these similes are then tagged as bona fide  e g    as hard as steel   or ironic  e g    as hairy as a bowling ball    as pleasant as a root canal    similes of either type can be retrieved on demand for any given adjective  They use these similes as the basis of an on line metaphor generation system called Aristotle             that can suggest lexical metaphors for a given descriptive goal  e g   to describe a supermodel as skinny  the source terms  pencil    whip    whippet    rope    stick insect  and  snake  are suggested  

Analogy edit 
The process of analogical reasoning has been studied from both a mapping and a retrieval perspective  the latter being key to the generation of novel analogies  The dominant school of research  as advanced by Dedre Gentner  views analogy as a structure preserving process  this view has been implemented in the structure mapping engine or SME              the MAC FAC retrieval engine  Many Are Called  Few Are Chosen   ACME  Analogical Constraint Mapping Engine  and ARCS  Analogical Retrieval Constraint System   Other mapping based approaches include Sapper              which situates the mapping process in a semantic network model of memory  Analogy is a very active sub area of creative computation and creative cognition  active figures in this sub area include Douglas Hofstadter  Paul Thagard  and Keith Holyoak  Also worthy of note here is Peter Turney and Michael Littman s machine learning approach to the solving of SAT style analogy problems  their approach achieves a score that compares well with average scores achieved by humans on these tests 

Joke generation edit 
Main article  Computational humor
Humour is an especially knowledge hungry process  and the most successful joke generation systems to date have focussed on pun generation  as exemplified by the work of Kim Binsted and Graeme Ritchie              This work includes the JAPE system  which can generate a wide range of puns that are consistently evaluated as novel and humorous by young children  An improved version of JAPE has been developed in the guise of the STANDUP system  which has been experimentally deployed as a means of enhancing linguistic interaction with children with communication disabilities  Some limited progress has been made in generating humour that involves other aspects of natural language  such as the deliberate misunderstanding of pronominal reference  in the work of Hans Wim Tinholt and Anton Nijholt   as well as in the generation of humorous acronyms in the HAHAcronym system             of Oliviero Stock and Carlo Strapparava 

Neologism edit 
The blending of multiple word forms is a dominant force for new word creation in language  these new words are commonly called  blends  or  portmanteau words   after Lewis Carroll   Tony Veale has developed a system called ZeitGeist             that harvests neological headwords from Wikipedia and interprets them relative to their local context in Wikipedia and relative to specific word senses in WordNet  ZeitGeist has been extended to generate neologisms of its own  the approach combines elements from an inventory of word parts that are harvested from WordNet  and simultaneously determines likely glosses for these new words  e g    food traveller  for  gastronaut  and  time traveller  for  chrononaut    It then uses Web search to determine which glosses are meaningful and which neologisms have not been used before  this search identifies the subset of generated words that are both novel   H creative   and useful 
A corpus linguistic approach to the search and extraction of neologism have also shown to be possible  Using Corpus of Contemporary American English as a reference corpus  Locky Law has performed an extraction of neologism  portmanteaus and slang words using the hapax legomena which appeared in the scripts of American TV drama House M D             
In terms of linguistic research in neologism  Stefan Th  Gries has performed a quantitative analysis of blend structure in English and found that  the degree of recognizability of the source words and that the similarity of source words to the blend plays a vital role in blend formation   The results were validated through a comparison of intentional blends to speech error blends             

Poetry edit 


More than iron  more than lead  more than gold I need electricity I need it more than I need lamb or pork or lettuce or cucumber I need it for my dreams 


Racter  from The Policeman s Beard Is Half Constructed

Like jokes  poems involve a complex interaction of different constraints  and no general purpose poem generator adequately combines the meaning  phrasing  structure and rhyme aspects of poetry  Nonetheless  Pablo Gerv s             has developed a noteworthy system called ASPERA that employs a case based reasoning  CBR  approach to generating poetic formulations of a given input text via a composition of poetic fragments that are retrieved from a case base of existing poems  Each poem fragment in the ASPERA case base is annotated with a prose string that expresses the meaning of the fragment  and this prose string is used as the retrieval key for each fragment  Metrical rules are then used to combine these fragments into a well formed poetic structure  Racter is an example of such a software project 

Musical creativity edit 
Further information  Computer music  Music and artificial intelligence  and Computer generated music
Computational creativity in the music domain has focused both on the generation of musical scores for use by human musicians  and on the generation of music for performance by computers  The domain of generation has included classical music  with software that generates music in the style of Mozart and Bach  and jazz              Most notably  David Cope             has written a software system called  Experiments in Musical Intelligence   or  EMI               that is capable of analyzing and generalizing from existing music by a human composer to generate novel musical compositions in the same style  EMI s output is convincing enough to persuade human listeners that its music is human generated to a high level of competence             
In the field of contemporary classical music  Iamus is the first computer that composes from scratch  and produces final scores that professional interpreters can play  The London Symphony Orchestra played a piece for full orchestra  included in Iamus  debut CD              which New Scientist described as  The first major work composed by a computer and performed by a full orchestra               Melomics  the technology behind Iamus  is able to generate pieces in different styles of music with a similar level of quality 
Creativity research in jazz has focused on the process of improvisation and the cognitive demands that this places on a musical agent  reasoning about time  remembering and conceptualizing what has already been played  and planning ahead for what might be played next             
The robot Shimon  developed by Gil Weinberg of Georgia Tech  has demonstrated jazz improvisation              Virtual improvisation software based on researches on stylistic modeling carried out by Gerard Assayag and Shlomo Dubnov include OMax  SoMax and PyOracle  are used to create improvisations in real time by re injecting variable length sequences learned on the fly from the live performer             
In the field of musical composition  the patented works             by Ren  Louis Baron allowed to make a robot that can create and play a multitude of orchestrated melodies  so called  coherent  in any musical style  All outdoor physical parameter associated with one or more specific musical parameters  can influence and develop each of these songs  in real time while listening to the song   The patented invention Medal Composer raises problems of copyright 

Visual and artistic creativity edit 
Computational creativity in the generation of visual art has had some notable successes in the creation of both abstract art and representational art  A well known program in this domain is Harold Cohen s AARON              which has been continuously developed and augmented since       Though formulaic  Aaron exhibits a range of outputs  generating black and white drawings or colour paintings that incorporate human figures  such as dancers   potted plants  rocks  and other elements of background imagery  These images are of a sufficiently high quality to be displayed in reputable galleries 
Other software artists of note include the NEvAr system  for  Neuro Evolutionary Art   of Penousal Machado              NEvAr uses a genetic algorithm to derive a mathematical function that is then used to generate a coloured three dimensional surface  A human user is allowed to select the best pictures after each phase of the genetic algorithm  and these preferences are used to guide successive phases  thereby pushing NEvAr s search into pockets of the search space that are considered most appealing to the user 
The Painting Fool  developed by Simon Colton originated as a system for overpainting digital images of a given scene in a choice of different painting styles  colour palettes and brush types  Given its dependence on an input source image to work with  the earliest iterations of the Painting Fool raised questions about the extent of  or lack of  creativity in a computational art system  Nonetheless  The Painting Fool has been extended to create novel images  much as AARON does  from its own limited imagination  Images in this vein include cityscapes and forests  which are generated by a process of constraint satisfaction from some basic scenarios provided by the user  e g   these scenarios allow the system to infer that objects closer to the viewing plane should be larger and more color saturated  while those further away should be less saturated and appear smaller   Artistically  the images now created by the Painting Fool appear on a par with those created by Aaron  though the extensible mechanisms employed by the former  constraint satisfaction  etc   may well allow it to develop into a more elaborate and sophisticated painter 
The artist Krasi Dimtch  Krasimira Dimtchevska  and the software developer Svillen Ranev have created a computational system combining a rule based generator of English sentences and a visual composition builder that converts sentences generated by the system into abstract art              The software generates automatically indefinite number of different images using different color  shape and size palettes  The software also allows the user to select the subject of the generated sentences or and the one or more of the palettes used by the visual composition builder 
An emerging area of computational creativity is that of video games  ANGELINA is a system for creatively developing video games in Java by Michael Cook  One important aspect is Mechanic Miner  a system that can generate short segments of code that act as simple game mechanics              ANGELINA can evaluate these mechanics for usefulness by playing simple unsolvable game levels and testing to see if the new mechanic makes the level solvable  Sometimes Mechanic Miner discovers bugs in the code and exploits these to make new mechanics for the player to solve problems with             
In July       Google released DeepDream   an open source             computer vision program  created to detect faces and other patterns in images with the aim of automatically classifying images  which uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic pareidolia  thus creating a dreamlike psychedelic appearance in the deliberately over processed images                                     
In August       researchers from T bingen  Germany created a convolutional neural network that uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images which is able to turn images into stylistic imitations of works of art by artists such as a Picasso or Van Gogh in about an hour  Their algorithm is put into use in the website DeepArt that allows users to create unique artistic images by their algorithm                                                 
In early       a global team of researchers explained how a new computational creativity approach known as the Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate  DSNS  could be used to generate original chess puzzles that were not derived from endgame databases              The DSNS is able to combine features of different objects  e g  chess problems  paintings  music  using stochastic methods in order to derive new feature specifications which can be used to generate objects in any of the original domains  The generated chess puzzles have also been featured on YouTube             

Creativity in problem solving edit 
Creativity is also useful in allowing for unusual solutions in problem solving  In psychology and cognitive science  this research area is called creative problem solving  The Explicit Implicit Interaction  EII  theory of creativity has been implemented using a CLARION based computational model that allows for the simulation of incubation and insight in problem solving              The emphasis of this computational creativity project is not on performance per se  as in artificial intelligence projects  but rather on the explanation of the psychological processes leading to human creativity and the reproduction of data collected in psychology experiments  So far  this project has been successful in providing an explanation for incubation effects in simple memory experiments  insight in problem solving  and reproducing the overshadowing effect in problem solving 

Debate about  general  theories of creativity edit 
Some researchers feel that creativity is a complex phenomenon whose study is further complicated by the plasticity of the language we use to describe it  We can describe not just the agent of creativity as  creative  but also the product and the method  Consequently  it could be claimed that it is unrealistic to speak of a general theory of creativity      citation needed      Nonetheless  some generative principles are more general than others  leading some advocates to claim that certain computational approaches are  general theories   Stephen Thaler  for instance  proposes that certain modalities of neural networks are generative enough  and general enough  to manifest a high degree of creative capabilities      citation needed     

Criticism of computational creativity edit 
This article contains weasel words  vague phrasing that often accompanies biased or unverifiable information  Such statements should be clarified or removed    December      
Traditional computers  as mainly used in the computational creativity application  do not support creativity  as they fundamentally transform a set of discrete  limited domain of input parameters into a set of discrete  limited domain of output parameters using a limited set of computational functions      citation needed      As such  a computer cannot be creative  as everything in the output must have been already present in the input data or the algorithms      citation needed      Related discussions and references to related work are captured in work on philosophical foundations of simulation             
Mathematically  the same set of arguments against creativity has been made by Chaitin              Similar observations come from a Model Theory perspective  All this criticism emphasizes that computational creativity is useful and may look like creativity  but it is not real creativity  as nothing new is created  just transformed in well defined algorithms
