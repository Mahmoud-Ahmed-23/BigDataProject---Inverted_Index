							The Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation  EGPC  aims to launch an oil and gas exploration tender by the end of this year  to increase the exploration operations in the different concession areas  and boost rates of production 
A source in the petroleum sector told Daily News Egypt that EGPC is currently planning the areas to be included in the tender  It is expected to include areas in the Western Desert  the Gulf of Suez  and the Eastern Desert  after obtaining necessary approvals 
He added that the number of proposed areas will range from eight to    concession blocks  mostly to search for crude oil 
The source pointed out that the Ministry of Petroleum has developed a plan to promote international oil companies  IOCs  investments in crude oil exploration  which in turn will raise local production and reduce dependence on imports 
He pointed out that the decline in the crude oil prices resulted in the reduction of IOCs investments  which affected the stability of Egypt       s oil production 
 EGPC added incentives to the new exploration agreements to encourage investors  as was done in the agreements for natural gas exploration   the source said  adding that incentives include the adjustment of the cost recovery period and the share of IOCs in the production of crude oil from different concession areas across the country 
Furthermore  EGPC is working to increase the productivity of the existing oil fields and the completion of project developments to link them to production  to compensate for the natural decline in the productivity of the older fields 
The source revealed that the ministry aims to increase the production of crude oil and condensates to about         barrels per day during the next fiscal year
