Cornelliana is a term for Cornell s traditions  legends  and lore  Cornellian traditions include Slope Day  a celebration held on the last day of classes of the spring semester  and Dragon Day  which includes the parading of a dragon built by architecture students  Dragon Day is one of the school s oldest traditions and has been celebrated annually since       historically on or near St  Patrick s Day  The dragon is built by the first year architecture students in the week preceding the start of Spring Break  Taunting messages are left for the engineering students during the week leading into Dragon Day  with pranks  a  nerd walk   and even  green streak   in which the students paint themselves green  often targeting engineers and their classes  On Dragon Day  the dragon is paraded around central campus by the first year students  starting behind Rand Hall and moving through Cornell until eventually returning towards the Arts Quad  During the parade  the upper year architecture students walk behind the dragon in various costumes  typically constructed by themselves for the event  Throughout much of its history  the dragon was then set afire upon its arrival to the arts quad  but that has since been discontinued due to environmental regulations                                        
According to legend  if a virgin crosses the Arts Quad at midnight  the statues of Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White will walk off their pedestals  meet in the center of the Quad  and shake hands  congratulating themselves on the chastity of students  There is also another myth that if a couple crosses the suspension bridge on North Campus  and the young woman does not accept a kiss from her partner  the bridge will fall  If the kiss is accepted  the couple is assured a long future together              
The university is also host to various student pranks  On at least two different occasions  the university has awoken to find something odd atop the     foot            m  tall McGraw clock tower  once a    pound          kg  pumpkin and another time a disco ball  Because there is no access to the spire atop the tower  how the items were put in place remains a mystery               The colors of the lights on McGraw tower change to orange for Halloween and green for St  Patrick s Day               The clock tower also plays music 
The school colors are carnelian  a shade of red  and white  a play on  Cornellian  and Andrew Dickson White  A bear is commonly used as the unofficial mascot  which dates back to the introduction of the mascot  Touchdown  in       a live bear who was brought onto the field during football games              The university s alma mater is  Far Above Cayuga s Waters   and its fight song is  Give My Regards to Davy   People associated with the university are called  Cornellians
