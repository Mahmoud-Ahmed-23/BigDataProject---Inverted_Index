Term used to impress in organizations



A word cloud of buzzwords related to big data
A buzzword is a word or phrase  new or already existing  that becomes popular for a period of time  Buzzwords often derive from technical terms yet often have much of the original technical meaning removed through fashionable use  being simply used to impress others  Some buzzwords retain their true technical meaning when used in the correct contexts  for example artificial intelligence                       
Buzzwords often originate in jargon  acronyms  or neologisms             Examples of overworked business buzzwords include synergy  vertical  dynamic  cyber and strategy  
It has been stated that businesses could not operate without buzzwords  as they are the shorthands or internal shortcuts that make perfect sense to people informed of the context             However  a useful buzzword can become co opted into general popular speech and lose its usefulness  According to management professor Robert Kreitner   Buzzwords are the literary equivalent of Gresham s law  They will drive out good ideas             
Buzzwords  or buzz phrases such as  all on the same page   can also be seen in business as a way to make people feel like there is a mutual understanding  As most workplaces use a specialized jargon  which could be argued is another form of buzzwords  it allows quicker communication  Indeed  many new hires feel more like  part of the team  the quicker they learn the buzzwords of their new workplace  Buzzwords permeate people s working lives so much that many do not realize that they are using them  The vice president of CSC Index  Rich DeVane  notes that buzzwords describe not only a trend  but also what can be considered a  ticket of entry  with regards to being considered as a successful organization    What people find tiresome is each consulting firm s attempt to put a different spin on it  That s what gives bad information             
Buzzwords also feature prominently in politics  where they can result in a process which  privileges rhetoric over reality  producing policies that are  operationalized  first and only  conceptualized  at a later date   The resulting political speech is known for  eschewing reasoned debate  as characterized by the use of evidence and structured argument   instead employing language exclusively for the purposes of control and manipulation             


Definition edit 
The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines a buzzword  hyphenating the term as buzz word  as a slogan  or as a fashionable piece of jargon  a chic  fashionable  voguish  trendy word a la mode 
It has been asserted that buzzwords do not simply appear  they are created by a group of people working within a business as a means to generate hype             Buzzwords are most closely associated with management and have become the vocabulary that is known as  management speak   Using a pompous or magisterial term  of or relating to a particular subject employed to impress those outside of the field of expertise 
It could also be called buzz phrase or loaded word            
What this means is that when a manager uses a said buzzword  most other people do not hear the meaning  and instead just see it as a buzzword  However it has been said that buzzwords are almost a  necessary evil  of management  as a way to inspire their team  but also stroke their own egos             With that being said  a buzzword is not necessarily a bad thing  as many disciplines thrive with the introduction of new terms which can be called buzzwords  These can also cross over into pop culture and indeed even into everyday life             With media channels now operating through many media  such as television  radio  print and increasingly digital  especially with the rise of social media   a  buzzword  can catch on and rapidly be adapted through the world

The origin of buzzwords can be seen in Hallgren  amp  Weiss        as coming from business students studying at Harvard University as a way to help them gain better results from their studies  Such language terms were collated     by whom       and then became what is known today as  buzzwords   During the early years of buzzwords     when        buzzwords were used by students as a means to enable them to quickly recall items of importance  As an example   If his analysis does not highlight the most important problems he has  poor focus   and if he fails to emphasize important recommendations he will be accused of  tinkering   If the sequence for the  implementation  of the recommendations is not good it is a matter of  poor timing   To succeed  the student must  get on top of the problem   He must  hit the problem  and not  shadow box  it  If he cannot do these things he might just as well  turn in his suit               
Students have used many different buzzwords to describe the situation that they are in  and how this might affect a moment in their everyday life  From studying these business students  Hallgren  amp  Weiss        noticed that business students could speak with apparent authority  It also seemed     to whom       as if using the right buzzword was more important than what the student came up with as an answer  Buzzwords have a strong influence on business culture and are commonly used in business speak
