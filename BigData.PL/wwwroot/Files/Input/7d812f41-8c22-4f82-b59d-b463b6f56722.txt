The courts of the United States are closely linked hierarchical systems of courts at the federal and state levels  The federal courts form the judicial branch of the U S  government and operate under the authority of the United States Constitution and federal law  The state and territorial courts of the individual U S  states and territories operate under the authority of the state and territorial constitutions and state and territorial law 
Federal statutes that refer to the  courts of the United States  are referring only to the courts of the federal government  and not the courts of the individual states and counties  Because of the federalist underpinnings of the division between sovereign federal and state governments  the various state court systems are free to operate in ways that vary widely from those of the federal government  and from one another  In practice  however  every state has adopted a division of its judiciary into at least two levels  and almost every state has three levels  with trial courts hearing cases which may be reviewed by appellate courts  and finally by a state supreme court  A few states have two separate supreme courts  with one having authority over civil matters and the other reviewing criminal cases     states and the federal government allow at least one appeal of right from a final judgment on the merits  meaning that the court receiving the appeal must decide the appeal after it is briefed and argued properly  Three states do not provide a right to a first appeal  Rather  they give litigants only a right to petition for the right to have an appeal heard 
State courts often have diverse names and structures  as illustrated below  State courts hear about     of litigation  most states have courts of special jurisdiction  which typically handle minor disputes such as traffic citations  and courts of general jurisdiction responsible for more serious disputes            
The U S  federal court system hears cases involving litigants from two or more states  violations of federal laws  treaties  and the Constitution  admiralty  bankruptcy  and related issues             In practice  about     of the cases are civil and     criminal             The civil cases often involve civil rights  patents  and Social Security while the criminal cases involve tax fraud  robbery  counterfeiting  and drug crimes             The trial courts are U S  district courts  followed by United States courts of appeals and then the Supreme Court of the United States  The judicial system  whether state or federal  begins with a court of first instance  whose work may be reviewed by an appellate court  and then ends at the court of last resort  which may review the work of the lower courts
