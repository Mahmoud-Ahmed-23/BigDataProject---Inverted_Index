							Egypt       s Minister of Electricity and Renewable Energy Mahmoud Essmat has reiterated his commitment to completing the Saudi Egypt electricity interconnector project by early summer       emphasising the importance of close collaboration and coordination between all involved parties 
The project  expected to be operational in two phases  will create new opportunities for Egypt and Saudi Arabia  with the first phase scheduled to begin in July       The project is expected to be fully operational by early      and is estimated to cost      billion 
Essmat has been holding intensive meetings with stakeholders responsible for project implementation  as well as representatives of relevant authorities issuing permits and licences related to the project       s construction  including those related to tower heights  submarine cables  oil pipelines  and other requirements 
 There is agreement  cooperation  and coordination between Egypt and Saudi Arabia on the necessity of bringing the electricity interconnection line into service and connecting it to the unified network in both countries by early summer   Essmat said 
These meetings  which aim to accelerate the pace of work  increase resources  and tackle challenges related to remote areas the interconnector passes through  are a testament to the commitment to completing the project on schedule
