							Egypt s appetite for energy is insatiable  with an annual demand growth rate of around     although Egypt is blessed with an abundance of natural resources to supply the country s energy needs through energy produced from various sources oil and gas  renewables  and other resources such as coal and nuclear  Yet hydrocarbon development was always the cornerstone of the energy sector  as Egypt now needs to consider different sources of energy 
There is no doubt that an efficient energy sector is central to a prosperous Egypt  Energy challenges play an integral part in the country s current economic woes  Until only relatively recently  Egypt was a self sufficient energy consumer  meeting its energy needs through local production  It has even been exporting both natural gas and electricity to neighbouring countries 
Since around two thirds of the country s electricity comes from gas plants  diversifying the Egyptian energy mix becomes a priority   the authorities in the last three years have started renewable energy feed in tariff programmes  signed an agreement for the construction of Al Dabaa nuclear power plant  and approved the use of coal for power production 
Coal  the main driver behind the industrial revolution and fueled some of the world s largest economies  has become the centre of controversy as an energy source  because it is a relatively cheap  abundant  and well established source of energy  It is  however  also a major source of pollution 
Global statistics determined that coal contributes to between        of the world s energy mix in       Furthermore  the World Coal Association claims that coal has supplied electricity to almost   billion people around the world and that coal energy industry has created   million jobs around the globe 
To tackle the issues of the efficiency of coal as an energy source  of how Egypt can fully utilise coal s potential and minimise its disadvantages  and to review Egypt s energy future  Daily News Egypt sat with Sacha Parneix  the commercial general manager of Steam Power Systems at GE Power  a subsidiary of General Electric  of Middle East  North Africa  and Turkey  MENAT  
How do you see the future of investments in the energy sector after the economic reforms taken by the government 
GE has proudly supported the development of Egypt s energy sector for over    years  Today  GE has installed more than     gas and steam turbines in Egypt and helps generate more than      gigawatts  GW  of electricity enough to power more than    million homes nationwide 
Egypt is undergoing strong economic reforms  with the government prioritising power generation efficiency and diversification of the country s energy mix  GE  with its holistic technology portfolio  gas  coal  oil  nuclear  hydro  wind  and solar   together with its strong local services capabilities in Egypt  is well positioned to respond effectively to these developments 
Coal fired power plants currently fuel     of global electricity  and in Egypt       s case  the government in      began allowing the use of coal for power generation for certain industries  In your opinion  can coal help Egypt reach energy self sufficiency 
Egypt is looking to move away from a heavy reliance on oil and natural gas  to a more diversified power generation mix to help enhance energy self sufficiency and security  Coal can play an important role here in helping to meet the need for efficient  reliable  flexible and affordable power 
In fact  Egypt is not alone in taking this route to a more diversified energy mix  It is a trend we see across the region today  The United Arab emirates  UAE   for example  aims to generate    of its electricity from nuclear power and     from imported coal under the UAE      energy goals  The country s first coal fueled power plant  the       megawatts  MW  Hassyan clean coal power project  will use GE s ultra supercritical  USC  technology to generate power at very competitive costs  Notably  the project will also meet flue gas emission limits far more stringently than emission limits in the Industrial Emissions Directive  IED  of the European Union and in the International Finance Corporation  IFC  guidelines  guaranteeing values similar to flue gas emissions from a gas fired plant  allowing the Dubai utility DEWA to call the project  clean coal  
 nbsp 
Furthermore  as Egypt looks to grow its renewable energy mix through increased investments in wind  hydro  and solar power  coal fueled generation can help address the challenge of intermittency in renewable energy supplies  There are no guarantees on the uninterrupted supply of wind  water  and or sunlight  and coal can complement renewable energy projects to provide much needed stability to the grid 
Coal is an excellent energy source in terms of economic efficiency  but what about the environmental concerns 
When we look at the environmental impact of coal fired power plants  there are two primary concerns  The first is local pollution that impacts people living in the vicinity of the plant site  This can be mitigated through technologies like optimised combustion  which allows the safe re use of ashes in sectors such as the cement industry  flue gas cleaning systems that remove harmful by products such as nitrates  sulphates  dust  mercury  etc  and treatment systems that remove waste from discharged water  GE Power is a leader in all these technologies  which stay very affordable  typically in the range of    of the overall plant cost if all are implemented together  
The second is global pollution  This relates mainly to carbon dioxide emissions  contribution to global warming at the level of the planet  Here  it is important to note that carbon dioxide emissions are linked to plant efficiency levels  At coal fired plants  the use of advanced equipment such as GE s ultra supercritical technology can lead to plant efficiency levels up to one third better  and  therefore  levels of carbon dioxide emissions one third lower  than the world average for existing coal based power plants  The application of digital solutions can further enhance the plant s operational efficiency and reduce its environmental footprint 
How much is the company       s investments in the Egyptian market  Is there an intention to expand investments during the coming period 
Egypt is a very important market for GE  and we see tremendous potential here  The country has a talented young and growing population and there is a lot of room for growth and development  GE is always working with its customers and partners across sectors to find win win opportunities that can deliver real impact in the country to help improve the lives of Egyptians 
GE employs     people across the country  and the company works with the public and private sectors to help transform the energy  healthcare  transportation  and aviation sectors to drive economic and industrial growth  Today  more than      GW of power in Egypt is generated through GE turbines  An aeroplane powered by GE engines takes off every   minutes from Egypt  and more than        GE healthcare technologies are deployed in hospitals across the country  This is a legacy we are proud of and committed to growing further in Egypt 
Coal  the main driver behind the industrial revolution and fueled some of the world s largest economies  has become the centre of controversy as an energy source  because it is a relatively cheap  abundant  and well established source of energy
Can new technologies  such as clean coal technology  unlock the potential of coal as an excellent energy source and improve its efficiency  
The technology available today can bring the environmental impact of coal power plants down to the level of gas power plants  which are usually considered to be quite clean  GE  for example  is at the leading edge of ultra supercritical  USC  technology that allows net coal fired plant efficiency of up to       significantly higher than the global average of      Adopting the technology has helped Germany s RDK  power plant to turn into the world s most efficient coal based power plant 
GE continues to push the limits of our leading technology even further with higher steam parameters and efficiency rates and is the first to market with advanced ultra supercritical  Steam H  technology that can deliver an additional     percentage points of efficiency beyond the best technology in operation today  driving towards the     net efficiency mark 
Furthermore  one of the most interesting developments today is the marriage of software and data analytics with physical equipment  GE s digital industrial solutions  for example  can increase efficiency up to      over the life of a  GW coal fired steam plant  the equivalent of taking         cars off the road  This additional efficiency matters as every point of efficiency reduces operating costs over the lifetime of the plant while also reducing carbon dioxide emissions 
Last but not least  innovative technology solutions today allow large coal fired steam plants  long considered as pure base load units  to participate actively in the stability of the grid  with the ability to ramp power output up and down quickly  making them an effective complement to renewable energy
