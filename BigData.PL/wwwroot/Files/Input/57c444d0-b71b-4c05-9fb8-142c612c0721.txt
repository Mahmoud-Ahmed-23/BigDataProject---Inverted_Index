Google Search  also known simply as Google or Google com  is a search engine operated by Google  It allows users to search for information on the Web by entering keywords or phrases  Google Search uses algorithms to analyze and rank websites based on their relevance to the search query  It is the most popular search engine worldwide 
Google Search is the most visited website in the world  As of       Google Search has a     share of the global search engine market             Approximately        of Google s monthly global traffic comes from the United States        from India       from Brazil        from the United Kingdom and       from Japan according to data provided by Similarweb            
The order of search results returned by Google is based  in part  on a priority rank system called  PageRank   Google Search also provides many different options for customized searches  using symbols to include  exclude  specify or require certain search behavior  and offers specialized interactive experiences  such as flight status and package tracking  weather forecasts  currency  unit  and time conversions  word definitions  and more 
The main purpose of Google Search is to search for text in publicly accessible documents offered by web servers  as opposed to other data  such as images or data contained in databases  It was originally developed in      by Larry Page  Sergey Brin  and Scott Hassan                                   The search engine would also be set up in the garage of Susan Wojcicki s Menlo Park home             In       Google introduced  Google Voice Search  to search for spoken  rather than typed  words             In       Google introduced a semantic search feature named Knowledge Graph 
Analysis of the frequency of search terms may indicate economic  social and health trends              Data about the frequency of use of search terms on Google can be openly inquired via Google Trends and have been shown to correlate with flu outbreaks and unemployment levels  and provide the information faster than traditional reporting methods and surveys  As of mid       Google s search engine has begun to rely on deep neural networks             
In August       a US judge in Virginia ruled that Google held an illegal monopoly over Internet search and search advertising                          The court found that Google maintained its market dominance by paying large amounts to phone makers and browser developers to make Google its default search engine              In April       the trial to determine which remedies sought by the Department of Justice would be imposed to address Google s illegal monopoly  which could include breaking up the company and preventing it from using its data to secure dominance in the AI sector             


Search indexing
See also  GooglebotGoogle indexes hundreds of terabytes of information from web pages              For websites that are currently down or otherwise not available  Google provides links to cached versions of the site  formed by the search engine s latest indexing of that page              Additionally  Google indexes some file types  being able to show users PDFs  Word documents  Excel spreadsheets  PowerPoint presentations  certain Flash multimedia content  and plain text files              Users can also activate  SafeSearch   a filtering technology aimed at preventing explicit and pornographic content from appearing in search results             
Despite Google search s immense index  sources generally assume that Google is only indexing less than    of the total Internet  with the rest belonging to the deep web  inaccessible through its search tools                                     
In       Google changed its search indexing tools to demote sites that had been accused of piracy              In October       Gary Illyes  a webmaster trends analyst with Google  announced that the search engine would be making a separate  primary web index dedicated for mobile devices  with a secondary  less up to date index for desktop use  The change was a response to the continued growth in mobile usage  and a push for web developers to adopt a mobile friendly version of their websites                          In December       Google began rolling out the change  having already done so for multiple websites             

 Caffeine  search architecture upgrade
In August       Google invited web developers to test a new search architecture  codenamed  Caffeine   and give their feedback  The new architecture provided no visual differences in the user interface  but added significant speed improvements and a new  under the hood  indexing infrastructure  The move was interpreted in some quarters as a response to Microsoft s recent release of an upgraded version of its own search service  renamed Bing  as well as the launch of Wolfram Alpha  a new search engine based on  computational knowledge                           Google announced completion of  Caffeine  on June          claiming     fresher results due to continuous updating of its index             
With  Caffeine   Google moved its back end indexing system away from MapReduce and onto Bigtable  the company s distributed database platform                         

 Medic  search algorithm update
In August       Danny Sullivan from Google announced a broad core algorithm update  As per current analysis done by the industry leaders Search Engine Watch and Search Engine Land  the update was to drop down the medical and health related websites that were not user friendly and were not providing good user experience  This is why the industry experts named it  Medic              
Google reserves very high standards for YMYL  Your Money or Your Life  pages  This is because misinformation can affect users financially  physically  or emotionally  Therefore  the update targeted particularly those YMYL pages that have low quality content and misinformation  This resulted in the algorithm targeting health and medical related websites more than others  However  many other websites from other industries were also negatively affected             

Search results
Ranking of results
By       it handled more than     billion searches per day              In      the European Commission found that Google Search favored Google s own products  instead of the best result for consumers  needs              In February      Google announced a major change to its mobile search algorithm which would favor mobile friendly over other websites  Nearly     of Google searches come from mobile phones  Google says it wants users to have access to premium quality websites  Those websites which lack a mobile friendly interface would be ranked lower and it is expected that this update will cause a shake up of ranks  Businesses who fail to update their websites accordingly could see a dip in their regular websites traffic             

PageRank
Main article  PageRank
Google s rise was largely due to a patented algorithm called PageRank which helps rank web pages that match a given search string              When Google was a Stanford research project  it was nicknamed BackRub because the technology checks backlinks to determine a site s importance  Other keyword based methods to rank search results  used by many search engines that were once more popular than Google  would check how often the search terms occurred in a page  or how strongly associated the search terms were within each resulting page  The PageRank algorithm instead analyzes human generated links assuming that web pages linked from many important pages are also important  The algorithm computes a recursive score for pages  based on the weighted sum of other pages linking to them  PageRank is thought to correlate well with human concepts of importance  In addition to PageRank  Google  over the years  has added many other secret criteria for determining the ranking of resulting pages  This is reported to comprise over     different indicators                          the specifics of which are kept secret to avoid difficulties created by scammers and help Google maintain an edge over its competitors globally 
PageRank was influenced by a similar page ranking and site scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex  developed by Robin Li in       Larry Page s patent for PageRank filed in      includes a citation to Li s earlier patent  Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu in                              
In a potential hint of Google s future direction of their Search algorithm  Google s then chief executive Eric Schmidt  said in a      interview with the Financial Times   The goal is to enable Google users to be able to ask the question such as  What shall I do tomorrow   and  What job shall I take                 Schmidt reaffirmed this during a      interview with The Wall Street Journal   I actually think most people don t want Google to answer their questions  they want Google to tell them what they should be doing next              

Google optimization
Main article  Search engine optimization
Because Google is the most popular search engine  many webmasters attempt to influence their website s Google rankings  An industry of consultants has arisen to help websites increase their rankings on Google and other search engines  This field  called search engine optimization  attempts to discern patterns in search engine listings  and then develop a methodology for improving rankings to draw more searchers to their clients  sites  Search engine optimization encompasses both  on page  factors  like body copy  title elements  H  heading elements and image alt attribute values  and Off Page Optimization factors  like anchor text and PageRank   The general idea is to affect Google s relevance algorithm by incorporating the keywords being targeted in various places  on page   in particular the title element and the body copy  note  the higher up in the page  presumably the better its keyword prominence and thus the ranking   Too many occurrences of the keyword  however  cause the page to look suspect to Google s spam checking algorithms  Google has published guidelines for website owners who would like to raise their rankings when using legitimate optimization consultants              It has been hypothesized  and  allegedly  is the opinion of the owner of one business about which there have been numerous complaints  that negative publicity  for example  numerous consumer complaints  may serve as well to elevate page rank on Google Search as favorable comments              The particular problem addressed in The New York Times article  which involved DecorMyEyes  was addressed shortly thereafter by an undisclosed fix in the Google algorithm  According to Google  it was not the frequently published consumer complaints about DecorMyEyes which resulted in the high ranking but mentions on news websites of events which affected the firm such as legal actions against it  Google Search Console helps to check for websites that use duplicate or copyright content             

 Hummingbird  search algorithm upgrade
Main article  Google Hummingbird
In       Google significantly upgraded its search algorithm with  Hummingbird   Its name was derived from the speed and accuracy of the hummingbird              The change was announced on September           having already been in use for a month               Hummingbird  places greater emphasis on natural language queries  considering context and meaning over individual keywords              It also looks deeper at content on individual pages of a website  with improved ability to lead users directly to the most appropriate page rather than just a website s homepage              The upgrade marked the most significant change to Google search in years  with more  human  search interactions             and a much heavier focus on conversation and meaning              Thus  web developers and writers were encouraged to optimize their sites with natural writing rather than forced keywords  and make effective use of technical web development for on site navigation             

Search results quality
In       drawing on internal Google documents disclosed as part of the United States v  Google LLC        antitrust case  technology reporters claimed that Google Search was  bloated and overmonetized              and that the  semantic matching  of search queries put advertising profits before quality              Wired withdrew Megan Gray s piece after Google complained about alleged inaccuracies  while the author reiterated that  As stated in court   A goal of Project Mercury was to increase commercial queries               
In March       Google announced a significant update to its core search algorithm and spam targeting  which is expected to wipe out         percent of all spam results              On March   th  it was confirmed that the roll out of the spam update was complete             

Shopping search
On September           the European based EU Court of Justice found that Google held an illegal monopoly with the way the company showed favoritism to its shopping search  and could not avoid paying      billion              The EU Court of Justice referred to Google s treatment of rival shopping searches as  discriminatory  and in violation of the Digital Markets Act

Universal search
 Universal search  was launched by Google on May           as an idea that merged the results from different kinds of search types into one  Prior to Universal search  a standard Google search would consist of links only to websites  Universal search  however  incorporates a wide variety of sources  including websites  news  pictures  maps  blogs  videos  and more  all shown on the same search results page                          Marissa Mayer  then vice president of search products and user experience  described the goal of Universal search as  we re attempting to break down the walls that traditionally separated our various search properties and integrate the vast amounts of information available into one simple set of search results             
In June       Google expanded its search results to cover available job listings  The data is aggregated from various major job boards and collected by analyzing company homepages  Initially only available in English  the feature aims to simplify finding jobs suitable for each user

Performing a search
A definition link is provided for many search terms 
Google Search consists of a series of localized websites  The largest of those  the google com site  is the top most visited website in the world               Some of its features include a definition link for most searches including dictionary words  the number of results you got on your search  links to other searches  e g  for words that Google believes to be misspelled  it provides a link to the search results using its proposed spelling   the ability to filter results to a date range               and many more 

Search syntax
Google search accepts queries as normal text  as well as individual keywords               It automatically corrects apparent misspellings by default  while offering to use the original spelling as a selectable alternative   and provides the same results regardless of capitalization               For more customized results  one can use a wide variety of operators  including  but not limited to                           

OR or      Search for webpages containing one of two similar queries  such as marathon OR race

Unlike other search engines  when searching for exact phrases  Google Search only takes words that are on the same line into account 

Query expansion
Google applies query expansion to submitted search queries  using techniques to deliver results that it considers  smarter  than the query users actually submitted  This technique involves several steps  including              

Word stemming   Certain words can be reduced so other  similar terms  are also found in results  so that  translator  can also search for  translation 
Acronyms   Searching for abbreviations can also return results about the name in its full length  so that  NATO  can show results for  North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Misspellings   Google will often suggest correct spellings for misspelled words
Synonyms   In most cases where a word is incorrectly used in a phrase or sentence  Google search will show results based on the correct synonym
Translations   The search engine can  in some instances  suggest results for specific words in a different language
Ignoring words   In some search queries containing extraneous or insignificant words  Google search will simply drop those specific words from the query
Location sensitivity   Google may consider users  geographical location to deliver more relevant results 
A screenshot of suggestions by Google Search when  wikip  is typed

During Google s developer conference  Google I O  in May       the company announced that users on Google Chrome and ChromeOS would be able to have the browser initiate an audio based search by saying  OK Google   with no button presses required  After having the answer presented  users can follow up with additional  contextual questions  an example include initially asking  OK Google  will it be sunny in Santa Cruz this weekend    hearing a spoken answer  and reply with  how far is it from here                             An update to the Chrome browser with voice search functionality rolled out a week later  though it required a button press on a microphone icon rather than  OK Google  voice activation               Google released a browser extension for the Chrome browser  named with a  beta  tag for unfinished development  shortly thereafter               In May       the company officially added  OK Google  into the browser itself               they removed it in October       citing low usage  though the microphone icon for activation remained available               In May           of search queries on mobile devices were done through voice

In addition to its tool for searching web pages  Google also provides services for searching images  Usenet newsgroups  news websites  videos  Google Videos   searching by locality  maps  and items for sale online  Google Videos allows searching the World Wide Web for video clips               The service evolved from Google Video  Google s discontinued video hosting service that also allowed to search the web for video clips              
In       Google has indexed over    trillion web pages  and received     billion queries per month               It also caches much of the content that it indexes  Google operates other tools and services including Google News  Google Shopping  Google Maps  Google Custom Search  Google Earth  Google Docs  Picasa  discontinued   Panoramio  discontinued   YouTube  Google Translate  Google Blog Search and Google Desktop Search  discontinued               
There are also products available from Google that are not directly search related  Gmail  for example  is a webmail application  but still includes search features  Google Browser Sync does not offer any search facilities  although it aims to organize your browsing time 

Energy consumption
In       Google claimed that a search query requires altogether about        kJ or             kW h               which is enough to raise the temperature of one liter of water by            C  According to green search engine Ecosia  the industry standard for search engines is estimated to be about          grams of CO  emission per search               Google s        searches per second translate to        kg CO  per second or over     million kilos of CO  per year              

Google Doodles
Main article  Google Doodle
On certain occasions  the logo on Google s webpage will change to a special version  known as a  Google Doodle   This is a picture  drawing  animation  or interactive game that includes the logo  It is usually done for a special event or day although not all of them are well known               Clicking on the Doodle links to a string of Google search results about the topic  The first was a reference to the Burning Man Festival in                                 and others have been produced for the birthdays of notable people like Albert Einstein  historical events like the interlocking Lego block s   th anniversary and holidays like Valentine s Day               Some Google Doodles have interactivity beyond a simple search  such as the famous  Google Pac Man  version that appeared on May          

Criticism
Privacy
Main article  Privacy concerns regarding Google
Google has been criticized for placing long term cookies on users  machines to store preferences  a tactic which also enables them to track a user s search terms and retain the data for more than a year              
Since       Google Inc  has globally introduced encrypted connections for most of its clients  to bypass governative blockings of the commercial and IT services              
Google searches have also triggered keyword warrants in which information is shared with law enforcement leading to a criminal case              

Complaints about indexing
In       The New York Times complained about Google s indexing  claiming that Google s caching of content on its site infringed its copyright for the content               In both Field v  Google and Parker v  Google  the United States District Court of Nevada ruled in favor of Google                           

Child sexual abuse
This section needs expansion  You can help by making an edit requestadding to it     May      
A      New York Times article on Google Search showed that images of child sexual abuse had been found on Google and that the company had been reluctant at times to remove them              

January      malware bug
A screenshot of the error of January         
Google flags search results with the message  This site may harm your computer  if the site is known to install malicious software in the background or otherwise surreptitiously  For approximately    minutes on January           all search results were mistakenly classified as malware and could therefore not be clicked  instead a warning message was displayed and the user was required to enter the requested URL manually  The bug was caused by human error                                                           The URL of      which expands to all URLs  was mistakenly added to the malware patterns file                           

Possible misuse of search results
In       a group of researchers observed a tendency for users to rely exclusively on Google Search for finding information  writing that  With the Google interface the user gets the impression that the search results imply a kind of totality           In fact  one only sees a small part of what one could see if one also integrates other research tools               
In       Google Search query results have been shown by Internet activist Eli Pariser to be tailored to users  effectively isolating users in what he defined as a filter bubble  Pariser holds algorithms used in search engines such as Google Search responsible for catering  a personal ecosystem of information                Although contrasting views have mitigated the potential threat of  informational dystopia  and questioned the scientific nature of Pariser s claims               filter bubbles have been mentioned to account for the surprising results of the U S  presidential election in      alongside fake news and echo chambers  suggesting that Facebook and Google have designed personalized online realities in which  we only see and hear what we like               

FTC fines
In       the US Federal Trade Commission fined Google US      million for violating their agreement not to violate the privacy of users of Apple s Safari web browser               The FTC was also continuing to investigate if Google s favoring of their own services in their search results violated antitrust regulations              

Payments to Apple
In a November      disclosure  during the ongoing antitrust trial against Google  an economics professor at the University of Chicago revealed that Google pays Apple     of all search advertising revenue generated when users access Google through the Safari browser  This revelation reportedly caused Google s lead attorney to cringe visibly      citation needed      The revenue generated from Safari users has been kept confidential  but the     figure suggests that it is likely in the tens of billions of dollars 
Both Apple and Google have argued that disclosing the specific terms of their search default agreement would harm their competitive positions  However  the court ruled that the information was relevant to the antitrust case and ordered its disclosure  This revelation has raised concerns about the dominance of Google in the search engine market and the potential anticompetitive effects of its agreements with Apple              

Big data and human bias
Google search engine robots are programmed to use algorithms that understand and predict human behavior  The book  Race After Technology  Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code              by Ruha Benjamin talks about human bias as a behavior that the Google search engine can recognize  In       some users Google searched  three Black teenagers  and images of criminal mugshots of young African American teenagers came up  Then  the users searched  three White teenagers  and were presented with photos of smiling  happy teenagers  They also searched for  three Asian teenagers   and very revealing photos of Asian girls and women appeared  Benjamin concluded that these results reflect human prejudice and views on different ethnic groups  A group of analysts explained the concept of a racist computer program   The idea here is that computers  unlike people  can t be racist but we re increasingly learning that they do in fact take after their makers          Some experts believe that this problem might stem from the hidden biases in the massive piles of data that the algorithms process as they learn to recognize patterns          reproducing our worst values               

Monopoly ruling
On August          Google lost a lawsuit which started in      in D C  Circuit Court  with Judge Amit Mehta finding that the company had an illegal monopoly over Internet search               This monopoly was held to be in violation of Section   of the Sherman Act               Google has said it will appeal the ruling               though they did propose to loosen search deals with Apple and others requiring them to set Google as the default search engine              

Trademark
Main article  Google  verb 
As people talk about  googling  rather than searching  the company has taken some steps to defend its trademark  in an effort to prevent it from becoming a generic trademark                            This has led to lawsuits  threats of lawsuits  and the use of euphemisms  such as calling Google Search a famous web search engine              

Discontinued features
Translate foreign pages
Until May       Google Search had offered a feature to translate search queries into other languages  A Google spokesperson told Search Engine Land that  Removing features is always tough  but we do think very hard about each decision and its implications for our users  Unfortunately  this feature never saw much pick up               

Instant search
Instant search was announced in September      as a feature that displayed suggested results while the user typed in their search query  initially only in select countries or to registered users               The primary advantage of the new system was its ability to save time  with Marissa Mayer  then vice president of search products and user experience  proclaiming that the feature would save     seconds per search  elaborating that  That may not seem like a lot at first  but it adds up  With Google Instant  we estimate that we ll save our users    hours with each passing second                Matt Van Wagner of Search Engine Land wrote that  Personally  I kind of like Google Instant and I think it represents a natural evolution in the way search works   and also praised Google s efforts in public relations  writing that  With just a press conference and a few well placed interviews  Google has parlayed this relatively minor speed improvement into an attention grabbing front page news story                The upgrade also became notable for the company switching Google Search s underlying technology from HTML to AJAX              
Instant Search could be disabled via Google s  preferences  menu for those who didn t want its functionality              
The publication       The Hacker Quarterly compiled a list of words that Google Instant did not show suggested results for  with a Google spokesperson giving the following statement to Mashable              

There are several reasons you may not be seeing search queries for a particular topic  Among other things  we apply a narrow set of removal policies for pornography  violence  and hate speech  It s important to note that removing queries from Autocomplete is a hard problem  and not as simple as blacklisting particular terms and phrases 
In search  we get more than one billion searches each day  Because of this  we take an algorithmic approach to removals  and just like our search algorithms  these are imperfect  We will continue to work to improve our approach to removals in Autocomplete  and are listening carefully to feedback from our users 

Our algorithms look not only at specific words  but compound queries based on those words  and across all languages  So  for example  if there s a bad word in Russian  we may remove a compound word including the transliteration of the Russian word into English  We also look at the search results themselves for given queries  So  for example  if the results for a particular query seem pornographic  our algorithms may remove that query from Autocomplete  even if the query itself wouldn t otherwise violate our policies  This system is neither perfect nor instantaneous  and we will continue to work to make it better 
PC Magazine discussed the inconsistency in how some forms of the same topic are allowed  for instance   lesbian  was blocked  while  gay  was not  and  cocaine  was blocked  while  crack  and  heroin  were not  The report further stated that seemingly normal words were also blocked due to pornographic innuendos  most notably  scat   likely due to having two completely separate contextual meanings  one for music and one for a sexual practice              
On July           Google removed Instant results  due to a growing number of searches on mobile devices  where interaction with search  as well as screen sizes  differ significantly from a computer                           

Instant previews
 Instant previews  allowed previewing screenshots of search results  web pages without having to open them  The feature was introduced in November      to the desktop website and removed in April      citing low usage                           

Dedicated encrypted search page
Various search engines provide encrypted Web search facilities  In May      Google rolled out SSL encrypted web search               The encrypted search was accessed at encrypted google com              However  the web search is encrypted via Transport Layer Security  TLS  by default today  thus every search request should be automatically encrypted if TLS is supported by the web browser               On its support website  Google announced that the address encrypted google com would be turned off April           stating that all Google products and most new browsers use HTTPS connections as the reason for the discontinuation              

Real Time Search
Google Real Time Search was a feature of Google Search in which search results also sometimes included real time information from sources such as Twitter  Facebook  blogs  and news websites               The feature was introduced on December                       and went offline on July          after the deal with Twitter expired               Real Time Search included Facebook status updates beginning on February                        A feature similar to Real Time Search was already available on Microsoft s Bing search engine  which showed results from Twitter and Facebook               The interface for the engine showed a live  descending  river  of posts in the main region  which could be paused or resumed   while a bar chart metric of the frequency of posts containing a certain search term or hashtag was located on the right hand corner of the page above a list of most frequently reposted posts and outgoing links  Hashtag search links were also supported  as were  promoted  tweets hosted by Twitter  located persistently on top of the river  and thumbnails of retweeted image or video links 
In January       geolocation links of posts were made available alongside results in Real Time Search  In addition  posts containing syndicated or attached shortened links were made searchable by the link  query option  In July       Real Time Search became inaccessible  with the Real Time link in the Google sidebar disappearing and a custom     error page generated by Google returned at its former URL  Google originally suggested that the interruption was temporary and related to the launch of Google                they subsequently announced that it was due to the expiry of a commercial arrangement with Twitter to provide access to tweets
