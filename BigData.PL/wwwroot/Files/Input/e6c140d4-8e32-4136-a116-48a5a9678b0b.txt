Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley  UK    w lst nkr  ft  WUUL st n krahft  US    kr ft          kraft             n e      Godwin     August          February       was an English novelist who wrote the Gothic novel Frankenstein  or  The Modern Prometheus         which is considered an early example of science fiction             She also edited and promoted the works of her husband  the Romantic poet and philosopher Percy Bysshe Shelley  Her father was the political philosopher William Godwin and her mother was the philosopher and women s rights advocate Mary Wollstonecraft 
Mary s mother died    days after giving birth to her  She was raised by her father  who provided her with a rich informal education  encouraging her to adhere to his own anarchist political theories  When she was four  her father married a neighbour  Mary Jane Clairmont  with whom Mary had a troubled relationship                       
In       Mary began a romance with one of her father s political followers  Percy Bysshe Shelley  who was already married  Together with her stepsister  Claire Clairmont  she and Percy left for France and travelled through Europe  Upon their return to England  Mary was pregnant with Percy s child  Over the next two years  she and Percy faced ostracism  constant debt and the death of their prematurely born daughter  They married in late       after the suicide of Percy Shelley s wife  Harriet            
In       the couple and Mary s stepsister famously spent a summer with Lord Byron and John William Polidori near Geneva  Switzerland  where Shelley conceived the idea for her novel Frankenstein  The Shelleys left Britain in      for Italy  where their second and third children died before Shelley gave birth to her last and only surviving child  Percy Florence Shelley  In       her husband drowned when his sailboat sank during a storm near Viareggio  A year later  Shelley returned to England and from then on devoted herself to raising her son and her career as a professional author  The last decade of her life was dogged by illness  most likely caused by the brain tumour which killed her at the age of    
Until the     s  Shelley was known mainly for her efforts to publish her husband s works and for her novel Frankenstein  which remains widely read and has inspired many theatrical and film adaptations  Recent scholarship has yielded a more comprehensive view of Shelley s achievements  Scholars have shown increasing interest in her literary output  particularly in her novels  which include the historical novels Valperga        and Perkin Warbeck         the apocalyptic novel The Last Man        and her final two novels  Lodore        and Falkner         Studies of her lesser known works  such as the travel book Rambles in Germany and Italy        and the biographical articles for Dionysius Lardner s Cabinet Cyclopaedia              support the growing view that Shelley remained a political radical throughout her life  Shelley s works often argue that cooperation and sympathy  particularly as practised by women in the family  were the ways to reform civil society  This view was a direct challenge to the individualistic Romantic ethos promoted by Percy Shelley and the Enlightenment political theories articulated by her father  William Godwin 


Life and career
Early life
Page from William Godwin s journal recording  Birth of Mary     minutes after    at night   left column  fourth row 
Mary Shelley was born Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin in Somers Town  London  in       She was the second child of the feminist philosopher  educator  and writer Mary Wollstonecraft and the first child of the philosopher  novelist  and journalist William Godwin  Wollstonecraft died of puerperal fever shortly after Mary was born  Godwin was left to bring up Mary  along with her older half sister  Fanny Imlay  Wollstonecraft s child by the American speculator Gilbert Imlay             A year after Wollstonecraft s death  Godwin published his Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman         which he intended as a sincere and compassionate tribute  However  because the Memoirs revealed Wollstonecraft s affairs and her illegitimate child  they were seen as shocking  Mary Godwin read these memoirs and her mother s books  and was brought up to cherish her mother s memory            
Mary s earliest years were happy  judging from the letters of William Godwin s housekeeper and nurse  Louisa Jones             But Godwin was often deeply in debt  feeling that he could not raise the children by himself  he cast about for a second wife              In December       he married Mary Jane Clairmont  a well educated woman with two young children of her own   Charles and Claire      note        Most of Godwin s friends disliked his new wife  describing her as quick tempered and quarrelsome                  note        but Godwin was devoted to her  and the marriage was a success              Mary Godwin  in contrast  came to detest her stepmother             William Godwin s   th century biographer Charles Kegan Paul later suggested that Mrs Godwin had favoured her own children over those of Mary Wollstonecraft            
Together  the Godwins started a publishing firm called M  J  Godwin  which sold children s books as well as stationery  maps  and games  However  the business did not turn a profit  and Godwin was forced to borrow substantial sums to keep it going              He continued to borrow to pay off earlier loans  compounding his difficulties  By       Godwin s business was close to failure  and he was  near to despair               Godwin was saved from debtor s prison by philosophical devotees such as Francis Place  who lent him further money

Though Mary Godwin received little formal education  her father tutored her in a broad range of subjects  He often took the children on educational outings  and they had access to his library and to the many intellectuals who visited him  including the Romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge and the former vice president of the United States Aaron Burr              Godwin admitted he was not educating the children according to Mary Wollstonecraft s philosophy as outlined in works such as A Vindication of the Rights of Woman         but Mary Godwin nonetheless received an unusual and advanced education for a girl of the time  She had a governess and a daily tutor and read many of her father s children s books on Roman and Greek history in manuscript              For six months in       she also attended a boarding school in Ramsgate              Her father described her at age    as  singularly bold  somewhat imperious  and active of mind  Her desire of knowledge is great  and her perseverance in everything she undertakes almost invincible              
In June       Mary s father sent her to stay with the dissenting family of the radical William Baxter  near Dundee  Scotland              To Baxter  he wrote   I am anxious that she should be brought up               like a philosopher  even like a cynic               Scholars have speculated that she was sent away for her health  to remove her from the seamy side of the business  or to introduce her to radical politics              Mary Godwin revelled in the spacious surroundings of Baxter s house and in the companionship of his four daughters  and she returned north in the summer of      for a further stay of    months              In the      introduction to Frankenstein  she recalled   I wrote then but in a most common place style  It was beneath the trees of the grounds belonging to our house  or on the bleak sides of the woodless mountains near  that my true compositions  the airy flights of my imagination  were born and fostered              

Percy Bysshe Shelley
On    June       Mary Godwin declared her love for Percy Shelley at Mary Wollstonecraft s graveside in the churchyard of St Pancras Old Church  shown here in                   
Mary Godwin may have first met the radical poet philosopher Percy Bysshe Shelley in the interval between her two stays in Scotland              By the time she returned home for a second time on    March       Percy Shelley had become estranged from his wife and was regularly visiting William Godwin  whom he had agreed to bail out of debt              Percy Shelley s radicalism  particularly his economic views  which he had imbibed from William Godwin s Political Justice         had alienated him from his wealthy aristocratic family  they wanted him to follow traditional models of the landed aristocracy  and he wanted to donate large amounts of the family s money to schemes intended to help the disadvantaged  Percy Shelley  therefore  had difficulty gaining access to money until he inherited his estate because his family did not want him wasting it on projects of  political justice   After several months of promises  Shelley announced that he either could not or would not pay off all of Godwin s debts  Godwin was angry and felt betrayed             
Mary and Percy began meeting each other secretly at her mother Mary Wollstonecraft s grave in the churchyard of St Pancras Old Church  and they fell in love she was     and he was                 On    June       Shelley and Godwin declared their love for one another as Shelley announced he could not hide his  ardent passion   leading her in a  sublime and rapturous moment  to say she felt the same way  on either that day or the next  Godwin lost her virginity to Shelley  which tradition claims happened in the churchyard              Godwin described herself as attracted to Shelley s  wild  intellectual  unearthly looks               To Mary s dismay  her father disapproved  and tried to thwart the relationship and salvage the  spotless fame  of his daughter  At about the same time  Mary s father learned of Shelley s inability to pay off the father s debts              Mary  who later wrote of  my excessive and romantic attachment to my father               was confused  She saw Percy Shelley as an embodiment of her parents  liberal and reformist ideas of the     s  particularly Godwin s view that marriage was a repressive monopoly  which he had argued in his      edition of Political Justice but later retracted              On    July       the couple eloped and secretly left for France  taking Mary s stepsister  Claire Clairmont  with them             
After convincing Mary Jane Godwin  who had pursued them to Calais  that they did not wish to return  the trio travelled to Paris  and then  by donkey  mule  carriage  and foot  through a France recently ravaged by war  to Switzerland   It was acting in a novel  being an incarnate romance   Mary Shelley recalled in                   Godwin wrote about France in        The distress of the inhabitants  whose houses had been burned  their cattle killed and all their wealth destroyed  has given a sting to my detestation of war                  As they travelled  Mary and Percy read works by Mary Wollstonecraft and others  kept a joint journal  and continued their own writing              At Lucerne  lack of money forced the three to turn back  They travelled down the Rhine and by land to the Dutch port of Maassluis  arriving at Gravesend  Kent  on    September                  

Percy Bysshe Shelley was inspired by the radicalism of Godwin s Political Justice         When the poet Robert Southey met Shelley  he felt as if he were seeing himself from the     s               Portrait by Amelia Curran        
The situation awaiting Mary Godwin in England was fraught with complications  some of which she had not foreseen  Either before or during the journey  she had become pregnant  She and Percy now found themselves penniless  and  to Mary s genuine surprise  her father refused to have anything to do with her              The couple moved with Claire into lodgings at Somers Town  and later  Nelson Square  They maintained their intense programme of reading and writing  and entertained Percy Shelley s friends  such as Thomas Jefferson Hogg and the writer Thomas Love Peacock              Percy Shelley sometimes left home for short periods to dodge creditors              The couple s distraught letters reveal their pain at these separations             
Pregnant and often ill  Mary Godwin had to cope with Percy s joy at the birth of his son by Harriet Shelley in late      and his constant outings with Claire Clairmont      note        Shelley and Clairmont were almost certainly lovers  which caused much jealousy on Godwin s part              Shelley greatly offended Godwin at one point when  during a walk in the French countryside  he suggested that they both take the plunge into a stream naked  this offended her principles              She was partly consoled by the visits of Hogg  whom she disliked at first but soon considered a close friend              Percy Shelley seems to have wanted Mary Godwin and Hogg to become lovers              Mary did not dismiss the idea  since in principle she believed in free love              In practice  however  she loved only Percy Shelley and seems to have ventured no further than flirting with Hogg                  note        On    February       she gave birth to a two month premature baby girl  who was not expected to survive              On   March  she wrote to Hogg 

My dearest Hogg my baby is dead will you come to see me as soon as you can  I wish to see you It was perfectly well when I went to bed I awoke in the night to give it suck it appeared to be sleeping so quietly that I would not awake it  It was dead then  but we did not find that out till morning from its appearance it evidently died of convulsions Will you come you are so calm a creature  amp  Shelley is afraid of a fever from the milk for I am no longer a mother now             
The loss of her child induced acute depression in Mary Godwin  who was haunted by visions of the baby  but she conceived again and had recovered by the summer              With a revival in Percy Shelley s finances after the death of his grandfather  Sir Bysshe Shelley  the couple holidayed in Torquay and then rented a two storey cottage at Bishopsgate  on the edge of Windsor Great Park              Little is known about this period in Mary Godwin s life  for her journal from May      to July      is lost  At Bishopsgate  Percy wrote his poem Alastor  or The Spirit of Solitude  and on    January       Mary gave birth to a second child  William  named after her father  and soon nicknamed  Willmouse   In her novel  The Last Man  she later imagined Windsor as a Garden of Eden             

Lake Geneva and Frankenstein
Draft of Frankenstein  or  The Modern Prometheus   It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld my man completed           
In May       Mary Godwin  Percy Shelley  and their son travelled to Geneva with Claire Clairmont  They planned to spend the summer with the poet Lord Byron  whose recent affair with Claire had left her pregnant              In History of a Six Weeks  Tour through a part of France  Switzerland  Germany and Holland         she describes the particularly desolate landscape in crossing from France into Switzerland             
The party arrived in Geneva on    May       where Mary called herself  Mrs Shelley   Byron joined them on    May  with his young physician  John William Polidori              and rented the Villa Diodati  close to Lake Geneva at the village of Cologny  Percy Shelley rented a smaller building called Maison Chapuis on the waterfront nearby              They spent their time writing  boating on the lake  and talking late into the night             
 It proved a wet  ungenial summer   Mary Shelley remembered in        and incessant rain often confined us for days to the house                   note        Sitting around a log fire at Byron s villa  the company amused themselves with German ghost stories  which prompted Byron to propose that they  each write a ghost story                           Unable to think of a story  young Mary Godwin became anxious   Have you thought of a story  I was asked each morning  and each morning I was forced to reply with a mortifying negative               During one mid June evening  the discussions turned to the nature of the principle of life   Perhaps a corpse would be re animated   Mary noted   galvanism had given token of such things               It was after midnight before they retired  and unable to sleep  she became possessed by her imagination as she beheld the grim terrors of her  waking dream   her ghost story             

I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together  I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out  and then  on the working of some powerful engine  show signs of life  and stir with an uneasy  half vital motion  Frightful must it be  for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world                  note       
She began writing what she assumed would be a short story  With Percy Shelley s encouragement  she expanded this tale into her first novel  Frankenstein  or  The Modern Prometheus  published in                   She later described that summer in Switzerland as the moment  when I first stepped out from childhood into life               The story of the writing of Frankenstein has been fictionalised several times and has formed the basis for a number of films 
In September       the astronomer Donald Olson  after a visit to the Lake Geneva villa the previous year  and inspecting data about the motion of the moon and stars  concluded that her waking dream took place  between  am and  am  on    June       several days after the initial idea by Lord Byron that they each write a ghost story             

Authorship of Frankenstein
While her husband Percy encouraged her writing  the extent of Percy s contribution to the novel is unknown and has been argued over by readers and critics              Mary Shelley wrote   I certainly did not owe the suggestion of one incident  nor scarcely of one train of feeling  to my husband  and yet but for his incitement  it would never have taken the form in which it was presented to the world   She wrote that the preface to the first edition was Percy s work  as far as I can recollect   There are differences in the            and      editions  which have been attributed to Percy s editing  James Rieger concluded Percy s  assistance at every point in the book s manufacture was so extensive that one hardly knows whether to regard him as editor or minor collaborator   while Anne K  Mellor later argued Percy only  made many technical corrections and several times clarified the narrative and thematic continuity of the text               Charles E  Robinson  editor of a facsimile edition of the Frankenstein manuscripts  concluded that Percy s contributions to the book  were no more than what most publishers  editors have provided new  or old  authors or  in fact  what colleagues have provided to each other after reading each other s works in progress              
Writing on the    th anniversary of Frankenstein  literary scholar and poet Fiona Sampson asked   Why hasn t Mary Shelley gotten the respect she deserves               She noted that  In recent years Percy s corrections  visible in the Frankenstein notebooks held at the Bodleian Library in Oxford  have been seized on as evidence that he must have at least co authored the novel  In fact  when I examined the notebooks myself  I realized that Percy did rather less than any line editor working in publishing today               Sampson published her findings in In Search of Mary Shelley         one of many biographies written about Shelley 

Bath and Marlow
On their return to England in September       Mary and Percy moved with Claire Clairmont  who took lodgings nearby to Bath  where they hoped to keep Claire s pregnancy secret              At Cologny  Mary Godwin had received two letters from her half sister  Fanny Imlay  who alluded to her  unhappy life   on   October  Fanny wrote an  alarming letter  from Bristol that sent Percy Shelley racing off to search for her  without success  On the morning of    October  Fanny Imlay was found dead in a room at a Swansea inn  along with a suicide note and a laudanum bottle  On    December  Percy Shelley s wife  Harriet  was discovered drowned in the Serpentine  a lake in Hyde Park  London              Both suicides were hushed up  Harriet s family obstructed Percy Shelley s efforts fully supported by Mary Godwin to assume custody of his two children by Harriet  His lawyers advised him to improve his case by marrying  so he and Mary  who was pregnant again  married on    December      at St Mildred s Church  Bread Street  London              Her father gave consent to her marriage as required for a minor aged under twenty one and Mr and Mrs Godwin were present as witnesses who signed the register   the marriage ending the family rift                         
Claire Clairmont gave birth to a baby girl on    January  at first called Alba  later Allegra                  note        In March of that year  the Chancery Court ruled Percy Shelley morally unfit to assume custody of his children and later placed them with a clergyman s family              Also in March  the Shelleys moved with Claire and Alba to Albion House at Marlow  Buckinghamshire  a large  damp building on the river Thames  There Mary Shelley gave birth to her third child  Clara  on   September  At Marlow  they entertained their new friends Marianne and Leigh Hunt  worked hard at their writing  and often discussed politics             
Early in the summer of       Mary Shelley finished Frankenstein  which was published anonymously in January       Reviewers and readers assumed that Percy Shelley was the author  since the book was published with his preface and dedicated to his political hero William Godwin              At Marlow  Mary edited the joint journal of the group s      Continental journey  adding material written in Switzerland in       along with Percy s poem  Mont Blanc   The result was the History of a Six Weeks  Tour  published in November       That autumn  Percy Shelley often lived away from home in London to evade creditors  The threat of a debtor s prison  combined with their ill health and fears of losing custody of their children  contributed to the couple s decision to leave England for Italy on    March       taking Claire Clairmont and Alba with them              They had no intention of returning             

Italy
William  Willmouse  Shelley  painted just before his death from malaria in       portrait by Amelia Curran       
One of the party s first tasks on arriving in Italy was to hand Alba over to Byron  who was living in Venice  He had agreed to raise her so long as Claire had nothing more to do with her              The Shelleys then embarked on a roving existence  never settling in any one place for long                  note        Along the way  they accumulated a circle of friends and acquaintances who often moved with them  The couple devoted their time to writing  reading  learning  sightseeing  and socialising  The Italian adventure was  however  blighted for Mary Shelley by the deaths of both her children Clara  in September      in Venice  and William  in June      in Rome                  note        These losses left her in a deep depression that isolated her from Percy Shelley              who wrote in his notebook 


My dearest Mary  wherefore hast thou gone 
And left me in this dreary world alone 
Thy form is here indeed a lovely one 
But thou art fled  gone down a dreary road
That leads to Sorrow s most obscure abode 
For thine own sake I cannot follow thee
Do thou return for mine             


For a time  Mary Shelley found comfort only in her writing              The birth of her fourth child  Percy Florence  on    November       finally lifted her spirits              though she nursed the memory of her lost children till the end of her life             
Italy provided the Shelleys  Byron  and other exiles with political freedom unattainable at home  Despite its associations with personal loss  Italy became for Mary Shelley  a country which memory painted as paradise               Their Italian years were a time of intense intellectual and creative activity for both Shelleys  While Percy composed a series of major poems  Mary wrote the novel Matilda              the historical novel Valperga  and the plays Proserpine and Midas  Mary wrote Valperga to help alleviate her father s financial difficulties  as Percy refused to assist him further              She was often physically ill  however  and prone to depressions  She also had to cope with Percy s interest in other women  such as Sophia Stacey  Emilia Viviani  and Jane Williams              Since Mary Shelley shared his belief in the non exclusivity of marriage  she formed emotional ties of her own among the men and women of their circle  She became particularly fond of the Greek revolutionary Prince Alexandros Mavrokordatos and of Jane and Edward Williams                  note        
In December       the Shelleys travelled south with Claire Clairmont and their servants to Naples  where they stayed for three months  receiving only one visitor  a physician              In       they found themselves plagued by accusations and threats from Paolo and Elise Foggi  former servants whom Percy Shelley had dismissed in Naples shortly after the Foggis had married              The pair revealed that on    February      in Naples  Percy Shelley had registered as his child by Mary Shelley a two month old baby girl named Elena Adelaide Shelley               The Foggis also claimed that Claire Clairmont was the baby s mother               Biographers have offered various interpretations of these events  that Percy Shelley decided to adopt a local child  that the baby was his by Elise  Claire  or an unknown woman  or that she was Elise s by Byron                   note         Mary Shelley insisted she would have known if Claire had been pregnant  but it is unclear how much she really knew               The events in Naples  a city Mary Shelley later called a paradise inhabited by devils               remain shrouded in mystery      note         The only certainty is that she herself was not the child s mother               Elena Adelaide Shelley died in Naples on   June                   
After leaving Naples  the Shelleys settled in Rome  the city where her husband wrote  the meanest streets were strewed with truncated columns  broken capitals   and sparkling fragments of granite or porphyry   The voice of dead time  in still vibrations  is breathed from these dumb things  animated and glorified as they were by man                Rome inspired her to begin writing the unfinished novel Valerius  the Reanimated Roman  where the eponymous hero resists the decay of Rome and the machinations of  superstitious  Catholicism               The writing of her novel was broken off when her son William died of malaria               Shelley bitterly commented that she had come to Italy to improve her husband s health  and instead the Italian climate had just killed her two children  leading her to write   May you my dear Marianne never know what it is to lose two only and lovely children in one year to watch their dying moments and then at last to be left childless and forever miserable                To deal with her grief  Shelley wrote the novella The Fields of Fancy  which became Matilda  dealing with a young woman whose beauty inspired incestuous love in her father  who ultimately commits suicide to stop himself from acting on his passion for his daughter  while she spends the rest of her life full of despair about  the unnatural love I had inspired                The novella offered a feminist critique of a patriarchal society as Matilda is punished in the afterlife  though she did nothing to encourage her father s feelings              

Claire Clairmont  Mary s stepsister and mistress of Lord Byron  portrait by Amelia Curran       
In the summer of       a pregnant Mary moved with Percy  Claire  and Edward and Jane Williams to the isolated Villa Magni  at the sea s edge near the hamlet of San Terenzo in the Bay of Lerici  Once they were settled in  Percy broke the  evil news  to Claire that her daughter Allegra had died of typhus in a convent at Bagnacavallo               Mary Shelley was distracted and unhappy in the cramped and remote Villa Magni  which she came to regard as a dungeon               On    June  she miscarried  losing so much blood that she nearly died  Rather than wait for a doctor  Percy sat her in a bath of ice to stanch the bleeding  an act the doctor later told him saved her life               All was not well between the couple that summer  however  and Percy spent more time with Jane Williams than with his depressed and debilitated wife               Much of the short poetry Shelley wrote at San Terenzo involved Jane rather than Mary              
The coast offered Percy Shelley and Edward Williams the chance to enjoy their  perfect plaything for the summer   a new sailing boat               The boat had been designed by Daniel Roberts and an admirer of Byron  Edward Trelawny  who had joined the party in January                    On   July       Percy Shelley  Edward Ellerker Williams  and Captain Daniel Roberts sailed south down the coast to Livorno  There Percy Shelley discussed with Byron and Leigh Hunt the launch of a radical magazine called The Liberal               On   July  he and Edward Williams set out on the return journey to Lerici with their eighteen year old boat boy  Charles Vivian               They never reached their destination  A letter arrived at Villa Magni from Hunt to Percy Shelley  dated   July  saying   pray write to tell us how you got home  for they say you had bad weather after you sailed Monday  amp  we are anxious                 The paper fell from me   Mary told a friend later   I trembled all over                She and Jane Williams rushed desperately to Livorno and then to Pisa in the fading hope that their husbands were still alive  Ten days after the storm  three bodies washed up on the coast near Viareggio  midway between Livorno and Lerici  Trelawny  Byron  and Hunt cremated Percy Shelley s corpse on the beach at Viareggio              

Return to England and writing career


  Frankenstein  is the most wonderful work to have been written at twenty years of age that I ever heard of  You are now five and twenty  And  most fortunately  you have pursued a course of reading and cultivated your mind in a manner the most admirably adapted to make you a great and successful author  If you cannot be independent  who should be  


  William Godwin to Mary Shelley             

After her husband s death  Mary Shelley lived for a year with Leigh Hunt and his family in Genoa  where she often saw Byron and transcribed his poems  She resolved to live by her pen and for her son  but her financial situation was precarious  On    July       she left Genoa for England and stayed with her father and stepmother in the Strand until a small advance from her father in law enabled her to lodge nearby               Sir Timothy Shelley had at first agreed to support his grandson  Percy Florence  only if he were handed over to an appointed guardian  Mary Shelley rejected this idea instantly               She managed instead to wring out of Sir Timothy a limited annual allowance  which she had to repay when Percy Florence inherited the estate   but to the end of his days  he refused to meet her in person and dealt with her only through lawyers  Mary Shelley busied herself with editing her husband s poems  among other literary endeavours  but concern for her son restricted her options  Sir Timothy threatened to stop the allowance if any biography of the poet were published               In       Percy Florence became the legal heir of the Shelley estate after the death of his half brother Charles Shelley  his father s son by Harriet Shelley  Sir Timothy raised Mary s allowance from      a year to      but remained as difficult as ever               Mary Shelley enjoyed the stimulating society of William Godwin s circle  but poverty prevented her from socialising as she wished  She also felt ostracised by those who  like Sir Timothy  still disapproved of her relationship with Percy Bysshe Shelley              
In the summer of       Mary Shelley moved to Kentish Town in north London to be near Jane Williams  She may have been  in the words of her biographer Muriel Spark   a little in love  with Jane  Jane later disillusioned her by gossiping that Percy had preferred her to Mary  owing to Mary s inadequacy as a wife               At around this time  Mary Shelley was working on her novel  The Last Man         and she assisted a series of friends who were writing memoirs of Byron and Percy Shelley the beginnings of her attempts to immortalise her husband               She also met the American actor John Howard Payne and the American writer Washington Irving  who intrigued her  Payne fell in love with her and in      asked her to marry him  She refused  saying that after being married to one genius  she could only marry another               Payne accepted the rejection  and tried   without success   to talk his friend Irving into proposing himself  Mary Shelley was aware of Payne s plan  but how seriously she took it is unclear

In       Mary Shelley was party to a scheme that enabled her friend Isabel Robinson and Isabel s lover  Mary Diana Dods  who wrote under the name David Lyndsay  to embark on a life together in France as husband and wife                   note         With the help of Payne  whom she kept in the dark about the details  Mary Shelley obtained false passports for the couple               In       she fell ill with smallpox while visiting them in Paris  weeks later she recovered  unscarred but without her youthful beauty              
During the period          Mary Shelley was busy as an editor and writer  She wrote the novels The Fortunes of Perkin Warbeck         Lodore         and Falkner         She contributed five volumes of Lives of Italian  Spanish  Portuguese  and French authors to Dionysius Lardner s Cabinet Cyclopaedia  She also wrote stories for ladies  magazines  She was still helping to support her father  and they looked out for publishers for each other               In       she sold the copyright for a new edition of Frankenstein for     to Henry Colburn and Richard Bentley for their new Standard Novels series               After her father s death in      at the age of eighty  she began assembling his letters and a memoir for publication  as he had requested in his will  but after two years of work  she abandoned the project               Throughout this period  she also championed Percy Shelley s poetry  promoting its publication and quoting it in her writing  By       Percy s works were well known and increasingly admired               In the summer of      Edward Moxon  the publisher of Tennyson and the son in law of Charles Lamb  proposed publishing an edition of the collected works of Percy Shelley  Mary wanted to include in this collection an unexpurgated version of Percy Shelley s epic poem Queen Mab        Moxon wanted to leave out the most radical passages as too shocking and atheistical  but Mary prevailed  thanks to Harriet de Boinville  who agreed to Mary s request to borrow her own original copy gifted by Percy Shelley               Mary was paid      to edit the Poetical Works         which Sir Timothy insisted should not include a biography  Mary found a way to tell the story of Percy s life  nonetheless  she included extensive biographical notes about the poems              
Shelley continued to practise her mother s feminist principles by extending aid to women of whom society disapproved               For instance  Shelley extended financial aid to Mary Diana Dods  a single mother and illegitimate herself  who appears to have been a lesbian  and gave her the new identity of Walter Sholto Douglas  husband of her lover Isabel Robinson               Shelley also assisted Georgiana Paul  a woman disallowed for by her husband for alleged adultery               Shelley wrote in her diary about her assistance to the latter   I do not make a boast I do not say aloud behold my generosity and greatness of mind for in truth it is simple justice I perform and so I am still reviled for being worldly               
Mary Shelley continued to treat potential romantic partners with caution  In       she met and flirted with the French writer Prosper M rim e  but her one surviving letter to him appears to be a deflection of his declaration of love               She was delighted when her old friend from Italy  Edward Trelawny  returned to England  and they joked about marriage in their letters               Their friendship had altered  however  following her refusal to cooperate with his proposed biography of Percy Shelley  and he later reacted angrily to her omission of the atheistic section of Queen Mab from Percy Shelley s poems               Oblique references in her journals  from the early     s until the early     s  suggest that Mary Shelley had feelings for the radical politician Aubrey Beauclerk  who may have disappointed her by twice marrying others                   note        
Mary Shelley s first concern during these years was the welfare of Percy Florence  She honoured her late husband s wish that his son attend public school and  with Sir Timothy s grudging help  had him educated at Harrow  To avoid boarding fees  she moved to Harrow on the Hill herself so that Percy could attend as a day scholar               Though Percy went on to Trinity College  Cambridge  and dabbled in politics and the law  he showed no sign of his parents  gifts              

Final years and death
In      and       mother and son travelled together on the continent  journeys that Mary Shelley recorded in Rambles in Germany and Italy in            and                           In       Sir Timothy Shelley finally died at the age of ninety   falling from the stalk like an overblown flower   as Mary put it               For the first time  she and her son were financially independent  though the estate proved less valuable than they had hoped

In the mid     s  Mary Shelley found herself the target of three separate blackmailers  In       an Italian political exile called Gatteschi  whom she had met in Paris  threatened to publish letters she had sent him  A friend of her son bribed a police chief into seizing Gatteschi s papers  including the letters  which were then destroyed               Shortly afterwards  Mary Shelley bought some letters written by herself and Percy Bysshe Shelley from a man calling himself G  Byron and posing as the illegitimate son of the late Lord Byron               Also in       Percy Bysshe Shelley s cousin Thomas Medwin approached her  claiming to have written a damaging biography of Percy Shelley  He said he would suppress it in return for       but Mary Shelley refused                   note          

In order to fulfil Shelley s wishes  Percy Florence and his wife Jane had the coffins of her parents exhumed and buried with her in Bournemouth              
In       Percy Florence married Jane Gibson St John  The marriage proved a happy one  and Mary Shelley and Jane were fond of each other               Mary lived with her son and daughter in law at Field Place  Sussex  the Shelleys  ancestral home  and at Chester Square  London  and accompanied them on travels abroad              
Mary Shelley s last years were blighted by illness  From       she suffered from headaches and bouts of paralysis in parts of her body  which sometimes prevented her from reading and writing               On   February       at Chester Square  she died at the age of fifty three from what her physician suspected was a brain tumour  According to Jane Shelley  Mary Shelley had asked to be buried with her mother and father  but Percy and Jane  judging the graveyard at St Pancras to be  dreadful   chose to bury her instead at St Peter s Church  Bournemouth  near their new home at Boscombe               On the first anniversary of Mary Shelley s death  the Shelleys opened her box desk  Inside they found locks of her dead children s hair  a notebook she had shared with Percy Bysshe Shelley  and a copy of his poem Adona s with one page folded round a silk parcel containing some of his ashes and the remains of his heart             

Literary themes and styles
Mary Shelley lived a literary life  Her father encouraged her to learn to write by composing letters               and her favourite occupation as a child was writing stories               Unfortunately  all of Mary s juvenilia were lost when she ran off with Percy in       and none of her surviving manuscripts can be definitively dated before that year               Her first published work is often thought to have been Mounseer Nongtongpaw               comic verses written for Godwin s Juvenile Library when she was ten and a half  however  the poem is attributed to another writer in the most recent authoritative collection of her works               Percy Shelley enthusiastically encouraged Mary Shelley s writing   My husband was  from the first  very anxious that I should prove myself worthy of my parentage  and enrol myself on the page of fame  He was forever inciting me to obtain literary reputation               

Novels
Autobiographical elements
Certain sections of Mary Shelley s novels are often interpreted as masked rewritings of her life  Critics have pointed to the recurrence of the father daughter motif in particular as evidence of this autobiographical style               For example  commentators frequently read Mathilda        autobiographically  identifying the three central characters as versions of Mary Shelley  William Godwin  and Percy Shelley               Mary Shelley herself confided that she modelled the central characters of The Last Man on her Italian circle  Lord Raymond  who leaves England to fight for the Greeks and dies in Constantinople  is based on Lord Byron  and the utopian Adrian  Earl of Windsor  who leads his followers in search of a natural paradise and dies when his boat sinks in a storm  is a fictional portrait of Percy Bysshe Shelley               However  as she wrote in her review of Godwin s novel Cloudesley         she did not believe that authors  were merely copying from our own hearts                William Godwin regarded his daughter s characters as types rather than portraits from real life               Some modern critics  such as Patricia Clemit and Jane Blumberg  have taken the same view  resisting autobiographical readings of Mary Shelley s works              

Novelistic genres


  Euthanasia  was never heard of more  even her name perished    The private chronicles  from which the foregoing relation has been collected  end with the death of Euthanasia  It is therefore in public histories alone that we find an account of the last years of the life of Castruccio  


  From Mary Shelley  Valperga             

Mary Shelley employed the techniques of many different novelistic genres  most vividly the Godwinian novel  Walter Scott s new historical novel  and the Gothic novel  The Godwinian novel  made popular during the     s with works such as Godwin s Caleb Williams          employed a Rousseauvian confessional form to explore the contradictory relations between the self and society                and Frankenstein exhibits many of the same themes and literary devices as Godwin s novel               However  Shelley critiques those Enlightenment ideals that Godwin promotes in his works               In The Last Man  she uses the philosophical form of the Godwinian novel to demonstrate the ultimate meaninglessness of the world               While earlier Godwinian novels had shown how rational individuals could slowly improve society  The Last Man and Frankenstein demonstrate the individual s lack of control over history              
Shelley uses the historical novel to comment on gender relations  for example  Valperga is a feminist version of Scott s masculinist genre               Introducing women into the story who are not part of the historical record  Shelley uses their narratives to question established theological and political institutions               Shelley sets the male protagonist s compulsive greed for conquest in opposition to a female alternative  reason and sensibility               In Perkin Warbeck  Shelley s other historical novel  Lady Gordon stands for the values of friendship  domesticity  and equality  Through her  Shelley offers a feminine alternative to the masculine power politics that destroy the male characters  The novel provides a more inclusive historical narrative to challenge the one which usually relates only masculine events              

Gender
With the rise of feminist literary criticism in the     s  Mary Shelley s works  particularly Frankenstein  began to attract much more attention from scholars  Feminist and psychoanalytic critics were largely responsible for the recovery from neglect of Shelley as a writer               Ellen Moers was one of the first to claim that Shelley s loss of a baby was a crucial influence on the writing of Frankenstein               She argues that the novel is a  birth myth  in which Shelley comes to terms with her guilt for causing her mother s death as well as for failing as a parent               Shelley scholar Anne K  Mellor suggests that  from a feminist viewpoint  it is a story  about what happens when a man tries to have a baby without a woman                Frankenstein  is profoundly concerned with natural as opposed to unnatural modes of production and reproduction                Victor Frankenstein s failure as a  parent  in the novel has been read as an expression of the anxieties which accompany pregnancy  giving birth  and particularly maternity              
Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar argue in their seminal book The Madwoman in the Attic        that in Frankenstein in particular  Shelley responded to the masculine literary tradition represented by John Milton s Paradise Lost  In their interpretation  Shelley reaffirms this masculine tradition  including the misogyny inherent in it  but at the same time  conceal s  fantasies of equality that occasionally erupt in monstrous images of rage                Mary Poovey reads the first edition of Frankenstein as part of a larger pattern in Shelley s writing  which begins with literary self assertion and ends with conventional femininity               Poovey suggests that Frankenstein s multiple narratives enable Shelley to split her artistic persona  she can  express and efface herself at the same time                Shelley s fear of self assertion is reflected in the fate of Frankenstein  who is punished for his egotism by losing all his domestic ties              
Feminist critics often focus on how authorship itself  particularly female authorship  is represented in and through Shelley s novels               As Mellor explains  Shelley uses the Gothic style not only to explore repressed female sexual desire              but also as way to  censor her own speech in Frankenstein                According to Poovey and Mellor  Shelley did not want to promote her own authorial persona and felt deeply inadequate as a writer  and  this shame contributed to the generation of her fictional images of abnormality  perversion  and destruction               
Shelley s writings focus on the role of the family in society and women s role within that family  She celebrates the  feminine affections and compassion  associated with the family and suggests that civil society will fail without them               Shelley was  profoundly committed to an ethic of cooperation  mutual dependence  and self sacrifice                In Lodore  for example  the central story follows the fortunes of the wife and daughter of the title character  Lord Lodore  who is killed in a duel at the end of the first volume  leaving a trail of legal  financial  and familial obstacles for the two  heroines  to negotiate  The novel is engaged with political and ideological issues  particularly the education and social role of women               It dissects a patriarchal culture that separated the sexes and pressured women into dependence on men  In the view of Shelley scholar Betty T  Bennett   the novel proposes egalitarian educational paradigms for women and men  which would bring social justice as well as the spiritual and intellectual means by which to meet the challenges life invariably brings                However  Falkner is the only one of Mary Shelley s novels in which the heroine s agenda triumphs               The novel s resolution proposes that when female values triumph over violent and destructive masculinity  men will be freed to express the  compassion  sympathy  and generosity  of their better natures              

Enlightenment and Romanticism
Frankenstein  like much Gothic fiction of the period  mixes a visceral and alienating subject matter with speculative and thought provoking themes               Rather than focusing on the twists and turns of the plot  however  the novel foregrounds the mental and moral struggles of the protagonist  Victor Frankenstein  and Shelley imbues the text with her own brand of politicised Romanticism  one that criticised the individualism and egotism of traditional Romanticism               Victor Frankenstein is like Satan in Paradise Lost  and Prometheus  he rebels against tradition  he creates life  and he shapes his own destiny  These traits are not portrayed positively  as Blumberg writes   his relentless ambition is a self delusion  clothed as quest for truth                He must abandon his family to fulfill his ambition

Mary Shelley believed in the Enlightenment idea that people could improve society through the responsible exercise of political power  but she feared that the irresponsible exercise of power would lead to chaos               In practice  her works largely criticise the way   th century thinkers such as her parents believed such change could be brought about  The creature in Frankenstein  for example  reads books associated with radical ideals but the education he gains from them is ultimately useless               Shelley s works reveal her as less optimistic than Godwin and Wollstonecraft  she lacks faith in Godwin s theory that humanity could eventually be perfected              
As literary scholar Kari Lokke writes  The Last Man  more so than Frankenstein   in its refusal to place humanity at the centre of the universe  its questioning of our privileged position in relation to nature               constitutes a profound and prophetic challenge to Western humanism                Specifically  Mary Shelley s allusions to what radicals believed was a failed revolution in France and the Godwinian  Wollstonecraftian  and Burkean responses to it  challenge  Enlightenment faith in the inevitability of progress through collective efforts                As in Frankenstein  Shelley  offers a profoundly disenchanted commentary on the age of revolution  which ends in a total rejection of the progressive ideals of her own generation                Not only does she reject these Enlightenment political ideals  but she also rejects the Romantic notion that the poetic or literary imagination can offer an alternative              

Politics
There is a new scholarly emphasis on Shelley as a lifelong reformer  deeply engaged in the liberal and feminist concerns of her day               In       she was thrilled by the Liberal uprising in Spain which forced the king to grant a constitution               In       she wrote articles for Leigh Hunt s periodical The Liberal and played an active role in the formulation of its outlook               She was delighted when the Whigs came back to power in      and at the prospect of the Reform Act          amp    Will     c                   
Critics have until recently cited Lodore and Falkner as evidence of increasing conservatism in Mary Shelley s later works  In       Mary Poovey influentially identified the retreat of Mary Shelley s reformist politics into the  separate sphere  of the domestic               Poovey suggested that Mary Shelley wrote Falkner to resolve her conflicted response to her father s combination of libertarian radicalism and stern insistence on social decorum               Mellor largely agreed  arguing that  Mary Shelley grounded her alternative political ideology on the metaphor of the peaceful  loving  bourgeois family  She thereby implicitly endorsed a conservative vision of gradual evolutionary reform                This vision allowed women to participate in the public sphere but it inherited the inequalities inherent in the bourgeois family              
However  in the last decade or so this view has been challenged  For example  Bennett claims that Mary Shelley s works reveal a consistent commitment to Romantic idealism and political reform              and Jane Blumberg s study of Shelley s early novels argues that her career cannot be easily divided into radical and conservative halves  She contends that  Shelley was never a passionate radical like her husband and her later lifestyle was not abruptly assumed nor was it a betrayal  She was in fact challenging the political and literary influences of her circle in her first work                In this reading  Shelley s early works are interpreted as a challenge to Godwin and Percy Bysshe Shelley s radicalism  Victor Frankenstein s  thoughtless rejection of family   for example  is seen as evidence of Shelley s constant concern for the domestic              

Short stories
Shelley frequently wrote stories to accompany prepared illustrations for gift books  such as this one  which accompanied  Transformation  in the      The Keepsake              
In the     s and     s  Mary Shelley frequently wrote short stories for gift books or annuals  including sixteen for The Keepsake  which was aimed at middle class women and bound in silk  with gilt edged pages               Mary Shelley s work in this genre has been described as that of a  hack writer  and  wordy and pedestrian                However  critic Charlotte Sussman points out that other leading writers of the day  such as the Romantic poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge  also took advantage of this profitable market  She explains that  the annuals were a major mode of literary production in the     s and     s   with The Keepsake the most successful              
Many of Shelley s stories are set in places or times far removed from early   th century Britain  such as Greece and the reign of Henry IV of France  Shelley was particularly interested in  the fragility of individual identity  and often depicted  the way a person s role in the world can be cataclysmically altered either by an internal emotional upheaval  or by some supernatural occurrence that mirrors an internal schism                In her stories  female identity is tied to a woman s short lived value in the marriage market while male identity can be sustained and transformed through the use of money               Although Mary Shelley wrote twenty one short stories for the annuals between      and       she always saw herself  above all  as a novelist  She wrote to Leigh Hunt   I write bad articles which help to make me miserable but I am going to plunge into a novel and hope that its clear water will wash off the mud of the magazines               

Travelogues
When they ran off to France in the summer of       Mary Godwin and Percy Shelley began a joint journal               which they published in      under the title History of a Six Weeks  Tour  adding four letters  two by each of them  based on their visit to Geneva in       along with Percy Shelley s poem  Mont Blanc   The work celebrates youthful love and political idealism and consciously follows the example of Mary Wollstonecraft and others who had combined travelling with writing               The perspective of the History is philosophical and reformist rather than that of a conventional travelogue  in particular  it addresses the effects of politics and war on France               The letters the couple wrote on the second journey confront the  great and extraordinary events  of the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo after his  Hundred Days  return in       They also explore the sublimity of Lake Geneva and Mont Blanc as well as the revolutionary legacy of the philosopher and novelist Jean Jacques Rousseau              
Mary Shelley s last full length book  written in the form of letters and published in       was Rambles in Germany and Italy in            and       which recorded her travels with her son Percy Florence and his university friends  In Rambles  Shelley follows the tradition of Mary Wollstonecraft s Letters Written in Sweden  Norway  and Denmark and her own A History of a Six Weeks  Tour in mapping her personal and political landscape through the discourse of sensibility and sympathy               For Shelley  building sympathetic connections between people is the way to build civil society and to increase knowledge   knowledge  to enlighten and free the mind from clinging deadening prejudices a wider circle of sympathy with our fellow creatures  these are the uses of travel                Between observations on scenery  culture  and  the people  especially in a political point of view                she uses the travelogue form to explore her roles as a widow and mother and to reflect on revolutionary nationalism in Italy                   note         She also records her  pilgrimage  to scenes associated with Percy Shelley               According to critic Clarissa Orr  Mary Shelley s adoption of a persona of philosophical motherhood gives Rambles the unity of a prose poem  with  death and memory as central themes                At the same time  Shelley makes an egalitarian case against monarchy  class distinctions  slavery  and war

Between      and       Mary Shelley wrote many biographies of notable Italian  Spanish  Portuguese  and French men and a few women for Dionysius Lardner s Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men  These formed part of Lardner s Cabinet Cyclopaedia  one of the best of many such series produced in the     s and     s in response to growing middle class demand for self education               Until the republication of these essays in       their significance within her body of work was not appreciated                   note         In the view of literary scholar Greg Kucich  they reveal Mary Shelley s  prodigious research across several centuries and in multiple languages   her gift for biographical narrative  and her interest in the  emerging forms of feminist historiography                Shelley wrote in a biographical style popularised by the   th century critic Samuel Johnson in his Lives of the Poets              combining secondary sources  memoir and anecdote  and authorial evaluation               She records details of each writer s life and character  quotes their writing in the original as well as in translation  and ends with a critical assessment of their achievement              
For Shelley  biographical writing was supposed to  in her words   form as it were a school in which to study the philosophy of history                and to teach  lessons   Most frequently and importantly  these lessons consisted of criticisms of male dominated institutions such as primogeniture               Shelley emphasises domesticity  romance  family  sympathy  and compassion in the lives of her subjects  Her conviction that such forces could improve society connects her biographical approach with that of other early feminist historians such as Mary Hays and Anna Jameson               Unlike her novels  most of which had an original print run of several hundred copies  the Lives had a print run of about       for each volume  thus  according to Kucich  Mary Shelley s  use of biography to forward the social agenda of women s historiography became one of her most influential political interventions               

Editorial work


 The qualities that struck anyone newly introduced to Shelley  were  first  a gentle and cordial goodness that animated his intercourse with warm affection  and helpful sympathy  The other  the eagerness and ardour with which he was attached to the cause of human happiness and improvement  


  Mary Shelley   Preface   Poetical Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley             

Soon after Percy Shelley s death  Mary Shelley determined to write his biography  In a letter of    November       she announced   I shall write his life  amp  thus occupy myself in the only manner from which I can derive consolation                However  her father in law  Sir Timothy Shelley  effectively banned her from doing so                   note         Mary began her fostering of Percy s poetic reputation in      with the publication of his Posthumous Poems  In       while she was working on the Lives  she prepared a new edition of his poetry  which became  in the words of literary scholar Susan J  Wolfson   the canonizing event  in the history of her husband s reputation               The following year  Mary Shelley edited a volume of her husband s essays  letters  translations  and fragments  and throughout the     s  she introduced his poetry to a wider audience by publishing assorted works in the annual The Keepsake              
Evading Sir Timothy s ban on a biography  Mary Shelley often included in these editions her own annotations and reflections on her husband s life and work                I am to justify his ways   she had declared in        I am to make him beloved to all posterity                It was this goal  argues Blumberg  that led her to present Percy s work to the public in the  most popular form possible                To tailor his works for a Victorian audience  she cast Percy Shelley as a lyrical rather than a political poet               As Mary Favret writes   the disembodied Percy identifies the spirit of poetry itself                Mary glossed Percy s political radicalism as a form of sentimentalism  arguing that his republicanism arose from sympathy for those who were suffering               She inserted romantic anecdotes of his benevolence  domesticity  and love of the natural world               Portraying herself as Percy s  practical muse   she also noted how she had suggested revisions as he wrote              
Despite the emotions stirred by this task  Mary Shelley arguably proved herself in many respects a professional and scholarly editor               Working from Percy s messy  sometimes indecipherable  notebooks  she attempted to form a chronology for his writings  and she included poems  such as Epipsychidion  addressed to Emilia Viviani  which she would rather have left out               She was forced  however  into several compromises  and  as Blumberg notes   modern critics have found fault with the edition and claim variously that she miscopied  misinterpreted  purposely obscured  and attempted to turn the poet into something he was not                According to Wolfson  Donald Reiman  a modern editor of Percy Bysshe Shelley s works  still refers to Mary Shelley s editions  while acknowledging that her editing style belongs  to an age of editing when the aim was not to establish accurate texts and scholarly apparatus but to present a full record of a writer s career for the general reader                In principle  Mary Shelley believed in publishing every last word of her husband s work               but she found herself obliged to omit certain passages  either by pressure from her publisher  Edward Moxon  or in deference to public propriety               For example  she removed the atheistic passages from Queen Mab for the first edition  After she restored them in the second edition  Moxon was prosecuted and convicted of blasphemous libel  though the prosecution was brought out of principle by the Chartist publisher Henry Hetherington  and no punishment was sought               Mary Shelley s omissions provoked criticism  often stinging  from members of Percy Shelley s former circle               and reviewers accused her of  among other things  indiscriminate inclusions               Her notes have nevertheless remained an essential source for the study of Percy Shelley s work  As Bennett explains   biographers and critics agree that Mary Shelley s commitment to bring Shelley the notice she believed his works merited was the single  major force that established Shelley s reputation during a period when he almost certainly would have faded from public view               

Reputation
Engraving by George Stodart after a monument of Mary and Percy Shelley by Henry Weekes       
In her own lifetime Mary Shelley was taken seriously as a writer  though reviewers often missed her writings  political edge  After her death  however  she was chiefly remembered as the wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley and as the author of Frankenstein               In fact  in the introduction to her letters published in       editor Frederick Jones wrote   a collection of the present size could not be justified by the general quality of the letters or by Mary Shelley s importance as a writer  It is as the wife of  Percy Bysshe Shelley  that she excites our interest                This attitude had not disappeared by      when Betty T  Bennett published the first volume of Mary Shelley s complete letters  As she explains   the fact is that until recent years scholars have generally regarded Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley as a result  William Godwin s and Mary Wollstonecraft s daughter who became Shelley s Pygmalion                It was not until Emily Sunstein s Mary Shelley  Romance and Reality in      that a full length scholarly biography was published              
The attempts of Mary Shelley s son and daughter in law to  Victorianise  her memory by censoring biographical documents contributed to a perception of Mary Shelley as a more conventional  less reformist figure than her works suggest  Her own timid omissions from Percy Shelley s works and her quiet avoidance of public controversy in her later years added to this impression  Commentary by Hogg  Trelawny  and other admirers of Percy Shelley also tended to downplay Mary Shelley s radicalism  Trelawny s Records of Shelley  Byron  and the Author        praised Percy Shelley at the expense of Mary  questioning her intelligence and even her authorship of Frankenstein               Lady Shelley  Percy Florence s wife  responded in part by presenting a severely edited collection of letters she had inherited  published privately as Shelley and Mary in                   
From Frankenstein s first theatrical adaptation in      to the cinematic adaptations of the   th century  including the first cinematic version in      and now famous versions such as James Whale s      Frankenstein  Mel Brooks  satirical      Young Frankenstein  and Kenneth Branagh s      Mary Shelley s Frankenstein  many audiences first encounter the work of Mary Shelley through adaptation               Over the course of the   th century  Mary Shelley came to be seen as a one novel author at best  rather than as the professional writer she was  most of her works have remained out of print until the last thirty years      when       obstructing a larger view of her achievement               In recent decades      when       the republication of almost all her writing has stimulated a new recognition of its value  Her habit of intensive reading and study  revealed in her journals and letters and reflected in her works  is now better appreciated               Shelley s conception of herself as an author has also been recognised  after Percy s death  she wrote of her authorial ambitions   I think that I can maintain myself  and there is something inspiriting in the idea                Scholars now consider Mary Shelley to be a major Romantic figure  significant for her literary achievement and her political voice as a woman and a liberal

Notes


  Claire s first name was  Jane   but from       see Gittings and Manton      she preferred to be called  Claire   her second name was  Clara    which is how she is known to history  To avoid confusion  this article calls her  Claire  throughout 

  William St Clair  in his biography of the Godwins and the Shelleys  notes that  it is easy to forget in reading of these crises  in the lives of the Godwins and the Shelleys  how unrepresentative the references in surviving documents may be  It is easy for the biographer to give undue weight to the opinions of the people who happen to have written things down        

   Journal   December Very Unwell  Shelley  amp  Clary walk out  as usual  to heaps of places   A letter from Hookham to say that Harriet has been brought to bed of a son and heir  Shelley writes a number of circular letters on this event  which ought to be ushered in with ringing of bells  etc   for it is the son of his wife   quoted in Spark      

  Sunstein speculates that Mary Shelley and Jefferson Hogg made love in April        Sunstein        

  The violent storms were  it is now known  a repercussion of the volcanic eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia in the previous year  Sunstein        See also The Year Without a Summer 

  Seymour argues that evidence from Polidori s diary conflicts with Mary Shelley s account of when the idea came to her       

  Alba was renamed  Allegra  in        Seymour      

  At various times  the Shelleys lived at Livorno  Bagni di Lucca  Venice  Este  Naples  Rome  Florence  Pisa  Bagni di Pisa  and San Terenzo 

  Clara died of dysentery at the age of one  and William of malaria at three and a half   Seymour           

  The Williamses were not technically married  Jane was still the wife of an army officer named Johnson 

  Elise had been employed by Byron as Allegra s nurse  Mary Shelley stated in a letter that Elise had been pregnant by Paolo at the time  which was the reason they had married  but not that she had had a child in Naples  Elise seems to have first met Paolo only in September  See Mary Shelley s letter to Isabella Hoppner     August       Selected Letters        

   Establishing Elena Adelaide s parentage is one of the greatest bafflements Shelley left for his biographers    Bieri      

  Dods  who had an infant daughter  assumed the name Walter Sholto Douglas and was accepted in France as a man 

  Beauclerk married Ida Goring in      and  after Ida s death  Mary Shelley s friend Rosa Robinson in       A clear picture of Mary Shelley s relationship with Beauclerk is difficult to reconstruct from the evidence   Seymour          

  According to Bieri  Medwin claimed to possess evidence relating to Naples  Medwin is the source for the theory that the child registered by Percy Shelley in Naples was his daughter by a mystery woman  See also  Journals          n  

  Mary Shelley donated the     fee for Rambles to the exiled Italian revolutionary Ferdinand Gatteschi  whose essay on the Carbonari rebels she included in the book   Orr   Mary Shelley s Rambles        

  However   precise attribution of all the biographical essays  in these volumes  is very difficult   according to Kucich 

  Sir Timothy Shelley made his allowance to Mary  on behalf of Percy Florence  dependent on her not putting the Shelley name in print
