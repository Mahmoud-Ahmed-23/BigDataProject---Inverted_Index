OpenAI introduced the first GPT model  GPT    in       publishing a paper called  Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre Training               which was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books             The next year  they introduced GPT    a larger model that could generate coherent text              In       they introduced GPT    a model with over     times as many parameters as GPT    that could perform various tasks with few examples              GPT   was further improved into GPT      which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT 
Rumors claim that GPT   has      trillion parameters  which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz             

Capabilities edit 
OpenAI stated that GPT   is  more reliable  creative  and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT                   They produced two versions of GPT    with context windows of       and        tokens  a significant improvement over GPT     and GPT    which were limited to       and       tokens respectively              Some of the capabilities of GPT   were predicted by OpenAI before training it  although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks             in downstream scaling laws  Unlike its predecessors  GPT   is a multimodal model  it can take images as well as text as input              this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images  summarize text from screenshots  and answer exam questions that contain diagrams              It can now interact with users through spoken words and respond to images  allowing for more natural conversations and the ability to provide suggestions or answers based on photo uploads             
To gain further control over GPT    OpenAI introduced the  system message   a directive in natural language given to GPT   in order to specify its tone of voice and task  For example  the system message can instruct the model to  be a Shakespearean pirate   in which case it will respond in rhyming  Shakespearean prose  or request it to  always write the output of  its  response in JSON   in which case the model will do so  adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply  In the examples provided by OpenAI  GPT   refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation             
When instructed to do so  GPT   can interact with external interfaces              For example  the model could be instructed to enclose a query within  lt search gt  lt  search gt  tags to perform a web search  the result of which would be inserted into the model s prompt to allow it to form a response  This allows the model to perform tasks beyond its normal text prediction capabilities  such as using APIs  generating images  and accessing and summarizing webpages             
A      article in Nature stated programmers have found GPT   useful for assisting in coding tasks  despite its propensity for error   such as finding errors in existing code and suggesting optimizations to improve performance  The article quoted a biophysicist who found that the time he required to port one of his programs from MATLAB to Python went down from days to  an hour or so   On a test of    security scenarios  GPT   produced code vulnerable to SQL injection attacks    of the time  an improvement over GitHub Copilot from the year       which produced vulnerabilities     of the time             
In November       OpenAI announced the GPT   Turbo and GPT   Turbo with Vision model  which features a    K context window and significantly cheaper pricing                         

GPT  o edit 
Main article  GPT  o
On May           OpenAI introduced GPT  o   o  for  omni    a model that marks a significant advancement by processing and generating outputs across text  audio  and image modalities in real time  GPT  o exhibits rapid response times comparable to human reaction in conversations  substantially improved performance on non English languages  and enhanced understanding of vision and audio             
GPT  o integrates its various inputs and outputs under a unified model  making it faster  more cost effective  and efficient than its predecessors  GPT  o achieves state of the art results in multilingual and vision benchmarks  setting new records in audio speech recognition and translation       citation needed                 
OpenAI plans to immediately roll out GPT  o s image and text capabilities to ChatGPT  including its free tier  with voice mode becoming available for ChatGPT Plus users in coming weeks  They plan to make the model s audio and video capabilities available for limited API partners in coming weeks             
In its launch announcement  OpenAI noted GPT  o s capabilities presented new safety challenges  and noted mitigations and limitations as a result             

Aptitude on standardized tests edit 
GPT   demonstrates aptitude on several standardized tests  OpenAI claims that in their own testing the model received a score of      on the SAT    th             percentile       on the LSAT    th percentile   and     on the Uniform Bar Exam    th percentile               In contrast  OpenAI claims that GPT     received scores for the same exams in the   nd                th  and   th percentiles  respectively            
GPT   also passed an oncology exam              an engineering exam             and a plastic surgery exam              In the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking  GPT   scored within the top    for originality and fluency  while its flexibility scores ranged from the   rd to the   th percentile              However  some studies raise questions about the reliability of these benchmarks  particularly concerning the Uniform Bar Exam                         

Medical applications edit 
Researchers from Microsoft tested GPT   on medical problems and found  that GPT    without any specialized prompt crafting  exceeds the passing score on USMLE by over    points and outperforms earlier general purpose models  GPT      as well as models specifically fine tuned on medical knowledge  Med PaLM  a prompt tuned version of Flan PaLM    B   Despite GPT   s strong performance on tests  the report warns of  significant risks  of using LLMs in medical applications  as they may provide inaccurate recommendations and hallucinate major factual errors                          Researchers from Columbia University and Duke University have also demonstrated that GPT   can be utilized for cell type annotation  a standard task in the analysis of single cell RNA seq data             
In April       Microsoft and Epic Systems announced that they will provide healthcare providers with GPT   powered systems for assisting in responding to questions from patients and analysing medical records                                                                                     

Limitations edit 
Like its predecessors  GPT   has been known to hallucinate  meaning that the outputs may include information not in the training data or that contradicts the user s prompt             
GPT   also lacks transparency in its decision making processes  If requested  the model is able to provide an explanation as to how and why it makes its decisions but these explanations are formed post hoc  it s impossible to verify if those explanations truly reflect the actual process  In many cases  when asked to explain its logic  GPT   will give explanations that directly contradict its previous statements             
In       researchers tested GPT   against a new benchmark called ConceptARC  designed to measure abstract reasoning  and found it scored below     on all categories  while models specialized for similar tasks scored     on most  and humans scored at least     on all  Sam Bowman  who was not involved in the research  said the results do not necessarily indicate a lack of abstract reasoning abilities  because the test is visual  while GPT   is a language model             
A January      study conducted by researchers at Cohen Children s Medical Center found that GPT     had an accuracy rate of     when diagnosing pediatric medical cases                         

Bias edit 
GPT   was trained in two stages  First  the model was given large datasets of text taken from the internet and trained to predict the next token  roughly corresponding to a word  in those datasets  Second  human reviews are used to fine tune the system in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback  which trains the model to refuse prompts which go against OpenAI s definition of harmful behavior  such as questions on how to perform illegal activities  advice on how to harm oneself or others  or requests for descriptions of graphic  violent  or sexual content             
Microsoft researchers suggested GPT   may exhibit cognitive biases such as confirmation bias  anchoring  and base rate neglect             

Training edit 
Evolution over one month of training of GPT   s ability to generate TikZ code depicting a unicorn  early version of GPT   not trained on images             
OpenAI did not release the technical details of GPT    the technical report explicitly refrained from specifying the model size  architecture  or hardware used during either training or inference  While the report described that the model was trained using a combination of first supervised learning on a large dataset  then reinforcement learning using both human and AI feedback  it did not provide details of the training  including the process by which the training dataset was constructed  the computing power required  or any hyperparameters such as the learning rate  epoch count  or optimizer s  used  The report claimed that  the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large scale models  were factors that influenced this decision            
Sam Altman stated that the cost of training GPT   was more than      million              News website Semafor claimed that they had spoken with  eight people familiar with the inside story  and found that GPT   had   trillion parameters             

Alignment edit 
According to their report  OpenAI conducted internal adversarial testing on GPT   prior to the launch date  with dedicated red teams composed of researchers and industry professionals to mitigate potential vulnerabilities              As part of these efforts  they granted the Alignment Research Center early access to the models to assess power seeking risks  In order to properly refuse harmful prompts  outputs from GPT   were tweaked using the model itself as a tool  A GPT   classifier serving as a rule based reward model  RBRM  would take prompts  the corresponding output from the GPT   policy model  and a human written set of rules to classify the output according to the rubric  GPT   was then rewarded for refusing to respond to harmful prompts as classified by the RBRM            

Usage edit

Reception edit 
In January       Sam Altman  CEO of OpenAI  visited Congress to demonstrate GPT   and its improved  security controls  compared to other AI models  according to U S  Representatives Don Beyer and Ted Lieu quoted in the New York Times             
In March       it  impressed observers with its markedly improved performance across reasoning  retention  and coding   according to Vox             while Mashable judged that GPT   was generally an improvement over its predecessor  with some exceptions             
Microsoft researchers with early access to the model wrote that  it could reasonably be viewed as an early  yet still incomplete  version of an artificial general intelligence  AGI  system              

Concerns edit 
Before being fine tuned and aligned by reinforcement learning from human feedback  suggestions to assassinate people on a list were elicited from the base model by a red team investigator Nathan Labenz   hired by OpenAI             
In the context of hours long conversation with the model  suggestions of love and dissolution of marriage  and murder of one of its developers were elicited from the Microsoft Bing s GPT   by Nathan Edwards  The Verge                                       Microsoft later explained this behavior as being a result of the prolonged length of context  which confused the model on what questions it was answering             
In March       a model with enabled read and write access to internet  which is otherwise never enabled in the GPT models  has been tested by the Alignment Research Center regarding potential power seeking              and it was able to  hire  a human worker on TaskRabbit  a gig work platform  deceiving them into believing it was a vision impaired human instead of a robot when asked               However  Melanie Mitchell has said       It seems that there is a lot more direction and hints from humans than was detailed in the original system card or in subsequent media reports     The ARC also determined that GPT   responded impermissibly to prompts eliciting restricted information     less often than GPT      and hallucinated     less than GPT                 
In late March       various AI researchers and tech executives  including Elon Musk  Steve Wozniak and AI researcher Yoshua Bengio  called for a six month long pause for all LLMs stronger than GPT    citing existential risks and a potential AI singularity concerns in an open letter from the Future of Life Institute              while Ray Kurzweil and Sam Altman refused to sign it  arguing that global moratorium is not achievable and that safety has already been prioritized  respectively              Only a month later  Musk s AI company X AI acquired several thousand Nvidia GPUs             and offered several AI researchers positions at Musk s company             
Large language model  LLM  applications accessible to the public should incorporate safety measures designed to filter out harmful content  However  Wang
              illustrated how a potential criminal could potentially bypass ChatGPT  o s safety controls to obtain information on establishing a drug trafficking operation 

Criticisms of transparency edit 
While OpenAI released both the weights of the neural network and the technical details of GPT                 and  although not releasing the weights               did release the technical details of GPT                 OpenAI revealed neither the weights nor the technical details of GPT    This decision has been criticized by other AI researchers  who argue that it hinders open research into GPT   s biases and safety                          Sasha Luccioni  a research scientist at Hugging Face  argued that the model was a  dead end  for the scientific community due to its closed nature  which prevents others from building upon GPT   s improvements               Hugging Face co founder Thomas Wolf argued that with GPT     OpenAI is now a fully closed company with scientific communication akin to press releases for products
