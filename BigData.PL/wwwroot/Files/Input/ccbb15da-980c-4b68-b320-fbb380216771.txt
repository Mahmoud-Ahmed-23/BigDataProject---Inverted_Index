Affect  in psychology  is the underlying experience of feeling  emotion  attachment  or mood             It encompasses a wide range of emotional states and can be positive  e g   happiness  joy  excitement  or negative  e g   sadness  anger  fear  disgust   Affect is a fundamental aspect of human experience and plays a central role in many psychological theories and studies  It can be understood as a combination of three components  emotion  mood  enduring  less intense emotional states that are not necessarily tied to a specific event   and affectivity  an individual s overall disposition or temperament  which can be characterized as having a generally positive or negative affect   In psychology  the term affect is often used interchangeably with several related terms and concepts  though each term may have slightly different nuances  These terms encompass  emotion  feeling  mood  emotional state  sentiment  affective state  emotional response  affective reactivity  disposition  Researchers and psychologists may employ specific terms based on their focus and the context of their work            


History edit 
The modern conception of affect developed in the   th century with Wilhelm Wundt             The word     clarification needed      comes from the German Gef hl  meaning  feeling             
A number of experiments have been conducted in the study of social and psychological affective preferences  i e   what people like or dislike   Specific research has been done on preferences  attitudes  impression formation  and decision making  This research contrasts findings with recognition memory  old new judgments   allowing researchers to demonstrate reliable distinctions between the two  Affect based judgments and cognitive processes have been examined with noted differences indicated  and some argue affect and cognition are under the control of separate and partially independent systems that can influence each other in a variety of ways  Zajonc         Both affect and cognition may constitute independent sources of effects within systems of information processing  Others suggest emotion is a result of an anticipated  experienced  or imagined outcome of an adaptational transaction between organism and environment  therefore cognitive appraisal processes are keys to the development and expression of an emotion  Lazarus        

Dimensions edit 
Affective states vary along three principal dimensions  valence  arousal  and motivational intensity             

Valence is the subjective spectrum of positive to negative evaluation of an experience an individual may have had  Emotional valence refers to the emotion s consequences  emotion eliciting circumstances  or subjective feelings or attitudes            
Arousal is objectively measurable as activation of the sympathetic nervous system  but can also be assessed subjectively via self report 
Motivational intensity refers to the impulsion to act             the strength of an urge to move toward or away from a stimulus and whether or not to interact with said stimulus  Simply moving is not considered approach  or avoidance  motivation           
It is important to note that arousal is different from motivational intensity  While arousal is a construct that is closely related to motivational intensity  they differ in that motivation necessarily implies action while arousal does not            

Affect display edit 
Affect is sometimes used to mean affect display  which is  a facial  vocal  or gestural behavior that serves as an indicator of affect   APA                   

Cognitive scope edit 
In psychology  affect defines the organisms  interaction with stimuli  It can influence the scope of the cognitive processes              Initially  researchers had thought that positive affects broadened the cognitive scope  whereas negative affects narrowed it             Thereafter  evidences suggested that affects high in motivational intensity narrow the cognitive scope  whereas affects low in motivational intensity broaden it  The construct of cognitive scope could be valuable in cognitive psychology            

Affect tolerance edit 
According to a research article about affect tolerance written by psychiatrist Jerome Sashin   Affect tolerance can be defined as the ability to respond to a stimulus which would ordinarily be expected to evoke affects by the subjective experiencing of feelings               Essentially it refers to one s ability to react to emotions and feelings  One who is low in affect tolerance would show little to no reaction to emotion and feeling of any kind  This is closely related to alexithymia 
 Alexithymia is a subclinical phenomenon involving a lack of emotional awareness or  more specifically  difficulty in identifying and describing feelings and in distinguishing feelings from the bodily sensations of emotional arousal              At its core  alexithymia is an inability for an individual to recognize what emotions they are feeling as well as an inability to describe them  According to Dalya Samur  lt Archived            at the Wayback Machine gt  and colleagues              persons with alexithymia have been shown to have correlations with increased suicide rates              mental discomfort              and deaths             
Affect tolerance                         factors  including anxiety sensitivity  intolerance of uncertainty  and emotional distress tolerance  may be helped by mindfulness              Mindfulness is a mental state achieved by focusing one s awareness on the present moment  while calmly acknowledging and accepting one s feelings  thoughts  and bodily sensations without judgment  The practice of Intention  Attention   amp  Attitude 
Mindfulness has been shown to produce  increased subjective well being  reduced psychological symptoms and emotional reactivity  and improved behavioral regulation              

Relationship to behavior and cognition edit 
The affective domain represents one of the three divisions described in modern psychology  the other two being the behavioral  and the cognitive  Classically  these divisions have also been referred to as the  ABC s of psychology               However  in certain views  the cognitive may be considered as a part of the affective  or the affective as a part of the cognitive              it is important to note that  cognitive and affective states    are  merely analytic categories              

Instinctive and cognitive factors in causation of affect edit 
 Affect  can mean an instinctual reaction to stimulation that occurs before the typical cognitive processes considered necessary for the formation of a more complex emotion  Robert B  Zajonc asserts this reaction to stimuli is primary for human beings and that it is the dominant reaction for non human organisms  Zajonc suggests that affective reactions can occur without extensive perceptual and cognitive encoding and be made sooner and with greater confidence than cognitive judgments  Zajonc        
Many theorists  e g  Lazarus        consider affect to be post cognitive  elicited only after a certain amount of cognitive processing of information has been accomplished  In this view  such affective reactions as liking  disliking  evaluation  or the experience of pleasure or displeasure each result from a different prior cognitive process that makes a variety of content discriminations and identifies features  examines them to find value  and weighs them according to their contributions  Brewin          Some scholars  e g  Lerner and Keltner       argue that affect can be both pre  and post cognitive  initial emotional responses produce thoughts  which produce affect   In a further iteration  some scholars argue that affect is necessary for enabling more rational modes of cognition  e g  Damasio       
A divergence from a narrow reinforcement model of emotion allows other perspectives about how affect influences emotional development  Thus  temperament  cognitive development  socialization patterns  and the idiosyncrasies of one s family or subculture might interact in nonlinear ways   For example  the temperament of a highly reactive low self soothing infant may  disproportionately  affect the process of emotion regulation in the early months of life  Griffiths        
Some other social sciences  such as geography or anthropology  have adopted the concept of affect during the last decade  In French psychoanalysis a major contribution to the field of affect comes from Andr  Green              The focus on affect has largely derived from the work of Deleuze and brought emotional and visceral concerns into such conventional discourses as those on geopolitics  urban life and material culture   Affect has also challenged methodologies of the social sciences by emphasizing somatic power over the idea of a removed objectivity and therefore has strong ties with the contemporary non representational theory             

Psychometric measurement edit 
Main article  Affect measures
Affect has been found across cultures to comprise both positive and negative dimensions  The most commonly used measure in scholarly research is the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule  PANAS               The PANAS is a lexical measure developed in a North American setting and consisting of    single word items  for instance excited  alert  determined for positive affect  and upset  guilty  and jittery for negative affect  However  some of the PANAS items have been found either to be redundant or to have ambiguous meanings to English speakers from non North American cultures  As a result  an internationally reliable short form  the I PANAS SF  has been developed and validated comprising two   item scales with internal reliability  cross sample and cross cultural factorial invariance  temporal stability  convergent and criterion related validities             
Mroczek and Kolarz have also developed another set of scales to measure positive and negative affect              Each of the scales has   items  The scales have shown evidence of acceptable validity and reliability across cultures                                     

Non conscious affect and perception edit 
Main articles  Unconscious mind and Perception
In relation to perception  a type of non conscious affect may be separate from the cognitive processing of environmental stimuli  A monohierarchy of perception  affect and cognition considers the roles of arousal  attention tendencies  affective primacy  Zajonc         evolutionary constraints  Shepard               and covert perception  Weiskrantz        within the sensing and processing of preferences and discriminations  Emotions are complex chains of events triggered by certain stimuli  There is no way to completely describe an emotion by knowing only some of its components  Verbal reports of feelings are often inaccurate because people may not know exactly what they feel  or they may feel several different emotions at the same time  There are also situations that arise in which individuals attempt to hide their feelings  and there are some who believe that public and private events seldom coincide exactly  and that words for feelings are generally more ambiguous than are words for objects or events  Therefore  non conscious emotions need to be measured by measures circumventing self report such as the Implicit Positive and Negative Affect Test  IPANAT  Quirin  Kaz n   amp  Kuhl        
Affective responses  on the other hand  are more basic and may be less problematic in terms of assessment  Brewin has proposed two experiential processes that frame non cognitive relations between various affective experiences  those that are prewired dispositions  i e  non conscious processes   able to  select from the total stimulus array those stimuli that are causally relevant  using such criteria as perceptual salience  spatiotemporal cues  and predictive value in relation to data stored in memory   Brewin        p             and those that are automatic  i e  subconscious processes   characterized as  rapid  relatively inflexible and difficult to modify     requiring  minimal attention to occur and     capable of being  activated without intention or awareness        p            
But a note should be considered on the differences between affect and emotion 

Arousal edit 
Main article  Arousal
Arousal is a basic physiological response to the presentation of stimuli  When this occurs  a non conscious affective process takes the form of two control mechanisms  one mobilizing and the other immobilizing  Within the human brain  the amygdala regulates an instinctual reaction initiating this arousal process  either freezing the individual or accelerating mobilization 
The arousal response is illustrated in studies focused on reward systems that control food seeking behavior  Balleine         Researchers have focused on learning processes and modulatory processes that are present while encoding and retrieving goal values  When an organism seeks food  the anticipation of reward based on environmental events becomes another influence on food seeking that is separate from the reward of food itself  Therefore  earning the reward and anticipating the reward are separate processes and both create an excitatory influence of reward related cues   Both processes are dissociated at the level of the amygdala  and are functionally integrated within larger neural systems 

Motivational intensity and cognitive scope edit 
Measuring cognitive scope edit 
Cognitive scope can be measured by tasks involving attention  perception  categorization and memory  Some studies use a flanker attention task to figure out whether cognitive scope is broadened or narrowed  For example  using the letters  H  and  N  participants need to identify as quickly as possible the middle letter of   when all the letters are the same  e g   HHHHH   and when the middle letter is different from the flanking letters  e g   HHNHH                Broadened cognitive scope would be indicated if reaction times differed greatly from when all the letters were the same compared to when the middle letter is different              Other studies use a Navon attention task to measure difference in cognitive scope  A large letter is composed of smaller letters  in most cases smaller  L  s or  F  s that make up the shape of the letter  T  or  H  or vice versa              Broadened cognitive scope would be suggested by a faster reaction to name the larger letter  whereas narrowed cognitive scope would be suggested by a faster reaction to name the smaller letters within the larger letter              A source monitoring paradigm can also be used to measure how much contextual information is perceived  for instance  participants are tasked to watch a screen which serially displays words to be memorized for   seconds each  and also have to remember whether the word appeared on the left or the right half of the screen               The words were also encased in a colored box  but the participants did not know that they would eventually be asked what color box the word appeared in             

Main research findings edit 
Motivation intensity refers to the strength of urge to move toward or away from a particular stimulus            
Anger and fear affective states  induced via film clips  resulted in more selective attention on a flanker task compared to controls as indicated by reaction times that were not very different  even when the flanking letters were different from the middle target letter                         Both anger and fear have high motivational intensity because propulsion to act would be high in the face of an angry or fearful stimulus  like a screaming person or coiled snake  Affects which are high in motivational intensity  and thus are narrow in cognitive scope  enable people to focus more on target information                         After seeing a sad picture  participants were faster to identify the larger letter in a Navon attention task  suggesting more global or broadened cognitive scope                         Sadness is thought to sometimes have low motivational intensity  But  after seeing a disgusting picture  participants were faster to identify the component letters  indicative of a localized and narrower cognitive scope                         Disgust has high motivational intensity  Affects which are high in motivational intensity narrow one s cognitive scope  enabling people to focus more on central information                                     whereas affects which are low in motivational intensity broadened cognitive scope  allowing for faster global interpretation              The changes in cognitive scope associated with different affective states is evolutionarily adaptive because high motivational intensity affects elicited by stimuli that require movement and action should be focused on  in a phenomenon known as goal directed behavior              For example  in early times  seeing a lion  a fearful stimulus  probably elicited a negative but highly motivational affective state  fear  in which the human being was propelled to run away  In this case the goal would be to avoid getting killed 
Moving beyond just negative affective states  researchers wanted to test whether or not negative or positive affective states varied between high and low motivational intensity  To evaluate this theory  Harmon Jones  Gable and Price created an experiment using appetitive picture priming and the Navon task  which would allow them to measure the attentional scope with detection of the Navon letters  The Navon task included a neutral affect comparison condition  Typically  neutral states cause broadened attention with a neutral stimulus              They predicted that a broad attentional scope could cause faster detection of global  large  letters  whereas a narrow attentional scope could cause faster detection of local  small  letters  The evidence proved that the appetitive stimuli produced a narrowed attentional scope  The experimenters further increased the narrowed attentional scope in appetitive stimuli by telling participants they would be allowed to consume the desserts shown in the pictures  The results revealed that their hypothesis was correct  in that the broad attentional scope led to quicker detection of global letters  while narrowed attentional scope led to quicker detection of local letters 
Researchers Bradley  Codispoti  Cuthbert and Lang wanted to further examine the emotional reactions in picture priming  Instead of using an appetitive stimulus they used stimulus sets from the International Affective Picture System  IAPS   The image set includes various unpleasant pictures such as snakes  insects  attack scenes  accidents  illness  and loss  They predicted that an unpleasant picture would stimulate a defensive motivational intensity response  which would produce strong emotional arousal such as skin gland responses and cardiac deceleration              Participants rated the pictures based on valence  arousal and dominance on the Self Assessment Manikin  SAM  rating scale  The findings were consistent with the hypothesis and proved that emotion is organized motivationally by the intensity of activation in appetitive or defensive systems             
Prior to research in       Harmon Jones and Gable performed an experiment to examine whether neural activation related to approach motivation intensity  left frontal central activity  would trigger the effect of appetitive stimuli on narrowed attention  They also tested whether individual dissimilarities in approach motivation are associated with attentional narrowing  In order to test the hypothesis  the researchers used the same Navon task with appetitive and neutral pictures in addition to having the participants indicate how long since they had last eaten in minutes   To examine neural activation  the researchers used electroencephalography and recorded eye movements in order to detect what regions of the brain were being used during approach motivation  The results supported the hypothesis that the left frontal central brain region is related to approach motivational processes and narrowed attentional scope              Some psychologists were concerned that the individuals who were hungry had an increase in activity in the left frontal central region due to frustration  This statement was proved false because the research showed that dessert pictures increased positive affect even in hungry individuals              The findings revealed that narrowed cognitive scope has the ability to assist us in goal accomplishment 

Clinical applications edit 
Later on  researchers connected motivational intensity to clinical applications and found that alcohol related pictures caused narrowed attention for persons who had a strong motivation to consume alcohol  The researchers tested the participants by exposing them to alcohol and neutral pictures  After the picture was displayed on a screen  the participants finished a test evaluating attentional focus  The findings proved that exposure to alcohol related pictures led to a narrowing of attentional focus to individuals who were motivated to use alcohol              However  exposure to neutral pictures did not correlate with alcohol related motivation to manipulate attentional focus  The Alcohol Myopia Theory  AMT  states that alcohol consumption reduces the amount of information available in memory  which also narrows attention so only the most proximal items or striking sources are encompassed in attentional scope              This narrowed attention leads intoxicated persons to make more extreme decisions than they would when sober  Researchers provided evidence that substance related stimuli capture the attention of individuals when they have high and intense motivation to consume the substance  Motivational intensity and cue induced narrowing of attention has a unique role in shaping people s initial decision to consume alcohol              In       psychologists from the University of Missouri investigated the connection between sport achievement orientation and alcohol outcomes  They asked varsity athletes to complete a Sport Orientation Questionnaire which measured their sport related achievement orientation on three scales competitiveness  win orientation  and goal orientation  The participants also completed assessments of alcohol use and alcohol related problems  The results revealed that the goal orientation of the athletes were significantly associated with alcohol use but not alcohol related problems             
In terms of psychopathological implications and applications  college students showing depressive symptoms were better at retrieving seemingly  nonrelevant  contextual information from a source monitoring paradigm task              Namely  the students with depressive symptoms were better at identifying the color of the box the word was in compared to nondepressed students              Sadness  low motivational intensity  is usually             associated with depression  so the more broad focus on contextual information of sadder students supports that affects high in motivational intensity narrow cognitive scope whereas affects low in motivational intensity broaden cognitive scope                        
The motivational intensity theory states that the difficulty of a task combined with the importance of success determine the energy invested by an individual              The theory has three main layers  The innermost layer says human behavior is guided by the desire to conserve as much energy as possible  Individuals aim to avoid wasting energy so they invest only the energy that is required to complete the task  The middle layer focuses on the difficulty of tasks combined with the importance of success and how this affects energy conservation  It focuses on energy investment in situations of clear and unclear task difficulty  The last layer looks at predictions for energy invested by a person when they have several possible options to choose at different task difficulties              The person is free to choose among several possible options of task difficulty  The motivational intensity theory offers a logical and consistent framework for research  Researchers can predict a person s actions by assuming effort refers to the energy investment   The motivational intensity theory is used to show how changes in goal attractiveness and energy investment correlate 

Mood edit 
Main article  Mood  psychology 
Mood  like emotion  is an affective state  However  an emotion tends to have a clear focus  i e   its cause is self evident   while mood tends to be more unfocused and diffuse              Mood  according to Batson  Shaw and Oleson         involves tone and intensity and a structured set of beliefs about general expectations of a future experience of pleasure or pain  or of positive or negative affect in the future  Unlike instant reactions that produce affect or emotion  and that change with expectations of future pleasure or pain  moods  being diffuse and unfocused and thus harder to cope with  can last for days  weeks  months or even years  Schucman         Moods are hypothetical constructs depicting an individual s emotional state  Researchers typically infer the existence of moods from a variety of behavioral referents  Blechman         Habitual negative affect and negative mood is characteristic of high neuroticism             
Positive affect and negative affect  PANAS  represent independent domains of emotion in the general population  and positive affect is strongly linked to social interaction  Positive and negative daily events show independent relationships to subjective well being  and positive affect is strongly linked to social activity  Recent research suggests that high functional support is related to higher levels of positive affect  In his work on negative affect arousal and white noise  Seidner found support for the existence of a negative affect arousal mechanism regarding the devaluation of speakers from other ethnic origins              The exact process through which social support is linked to positive affect remains unclear  The process could derive from predictable  regularized social interaction  from leisure activities where the focus is on relaxation and positive mood  or from the enjoyment of shared activities  The techniques used to shift a negative mood to a positive one are called mood repair strategies 

Social interaction edit 
Affect display is a critical facet of interpersonal communication  Evolutionary psychologists have advanced the hypothesis that hominids have evolved with sophisticated capability of reading affect displays             
Emotions are portrayed as dynamic processes that mediate the individual s relation to a continually changing social environment              In other words  emotions are considered to be processes of establishing  maintaining  or disrupting the relation between the organism and the environment on matters of significance to the person             
Most social and psychological phenomena occur as the result of repeated interactions between multiple individuals over time  These interactions should be seen as a multi agent system a system that contains multiple agents interacting with each other and or with their environments over time  The outcomes of individual agents  behaviors are interdependent  Each agent s ability to achieve its goals depends on not only what it does but also what other agents do             
Emotions are one of the main sources for the interaction  Emotions of an individual influence the emotions  thoughts and behaviors of others  others  reactions can then influence their future interactions with the individual expressing the original emotion  as well as that individual s future emotions and behaviors  Emotion operates in cycles that can involve multiple people in a process of reciprocal influence             
Affect  emotion  or feeling is displayed to others through facial expressions  hand gestures  posture  voice characteristics  and other physical manifestation  These affect displays vary between and within cultures and are displayed in various forms ranging from the most discrete of facial expressions to the most dramatic and prolific gestures             
Observers are sensitive to agents  emotions  and are capable of recognizing the messages these emotions convey  They react to and draw inferences from an agent s emotions  The emotion an agent displays may not be an authentic reflection of their actual state  See also Emotional labor  
Agents  emotions can have effects on four broad sets of factors 

Emotions of other persons
Inferences of other persons
Behaviors of other persons
Interactions and relationships between the agent and other persons 
Emotion may affect not only the person at whom it was directed  but also third parties who observe an agent s emotion  Moreover  emotions can affect larger social entities such as a group or a team  Emotions are a kind of message and therefore can influence the emotions  attributions and ensuing behaviors of others  potentially evoking a feedback process to the original agent 
Agents  feelings evoke feelings in others by two suggested distinct mechanisms 

Emotion contagion   people tend to automatically and unconsciously mimic non verbal expressions              Mimicking occurs also in interactions involving textual exchanges alone             
Emotion interpretation   an individual may perceive an agent as feeling a particular emotion and react with complementary or situationally appropriate emotions of their own  The feelings of the others diverge from and in some way complement the feelings of the original agent 
People may not only react emotionally  but may also draw inferences about emotive agents such as the social status or power of an emotive agent  their competence and their credibility              For example  an agent presumed to be angry may also be presumed to have high power
