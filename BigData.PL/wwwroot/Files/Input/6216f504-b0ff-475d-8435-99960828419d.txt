Geoffrey Everest Hinton  born       is a British Canadian computer scientist  cognitive scientist  cognitive psychologist  and Nobel laureate in physics  known for his work on artificial neural networks  which earned him the title  the Godfather of AI             
Hinton is University Professor Emeritus at the University of Toronto  From      to       he divided his time working for Google  Google Brain  and the University of Toronto before publicly announcing his departure from Google in May       citing concerns about the many risks of artificial intelligence  AI  technology                          In       he co founded and became the chief scientific advisor of the Vector Institute in Toronto                         
With David Rumelhart and Ronald J  Williams  Hinton was co author of a highly cited paper published in      that popularised the backpropagation algorithm for training multi layer neural networks              although they were not the first to propose the approach              Hinton is viewed as a leading figure in the deep learning community              The image recognition milestone of the AlexNet designed in collaboration with his students Alex Krizhevsky             and Ilya Sutskever for the ImageNet challenge                 was a breakthrough in the field of computer vision             
Hinton received the      Turing Award  often referred to as the  Nobel Prize of Computing   together with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun for their work on deep learning              They are sometimes referred to as the  Godfathers of Deep Learning                          and have continued to give public talks together                          He was also awarded  along with John Hopfield  the      Nobel Prize in Physics for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks                         
In May       Hinton announced his resignation from Google to be able to  freely speak out about the risks of A I               He has voiced concerns about deliberate misuse by malicious actors  technological unemployment  and existential risk from artificial general intelligence              He noted that establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI in order to avoid the worst outcomes              After receiving the Nobel Prize  he called for urgent research into AI safety to figure out how to control AI systems smarter than humans                                     


Education edit 
Hinton was born on   December                  in Wimbledon  England  and was educated at Clifton College in Bristol              In       he enrolled as an undergraduate student at King s College  Cambridge  and after repeatedly switching between different fields  like natural sciences  history of art  and philosophy  he eventually graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in                               He spent a year apprenticing carpentry before returning to academic studies              From      to       he continued his study at the University of Edinburgh  where he was awarded a PhD in artificial intelligence in      for research supervised by Christopher Longuet Higgins  who favored the symbolic AI approach over the neural network approach                                                 

Career and research edit 
After his PhD  Hinton initially worked at the University of Sussex and at the MRC Applied Psychology Unit  After having difficulty getting funding in Britain              he worked in the US at the University of California  San Diego and Carnegie Mellon University              He was the founding director of the Gatsby Charitable Foundation Computational Neuroscience Unit at University College London              He is currently     update                  University Professor Emeritus in the computer science department at the University of Toronto  where he has been affiliated since                  
Upon arrival in Canada  Geoffrey Hinton was appointed at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research  CIFAR  in      as a Fellow in CIFAR s first research program  Artificial Intelligence  Robotics  amp  Society              In       Hinton and collaborators successfully proposed the launch of a new program at CIFAR   Neural Computation and Adaptive Perception               NCAP   which today is named  Learning in Machines  amp  Brains   Hinton would go on to lead NCAP for ten years              Among the members of the program are Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun  with whom Hinton would go on to win the ACM A M  Turing Award in                   All three Turing winners continue to be members of the CIFAR Learning in Machines  amp  Brains program             
Hinton taught a free online course on Neural Networks on the education platform Coursera in                   He co founded DNNresearch Inc  in      with his two graduate students Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever at the University of Toronto s department of computer science  In March       Google acquired DNNresearch Inc   and Hinton planned to  divide his time between his university research and his work at Google                          
Hinton s research concerns ways of using neural networks for machine learning  memory  perception  and symbol processing  He has written or co written more than     peer reviewed publications                        
While Hinton was a postdoc at UC San Diego  David E  Rumelhart and Hinton and Ronald J  Williams applied the backpropagation algorithm to multi layer neural networks  Their experiments showed that such networks can learn useful internal representations of data              In a      interview              Hinton said that  David E  Rumelhart came up with the basic idea of backpropagation  so it s his invention   Although this work was important in popularising backpropagation  it was not the first to suggest the approach              Reverse mode automatic differentiation  of which backpropagation is a special case  was proposed by Seppo Linnainmaa in       and Paul Werbos proposed to use it to train neural networks in                  
In       Hinton co invented Boltzmann machines with David Ackley and Terry Sejnowski              His other contributions to neural network research include distributed representations  time delay neural network  mixtures of experts  Helmholtz machines and product of experts              An accessible introduction to Geoffrey Hinton s research can be found in his articles in Scientific American in September      and October                   In       Hinton coauthored an unsupervised learning paper titled Unsupervised learning of image transformations              In       he developed the visualization method t SNE with Laurens van der Maaten                         
In October and November       Hinton published two open access research papers on the theme of capsule neural networks                          which  according to Hinton  are  finally something that works well              
At the      Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems  NeurIPS   Hinton introduced a new learning algorithm for neural networks that he calls the  Forward Forward  algorithm  The idea of the new algorithm is to replace the traditional forward backward passes of backpropagation with two forward passes  one with positive  i e  real  data and the other with negative data that could be generated solely by the network                         
In May       Hinton publicly announced his resignation from Google  He explained his decision by saying that he wanted to  freely speak out about the risks of A I   and added that a part of him now regrets his life s work                         
Notable former PhD students and postdoctoral researchers from his group include Peter Dayan              Sam Roweis              Max Welling              Richard Zemel                         Brendan Frey             Radford M  Neal             Yee Whye Teh             Ruslan Salakhutdinov             Ilya Sutskever             Yann LeCun              Alex Graves              Zoubin Ghahramani              and Peter Fitzhugh Brown

In       Hinton expressed concerns about the rapid progress of AI                          He had previously believed that artificial general intelligence  AGI  was     to    years or even longer away               However  in a March      interview with CBS  he said that  general purpose AI  might be fewer than    years away and could bring about changes  comparable in scale with the industrial revolution or electricity              
In an interview with The New York Times published on   May                   Hinton announced his resignation from Google so he could  talk about the dangers of AI without considering how this impacts Google               He noted that  a part of him now regrets his life s work                          
In early May       Hinton said in an interview with BBC that AI might soon surpass the information capacity of the human brain  He described some of the risks posed by these chatbots as  quite scary   Hinton explained that chatbots have the ability to learn independently and share knowledge  so that whenever one copy acquires new information  it is automatically disseminated to the entire group  allowing AI chatbots to have the capability to accumulate knowledge far beyond the capacity of any individual              

Existential risk from AGI edit 
Hinton has expressed concerns about the possibility of an AI takeover  stating that  it s not inconceivable  that AI could  wipe out humanity               Hinton said in      that AI systems capable of intelligent agency would be useful for military or economic purposes               He worries that generally intelligent AI systems could  create sub goals  that are unaligned with their programmers  interests               He says that AI systems may become power seeking or prevent themselves from being shut off  not because programmers intended them to  but because those sub goals are useful for achieving later goals               In particular  Hinton says  we have to think hard about how to control  AI systems capable of self improvement              

Catastrophic misuse edit 
Hinton reports concerns about deliberate misuse of AI by malicious actors  stating that  it is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using  AI  for bad things               In       Hinton called for an international ban on lethal autonomous weapons              

Economic impacts edit 
Hinton was previously optimistic about the economic effects of AI  noting in      that   The phrase  artificial general intelligence  carries with it the implication that this sort of single robot is suddenly going to be smarter than you  I don t think it s going to be that  I think more and more of the routine things we do are going to be replaced by AI systems                Hinton had also argued that AGI would not make humans redundant    AI in the future is  going to know a lot about what you re probably going to want to do    But it s not going to replace you               
In       however  Hinton became  worried that AI technologies will in time upend the job market  and take away more than just  drudge work               He said in      that the British government would have to establish a universal basic income to deal with the impact of AI on inequality               In Hinton s view  AI will boost productivity and generate more wealth  But unless the government intervenes  it will only make the rich richer and hurt the people who might lose their jobs   That s going to be very bad for society   he said              
At Christmas      he had become somewhat more pessimistic  saying that there was a     to    per cent chance  that AI would be the cause of human extinction within the following three decades  he had previously suggested a     chance  without a timescale                He expressed surprise at the speed with which AI was advancing  and said that most experts expected AI to advance  probably in the next    years  to be  smarter than people          a scary thought           So just leaving it to the profit motive of large companies is not going to be sufficient to make sure they develop it safely  The only thing that can force those big companies to do more research on safety is government regulation                Another  godfather of AI   Yann LeCun  disagreed  saying AI  could actually save humanity from extinction               

Politics edit 
Hinton is a socialist               He moved from the US to Canada in part due to disillusionment with Ronald Reagan era politics and disapproval of military funding of artificial intelligence             
In August       Hinton co authored a letter with Yoshua Bengio  Stuart Russell  and Lawrence Lessig in support of SB       a California AI safety bill that would require companies training models which cost more than US          million to perform risk assessments before deployment  They said the legislation was the  bare minimum for effective regulation of this technology                            

Personal life edit 
Hinton s first wife  Rosalind Zalin  died of ovarian cancer in       his second wife  Jacqueline  Jackie  Ford  died of pancreatic cancer in                                
Hinton is the great great grandson of the mathematician and educator Mary Everest Boole and her husband  the logician George Boole               George Boole s work eventually became one of the foundations of modern computer science  Another great great grandfather of his was the surgeon and author James Hinton               who was the father of the mathematician Charles Howard Hinton 
Hinton s father was the entomologist Howard Hinton                           His middle name comes from another relative  George Everest  the Surveyor General of India after whom the mountain is named              He is the nephew of the economist Colin Clark              
Hinton injured his back at age     which makes sitting painful for him  He has dealt with depression throughout his life
