Intestinal organoid grown from Lgr   stem cells
An organoid is a miniaturised and simplified version of an organ produced in vitro in three dimensions that mimics the key functional  structural  and biological complexity of that organ             It is derived from one or a few cells from a tissue  embryonic stem cells  or induced pluripotent stem cells  which can self organize in three dimensional culture owing to their self renewal and differentiation capacities  The technique for growing organoids has rapidly improved since the early     s  and The Scientist named it one of the biggest scientific advancements of                  Scientists and engineers use organoids to study development and disease in the laboratory  for drug discovery and development in industry             personalized diagnostics and medicine  gene and cell therapies  tissue engineering  and regenerative medicine 


History edit 
Attempts to create organs in vitro started with one of the first dissociation reaggregation experiments            where Henry Van Peters Wilson demonstrated that mechanically dissociated sponge cells can reaggregate and self organize to generate a whole organism             In the subsequent decades  multiple labs were able to generate different types of organs            in vitro through the dissociation and reaggregation of organ tissues obtained from amphibians            and embryonic chicks             The formation of first tissue like colonies in vitro was observed for the first time by co culturing keratinocytes and  T  fibroblasts             The phenomena of mechanically dissociated cells aggregating and reorganizing to reform the tissue they were obtained from subsequently led to the development of the differential adhesion hypothesis by Malcolm Steinberg             With the advent of the field of stem cell biology  the potential of stem cells to form organs in vitro was realized early on with the observation that when stem cells form teratomas or embryoid bodies  the differentiated cells can organize into different structures resembling those found in multiple tissue types             The advent of the field of organoids  started with a shift from culturing and differentiating stem cells in two dimensional   D  media  to three dimensional   D  media to allow for the development of the complex   dimensional structures of organs             Utilization of  D media culture media methods for the structural organization was made possible with the development of extracellular matrices  ECM              In the late     s  Bissell and colleagues showed that a laminin rich gel can be used as a basement membrane for differentiation and morphogenesis in cell cultures of mammary epithelial cells                          Since       researchers have devised different methods for  D culturing  and were able to utilize different types of stem cells to generate organoids resembling a multitude of organs             In the     s  in addition to their role in physical support  the role of ECM components in gene expression by their interaction with integrin based focal adhesion pathways was reported              In       Yaakov Nahmias and David Odde showed the self assembly of vascular liver organoid maintained for over    days in vitro              In       Yoshiki Sasai and his team at RIKEN institute demonstrated that stem cells can be coaxed into balls of neural cells that self organize into distinctive layers              In      the Laboratory of Hans Clevers at Hubrecht Institute and University Medical Center Utrecht  Netherlands  showed that single LGR  expressing intestinal stem cells self organize to crypt villus structures in vitro without necessity of a mesenchymal niche  making them the first organoids              In       Mathieu Unbekandt  amp  Jamie A  Davies demonstrated the production of renal organoids from murine fetus derived renogenic stem cells              In       Qun Wang and co workers engineered collagen I and laminin based gels and synthetic foam biomaterials for the culture and delivery of intestinal organoids             and encapsulated DNA functionalized gold nanoparticles into intestinal organoids to form an intestinal Trojan horse for drug delivery and gene therapy              Subsequent reports showed significant physiological function of these organoids in vitro             and in vivo                         
Other significant early advancements included in       Madeline Lancaster at the Institute of Molecular Biotechnology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences established a protocol starting from pluripotent stem cells to generate cerebral organoids that mimic the developing human brain s cellular organization              Meritxell Huch and Craig Dorrell at Hubrecht Institute and University Medical Center Utrecht demonstrated that single Lgr   cells from damaged mouse liver can be clonally expanded as liver organoids in Rspo  based culture medium over several months              In       Artem Shkumatov et al  at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign demonstrated that cardiovascular organoids can be formed from ES cells through modulation of the substrate stiffness  to which they adhere  Physiological stiffness promoted three dimensionality of EBs and cardiomyogenic differentiation             

Properties edit 
Lancaster and Knoblich            define an organoid as a collection of organ specific cell types that develops from stem cells or organ progenitors  self organizes through cell sorting and spatially restricted lineage commitment in a manner similar to in vivo  and exhibits the following properties  

it has multiple organ specific cell types 
it is capable of recapitulating some specific function of the organ  e g  contraction  neural activity  endocrine secretion  filtration  excretion  
its cells are grouped together and spatially organized  similar to an organ 
Process edit 
Organoid formation generally requires culturing the stem cells or progenitor cells in a  D medium             Stem cells have the ability to self renew and differentiate into various cell subtypes  and they enable understanding the processes of development and disease progression              Therefore organoids derived from stem cells enable studying biology and physiology at the organ level              The  D medium can be made using an extracellular matrix hydrogel such as Matrigel or Cultrex BME  which is a laminin rich extracellular matrix that is secreted by the Engelbreth Holm Swarm tumor line              Organoid bodies can then be made through embedding stem cells in the  D medium             When pluripotent stem cells are used for the creation of the organoid  the cells are usually  but not all the time  allowed to form embryoid bodies             Those embryoid bodies are then pharmacologically treated with patterning factors to drive the formation of the desired organoid identity             Organoids have also been created using adult stem cells extracted from the target organ  and cultured in  D media             
Biochemical cues have been incorporated in  D organoid cultures and with exposure of morphogenes  morphogen inhibitors  or growth factors  organoid models can be developed using embryonic stem cells  ESCs  or adult stem cells  ASCs   Vascularization techniques can be utilized to embody microenvironments that are close to their counterparts  physiologically  Vasculature systems that can facilitate oxygen or nutrients to the inner mass of organoids can be achieved through microfluidic systems  vascular endothelial growth factor delivery systems  and endothelial cell coated modules             With patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells  iPSCs              and CRISPR Cas based genome editing             technologies  genome edited or mutated pluripotent stem cells  PSCs  with altered signaling cues can be generated to control intrinsic cues within organoids 

Types edit 
A multitude of organ structures have been recapitulated using organoids             This section aims to outline the state of the field as of now through providing an abridged list of the organoids that have been successfully created  along with a brief outline based on the most recent literature for each organoid  and examples of how it has been utilized in research 

Cerebral organoid edit 
A cerebral organoid describes artificially grown  in vitro  miniature organs resembling the brain  Cerebral organoids are created by culturing human pluripotent stem cells in a three dimensional structure using rotational bioreactor and develop over the course of months              The procedure has potential applications in the study of brain development  physiology and function  Cerebral organoids may experience  simple sensations  in response to external stimulation and neuroscientists are among those expressing concern that such organs could develop sentience  They propose that further evolution of the technique needs to be subject to a rigorous oversight procedure                                      In       researchers have built a hybrid biocomputer that combines laboratory grown human brain organoids with conventional circuits  and can complete tasks such as voice recognition              Cerebral Organoids are currently being used to research and develop Organoid Intelligence  OI  technologies             

Gastrointestinal organoid edit 
Gastrointestinal organoids refer to organoids that recapitulate structures of the gastrointestinal tract  The gastrointestinal tract arises from the endoderm  which during development forms a tube that can be divided in three distinct regions  which give rise to  along with other organs  the following sections of the gastrointestinal tract             

The foregut gives rise to the oral cavity and the stomach
The midgut gives rise to the small intestines and the ascending colon
The hindgut gives rise to the rectum and the rest of the colon
Organoids have been created for the following structures of the gastrointestinal tract 

Intestinal organoid edit 
Intestinal organoids             have thus far been among the gut organoids generated directly from intestinal tissues or pluripotent stem cells             One way human pluripotent stem cells can be driven to form intestinal organoids is through first the application of activin A to drive the cells into a mesoendodermal identity  followed by the pharmacological upregulation of Wnt a and Fgf  signaling pathways as they have been demonstrated to promote posterior gut fate             Intestinal organoids have also been generated from intestinal stem cells  extracted from adult tissue and cultured in  D media              These adult stem cell derived organoids are often referred to as enteroids or colonoids  depending on their segment of origin  and have been established from both the human and murine intestine                                      Intestinal organoids consist of a single layer of polarized intestinal epithelial cells surrounding a central lumen  As such  recapitulate the crypt villus structure of the intestine  by recapitulating its function  physiology and organization  and maintaining all the cell types found normally in the structure including intestinal stem cells             Thus  intestinal organoids are a valuable model to study intestinal nutrient transport                          drug absorption and delivery                          nanomaterials and nanomedicine                          incretin hormone secretion                          and infection by various enteropathogens                          For example  Qun Wang s team rationally designed artificial virus nanoparticles as oral drug delivery vehicles  ODDVs  with gut organoid derived mucosal models             and demonstrated a new concept of using newly established colon organoids as tools for high throughput drug screening  toxicity testing  and oral drug development              Or recently  Sakib  S   and Zou  S  developed graphene oxide nanoparticles for delivering siRNA regulating expression of tumor necrosis factor    that aimed to treat intestinal organoids exhibiting an inflammatory phenotype              Intestinal organoids also recapitulate the crypt Villus structure to such a high degree of fidelity that they have been successfully transplanted to mouse intestines  and are hence highly regarded as a valuable model for research             One of the fields of research that intestinal organoids have been utilized is that of stem cell niche  Intestinal organoids were used to study the nature of the intestinal stem cell niche  and research done with them demonstrated the positive role IL    has in maintaining in intestinal stem cells              along with demonstrating the roles of other cell types like neurons and fibroblasts in maintenance of intestinal stem cells              In the field of infection biology  different intestinal organoid based model systems have been explored  On one hand  organoids can be infected in bulk by simply mixing them with the enteropathogen of interest              However  to model infection via a more natural route starting from the intestinal lumen  microinjection of the pathogen is required                          In addition  the polarity of intestinal organoids can be inverted              and they can even be dissociated into single cells and cultured as  D monolayers                         in order to make both the apical and basolateral sides of the epithelium more easily accessible  Intestinal organoids have also demonstrated therapeutic potential              An intestinal organoid  Minigut  grows up in   days  The scale bars are      m  In order to more accurately recapitulate the intestine in vivo  co cultures of intestinal organoids and immune cells have been developed              Furthermore  organ on a chip models combine intestinal organoids with other cell types such as endothelial or immune cells as well as peristaltic flow                         
Gastric organoid edit 
Gastric organoids recapitulate at least partly the physiology of the stomach  Gastric organoids have been generated directly from pluripotent stem cells through the temporal manipulation of the FGF  WNT  BMP  retinoic acid and EGF signalling pathways in three dimensional culture conditions              Gastric organoids have also been generated using LGR  expressing stomach adult stem cells              Gastric organoids have been used as model for the study of cancer                          along with human disease             and development              For example  one study              investigated the underlying genetic alterations behind a patient s metastatic tumor population  and identified that unlike the patient s primary tumor  the metastasis had both alleles of the TGFBR  gene mutated  To further assess the role of TGFBR  in the metastasis  the investigators created organoids where TGFBR  expression is knocked down  through which they were able to demonstrate that reduced TGFBR  activity leads to invasion and metastasis of cancerous tumors both in vitro and in vivo 

Lingual organoid edit 
Lingual organoids are organoids that recapitulate  at least partly  aspects of the tongue physiology  Epithelial lingual organoids have been generated using BMI  expressing epithelial stem cells in three dimensional culture conditions through the manipulation of EGF  WNT  and TGF                 This organoid culture  however  lacks taste receptors  as these cells do not arise from Bmi  expressing epithelial stem cells              Lingual taste bud organoids containing taste cells  however  have been created using the LGR   or CD    stem progenitor cells of circumvallate  CV  papilla tissue              These taste bud organoids have been successfully created both directly from isolated Lgr   or LGR  expressing taste stem progenitor cells               and indirectly  through the isolation  digestion  and subsequent culturing of CV tissue containing Lgr   or CD    stem progenitor cells             

Cerebellar organoid edit 
Cerebellar organoid or hind brain organoids tend to recapitulate the cellular diversity of the fetal cerebellum along with some of its distinct cytoarchitectural features  The generation of cerebellar tissue from PSCs requires a secondary induction which leads to the formation of isthmic organizer  which first appears in the cell aggregate in  D culture                           Over the years this area of research has led to cerebellar organoid development which involves the patterning of human pluripotent stem cells resulting in the generation of both cerebellar excitatory and inhibitory progenitor populations  This includes the rhombic lip and the ventricular zone progenitors  Although further resarch is still ongoing in context of functional and morphological development of Purkinje cells over a longer period of developmental time

Blood brain barrier  BBB  organoid             
Self assembled cell aggregates consisting of BMECs  astrocytes  and pericytes are emerging as a potential alternative to transwell and microfluidic models for certain applications  These organoides can generate many features of the BBB  such as the expression of tight junctions  molecular transporters  and drug efflux pumps  and can therefore be used to model drug transport across the BBB  Also  they can serve as a model for evaluating the interactions between the BBB and adjacent brain tissue and provide a platform for understanding the combined abilities of a new drug to overcome the BBB and its effect on brain tissue  In addition  such models are highly scalable and easier to manufacture and operate than microfluidic devices  However  they have limited ability to reconstruct the morphology and physiology of the BBB and are unable to simulate physiological flow and shear stress 
Basic research edit 
Organoids enable to study how cells interact together in an organ  their interaction with their environment  how diseases affect them and the effect of drugs  In vitro culture makes this system easy to manipulate and facilitates their monitoring  While organs are difficult to culture because their size limits the penetration of nutrients  the small size of organoids limits this problem  On the other hand  they do not exhibit all organ features and interactions with other organs are not recapitulated in vitro  While research on stem cells and regulation of stemness was the first field of application of intestinal organoids              they are now also used to study e g  uptake of nutrients  drug transport and secretion of incretin hormones               This is of great relevance in the context of malabsorption diseases as well as metabolic diseases such as obesity  insulin resistance  and diabetes 

Models of disease edit 
Organoids provide an opportunity to create cellular models of human disease  which can be studied in the laboratory to better understand the causes of disease and identify possible treatments  The power of organoids in this regard was first shown for a genetic form of microcephaly  where patient cells were used to make cerebral organoids  which were smaller and showed abnormalities in early generation of neurons              In another example  the genome editing system called CRISPR was applied to human pluripotent stem cells to introduce targeted mutations in genes relevant to two different kidney diseases  polycystic kidney disease and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis              These CRISPR modified pluripotent stem cells were subsequently grown into human kidney organoids  which exhibited disease specific phenotypes  Kidney organoids from stem cells with polycystic kidney disease mutations formed large  translucent cyst structures from kidney tubules  When cultured in the absence of adherent cues  in suspension   these cysts reached sizes of        cm in diameter over several months               Kidney organoids with mutations in a gene linked to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis developed junctional defects between podocytes  the filtering cells affected in that disease               Importantly  these disease phenotypes were absent in control organoids of identical genetic background  but lacking the CRISPR mutations                                        Comparison of these organoid phenotypes to diseased tissues from mice and humans suggested similarities to defects in early development                           
As first developed by Takahashi and Yamanaka in       induced pluripotent stem cells  iPSC  can also be reprogrammed from patient skin fibroblasts               These stem cells carry the exact genetic background of the patient including any genetic mutations which might contribute to the development of human disease  Differentiation of these cells into kidney organoids has been performed from patients with Lowe Syndrome due to ORCL  mutations               This report compared kidney organoids differentiated from patient iPSC to unrelated control iPSC and demonstrated an inability of patient kidney cells to mobilise transcription factor SIX  from the golgi complex               Because SIX  is a well characterised marker of nephron progenitor cells in the cap mesenchyme  the authors concluded that renal disease frequently seen in Lowe Syndrome  global failure of proximal tubule reabsorption or renal Fanconi syndrome  could be related to alteration in nephron patterning arising from nephron progenitor cells lacking this important SIX  gene expression              
Other studies have used CRISPR gene editing to correct the patient s mutation in the patient iPSC cells to create an isogenic control  which can be performed simultaneously with iPSC reprogramming                                         Comparison of a patient iPSC derived organoid against an isogenic control is the current gold standard in the field as it permits isolation of the mutation of interest as the only variable within the experimental model               In one such report  kidney organoids derived from iPSC of a patient with Mainzer Saldino Syndrome due to compound heterozygous mutations in IFT    were compared to an isogenic control organoid in which an IFT    variant giving rise to a non viable mRNA transcript was corrected by CRISPR               Patient kidney organoids demonstrated abnormal ciliary morphology consistent with existing animal models which was rescued to wild type morphology in the gene corrected organoids               Comparative transcriptional profiling of epithelial cells purified from patient and control organoids highlighted pathways involved in cell polarity  cell cell junctions and dynein motor assembly  some of which had been implicated for other genotypes within the phenotypic family of renal ciliopathies                Another report utilising an isogenic control demonstrated abnormal nephrin localisation in the glomeruli of kidney organoids generated from a patient with congenital nephrotic syndrome              
Things such as epithelial metabolism can also be modelled              

Personalised medicine edit 
Intestinal organoids grown from rectal biopsies using culture protocols established by the Clevers group have been used to model cystic fibrosis               and led to the first application of organoids for personalised treatment               Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease that is caused by gene mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene that encodes an epithelial ion channel necessary for healthy epithelial surface fluids  Studies by the laboratory of Jeffrey Beekman  Wilhelmina Children s Hospital  University Medical Center Utrecht  The Netherlands  described in      that stimulation of colorectal organoids with cAMP raising agonists such as forskolin or cholera toxin induced rapid swelling of organoids in a fully CFTR dependent manner               Whereas organoids from non cystic fibrosis subjects swell in response to forskolin as a consequence of fluid transport into the organoids  lumens  this is severely reduced or absent in organoids derived from people with cystic fibrosis  Swelling could be restored by therapeutics that repair the CFTR protein  CFTR modulators   indicating that individual responses to CFTR modulating therapy could be quantitated in a preclinical laboratory setting  Schwank et al  also demonstrated that the intestinal cystic fibrosis organoid phenotype could be repaired by CRISPR Cas  gene editing in                   
Follow up studies by Dekkers et al  in      revealed that quantitative differences in forskolin induced swelling between intestinal organoids derived from people with cystic fibrosis associate with known diagnostic and prognostic markers such as CFTR gene mutations or in vivo biomarkers of CFTR function               In addition  the authors demonstrated that CFTR modulator responses in intestinal organoids with specific CFTR mutations correlated with published clinical trial data of these treatments  This led to preclinical studies where organoids from patients with extremely rare CFTR mutations for who no treatment was registered were found to respond strongly to a clinically available CFTR modulator  The suggested clinical benefit of treatment for these subjects based on the preclinical organoid test was subsequently confirmed upon clinical introduction of treatment by members of the clinical CF center under supervision of Kors van der Ent  Department of Paediatric Pulmonology  Wilhelmina Children s Hospital  University Medical Center Utrecht  The Netherlands   These studies show for the first time that organoids can be used for the individual tailoring of therapy or personalised medicine 

Organoid transplants edit 
The self renewal and regenerative properties of intestinal organoids make them promising candidates for transplantation therapies  particularly for disease involving epithelial barrier disruption  Notably  transplantation of organoids into the duodenum of mice has been shown to aid in the recovery of mucosal damages on mice with ischemia reperfusion injury              
The first successful transplantation of an organoid into a human  a patient with ulcerative colitis whose cells were used for the organoid  was carried out in                                

As a model for developmental biology edit 
Organoids offer researchers an exceptional model to study developmental biology               Since the identification of pluripotent stem cells  there have been great advancements in directing pluripotent stem cells fate in vitro using  D cultures               These advancements in PSC fate direction  coupled with the advancements in  D culturing techniques allowed for the creation of organoids that recapitulate the properties of various specific subregions of a multitude of organs               The use of these organoids has thus greatly contributed to expanding our understanding of the processes of organogenesis  and the field of developmental biology               In central nervous system development  for example  organoids have contributed to our understanding of the physical forces that underlie retinal cup formation                            More recent work has extended cortical organoid growth periods extensively and at nearly a year under specific differentiation conditions  the organoids persist and have some features of human fetal development stages
