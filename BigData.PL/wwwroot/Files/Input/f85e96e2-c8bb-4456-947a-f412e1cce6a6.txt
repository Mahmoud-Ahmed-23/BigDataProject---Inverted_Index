Numbers significantly larger than those used regularly
For other uses  see Large number  disambiguation  
Large numbers  far beyond those encountered in everyday life such as simple counting or financial transactions play a crucial role in various domains  These expansive quantities appear prominently in mathematics  cosmology  cryptography  and statistical mechanics  While they often manifest as large positive integers  they can also take other forms in different contexts   such as P adic number   Googology delves into the naming conventions and properties of these immense numerical entities                       
Since the customary  traditional  non technical  decimal format of large numbers can be lengthy  other systems have been devised that allows for shorter representation  For example  a billion is represented as    characters                 in decimal format  but is only   characters       when expressed in exponential format  A trillion is    characters in decimal  but only          in exponential  Values that vary dramatically can be represented and compared graphically via logarithmic scale 


Natural language numbering edit 
A natural language numbering system allows for representing large numbers using names that more clearly distinguish numeric scale than a series of digits  For example  billion  may be easier to comprehend for some readers than                  But  as names  a numeric value can be lengthy  For example              is  two million  three hundred forty five thousand  seven hundred and eighty nine  

Standard notation edit 
Standard notation is a variation of English s natural language numbering  where it is shortened into a suffix  Examples are                      B  B   billion  

Scientific notation edit 
Scientific notation was devised to represent the vast range of values encountered in scientific research in a format that is more compact than traditional formats yet allows for high precision when called for  A value is represented as a decimal fraction times a multiple power of     The factor is intended to make reading comprehension easier than a lengthy series of zeros  For example          expresses one billion   followed by nine zeros  The reciprocal  one billionth  is           Sometimes the      becomes an e  like   billion as  e

Astronomical edit 
In astronomy and cosmology large numbers for measures of length and time are encountered  For instance  according to the prevailing Big Bang model  the universe is approximately      billion years old  equivalent to            seconds   The observable universe spans    billion light years  approximately          meters  and hosts around        stars  organized into roughly     billion galaxies  as observed by the Hubble Space Telescope   As a rough estimate  there are about      atoms within the observable universe

Combinatorial processes give rise to astonishingly large numbers  The  factorial function  which quantifies permutations of a fixed set of objects  grows superexponentially as the number of objects increases   Stirling s formula provides a precise asymptotic expression for this rapid growth 
In statistical mechanics  combinatorial numbers reach such immense magnitudes that they are often expressed using logarithms 
G del numbers  along with similar representations of bit strings in algorithmic information theory  are vast even for mathematical statements of moderate length  Remarkably  certain pathological numbers surpass even the G del numbers associated with typical mathematical propositions

      displaystyle log      
  
 to get a number between   and     Thus  the number is between

  As explained  a more precise description of a number also specifies the value of this number between   and     or the previous number  taking the logarithm one time less  between    and       or the next  between   and

 the power tower can be made one higher  replacing x by log  x  or find x from the lower tower representation of the log   of the whole number  If the power tower would contain one or more numbers different from     the two approaches would lead to different results  corresponding to the fact that extending the power tower with a    at the bottom is then not the same as extending it with a    at the top  but  of course  similar remarks apply if the whole power tower consists of copies of the same number  different from     
If the height of the tower is large  the various representations for large numbers can be applied to the height itself  If the height is given only approximately   giving a value at the top does not make sense  so the double arrow notation  e g

            x     
          
            n
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle  uparrow   n  
  
 
Compare this notation with the hyper operator and the Conway chained arrow notation 


  
    
      
        a
        
            x     
          
            n
          
        
        b
      
    
      displaystyle a uparrow   n b 
  
     a   b   n     hyper a       n                     b 
An advantage of the first is that when considered as function of b  there is a natural notation for powers of this function  just like when writing out the n arrows   
  
    
      
         
        a
        
            x     
          
            n
          
        
        
           
          
            k
          
        
        b
      
    
      displaystyle  a uparrow   n    k b 
  
  For example 


  
    
      
         
          
        
            x     
          
             
          
        
        
           
          
             
          
        
        b
      
    
      displaystyle     uparrow          b 
  
                        b                  
and only in special cases the long nested chain notation is reduced  for 
  
    
      
        
          
            x     
        
        
          b
            x     
        
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle   b     
  
 obtains 


  
    
      
          
        
            x     
          
             
          
        
         
         
         
          
        
            x     
          
             
          
        
        
           
          
             
          
        
         
      
    
      displaystyle    uparrow           uparrow            
  
                 
Since the b can also be very large  in general it can be written instead a number with a sequence of powers 
  
    
      
         
          
        
            x     
          
            n
          
        
        
           
          
            
              k
              
                n
              
            
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle     uparrow   n    k  n   
  
 with decreasing values of n  with exactly given integer exponents 
  
    
      
        
          
            k
            
              n
            
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle  k  n   
  
  with at the end a number in ordinary scientific notation  Whenever a 
  
    
      
        
          
            k
            
              n
            
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle  k  n   
  
 is too large to be given exactly  the value of 
  
    
      
        
          
            k

      displaystyle  k  n     
  
 is increased by   and everything to the right of 
  
    
      
         
        
          n
           
           
        
        
           
          
            
              k
              
                n
                 
                 
              
            
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle   n      k  n     
  
 is rewritten 
For describing numbers approximately  deviations from the decreasing order of values of n are not needed  For example  
  
    
      
          
          x     
         
          
          x       x     
        
           
          
             
          
        
        a
         
         
          
          x       x     
        
           
          
             
          
        
        a
      
    
      displaystyle    uparrow     uparrow  uparrow      a     uparrow  uparrow      a 
  
  and

          x       x       x     
         
         
         
          
          x       x     
         
          
          x       x

          x       x       x

  Thus is obtained the somewhat counterintuitive result that a number x can be so large that  in a way  x and   x are  almost equal   for arithmetic of large numbers see also below  
If the superscript of the upward arrow is large  the various representations for large numbers can be applied to this superscript itself  If this superscript is not exactly given then there is no point in raising the operator to a particular power or to adjust the value on which it act  instead it is possible to simply use a standard value at the right  say     and the expression reduces to 
  
    
      
          
        
            x     
          
            n
          
        
          
         
         
          
          x     
          
          x     
        n
         
      
    
      displaystyle    uparrow   n        to    to n  
  
 with an approximate n  For such numbers the advantage of using the upward arrow notation no longer applies  so the chain notation can be used instead 
The above can be applied recursively for this n  so the notation 
  
    
      
        
            x     
          
            n
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle  uparrow   n  
  
 is obtained in the superscript of the first arrow  etc   or a nested chain notation  e g

If the number of levels gets too large to be convenient  a notation is used where this number of levels is written down as a number  like using the superscript of the arrow instead of writing many arrows   Introducing a function 
  
    
      
        f
         
        n
         
         
          
        
            x     
          
            n
          
        
          
      
    
      displaystyle f n     uparrow   n    
  
              n   these levels become functional powers of f  allowing us to write a number in the form 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            m
          
        
         
        n
         
      
    
      displaystyle f  m  n  
  
 where m is given exactly and n is an integer which may or may not be given exactly  for example  
  
    
      
        
          f
          
             
          
        
         
         
          xd  
        
            
          
             
          
        
         
      
    
      displaystyle f       times         
  
   If n is large  any of the above can be used for expressing it  The  roundest  of these numbers are those of the form fm             m     For example  
  
    
      
         
          
          x     
          
          x     
         
          x     
         
         
         
          
        
            x     
          
              
            
                x     
              
                
                    
                  
                      
                  
                
              
            
              
          
        
          
      
    
      displaystyle     to    to   to       uparrow      uparrow                 
  

Compare the definition of Graham s number  it uses numbers   instead of    and has    arrow levels and the number   at the top  thus

 is too large to give exactly  it is possible to use a fixed n  e g  n      and apply the above recursively to m  i e   the number of levels of upward arrows is itself represented in the superscripted upward arrow notation  etc  Using the functional power notation of f this gives multiple levels of f  Introducing a function 
  
    
      
        g

      displaystyle g n  f  n     
  
 these levels become functional powers of g  allowing us to write a number in the form

      displaystyle g  m  n  
  
 where m is given exactly and n is an integer which may or may not be given exactly  For example  if        m      gm     If n is large any of the above can be used for expressing it  Similarly a function h  etc  can be introduced  If many such functions are required  they can be numbered instead of using a new letter every time  e g  as a subscript  such that there are numbers of the form

      displaystyle f  k   m  n  
  
 where k and m are given exactly and n is an integer which may or may not be given exactly  Using k   for the f above  k   for g  etc   obtains        n k

  If n is large any of the above can be used to express it  Thus is obtained a nesting of forms

 with decreasing values of n  where all these numbers are exactly given integers  with at the end a number in ordinary scientific notation 
For a number too large to write down in the Conway chained arrow notation it size can be described by the length of that chain  for example only using elements    in the chain  in other words  one could specify its position in the sequence                         If even the position in the sequence is a large number same techniques can be applied again

Other notations edit 
Some notations for extremely large numbers 

Knuth s up arrow notation hyperoperators Ackermann function  including tetration
Conway chained arrow notation
Steinhaus Moser notation  apart from the method of construction of large numbers  this also involves a graphical notation with polygons  Alternative notations  like a more conventional function notation  can also be used with the same functions 
Fast growing hierarchy
These notations are essentially functions of integer variables  which increase very rapidly with those integers  Ever faster increasing functions can easily be constructed recursively by applying these functions with large integers as argument 
A function with a vertical asymptote is not helpful in defining a very large number  although the function increases very rapidly  one has to define an argument very close to the asymptote  i e  use a very small number  and constructing that is equivalent to constructing a very large number  e g  the reciprocal

Accuracy edit 
For a number 
  
    
      
        
            
          
            n
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle     n  
  
  one unit change in n changes the result by a factor     In a number like

      displaystyle             times         
  
  with the     the result of proper rounding using significant figures  the true value of the exponent may be    less or    more  Hence the result may be a factor

 too large or too small  This seems like extremely poor accuracy  but for such a large number it may be considered fair  a large error in a large number may be  relatively small  and therefore acceptable  

For very large numbers edit 
In the case of an approximation of an extremely large number  the relative error may be large  yet there may still be a sense in which one wants to consider the numbers as  close in magnitude   For example  consider


  
    
      
        
            
          
              
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle         
  
 and 
  
    
      
        
            
          
             
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle        
  

The relative error is


  
    
      
         
          x     
        
          
            
                
              
                 
              
            
            
                
              
                  
              
            
          
        
         
         
          x     
        
          
             
              
          
        
         
          
          x   
      
    
      displaystyle     frac                        frac               
  

a large relative error  However  one can also consider the relative error in the logarithms  in this case  the logarithms  to base     are    and    so the relative error in the logarithms is only     
The point is that exponential functions magnify relative errors greatly   if a and b have a small relative error 


  
    
      
        
            
          
            a
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle     a  
  
 and 
  
    
      
        
            
          
            b
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle     b  
  

the relative error is larger  and


  
    
      
        
            
          
            
                
              
                a
              
            
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle         a   
  
 and 
  
    
      
        
            
          
            
                
              
                b
              
            
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle         b   
  

will have an even larger relative error  The question then becomes  on which level of iterated logarithms to compare two numbers  There is a sense in which one may want to consider


  
    
      
        
            
          
            
                
              
                  
              
            
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle              
  
 and 
  
    
      
        
            
          
            
                
              
                 
              
            
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle             
  

to be  close in magnitude   The relative error between these two numbers is large  and the relative error between their logarithms is still large  however  the relative error in their second iterated logarithms is small 


  
    
      
        
          log

          log

 and 
  
    
      
        
          log
          
              
          
        
          x     
         
        
          log
          
              
          
        
          x     
         
        
            
          
            
                
              
                 
              
            
          
        
         
         
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle  log        log                       
  

Such comparisons of iterated logarithms are common  e g   in analytic number theory 

Classes edit 
One solution to the problem of comparing large numbers is to define classes of numbers  such as the system devised by Robert Munafo              which is based on different  levels  of perception of an average person  Class     numbers between zero and six   is defined to contain numbers that are easily subitized  that is  numbers that show up very frequently in daily life and are almost instantly comparable  Class     numbers between six and                 is defined to contain numbers whose decimal expressions are easily subitized  that is  numbers who are easily comparable not by cardinality  but  at a glance  given the decimal expansion 
Each class after these are defined in terms of iterating this base    exponentiation  to simulate the effect of another  iteration  of human indistinguishibility  For example  class   is defined to include numbers between           and              which are numbers where X becomes humanly indistinguishable from X                taking iterated logarithms of such X yields indistinguishibility firstly between log X  and  log X   secondly between log log X   and   log log X    and finally an extremely long decimal expansion whose length can t be subitized  

Approximate arithmetic edit 
There are some general rules relating to the usual arithmetic operations performed on very large numbers 

The sum and the product of two very large numbers are both  approximately  equal to the larger one 

  
    
      
         
        
            
          
            a
          
        
        
           
          
            
            
            
                
              
                b
              
            
          
        
         
        
            
          
            a
            
                
              
                b
              
            
          
        
         
        
            
          
            
                
              
                b
                 
                
                  log
                  
                      
                  
                
                  x     
                a
              
            
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle      a            b       a    b           b  log      a   
  

Hence 

A very large number raised to a very large power is  approximately  equal to the larger of the following two values  the first value and    to the power the second  For example  for very large 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
      displaystyle n 
  
 there is 
  
    
      
        
          n
          
            n
          
        
          x     
        
            
          
            n
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle n  n  approx     n

      displaystyle    n  approx     n

Systematically creating ever faster increasing sequences edit 
Main article  fast growing hierarchy
Given a strictly increasing integer sequence function 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
             
          
        
         
        n
         
      
    
      displaystyle f     n  
  
  n     it is possible to produce a faster growing sequence 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
             
          
        
         
        n
         
         
        
          f
          
             
          
          
            n
          
        
         
        n
         
      
    
      displaystyle f     n  f      n  n  
  
  where the superscript n denotes the nth functional power   This can be repeated any number of times by letting 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            k
          
        
         
        n
         
         
        
          f
          
            k
              x     
             
          
          
            n
          
        
         
        n
         
      
    
      displaystyle f  k  n  f  k     n  n  
  
  each sequence growing much faster than the one before it  Thus it is possible to define 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
              x c  
          
        
         
        n
         
         
        
          f
          
            n
          
        
         
        n
         
      
    
      displaystyle f   omega   n  f  n  n  
  
  which grows much faster than any 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            k
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle f  k  
  
 for finite k  here   is the first infinite ordinal number  representing the limit of all finite numbers k    This is the basis for the fast growing hierarchy of functions  in which the indexing subscript is extended to ever larger ordinals 
For example  starting with  f  n    n     

f  n    f n n    n   n    n
f  n    f n n     nn  gt        n for n      using Knuth up arrow notation 
f  n    f n n   gt       n n        n for n    
fk   n   gt     k n for n      k  lt   
f  n    fn n   gt     n     n  gt     n      n            A n  n  for n      where A is the Ackermann function  of which f  is a unary version 
f         gt  f        gt  Graham s number    g   in the sequence defined by g       gk        gk   
This follows by noting f  n   gt     n     n  gt     n            and hence f  gk       gt  gk      
f  n   gt     n     n         n   n             n   n         using Conway chained arrow notation 
f    n    f n n   gt       n   n         because if gk n    X   n   k then X   n   k     gkn    
f  k n   gt       n   n     k     gt   n   n   k 
f   n    f  n n   gt   n   n   n     n   n   n    
f   k n   gt   n   n   n   k 
f   n   gt   n   n   n   n 
f k n   gt   n   n         n   n   Chain of k   n s 
f   n    f n n    gt   n   n         n   n   Chain of n   n s 


In some noncomputable sequences edit 
The busy beaver function   is an example of a function which grows faster than any computable function  Its value for even relatively small input is huge  The values of   n  for n                 are                                sequence A       in the OEIS        is not known but is at least        

Infinite numbers edit 
Main article  cardinal number
See also  large cardinal  Mahlo cardinal  and totally indescribable cardinal
Although all the numbers discussed above are very large  they are all still finite   Certain fields of mathematics define infinite and transfinite numbers  For example  aleph null is the cardinality of the infinite set of natural numbers  and aleph one is the next greatest cardinal number

      displaystyle   mathfrak  c   
  
 is the cardinality of the reals   The proposition that 
  
    
      
        
          
            c
