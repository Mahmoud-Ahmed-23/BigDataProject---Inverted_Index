The persecution of university faculty members is unacceptable  said two human rights groups on Tuesday 
The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights  EIPR  and the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression  AFTE  condemned the referral of Professor Mona Prince to disciplinary investigation and said that those working in the academic community should be afforded the protection to express views that may or may not be widely accepted 
 The two organisations believe that the protection and promotion of academic freedom  and the protection of faculty members from any attempts to interfere or intellectual terrorism  is mainly the responsibility of the academic institution   said the statement  issued on Tuesday  It called on academic institutions to create a safe environment for university faculty to freely express views  instead of cracking down on freedom of expression 
The groups also called on Suez CanalUniversity to launch an initiative involving students and faculty  promoting and discussing the concepts of academic freedom and freedom of expression and the need for everyone to respect dissenting opinions 
Prince was accused of contempt of religion by a number of her students after a lecture in early April  The complaints prompted an investigation 
Prince teaches a course in conversation  and before her controversial class  she and her pupils had agreed to discuss sectarian strife in Egypt  a growing topic of interest following violence in Al Khasous and at St Mark s Coptic Orthodox Cathedral 
The class discussion revealed opposing views on the matter  Prince showed posters put up at the university by Salafi students that said   Shi a are the enemy  and told her students that this was an example of sectarianism 
Following the lecture  students submitted complaints against her and Prince said she had received death threats from some 
On    April the Dean of the Faculty of Education called Prince and told her that she should not come to the university in case she could not be protected from students  reactions  Prince has since taken preventive legal action to show that she was asked not to come to the university and had received death threats 
The first complaint accuses her of contempt against Islam as a result of statements made during her lecture  The second complaint was made over comments she allegedly wrote on Facebook criticising the dean  and the third complaint is for irregular attendance 
Prince denied the accusations made in the complaints  saying they stemmed from her discussion with students about sectarian strife
