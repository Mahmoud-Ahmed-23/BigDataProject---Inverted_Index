First order logic  also called predicate logic  predicate calculus  or quantificational logic  is a collection of formal systems used in mathematics  philosophy  linguistics  and computer science  First order logic uses quantified variables over non logical objects  and allows the use of sentences that contain variables  Rather than propositions such as  all men are mortal   in first order logic one can have expressions in the form  for all x  if x is a man  then x is mortal   where  for all x  is a quantifier  x is a variable  and      is a man  and      is mortal  are predicates             This distinguishes it from propositional logic  which does not use quantifiers or relations                                   in this sense  propositional logic is the foundation of first order logic 
A theory about a topic  such as set theory  a theory for groups             or a formal theory of arithmetic  is usually a first order logic together with a specified domain of discourse  over which the quantified variables range   finitely many functions from that domain to itself  finitely many predicates defined on that domain  and a set of axioms believed to hold about them   Theory  is sometimes understood in a more formal sense as just a set of sentences in first order logic 
The term  first order  distinguishes first order logic from higher order logic  in which there are predicates having predicates or functions as arguments  or in which quantification over predicates  functions  or both  are permitted                                  In first order theories  predicates are often associated with sets  In interpreted higher order theories  predicates may be interpreted as sets of sets 
There are many deductive systems for first order logic which are both sound  i e  all provable statements are true in all models  and complete  i e  all statements which are true in all models are provable  Although the logical consequence relation is only semidecidable  much progress has been made in automated theorem proving in first order logic  First order logic also satisfies several metalogical theorems that make it amenable to analysis in proof theory  such as the L wenheim Skolem theorem and the compactness theorem 
First order logic is the standard for the formalization of mathematics into axioms  and is studied in the foundations of mathematics  Peano arithmetic and Zermelo Fraenkel set theory are axiomatizations of number theory and set theory  respectively  into first order logic  No first order theory  however  has the strength to uniquely describe a structure with an infinite domain  such as the natural numbers or the real line  Axiom systems that do fully describe these two structures  i e  categorical axiom systems  can be obtained in stronger logics such as second order logic 
The foundations of first order logic were developed independently by Gottlob Frege and Charles Sanders Peirce             For a history of first order logic and how it came to dominate formal logic  see Jos  Ferreir s

While propositional logic deals with simple declarative propositions  first order logic additionally covers predicates and quantification  A predicate evaluates to true or false for an entity or entities in the domain of discourse 
Consider the two sentences  Socrates is a philosopher  and  Plato is a philosopher   In propositional logic  these sentences themselves are viewed as the individuals of study  and might be denoted  for example  by variables such as p and q  They are not viewed as an application of a predicate  such as 
  
    
      
        
          isPhil
        
      
    
      displaystyle   text isPhil   
  
  to any particular objects in the domain of discourse  instead viewing them as purely an utterance which is either true or false             However  in first order logic  these two sentences may be framed as statements that a certain individual or non logical object has a property  In this example  both sentences happen to have the common form 
  
    
      
        
          isPhil
        
         
        x
         
      
    
      displaystyle   text isPhil   x  
  
 for some individual 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
      displaystyle x 
  
  in the first sentence the value of the variable x is  Socrates   and in the second sentence it is  Plato   Due to the ability to speak about non logical individuals along with the original logical connectives  first order logic includes propositional logic                                    
The truth of a formula such as  x is a philosopher  depends on which object is denoted by x and on the interpretation of the predicate  is a philosopher   Consequently   x is a philosopher  alone does not have a definite truth value of true or false  and is akin to a sentence fragment             Relationships between predicates can be stated using logical connectives  For example  the first order formula  if x is a philosopher  then x is a scholar   is a conditional statement with  x is a philosopher  as its hypothesis  and  x is a scholar  as its conclusion  which again needs specification of x in order to have a definite truth value 
Quantifiers can be applied to variables in a formula  The variable x in the previous formula can be universally quantified  for instance  with the first order sentence  For every x  if x is a philosopher  then x is a scholar   The universal quantifier  for every  in this sentence expresses the idea that the claim  if x is a philosopher  then x is a scholar  holds for all choices of x 
The negation of the sentence  For every x  if x is a philosopher  then x is a scholar  is logically equivalent to the sentence  There exists x such that x is a philosopher and x is not a scholar   The existential quantifier  there exists  expresses the idea that the claim  x is a philosopher and x is not a scholar  holds for some choice of x 
The predicates  is a philosopher  and  is a scholar  each take a single variable  In general  predicates can take several variables  In the first order sentence  Socrates is the teacher of Plato   the predicate  is the teacher of  takes two variables 
An interpretation  or model  of a first order formula specifies what each predicate means  and the entities that can instantiate the variables  These entities form the domain of discourse or universe  which is usually required to be a nonempty set  For example  consider the sentence  There exists x such that x is a philosopher   This sentence is seen as being true in an interpretation such that the domain of discourse consists of all human beings  and that the predicate  is a philosopher  is understood as  was the author of the Republic   It is true  as witnessed by Plato in that text      clarification needed     
There are two key parts of first order logic  The syntax determines which finite sequences of symbols are well formed expressions in first order logic  while the semantics determines the meanings behind these expressions

See also  Formal languageUnlike natural languages  such as English  the language of first order logic is completely formal  so that it can be mechanically determined whether a given expression is well formed  There are two key types of well formed expressions  terms  which intuitively represent objects  and formulas  which intuitively express statements that can be true or false  The terms and formulas of first order logic are strings of symbols  where all the symbols together form the alphabet of the language  
Alphabet edit 
See also  Alphabet  formal languages  and Symbol  formal 
As with all formal languages  the nature of the symbols themselves is outside the scope of formal logic  they are often regarded simply as letters and punctuation symbols 
It is common to divide the symbols of the alphabet into logical symbols  which always have the same meaning  and non logical symbols  whose meaning varies by interpretation             For example  the logical symbol 
  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  land  
  
 always represents  and   it is never interpreted as  or   which is represented by the logical symbol 
  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  lor  
  
  However  a non logical predicate symbol such as Phil x  could be interpreted to mean  x is a philosopher    x is a man named Philip   or any other unary predicate depending on the interpretation at hand 

Logical symbols edit 
Main article  List of logical symbols
Logical symbols are a set of characters that vary by author  but usually include the following             

Quantifier symbols    for universal quantification  and   for existential quantification
Logical connectives    for conjunction    for disjunction    for implication    for biconditional    for negation  Some authors             use Cpq instead of   and Epq instead of    especially in contexts where   is used for other purposes  Moreover  the horseshoe   may replace               the triple bar   may replace    a tilde      Np  or Fp may replace    a double bar 
  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle    
  
  
  
    
      
         
      
    
      displaystyle   
  
              or Apq may replace    and an ampersand  amp   Kpq  or the middle dot   may replace    especially if these symbols are not available for technical reasons 
Parentheses  brackets  and other punctuation symbols  The choice of such symbols varies depending on context 
An infinite set of variables  often denoted by lowercase letters at the end of the alphabet x  y  z        Subscripts are often used to distinguish variables  x   x   x             
An equality symbol  sometimes  identity symbol     see        Equality and its axioms below  
Not all of these symbols are required in first order logic  Either one of the quantifiers along with negation  conjunction  or disjunction   variables  brackets  and equality suffices 
Other logical symbols include the following 

Truth constants  T  or   for  true  and F  or   for  false   Without any such logical operators of valence    these two constants can only be expressed using quantifiers 
Additional logical connectives such as the Sheffer stroke  Dpq  NAND   and exclusive or  Jpq 
Non logical symbols edit 
Non logical symbols represent predicates  relations   functions and constants  It used to be standard practice to use a fixed  infinite set of non logical symbols for all purposes 

For every integer n                there is a collection of n ary  or n place  predicate symbols  Because they represent relations between n elements  they are also called relation symbols  For each arity n  there is an infinite supply of them 
Pn   Pn   Pn   Pn      
For every integer n                there are infinitely many n ary function symbols 
f n   f n   f n   f n      
When the arity of a predicate symbol or function symbol is clear from context  the superscript n is often omitted 
In this traditional approach  there is only one language of first order logic              This approach is still common  especially in philosophically oriented books 
A more recent practice is to use different non logical symbols according to the application one has in mind  Therefore  it has become necessary to name the set of all non logical symbols used in a particular application  This choice is made via a signature             
Typical signatures in mathematics are        or just     for groups             or               lt   for ordered fields  There are no restrictions on the number of non logical symbols  The signature can be empty  finite  or infinite  even uncountable  Uncountable signatures occur for example in modern proofs of the L wenheim Skolem theorem 
Though signatures might in some cases imply how non logical symbols are to be interpreted  interpretation of the non logical symbols in the signature is separate  and not necessarily fixed   Signatures concern syntax rather than semantics 
In this approach  every non logical symbol is of one of the following types 

A predicate symbol  or relation symbol  with some valence  or arity  number of arguments  greater than or equal to    These are often denoted by uppercase letters such as P  Q and R  Examples 
In P x   P is a predicate symbol of valence    One possible interpretation is  x is a man  
In Q x y   Q is a predicate symbol of valence    Possible interpretations include  x is greater than y  and  x is the father of y  
Relations of valence   can be identified with propositional variables  which can stand for any statement  One possible interpretation of R is  Socrates is a man  
A function symbol  with some valence greater than or equal to    These are often denoted by lowercase roman letters such as f  g and h  Examples 
f x  may be interpreted as  the father of x   In arithmetic  it may stand for   x   In set theory  it may stand for  the power set of x  
In arithmetic  g x y  may stand for  x y   In set theory  it may stand for  the union of x and y  
Function symbols of valence   are called constant symbols  and are often denoted by lowercase letters at the beginning of the alphabet such as a  b and c  The symbol a may stand for Socrates  In arithmetic  it may stand for    In set theory  it may stand for the empty set 
The traditional approach can be recovered in the modern approach  by simply specifying the  custom  signature to consist of the traditional sequences of non logical symbols

The above context free grammar in Backus Naur form defines the language of syntactically valid first order formulas with function symbols and predicate symbols up to arity    For higher arities  it needs to be adapted accordingly                  citation needed     


The example formula  x  x    x c    f  x x   c  describes multiplicative inverses when f    c  and c  are interpreted as multiplication  zero  and one  respectively 

The formation rules define the terms and formulas of first order logic              When terms and formulas are represented as strings of symbols  these rules can be used to write a formal grammar for terms and formulas  These rules are generally context free  each production has a single symbol on the left side   except that the set of symbols may be allowed to be infinite and there may be many start symbols  for example the variables in the case of terms 

Terms edit 
The set of terms is inductively defined by the following rules             

Variables  Any variable symbol is a term 
Functions  If f is an n ary function symbol  and t        tn are terms  then f t      tn  is a term  In particular  symbols denoting individual constants are nullary function symbols  and thus are terms 
Only expressions which can be obtained by finitely many applications of rules   and   are terms  For example  no expression involving a predicate symbol is a term 

Formulas edit 
The set of formulas  also called well formed formulas             or WFFs  is inductively defined by the following rules 

Predicate symbols  If P is an n ary predicate symbol and t        tn are terms then P t      tn  is a formula 
Equality  If the equality symbol is considered part of logic  and t  and t  are terms  then t    t  is a formula 
Negation  If 
  
    
      
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle  varphi  
  
 is a formula  then

Binary connectives  If

        and

          x c

  is a formula  Similar rules apply to other binary logical connectives 
Quantifiers  If 
  
    
      
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle  varphi  
  
  is a formula and x is a variable  then 
  
    
      
          x     
        x
          x c

          x c

 holds  and

        x
          x c

  there exists x such that 
  
    
      
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle  varphi  
  
  are formulas 
Only expressions which can be obtained by finitely many applications of rules     are formulas  The formulas obtained from the first two rules are said to be atomic formulas 
For example 


  
    
      
          x     
        x
          x     
        y
         
        P
         
        f
         
        x
         
         
          x     
          xac 
         
        P
         
        x
         
          x     
        Q
         
        f
         
        y
         
         
        x
         
        z
         
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle  forall x forall y P f x   rightarrow  neg  P x  rightarrow Q f y  x z    
  

is a formula  if f is a unary function symbol  P a unary predicate symbol  and Q a ternary predicate symbol  However  
  
    
      
          x     
        x
        
        x
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  forall x  x rightarrow  
  
 is not a formula  although it is a string of symbols from the alphabet 
The role of the parentheses in the definition is to ensure that any formula can only be obtained in one way by following the inductive definition  i e   there is a unique parse tree for each formula   This property is known as unique readability of formulas  There are many conventions for where parentheses are used in formulas  For example  some authors use colons or full stops instead of parentheses  or change the places in which parentheses are inserted  Each author s particular definition must be accompanied by a proof of unique readability 

Notational conventions edit 
For convenience  conventions have been developed about the precedence of the logical operators  to avoid the need to write parentheses in some cases  These rules are similar to the order of operations in arithmetic  A common convention is 


  
    
      
          xac 
      
    
      displaystyle  lnot  
  
 is evaluated first

  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  land  
  
 and 
  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  lor  
  
 are evaluated next
Quantifiers are evaluated next

  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  to  
  
 is evaluated last 
Moreover  extra punctuation not required by the definition may be inserted to make formulas easier to read  Thus the formula 


  
    
      
          xac 
          x     
        x
        P

        P
         
        x
         
      
    
      displaystyle  lnot  forall xP x  to  exists x lnot P x  
  

might be written as 


  
    
      
         
          xac

      displaystyle   lnot   forall xP x    to  exists x  lnot P x    
  

Free and bound variables edit 
Main article  Free variables and bound variables
In a formula  a variable may occur free or bound  or both   One formalization of this notion is due to Quine  first the concept of a variable occurrence is defined  then whether a variable occurrence is free or bound  then whether a variable symbol overall is free or bound  In order to distinguish different occurrences of the identical symbol x  each occurrence of a variable symbol x in a formula        is identified with the initial substring of        up to the point at which said instance of the symbol x appears            p     Then  an occurrence of x is said to be bound if that occurrence of x lies within the scope of at least one of either 
  
    
      
          x     
        x
      
    
      displaystyle  exists x 
  
 or 
  
    
      
          x     
        x
      
    
      displaystyle  forall x 
  
  Finally  x is bound in        if all occurrences of x in        are bound            pp         
Intuitively  a variable symbol is free in a formula if at no point is it quantified            pp          in  y P x  y   the sole occurrence of variable x is free while that of y is bound  The free and bound variable occurrences in a formula are defined inductively as follows 

Atomic formulas
If   is an atomic formula  then x occurs free in   if and only if x occurs in    Moreover  there are no bound variables in any atomic formula 
Negation
x occurs free in    if and only if x occurs free in    x occurs bound in    if and only if x occurs bound in  
Binary connectives
x occurs free in         if and only if x occurs free in either   or    x occurs bound in         if and only if x occurs bound in either   or    The same rule applies to any other binary connective in place of   
Quantifiers
x occurs free in  y    if and only if x occurs free in   and x is a different symbol from y  Also  x occurs bound in  y    if and only if x is y or x occurs bound in    The same rule holds with   in place of   
For example  in  x  y  P x    Q x f x  z    x and y occur only bound               z occurs only free  and w is neither because it does not occur in the formula 
Free and bound variables of a formula need not be disjoint sets  in the formula P x     x Q x   the first occurrence of x  as argument of P  is free while the second one  as argument of Q  is bound 
A formula in first order logic with no free variable occurrences is called a first order sentence  These are the formulas that will have well defined truth values under an interpretation  For example  whether a formula such as Phil x  is true must depend on what x represents  But the sentence  x Phil x  will be either true or false in a given interpretation 

Example  ordered abelian groups edit 
In mathematics  the language of ordered abelian groups has one constant symbol    one unary function symbol    one binary function symbol    and one binary relation symbol    Then 

The expressions   x  y  and   x    y    z    are terms  These are usually written as x   y and x   y   z 
The expressions   x  y      and     x    y    z       x  y   are atomic formulas  These are usually written as x   y     and x   y   z               x   y

 is a formula  which is usually written as

      displaystyle  forall x forall y x y leq z  to  forall x forall y x y     
  
 This formula has one free variable  z 
The axioms for ordered abelian groups can be expressed as a set of sentences in the language  For example  the axiom stating that the group is commutative is usually written 
  
    
      
         
          x     
        x

        y
         
        x
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle   forall x   forall y  x y y x   
  


Semantics edit 
An interpretation of a first order language assigns a denotation to each non logical symbol  predicate symbol  function symbol  or constant symbol  in that language  It also determines a domain of discourse that specifies the range of the quantifiers  The result is that each term is assigned an object that it represents  each predicate is assigned a property of objects  and each sentence is assigned a truth value  In this way  an interpretation provides semantic meaning to the terms  predicates  and formulas of the language  The study of the interpretations of formal languages is called formal semantics  What follows is a description of the standard or Tarskian semantics for first order logic   It is also possible to define game semantics for first order logic  but aside from requiring the axiom of choice  game semantics agree with Tarskian semantics for first order logic  so game semantics will not be elaborated herein  

First order structures edit 
Main article  Structure  mathematical logic 
The most common way of specifying an interpretation  especially in mathematics  is to specify a structure  also called a model  see below   The structure consists of a domain of discourse D and an interpretation function I mapping non logical symbols to predicates  functions  and constants 
The domain of discourse D is a nonempty set of  objects  of some kind  Intuitively  given an interpretation  a first order formula becomes a statement about these objects  for example  
  
    
      
          x     
        x
        P
         
        x
         
      
    
      displaystyle  exists xP x  
  
 states the existence of some object in D for which the predicate P is true  or  more precisely  for which the predicate assigned to the predicate symbol P by the interpretation is true   For example  one can take D to be the set of integers 
Non logical symbols are interpreted as follows 

The interpretation of an n ary function symbol is a function from Dn to D  For example  if the domain of discourse is the set of integers  a function symbol f of arity   can be interpreted as the function that gives the sum of its arguments  In other words  the symbol f is associated with the function        
  
    
      
        I
         
        f
         
      
    
      displaystyle I f  
  
        which  in this interpretation  is addition 
The interpretation of a constant symbol  a function symbol of arity    is a function from D   a set whose only member is the empty tuple  to D  which can be simply identified with an object in D  For example  an interpretation may assign the value 
  
    
      
        I
         
        c
         
         
          
      
    
      displaystyle I c     
  
 to the constant symbol 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
      displaystyle c 
  
 
The interpretation of an n ary predicate symbol is a set of n tuples of elements of D  giving the arguments for which the predicate is true  For example  an interpretation 
  
    
      
        I
         
        P
         
      
    
      displaystyle I P  
  
 of a binary predicate symbol P may be the set of pairs of integers such that the first one is less than the second  According to this interpretation  the predicate P would be true if its first argument is less than its second argument  Equivalently  predicate symbols may be assigned Boolean valued functions from Dn to 
  
    
      
         
        
          t
          r
          u
          e
           
          f
          a
          l
          s
          e
        
         
      
    
      displaystyle    mathrm  true false

A formula evaluates to true or false given an interpretation and a variable assignment   that associates an element of the domain of discourse with each variable  The reason that a variable assignment is required is to give meanings to formulas with free variables  such as 
  
    
      
        y
         
        x
      
    
      displaystyle y x 
  
  The truth value of this formula changes depending on the values that x and y denote 
First  the variable assignment   can be extended to all terms of the language  with the result that each term maps to a single element of the domain of discourse  The following rules are used to make this assignment 

Variables  Each variable x evaluates to   x

 if there exists an evaluation 
  
    
      
        
            x bc 
            x     
        
      
    
      displaystyle  mu   
  
 of the variables that differs from

 at most regarding the evaluation of x and such that   is true according to the interpretation M and the variable assignment

      displaystyle  forall x varphi  x  
  
 is true if every possible choice of a value for x causes   x  to be true 
If a formula does not contain free variables  and so is a sentence  then the initial variable assignment does not affect its truth value  In other words  a sentence is true according to M and 
  
    
      
          x bc 
      
    
      displaystyle  mu

            x     
        
      
    
      displaystyle  mu   
  
 
There is a second common approach to defining truth values that does not rely on variable assignment functions  Instead  given an interpretation M  one first adds to the signature a collection of constant symbols  one for each element of the domain of discourse in M  say that for each d in the domain the constant symbol cd is fixed  The interpretation is extended so that each new constant symbol is assigned to its corresponding element of the domain  One now defines truth for quantified formulas syntactically  as follows 

Existential quantifiers  alternate   A formula 
  
    
      
          x     
        x
          x c  
         
        x
         
      
    
      displaystyle  exists x varphi  x  
  
 is true according to M if there is some d in the domain of discourse such that 
  
    
      
          x c  
         
        
          c
          
            d
          
        
         
      
    
      displaystyle  varphi  c  d   
  
 holds  Here 
  
    
      
          x c  
         
        
          c
          
            d
          
        
         
      
    
      displaystyle  varphi  c  d   
  
 is the result of substituting  cd for every free occurrence of x in   
Universal quantifiers  alternate   A formula 
  
    
      
          x     
        x

        x
         
      
    
      displaystyle  forall x varphi  x  
  
 is true according to M if  for every d in the domain of discourse  
  
    
      
          x c  
         
        
          c
          
            d
          
        
         
      
    
      displaystyle  varphi  c  d   
  
 is true according to M 
This alternate approach gives exactly the same truth values to all sentences as the approach via variable assignments 

Validity  satisfiability  and logical consequence edit 
See also  Satisfiability
If a sentence   evaluates to true under a given interpretation M  one says that M satisfies    this is denoted             
  
    
      
        M
          x  a  
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle M vDash  varphi  
  
  A sentence is satisfiable if there is some interpretation under which it is true  This is a bit different from the symbol 
  
    
      
          x  a  
      
    
      displaystyle  vDash  
  
 from model theory  where 
  
    
      
        M
          x  a  
          x d  
      
    
      displaystyle M vDash  phi  
  
 denotes satisfiability in a model  i e   there is a suitable assignment of values in 
  
    
      
        M
      
    
      displaystyle M 
  
 s domain to variable symbols of 
  
    
      
          x d  
      
    
      displaystyle  phi  
  
              
Satisfiability of formulas with free variables is more complicated  because an interpretation on its own does not determine the truth value of such a formula  The most common convention is that a formula   with free variables 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
             
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle x     
  
       
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle x  n  
  
 is said to be satisfied by an interpretation if the formula   remains true regardless which individuals from the domain of discourse are assigned to its free variables 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
             
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle x     
  
       
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle x  n  
  
  This has the same effect as saying that a formula   is satisfied if and only if its universal closure 
  
    
      
          x     
        
          x
          
             
          
        
          x     
          x     
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
          x d  
         
        
          x
          
             
          
        
         
          x     
         
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
         
      
    
      displaystyle  forall x     dots  forall x  n  phi  x      dots  x  n   
  
 is satisfied 
A formula is logically valid  or simply valid  if it is true in every interpretation              These formulas play a role similar to tautologies in propositional logic 
A formula   is a logical consequence of a formula   if every interpretation that makes   true also makes   true  In this case one says that   is logically implied by   

Algebraizations edit 
An alternate approach to the semantics of first order logic proceeds via abstract algebra  This approach generalizes the  Lindenbaum Tarski algebras of propositional logic   There are three ways of eliminating quantified variables from first order logic that do not involve replacing quantifiers with other variable binding term operators 

Cylindric algebra  by Alfred Tarski  et al  
Polyadic algebra  by Paul Halmos 
Predicate functor logic  primarily by Willard Quine 
These algebras are all lattices that properly extend the two element Boolean algebra 
Tarski and Givant        showed that the fragment of first order logic that has no atomic sentence lying in the scope of more than three quantifiers has the same expressive power as relation algebra                                      This fragment is of great interest because it suffices for Peano arithmetic and most axiomatic set theory  including the canonical Zermelo Fraenkel set theory  ZFC   They also prove that first order logic with a primitive ordered pair is equivalent to a relation algebra with two ordered pair projection functions                                   

First order theories  models  and elementary classes edit 
A first order theory of a particular signature is a set of axioms  which are sentences consisting of symbols from that signature  The set of axioms is often finite or recursively enumerable  in which case the theory is called effective  Some authors require theories to also include all logical consequences of the axioms  The axioms are considered to hold within the theory and from them other sentences that hold within the theory can be derived 
A first order structure that satisfies all sentences in a given theory is said to be a model of the theory  An elementary class is the set of all structures satisfying a particular theory  These classes are a main subject of study in model theory 
Many theories have an intended interpretation  a certain model that is kept in mind when studying the theory  For example  the intended interpretation of Peano arithmetic consists of the usual natural numbers with their usual operations  However  the L wenheim Skolem theorem shows that most first order theories will also have other  nonstandard models 
A theory is consistent  within a deductive system  if it is not possible to prove a contradiction from the axioms of the theory  A theory is complete if  for every formula in its signature  either that formula or its negation is a logical consequence of the axioms of the theory  G del s incompleteness theorem shows that effective first order theories that include a sufficient portion of the theory of the natural numbers can never be both consistent and complete 

Empty domains edit 
Main article  Empty domain
The definition above requires that the domain of discourse of any interpretation must be nonempty  There are settings  such as inclusive logic  where empty domains are permitted  Moreover  if a class of algebraic structures includes an empty structure  for example  there is an empty poset   that class can only be an elementary class in first order logic if empty domains are permitted or the empty structure is removed from the class 
There are several difficulties with empty domains  however 

Many common rules of inference are valid only when the domain of discourse is required to be nonempty  One example is the rule stating that 
  
    
      
          x c  
          x     
          x     
        x
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle  varphi  lor  exists x psi  
  
 implies 
  
    
      
          x     
        x
         
          x c  
          x     
          x c  
         
      
    
      displaystyle  exists x  varphi  lor  psi   
  
 when x is not a free variable in 
  
    
      
          x c  
      
    
      displaystyle  varphi  
  
  This rule  which is used to put formulas into prenex normal form  is sound in nonempty domains  but unsound if the empty domain is permitted 
The definition of truth in an interpretation that uses a variable assignment function cannot work with empty domains  because there are no variable assignment functions whose range is empty   Similarly  one cannot assign interpretations to constant symbols   This truth definition requires that one must select a variable assignment function    above  before truth values for even atomic formulas can be defined  Then the truth value of a sentence is defined to be its truth value under any variable assignment  and it is proved that this truth value does not depend on which assignment is chosen  This technique does not work if there are no assignment functions at all  it must be changed to accommodate empty domains 
Thus  when the empty domain is permitted  it must often be treated as a special case  Most authors  however  simply exclude the empty domain by definition 

Deductive systems edit 
A deductive system is used to demonstrate  on a purely syntactic basis  that one formula is a logical consequence of another formula  There are many such systems for first order logic  including Hilbert style deductive systems  natural deduction  the sequent calculus  the tableaux method  and resolution  These share the common property that a deduction is a finite syntactic object  the format of this object  and the way it is constructed  vary widely   These finite deductions themselves are often called derivations in proof theory  They are also often called proofs but are completely formalized unlike natural language mathematical proofs 
A deductive system is sound if any formula that can be derived in the system is logically valid  Conversely  a deductive system is complete if every logically valid formula is derivable  All of the systems discussed in this article are both sound and complete  They also share the property that it is possible to effectively verify that a purportedly valid deduction is actually a deduction  such deduction systems are called effective 
A key property of deductive systems is that they are purely syntactic  so that derivations can be verified without considering any interpretation  Thus  a sound argument is correct in every possible interpretation of the language  regardless of whether that interpretation is about mathematics  economics  or some other area 
In general  logical consequence in first order logic is only semidecidable  if a sentence A logically implies a sentence B then this can be discovered  for example  by searching for a proof until one is found  using some effective  sound  complete proof system   However  if A does not logically imply B  this does not mean that A logically implies the negation of B  There is no effective procedure that  given formulas A and B  always correctly decides whether A logically implies B 

Rules of inference edit 
Further information  List of rules of inference
A rule of inference states that  given a particular formula  or set of formulas  with a certain property as a hypothesis  another specific formula  or set of formulas  can be derived as a conclusion  The rule is sound  or truth preserving  if it preserves validity in the sense that whenever any interpretation satisfies the hypothesis  that interpretation also satisfies the conclusion 
For example  one common rule of inference is the rule of substitution  If t is a term and   is a formula possibly containing the variable x  then   t x  is the result of replacing all free instances of x by t in    The substitution rule states that for any   and any term t  one can conclude   t x  from   provided that no free variable of t becomes bound during the substitution process   If some free variable of t becomes bound  then to substitute t for x it is first necessary to change the bound variables of   to differ from the free variables of t  
To see why the restriction on bound variables is necessary  consider the logically valid formula   given by 
  
    
      
          x     
        x
         
        x
         
        y
         
      
    
      displaystyle  exists x x y  
  
  in the signature of             of arithmetic  If t is the term  x       the formula   t y  is 
  
    
      
          x

      displaystyle  exists x x x    
  
  which will be false in many interpretations  The problem is that the free variable x of t became bound during the substitution  The intended replacement can be obtained by renaming the bound variable x of   to something else  say z  so that the formula after substitution is 
  
    
      
          x     
        z
         
        z
         
        x
         
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle  exists z z x    
  
  which is again logically valid 
The substitution rule demonstrates several common aspects of rules of inference  It is entirely syntactical  one can tell whether it was correctly applied without appeal to any interpretation  It has  syntactically defined  limitations on when it can be applied  which must be respected to preserve the correctness of derivations  Moreover  as is often the case  these limitations are necessary because of interactions between free and bound variables that occur during syntactic manipulations of the formulas involved in the inference rule 

Hilbert style systems and natural deduction edit 
A deduction in a Hilbert style deductive system is a list of formulas  each of which is a logical axiom  a hypothesis that has been assumed for the derivation at hand or follows from previous formulas via a rule of inference  The logical axioms consist of several axiom schemas of logically valid formulas  these encompass a significant amount of propositional logic  The rules of inference enable the manipulation of quantifiers  Typical Hilbert style systems have a small number of rules of inference  along with several infinite schemas of logical axioms  It is common to have only modus ponens and universal generalization as rules of inference 
Natural deduction systems resemble Hilbert style systems in that a deduction is a finite list of formulas  However  natural deduction systems have no logical axioms  they compensate by adding additional rules of inference that can be used to manipulate the logical connectives in formulas in the proof 

Sequent calculus edit

The sequent calculus was developed to study the properties of natural deduction systems              Instead of working with one formula at a time  it uses sequents  which are expressions of the form 


  
    
      
        
          A

where A        An  B        Bk are formulas and the turnstile symbol 
  
    
      
          x  a  
      
    
      displaystyle  vdash  
  
 is used as punctuation to separate the two halves  Intuitively  a sequent expresses the idea that

Tableaux method edit

Further information  Method of analytic tableaux
Unlike the methods just described the derivations in the tableaux method are not lists of formulas  Instead  a derivation is a tree of formulas  To show that a formula A is provable  the tableaux method attempts to demonstrate that the negation of A is unsatisfiable  The tree of the derivation has 
  
    
      
          xac 
        A
      
    
      displaystyle  lnot A 
  
 at its root  the tree branches in a way that reflects the structure of the formula  For example  to show that 
  
    
      
        C
          x     
        D
      
    
      displaystyle C lor D 
  
 is unsatisfiable requires showing that C and D are each unsatisfiable  this corresponds to a branching point in the tree with parent 
  
    
      
        C
          x

Resolution edit 
Main article  Resolution  logic 
The resolution rule is a single rule of inference that  together with unification  is sound and complete for first order logic  As with the tableaux method  a formula is proved by showing that the negation of the formula is unsatisfiable  Resolution is commonly used in automated theorem proving 
The resolution method works only with formulas that are disjunctions of atomic formulas  arbitrary formulas must first be converted to this form through Skolemization  The resolution rule states that from the hypotheses

Provable identities edit 
Many identities can be proved  which establish equivalences between particular formulas  These identities allow for rearranging formulas by moving quantifiers across other connectives and are useful for putting formulas in prenex normal form  Some provable identities include

Equality and its axioms edit 
See also  Equality  mathematics         In logic
There are several different conventions for using equality  or identity  in first order logic  The most common convention  known as first order logic with equality  includes the equality symbol as a primitive logical symbol which is always interpreted as the real equality relation between members of the domain of discourse  such that the  two  given members are the same member  This approach also adds certain axioms about equality to the deductive system employed  These equality axioms are                                       

Reflexivity  For each variable x  x   x 
Substitution for functions  For all variables x and y  and any function symbol f 
x   y   f      x         f      y       
Substitution for formulas  For any variables x and y and any formula   z  with a free variable z  then 
x   y      x      y   
These are axiom schemas  each of which specifies an infinite set of axioms  The third schema is known as Leibniz s law   the principle of substitutivity    the indiscernibility of identicals   or  the replacement property   The second schema  involving the function symbol f  is  equivalent to  a special case of the third schema  using the formula  

  z   f      x         f      z      
Then

x   y    f      x         f      x         f      x         f      y        
Since x   y is given  and f      x         f      x       true by reflexivity  we have f      x         f      y      
Many other properties of equality are consequences of the axioms above  for example 

Symmetry  If x   y then y   x             
Transitivity  If x   y and y   z then x   z             
First order logic without equality edit 
An alternate approach considers the equality relation to be a non logical symbol  This convention is known as first order logic without equality  If an equality relation is included in the signature  the axioms of equality must now be added to the theories under consideration  if desired  instead of being considered rules of logic  The main difference between this method and first order logic with equality is that an interpretation may now interpret two distinct individuals as  equal   although  by Leibniz s law  these will satisfy exactly the same formulas under any interpretation   That is  the equality relation may now be interpreted by an arbitrary equivalence relation on the domain of discourse that is congruent with respect to the functions and relations of the interpretation 
When this second convention is followed  the term normal model is used to refer to an interpretation where no distinct individuals a and b satisfy a   b  In first order logic with equality  only normal models are considered  and so there is no term for a model other than a normal model  When first order logic without equality is studied  it is necessary to amend the statements of results such as the L wenheim Skolem theorem so that only normal models are considered 
First order logic without equality is often employed in the context of second order arithmetic and other higher order theories of arithmetic  where the equality relation between sets of natural numbers is usually omitted 

Defining equality within a theory edit 
If a theory has a binary formula A x y  which satisfies reflexivity and Leibniz s law  the theory is said to have equality  or to be a theory with equality  The theory may not have all instances of the above schemas as axioms  but rather as derivable theorems  For example  in theories with no function symbols and a finite number of relations  it is possible to define equality in terms of the relations  by defining the two terms s and t to be equal if any relation is unchanged by changing s to t in any argument 
Some theories allow other ad hoc definitions of equality 

In the theory of partial orders with one relation symbol    one could define s   t to be an abbreviation for s   t 
  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  wedge  
  
 t   s 
In set theory with one relation    one may define s   t to be an abbreviation for  x  s   x   t   x  
  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  wedge  
  
  x  x   s   x    t   This definition of equality then automatically satisfies the axioms for equality  In this case  one should replace the usual axiom of extensionality  which can be stated as 
  
    
      
          x     
        x
          x

  which says that if sets x and y have the same elements  then they also belong to the same sets 
Metalogical properties edit 
One motivation for the use of first order logic  rather than higher order logic  is that first order logic has many metalogical properties that stronger logics do not have  These results concern general properties of first order logic itself  rather than properties of individual theories  They provide fundamental tools for the construction of models of first order theories 

Completeness and undecidability edit 
G del s completeness theorem  proved by Kurt G del in       establishes that there are sound  complete  effective deductive systems for first order logic  and thus the first order logical consequence relation is captured by finite provability  Naively  the statement that a formula   logically implies a formula   depends on every model of    these models will in general be of arbitrarily large cardinality  and so logical consequence cannot be effectively verified by checking every model  However  it is possible to enumerate all finite derivations and search for a derivation of   from    If   is logically implied by    such a derivation will eventually be found  Thus first order logical consequence is semidecidable  it is possible to make an effective enumeration of all pairs of sentences       such that   is a logical consequence of        
Unlike propositional logic  first order logic is undecidable  although semidecidable   provided that the language has at least one predicate of arity at least    other than equality   This means that there is no decision procedure that determines whether arbitrary formulas are logically valid  This result was established independently by Alonzo Church and Alan Turing in      and       respectively  giving a negative answer to the Entscheidungsproblem posed by David Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann in       Their proofs demonstrate a connection between the unsolvability of the decision problem for first order logic and the unsolvability of the halting problem 
There are systems weaker than full first order logic for which the logical consequence relation is decidable  These include propositional logic and monadic predicate logic  which is first order logic restricted to unary predicate symbols and no function symbols  Other logics with no function symbols which are decidable are the guarded fragment of first order logic  as well as two variable logic  The Bernays Sch nfinkel class of first order formulas is also decidable  Decidable subsets of first order logic are also studied in the framework of description logics 

The L wenheim Skolem theorem edit 
The L wenheim Skolem theorem shows that if a first order theory of cardinality   has an infinite model  then it has models of every infinite cardinality greater than or equal to    One of the earliest results in model theory  it implies that it is not possible to characterize countability or uncountability in a first order language with a countable signature  That is  there is no first order formula   x  such that an arbitrary structure M satisfies   if and only if the domain of discourse of M is countable  or  in the second case  uncountable  
The L wenheim Skolem theorem implies that infinite structures cannot be categorically axiomatized in first order logic  For example  there is no first order theory whose only model is the real line  any first order theory with an infinite model also has a model of cardinality larger than the continuum  Since the real line is infinite  any theory satisfied by the real line is also satisfied by some nonstandard models  When the L wenheim Skolem theorem is applied to first order set theories  the nonintuitive consequences are known as Skolem s paradox 

The compactness theorem edit 
The compactness theorem states that a set of first order sentences has a model if and only if every finite subset of it has a model              This implies that if a formula is a logical consequence of an infinite set of first order axioms  then it is a logical consequence of some finite number of those axioms  This theorem was proved first by Kurt G del as a consequence of the completeness theorem  but many additional proofs have been obtained over time  It is a central tool in model theory  providing a fundamental method for constructing models 
The compactness theorem has a limiting effect on which collections of first order structures are elementary classes  For example  the compactness theorem implies that any theory that has arbitrarily large finite models has an infinite model  Thus  the class of all finite graphs is not an elementary class  the same holds for many other algebraic structures  
There are also more subtle limitations of first order logic that are implied by the compactness theorem  For example  in computer science  many situations can be modeled as a directed graph of states  nodes  and connections  directed edges    Validating such a system may require showing that no  bad  state can be reached from any  good  state  Thus  one seeks to determine if the good and bad states are in different connected components of the graph  However  the compactness theorem can be used to show that connected graphs are not an elementary class in first order logic  and there is no formula   x y  of first order logic  in the logic of graphs  that expresses the idea that there is a path from x to y  Connectedness can be expressed in second order logic  however  but not with only existential set quantifiers  as 
  
    
      
        
            x a  
          
             
          
          
             
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle  Sigma          
  
 also enjoys compactness 

Lindstr m s theorem edit 
Main article  Lindstr m s theorem
Per Lindstr m showed that the metalogical properties just discussed actually characterize first order logic in the sense that no stronger logic can also have those properties  Ebbinghaus and Flum       Chapter XIII   Lindstr m defined a class of abstract logical systems  and a rigorous definition of the relative strength of a member of this class  He established two theorems for systems of this type 

A logical system satisfying Lindstr m s definition that contains first order logic and satisfies both the L wenheim Skolem theorem and the compactness theorem must be equivalent to first order logic 
A logical system satisfying Lindstr m s definition that has a semidecidable logical consequence relation and satisfies the L wenheim Skolem theorem must be equivalent to first order logic 
Limitations edit 
Although first order logic is sufficient for formalizing much of mathematics and is commonly used in computer science and other fields  it has certain limitations  These include limitations on its expressiveness and limitations of the fragments of natural languages that it can describe 
For instance  first order logic is undecidable  meaning a sound  complete and terminating decision algorithm for provability is impossible  This has led to the study of interesting decidable fragments  such as C   first order logic with two variables and the counting quantifiers

 and

              x

      displaystyle  exists    leq n  
  
             

Expressiveness edit 
The L wenheim Skolem theorem shows that if a first order theory has any infinite model  then it has infinite models of every cardinality  In particular  no first order theory with an infinite model can be categorical  Thus  there is no first order theory whose only model has the set of natural numbers as its domain  or whose only model has the set of real numbers as its domain   Many extensions of first order logic  including infinitary logics and higher order logics  are more expressive in the sense that they do permit categorical axiomatizations of the natural numbers or real numbers     clarification needed       This expressiveness comes at a metalogical cost  however  by Lindstr m s theorem  the compactness theorem and the downward L wenheim Skolem theorem cannot hold in any logic stronger than first order 

Formalizing natural languages edit 
Main article  Logic translation        Natural language formalization
First order logic is able to formalize many simple quantifier constructions in natural language  such as  every person who lives in Perth lives in Australia   Hence  first order logic is used as a basis for knowledge representation languages  such as FO    
Still  there are complicated features of natural language that cannot be expressed in first order logic   Any logical system which is appropriate as an instrument for the analysis of natural language needs a much richer structure than first order predicate logic

Quantification over properties

If John is self satisfied  then there is at least one thing he has in common with Peter 
Example requires a quantifier over predicates  which cannot be implemented in single sorted first order logic  Zj    X Xj Xp  


Quantification over properties

Santa Claus has all the attributes of a sadist 
Example requires quantifiers over predicates  which cannot be implemented in single sorted first order logic   X  x Sx   Xx    Xs  


Predicate adverbial

John is walking quickly 
Example cannot be analysed as Wj   Qj predicate adverbials are not the same kind of thing as second order predicates such as colour 


Relative adjective

Jumbo is a small elephant 
Example cannot be analysed as Sj   Ej predicate adjectives are not the same kind of thing as second order predicates such as colour 


Predicate adverbial modifier

John is walking very quickly 
 


Relative adjective modifier

Jumbo is terribly small 
An expression such as  terribly   when applied to a relative adjective such as  small   results in a new composite relative adjective  terribly small  


Prepositions

Mary is sitting next to John 
The preposition  next to  when applied to  John  results in the predicate adverbial  next to John  

Restrictions  extensions  and variations edit 
There are many variations of first order logic  Some of these are inessential in the sense that they merely change notation without affecting the semantics  Others change the expressive power more significantly  by extending the semantics through additional quantifiers or other new logical symbols  For example  infinitary logics permit formulas of infinite size  and modal logics add symbols for possibility and necessity

  This change requires adding additional axioms to the theory at hand  so that interpretations of the predicate symbols used have the correct semantics             
Restrictions such as these are useful as a technique to reduce the number of inference rules or axiom schemas in deductive systems  which leads to shorter proofs of metalogical results  The cost of the restrictions is that it becomes more difficult to express natural language statements in the formal system at hand  because the logical connectives used in the natural language statements must be replaced by their  longer  definitions in terms of the restricted collection of logical connectives  Similarly  derivations in the limited systems may be longer than derivations in systems that include additional connectives  There is thus a trade off between the ease of working within the formal system and the ease of proving results about the formal system 
It is also possible to restrict the arities of function symbols and predicate symbols  in sufficiently expressive theories  One can in principle dispense entirely with functions of arity greater than   and predicates of arity greater than   in theories that include a pairing function  This is a function of arity   that takes pairs of elements of the domain and returns an ordered pair containing them  It is also sufficient to have two predicate symbols of arity   that define projection functions from an ordered pair to its components  In either case it is necessary that the natural axioms for a pairing function and its projections are satisfied 

Many sorted logic edit 
Main article  Many sorted logic
Ordinary first order interpretations have a single domain of discourse over which all quantifiers range  Many sorted first order logic allows variables to have different sorts  which have different domains  This is also called typed first order logic  and the sorts called types  as in data type   but it is not the same as first order type theory  Many sorted first order logic is often used in the study of second order arithmetic             
When there are only finitely many sorts in a theory  many sorted first order logic can be reduced to single sorted first order logic                                       
One introduces into the single sorted theory a unary predicate symbol for each sort in the many sorted theory and adds an axiom saying that these unary predicates partition the domain of discourse  For example  if there are two sorts  one adds predicate symbols

Additional quantifiers edit 
Additional quantifiers can be added to first order logic 

Sometimes it is useful to say that  P x  holds for exactly one x   which can be expressed as   x P x    This notation  called uniqueness quantification  may be taken to abbreviate a formula such as  x  P x  
  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  wedge  
  
  y  P y     x   y    
First order logic with extra quantifiers has new quantifiers Qx      with meanings such as  there are many x such that       Also see branching quantifiers and the plural quantifiers of George Boolos and others 
Bounded quantifiers are often used in the study of set theory or arithmetic 
Infinitary logics edit 
Main article  Infinitary logic
Infinitary logic allows infinitely long sentences  For example  one may allow a conjunction or disjunction of infinitely many formulas  or quantification over infinitely many variables  Infinitely long sentences arise in areas of mathematics including topology and model theory 
Infinitary logic generalizes first order logic to allow formulas of infinite length  The most common way in which formulas can become infinite is through infinite conjunctions and disjunctions  However  it is also possible to admit generalized signatures in which function and relation symbols are allowed to have infinite arities  or in which quantifiers can bind infinitely many variables  Because an infinite formula cannot be represented by a finite string  it is necessary to choose some other representation of formulas  the usual representation in this context is a tree  Thus  formulas are  essentially  identified with their parse trees  rather than with the strings being parsed 
The most commonly studied infinitary logics are denoted L    where   and   are each either cardinal numbers or the symbol    In this notation  ordinary first order logic is L   
In the logic L    arbitrary conjunctions or disjunctions are allowed when building formulas  and there is an unlimited supply of variables  More generally  the logic that permits conjunctions or disjunctions with less than   constituents is known as L    For example  L    permits countable conjunctions and disjunctions 
The set of free variables in a formula of L   can have any cardinality strictly less than    yet only finitely many of them can be in the scope of any quantifier when a formula appears as a subformula of another              In other infinitary logics  a subformula may be in the scope of infinitely many quantifiers  For example  in L    a single universal or existential quantifier may bind arbitrarily many variables simultaneously  Similarly  the logic L   permits simultaneous quantification over fewer than   variables  as well as conjunctions and disjunctions of size less than   

Non classical and modal logics edit 
Main article  Non classical logic 
Intuitionistic first order logic uses intuitionistic rather than classical reasoning  for example      need not be equivalent to   and    x   is in general not equivalent to   x     
First order modal logic allows one to describe other possible worlds as well as this contingently true world which we inhabit  In some versions  the set of possible worlds varies depending on which possible world one inhabits  Modal logic has extra modal operators with meanings which can be characterized informally as  for example  it is necessary that     true in all possible worlds  and  it is possible that     true in some possible world   With standard first order logic we have a single domain  and each predicate is assigned one extension  With first order modal logic we have a domain function that assigns each possible world its own domain  so that each predicate gets an extension only relative to these possible worlds  This allows us to model cases where  for example  Alex is a philosopher  but might have been a mathematician  and might not have existed at all  In the first possible world P a  is true  in the second P a  is false  and in the third possible world there is no a in the domain at all 
First order fuzzy logics are first order extensions of propositional fuzzy logics rather than classical propositional calculus 
Fixpoint logic edit 
Main article  Fixed point logic
Fixpoint logic extends first order logic by adding the closure under the least fixed points of positive operators             

Higher order logics edit 
Main article  Higher order logic
The characteristic feature of first order logic is that individuals can be quantified  but not predicates  Thus

is not  in most formalizations of first order logic  Second order logic extends first order logic by adding the latter type of quantification  Other higher order logics allow quantification over even higher types than second order logic permits  These higher types include relations between relations  functions from relations to relations between relations  and other higher type objects   Thus the  first  in first order logic describes the type of objects that can be quantified 
Unlike first order logic  for which only one semantics is studied  there are several possible semantics for second order logic  The most commonly employed semantics for second order and higher order logic is known as full semantics  The combination of additional quantifiers and the full semantics for these quantifiers makes higher order logic stronger than first order logic  In particular  the  semantic  logical consequence relation for second order and higher order logic is not semidecidable  there is no effective deduction system for second order logic that is sound and complete under full semantics 
Second order logic with full semantics is more expressive than first order logic  For example  it is possible to create axiom systems in second order logic that uniquely characterize the natural numbers and the real line  The cost of this expressiveness is that second order and higher order logics have fewer attractive metalogical properties than first order logic  For example  the L wenheim Skolem theorem and compactness theorem of first order logic become false when generalized to higher order logics with full semantics 

Automated theorem proving and formal methods edit 
Further information  Automated theorem proving        First order theorem proving
Automated theorem proving refers to the development of computer programs that search and find derivations  formal proofs  of mathematical theorems              Finding derivations is a difficult task because the search space can be very large  an exhaustive search of every possible derivation is theoretically possible but computationally infeasible for many systems of interest in mathematics  Thus complicated heuristic functions are developed to attempt to find a derivation in less time than a blind search             
The related area of automated proof verification uses computer programs to check that human created proofs are correct  Unlike complicated automated theorem provers  verification systems may be small enough that their correctness can be checked both by hand and through automated software verification  This validation of the proof verifier is needed to give confidence that any derivation labeled as  correct  is actually correct 
Some proof verifiers  such as Metamath  insist on having a complete derivation as input  Others  such as Mizar and Isabelle  take a well formatted proof sketch  which may still be very long and detailed  and fill in the missing pieces by doing simple proof searches or applying known decision procedures  the resulting derivation is then verified by a small core  kernel   Many such systems are primarily intended for interactive use by human mathematicians  these are known as proof assistants  They may also use formal logics that are stronger than first order logic  such as type theory  Because a full derivation of any nontrivial result in a first order deductive system will be extremely long for a human to write              results are often formalized as a series of lemmas  for which derivations can be constructed separately 
Automated theorem provers are also used to implement formal verification in computer science  In this setting  theorem provers are used to verify the correctness of programs and of hardware such as processors with respect to a formal specification  Because such analysis is time consuming and thus expensive  it is usually reserved for projects in which a malfunction would have grave human or financial consequences 
For the problem of model checking  efficient algorithms are known to decide whether an input finite structure satisfies a first order formula  in addition to computational complexity bounds  see Model checking        First order logic

  More precisely  there is only one language of each variant of one sorted first order logic  with or without equality  with or without functions  with or without propositional variables      

  The word language is sometimes used as a synonym for signature  but this can be confusing because  language  can also refer to the set of formulas
