							The Right to Climb initiative is raising money and awareness by organising a trip to climb Mount Kenya
By Hannah Wilkinson
The Right to Live Association was founded thirty years ago by the mothers of intellectually handicapped children 
They had noticed unacceptable levels of prejudice  other parents would grab their own kids and forcibly move them away from children with disabilities 
For these women  it was not enough for their children to live  they had to have a life  They wanted to create an organisation where intellectually disabled people could develop  feel safe and actually enjoy themselves  one which would speak for the     of the population who have a disability  when no one else would 
Noura Mustafa  who works with the Right to Live Association  recounted the story of its inception at a charity fundraiser on Monday night  held in the swanky surroundings of the Le Pacha boat in Zamalek 
 In Egypt  anything that combines food and drink  that kind of gets people s attention   joked Omar Samra  a renowned climber  who organises charity climbing expeditions in conjunction with his travel company  Wild Guanabana  as part of an initiative called Right to Climb  RTC   Samra is intimately connected to The Right to Live Association  himself having two sisters with intellectual disabilities 
The event was primarily a fundraiser for RTC s next trip  in which a team of intrepid mountaineers will attempt to reach the summit of Mount Kenya  In order to support this venture  guests were encouraged to buy as many raffle tickets as possible  at EGP    each  and donations were encouraged 
The party also served as a platform for raising awareness  both about the Right to Climb initiative  and the charity itself 
 There has been an RTC climb every year since       with over EGP  m raised in total between all climbs   explained Safi  well known voice of Nile FM  and MC for the evening  Safi went on the first expedition with Right to Climb  and plans to go on the next one   This time we set a target for the climbers at EGP      as that is also how high Mount Kenya is   he said 
For Samra  who has climbed mountains like Everest  walking up mountains like Kilimanjaro was probably a little like strolling up a hill  but for first time climbers  it was a gruelling but life changing experience  Safi introduced several speakers to extol the virtues of making the climb for charity  Biko G  a gregarious individual  spoke of his trip with enthusiasm  recounting how the perspective he achieved climbing the mountain encouraged him to quit his job and start his own business from scratch 
Beyond life changing experiences  speakers reminded attendees that they need not even leave Cairo to help the cause  Mustafa asked those present to donate their time as well  at one of the Right to Live Association s centres  where intellectually handicapped adults are trained in basic skills including baking  bamboo and wicker work  and sewing  She invited people to give up their time volunteering at one of the centres  or just to come and buy some of the products produced there 
For the Right to Live Association  all support is crucial  In the thirty years since the charity was founded  life in Egypt is still extremely difficult for disabled people 
 They are extremely marginalised by the state which is dreadful   Safi explained   Even worse  they are more often than not ostracised by society  kept hidden in homes and not given the chance to enjoy life to the fullest and get all the rights they deserve  It breaks your heart when you see how respectfully they are treated in more civilised countries  and here it       s like they almost don       t exist
