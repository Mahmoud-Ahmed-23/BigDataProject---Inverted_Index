							Egypt s Minister of Environment  Yasmine Fouad  met with representatives from Jordan s Tajanus Group for Ownership and Commercial Projects to review a smart digital solution for waste collection and management developed by the company 
The meeting  held at the Ministry       s headquarters in the New Administrative Capital  was attended by Ali Abu Sena  CEO of the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency  Yasser Abdullah  Head of the Waste Management Regulatory Authority  and other senior ministry officials 
Minister Fouad emphasized that Egypt already operates a national digital waste data management system  Developed by the Waste Management Regulatory Authority  this platform facilitates the electronic issuance of licenses and permits for waste related activities  including hazardous materials  It serves as an integrated tool for collecting  storing  and analyzing waste management data across the country  with ongoing upgrades to enhance its efficiency 
During the session  representatives from Tajanus Group presented their digital platform  which features a mobile application allowing users to request waste collection services with ease  The system enables licensed service providers to dispatch collection vehicles based on the type and classification of waste  optimizing logistics and efficiency 
The platform aims to support a circular economy from consumption to recycling by leveraging big data to help recycling companies plan storage capacity  expansion strategies  and recycling initiatives in response to real time demand trends 
Additionally  the system provides a centralized dashboard for authorities to track collection points  monitor service provider performance  and ensure waste is disposed of by licensed entities  It offers real time analytics and reporting tools that help stakeholders make informed decisions about scaling operations 
Fouad highlighted the magnitude of Egypt s waste challenge  noting that the country generates approximately        tonnes of waste daily equating to around    million tons annually  She reiterated the state       s commitment to building an integrated waste management infrastructure  including recycling plants  secure disposal sites  and private sector partnerships for waste collection and real time monitoring 
The Minister directed relevant officials to coordinate with the New Urban Communities Authority to assess the feasibility of adopting the proposed digital system  She also underscored the potential for private sector players to use the platform to inform investment strategies and target high density areas for service expansion
