							By the eve of    Ramadan  the religious practice of the holy month intensifies  creating a shift in the already abnormal Ramadan lifestyle  Apart from the daily evening prayers that are common throughout the month  the Taraweeh prayers  extra worshipping hours  are added to many Muslims  lives during the final third of Ramadan 
Due to the special religious meaning of those final ten days  orthodox Muslims   and actually most Egyptians   tend to cut down on their after Iftar social activities in order to meet certain religious commitments 
A widespread religious practice in the final ten days is E tekaf   It involves total isolation from the outer world to be concerned only with praying and reciting the Quran  E tekaf happens on different levels  The most devout take shelter inside a mosque for the whole ten days  Others prefer to stay at home  where they can be left alone to worship uninterrupted  Most people practice the most moderate type of E tekaf and choose to allocate a few hours of their day to stay in full isolation   whether at home or inside a mosque   to worship 
Muslims generally tend to double their prayers during those ten days  especially during the evenings of odd numbered days  According to Islamic teachings  one of the five eves of the odd numbered days during these last days of Ramadan is known as Laylat Al Qadr  It is considered a clear  exceptional night where all prayers are answered since it coincides with the night when the Quran was sent down to Prophet Muhammad  The exact date of this day remains unknown to Muslims  so they treat all five evenings the same way 
Especially during the eves of odd numbered nights  people prefer to perform their after midnight prayers at mosques instead of at home  Others hold gatherings in their homes where all those invited sit together  each reading a part of the Quran so that they collectively finish reading the entire holy book by the end of the gathering 
During the last ten days of Ramadan  charity work is likely to increase   People want to make sure they have given enough during the holy month 
The ever popular mosalsalat will find their viewership reduced  as people replace watching some   or even all   of these fictive fantasies with prayer 
Despite all of these ways of spending the final ten days of Ramadan  for many Muslims their arrival does not create any change in lifestyle  The fact of the matter is that any religious activity   be it prayer  Quran recital or E tekaf   is a personal choice and none is religiously binding
