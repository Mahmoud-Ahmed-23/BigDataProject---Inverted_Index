Main article  Federal government of the United States

The U S  president is the head of state  commander in chief of the military  chief executive of the federal government  and has the ability to veto legislative bills from the U S  Congress before they become law  However  presidential vetoes can be overridden by a two thirds supermajority vote in both chambers of Congress  The president appoints the members of the Cabinet  subject to Senate approval  and names other officials who administer and enforce federal laws through their respective agencies               The president also has clemency power for federal crimes and can issue pardons  Finally  the president has the right to issue expansive  executive orders   subject to judicial review  in a number of policy areas  Candidates for president campaign with a vice presidential running mate  Both candidates are elected together  or defeated together  in a presidential election  Unlike other votes in American politics  this is technically an indirect election in which the winner will be determined by the U S  Electoral College  There  votes are officially cast by individual electors selected by their state legislature               In practice  however  each of the    states chooses a group of presidential electors who are required to confirm the winner of their state s popular vote  Each state is allocated two electors plus one additional elector for each congressional district  which in effect combines to equal the number of elected officials that state sends to Congress  The District of Columbia  with no representatives or senators  is allocated three electoral votes  Both the president and the vice president serve a four year term  and the president may be reelected to the office only once  for one additional four year term      q

The three branch system is known as the presidential system  in contrast to the parliamentary system  where the executive is part of the legislative body  Many countries around the world imitated this aspect of the      Constitution of the United States  especially in the Americas
