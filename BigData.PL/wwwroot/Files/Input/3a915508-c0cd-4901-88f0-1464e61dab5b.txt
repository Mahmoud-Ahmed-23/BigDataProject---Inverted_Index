Founded on    March       the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems             MPI IS  is one of the    research institutes of the Max Planck Society  With locations in Stuttgart and T bingen  it combines interdisciplinary research in the growing field of intelligent systems  
Intelligent systems are becoming increasingly important in many areas of life   as virtual systems on the Internet or as cyber physical systems in the physical world  Artificial intelligent systems can be used in a broad range of areas  for instance in autonomous vehicles or to diagnose and fight diseases

Initiatives and networks edit 
The Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems and ETH Zurich cooperate in the research field of  Learning Systems   For this purpose  they have founded the Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems  CLS   It is the first joint doctoral program of ETH Zurich and the Max Planck Society  
Since the program was founded in           doctoral students and post docs have been admitted as Fellows or Associated Fellows  CLS currently counts    directors  professors  and research group leaders among its members or associated members  In July       the Max Planck Society and ETH Zurich agreed to extend the program s funding            until      
Since December       the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems is part of the research network Cyber Valley             Partners are the University of Stuttgart  the University of T bingen  the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft  the State of Baden W rttemberg and seven industrial partners  Amazon  BMW Group  Daimler AG  IAV GmbH  Porsche AG  Robert Bosch GmbH  and ZF Friedrichshafen AG  Cyber Valley is also supported by the Christian B rkert Foundation  the Gips Sch le Foundation  the Vector Foundation  and the Carl Zeiss Foundation  
Founded in       the European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems  ELLIS  aims to strengthen Europe s role in global AI research
