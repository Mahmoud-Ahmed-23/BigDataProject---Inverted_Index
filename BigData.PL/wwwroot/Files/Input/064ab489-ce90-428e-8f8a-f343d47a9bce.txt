DeepDream is a computer vision program created by Google engineer Alexander Mordvintsev that uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic pareidolia  thus creating a dream like appearance reminiscent of a psychedelic experience in the deliberately overprocessed images                                  
Google s program popularized the term  deep   dreaming  to refer to the generation of images that produce desired activations in a trained deep network  and the term now refers to a collection of related approaches 


History edit 
The DeepDream software  originated in a deep convolutional network codenamed  Inception  after the film of the same name                                   was developed for the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge  ILSVRC  in                 and released in July      
The dreaming idea and name became popular on the internet in      thanks to Google s DeepDream program   The idea dates from early in the history of neural networks             and similar methods have been used to synthesize visual textures            
Related visualization ideas were developed  prior to Google s work  by several research groups                       
After Google published their techniques and made their code open source             a number of tools in the form of web services  mobile applications  and desktop software appeared on the market to enable users to transform their own photos            

Process edit 
The original image  top  after applying ten  middle  and fifty  bottom  iterations of DeepDream  the network having been trained to perceive dogs and then run backwards
The software is designed to detect faces and other patterns in images  with the aim of automatically classifying images              However  once trained  the network can also be run in reverse  being asked to adjust the original image slightly so that a given output neuron  e g  the one for faces or certain animals  yields a higher confidence score  This can be used for visualizations to understand the emergent structure of the neural network better  and is the basis for the DeepDream concept  This reversal procedure is never perfectly clear and unambiguous because it utilizes a one to many mapping process              However  after enough reiterations  even imagery initially devoid of the sought features will be adjusted enough that a form of pareidolia results  by which psychedelic and surreal images are generated algorithmically  The optimization resembles backpropagation  however  instead of adjusting the network weights  the weights are held fixed and the input is adjusted 
For example  an existing image can be altered so that it is  more cat like   and the resulting enhanced image can be again input to the procedure             This usage resembles the activity of looking for animals or other patterns in clouds 
Applying gradient descent independently to each pixel of the input produces images in which
adjacent pixels have little relation and thus the image has too much high frequency information 
The generated images can be greatly improved by including a prior or regularizer that prefers inputs
that have natural image statistics  without a preference for any particular image   or are simply smooth                                    
For example  Mahendran et al              used the total variation regularizer that prefers images that are piecewise constant  Various regularizers are discussed further in Yosinski et al              An in depth  visual exploration of feature visualization and regularization techniques was published more recently             
The cited resemblance of the imagery to LSD  and psilocybin induced hallucinations is suggestive of a functional resemblance between artificial neural networks and particular layers of the visual cortex             
Neural networks such as DeepDream have biological analogies providing insight into brain processing and the formation of consciousness  Hallucinogens such as DMT alter the function of the serotonergic system which is present within the layers of the visual cortex  Neural networks are trained on input vectors and are altered by internal variations during the training process  The input and internal modifications represent the processing of exogenous and endogenous signals respectively in the visual cortex  As internal variations are modified in deep neural networks the output image reflect these changes  This specific manipulation demonstrates how inner brain mechanisms are analogous to internal layers of neural networks  Internal noise level modifications represent how hallucinogens omit external sensory information leading internal preconceived conceptions to strongly influence visual perception             

Usage edit

The dreaming idea can be applied to hidden  internal  neurons other than those in the output  
which allows exploration of the roles and representations of various parts of the network             
It is also possible to optimize the input to satisfy either a single neuron  this usage is sometimes called Activity Maximization              or an entire layer of neurons 
While dreaming is most often used for visualizing networks or producing computer art  it has recently been proposed that adding  dreamed  inputs to the training set can improve training times for abstractions in Computer Science             
The DeepDream model has also been demonstrated to have application in the field of art history             
DeepDream was used for Foster the People s music video for the song  Doing It for the Money              
In       a research group out of the University of Sussex created a Hallucination Machine  applying the DeepDream algorithm to a pre recorded panoramic video  allowing users to explore virtual reality environments to mimic the experience of psychoactive substances and or psychopathological conditions               They were able to demonstrate that the subjective experiences induced by the Hallucination Machine differed significantly from control  non  hallucinogenic   videos  while bearing phenomenological similarities to the psychedelic state  following administration of psilocybin  
In       a study published in the journal Entropy demonstrated the similarity between DeepDream and actual psychedelic experience with neuroscientific evidence              The authors recorded Electroencephalography  EEG  of human participants during passive vision of a movie clip and its DeepDream generated counterpart  They found that DeepDream video triggered a higher entropy in the EEG signal and a higher level of functional connectivity between brain areas              both well known biomarkers of actual psychedelic experience             
In       a research group coordinated by the University of Trento  measure d  participants  cognitive flexibility and creativity after the exposure to virtual reality panoramic videos and their hallucinatory like counterparts generated by the DeepDream algorithm     following the simulated psychedelic exposure  individuals exhibited     an attenuated contribution of the automatic process and chaotic dynamics underlying their decision processes  presumably due to a reorganization in the cognitive dynamics that facilitates the exploration of uncommon decision strategies and inhibits automated choices
