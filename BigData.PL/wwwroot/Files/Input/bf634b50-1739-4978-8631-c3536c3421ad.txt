Ursula von der Leyen  President of the European Commission  denounced        Russian aggression and its use of hunger and grain to wield power   in a special address at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting      on Tuesday 



 Global cooperation is the antidote to Russia s blackmail   she said 



Her message focused on strategic priorities for Europe since the war  Boosting military spending is one such initiative   We have to invest much more in solid European defence capabilities   von der Leyen said  While NATO remains the world s strongest military alliance  European spending on defence has not kept pace with recent increases by the United States  Russia or China  particularly since the      financial crisis 



Increasing that spending   with a particular focus on the interoperability of nations  defence investments   can help strengthen the region s ability to defend itself from such threats 



She pointed to other key initiatives such as promoting green power  ensuring the resilience of supply chains and promoting food security  In terms of energy  she said  the crisis in Ukraine has galvanized Europe s embrace of renewable sources and diversification of its energy supply 



RePowerEU  a     bn plan launched last week by the European Commission  aims to accelerate the green transition by nearly doubling Europe s energy consumption from renewable sources by      



Ultimately   hydrogen is the new frontier of Europe s energy network   von der Leyen said 



Europe must respond to additional knock on effects of the war  such as rising food prices  as Russia has confiscated Ukrainian grain and blockaded other food exports  Europe is helping by providing revenue  increasing its food production and supporting other regions such as Africa in becoming less dependent on food exports 



Technology can be a part of the solution to food insecurity to boost  climate smart  agriculture  Vertical farming and precision irrigation are among the initiatives that can improve access to food in climate responsible ways 



In a conversation with Klaus Schwab  Executive Chairperson and Founder  World Economic Forum  von der Leyen noted that she could see a long term future in which Russia found a path back to alignment with Europe 



 This brutal invasion is standing up against the leadership in Russia   she said  The people of Russia  who ultimately will control the nation s future  are the ones who will decide the nation s way forward  If  in the future  the nation embraces  rule of law and respect for the international  rules based order  it s a clear yes   she said
