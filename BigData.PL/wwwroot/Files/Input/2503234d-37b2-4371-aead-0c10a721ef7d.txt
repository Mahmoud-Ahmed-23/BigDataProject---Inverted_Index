portion of it remains intact The human eye is capable of percieving more than    million different colors  and it can adjust to a vast range of light levels  from the bright sun to total darkness There are approximately    times more bacterial cells in and on the human body than human cells  playing a important role in digestion and immune function The human skin renews itself completely every       days  shedding old cells and replacing them with new ones ReproductionReproduction is the biological process by which organisms produce offspring  ensuring the continuation of species  It can be asexual  involving a single parent and producing genetically identical offspring  or sexual  requiring two parents and resulting in genetic variation  In animals and plants  reproduction involves complex processes such as gamete formation  fertilization  and development  Asexual and Sexual ReproductionHuman Reproductive SystemReproductive Phase of life in HumansReproductive HealthQuiz  ReproductionGenetics and EvolutionGenetics focuses on the inheritance of traits through genes  with principles like Mendel s laws regulating dominant and recessive alleles  Evolution describes how genetic variations lead to species adaptation over time through natural selection  Genetic mutations contribute to diversity  fueling the process of evolution  The combination of genetic inheritance

environments over time  Biology plays a key role in addressing critical issues in health  conservation  and environmental sustainability
