Early life edit 
Grisham  the second of five children  was born in Jonesboro  Arkansas  to Wanda  n e Skidmore  and John Ray Grisham             His father was a construction worker and a cotton farmer  and his mother was a homemaker              When Grisham was four years old  his family settled in Southaven  Mississippi  near Memphis  Tennessee             As a child  he wanted to be a baseball player             As noted in the foreword to Calico Joe  Grisham gave up playing baseball at the age of     after a game in which a pitcher aimed a beanball at him and narrowly missed doing the young Grisham grave harm 
Although Grisham s parents lacked formal education  his mother encouraged him to read and prepare for college             He drew on his childhood experiences for his novel A Painted House             Grisham started working for a plant nursery as a teenager  watering bushes for       an hour  He was soon promoted to a fence crew for       an hour  He wrote about the job   there was no future in it   At     Grisham took a job with a plumbing contractor but says he  never drew inspiration from that miserable work              
Initially  Grisham attended Horn Lake High School  a school that was so overcrowded some classes met in a church or a gymnasium               In       he transferred to Southaven High School  where he played football  basketball  and baseball               He credits his   th grade English teacher  Frances McGuffey  for inspiring his love for reading and for introducing him to the works of John Steinbeck in particular             
Through one of his father s contacts  Grisham managed to find work on a highway asphalt crew in Mississippi at age     It was during this time that an unfortunate incident got him  serious  about college  A fight with gunfire broke out among the crew  causing Grisham to run to a nearby restroom to find safety  He did not come out until after the police had detained the perpetrators  He hitchhiked home and started thinking about college  His next work was in retail  as a sales clerk in a department store men s underwear section  which he described as  humiliating   By this time  Grisham was halfway through college  Planning to become a tax lawyer  he was soon overcome by  the complexity and lunacy  of it  deciding instead to return to his hometown as a trial lawyer             
Grisham attended the Northwest Mississippi Community College in Senatobia  Mississippi  where he hoped to launch his baseball career but was benched instead               He and two close friends  Bubba Logan and Parker Pickle  transferred to Delta State University in Cleveland where Grisham hoped to revive his baseball career as a walk on player  but he was cut from the team and he left school after one semester                                                 Ultimately  Grisham changed colleges three times before completing a degree             Although he started there as an economics major  he eventually graduated from Mississippi State University in      with a Bachelor of Science in accounting after being inspired by a fellow student  a Vietnam veteran  who planned to go to law school                          He later enrolled in the University of Mississippi School of Law intending to become a tax lawyer  but his interest shifted to general civil litigation  He graduated in      with a J D  degree            

Career edit 
Law and politics edit 
Grisham practiced law for about a decade and won election as a Democrat to the Mississippi House of Representatives  serving from      to                              He challenged the incumbent after becoming embarrassed by Mississippi s national reputation and inspired by the passage of the Education Reform Act of                   Grisham represented the  th District  which included DeSoto County  Mississippi              By his second term in the state legislature  he was the vice chairman of the Apportionment and Elections Committee and a member of several other committees             He supported Representative Ed Perry s unsuccessful bid for the House speakership in       With a different speaker elected at the beginning of the      legislative session  Grisham was out of favor with the new legislative leaders and assigned to more minor committee roles  Not as busy with political affairs  he devoted more time to his novel  The Firm  Grisham later reflected that if Perry had become speaker he might have been given more committee responsibilities and thus unable to write             
Grisham s writing career blossomed with the success of his second book  The Firm  and he gave up practicing law  except for returning briefly in      to represent the family of a railroad worker who was killed on the job             His official website states   He was honoring a commitment made before he had retired from the law to become a full time writer  Grisham successfully argued his clients  case  earning them a jury award of            the biggest verdict of his career

Beginning with A Painted House  Grisham broadened his focus from law to the more general rural South but continued to write legal thrillers at the rate of one per year  In      he once again claimed the number one book of the year with The Summons  In      and      he missed the number one bestseller of the year due to the success of The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown  but he once again produced two novels which ended the year in the top    In       The Last Juror ended the year at number four  and in      he overtook The Da Vinci Code and returned to number one for the year with The Broker  The year      marked the first time since      that he did not have one of the top selling books of the year  but he returned to number two in       number one in       and number two in       Grisham has also written sports fiction and comedy fiction  He wrote the original screenplay for and produced the      baseball movie Mickey  which starred Harry Connick Jr
