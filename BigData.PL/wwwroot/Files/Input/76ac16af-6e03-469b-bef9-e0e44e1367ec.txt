Systemic inaccuracy
For other uses  see Bias  disambiguation  
Statistical bias  in the mathematical field of statistics  is a systematic tendency in which the methods used to gather data and generate statistics present an inaccurate  skewed or biased depiction of reality  Statistical bias exists in numerous stages of the data collection and analysis process  including  the source of the data  the methods used to collect the data  the estimator chosen  and the methods used to analyze the data  Data analysts can take various measures at each stage of the process to reduce the impact of statistical bias in their work  Understanding the source of statistical bias can help to assess whether the observed results are close to actuality  Issues of statistical bias has been argued to be closely linked to issues of statistical validity            
Statistical bias can have significant real world implications as data is used to inform decision making across a wide variety of processes in society  Data is used to inform lawmaking  industry regulation  corporate marketing and distribution tactics  and institutional policies in organizations and workplaces  Therefore  there can be significant implications if statistical bias is not accounted for and controlled  For example  if a pharmaceutical company wishes to explore the effect of a medication on the common cold but the data sample only includes men  any conclusions made from that data will be biased towards how the medication affects men rather than people in general  That means the information would be incomplete and not useful for deciding if the medication is ready for release in the general public  In this scenario  the bias can be addressed by broadening the sample  This sampling error is only one of the ways in which data can be biased  
Bias can be differentiated from other statistical mistakes such as accuracy  instrument failure inadequacy   lack of data  or mistakes in transcription  typos   Bias implies that the data selection may have been skewed by the collection criteria  Other forms of human based bias emerge in data collection as well such as response bias  in which participants give inaccurate responses to a question  Bias does not preclude the existence of any other mistakes  One may have a poorly designed sample  an inaccurate measurement device  and typos in recording data simultaneously  Ideally  all factors are controlled and accounted for 
Also it is useful to recognize that the term  error  specifically refers to the outcome rather than the process  errors of rejection or acceptance of the hypothesis being tested   or from the phenomenon of random errors             The terms flaw or mistake are recommended to differentiate procedural errors from these specifically defined outcome based terms 


Bias of an estimator edit 
Main article  Bias of an estimator
Statistical bias is a feature of a statistical technique or of its results whereby the expected value of the results differs from the true underlying quantitative parameter being estimated  The bias of an estimator of a parameter should not be confused with its degree of precision  as the degree of precision is a measure of the sampling error  The bias is defined as follows  let 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
      displaystyle T 
  
 be a statistic used to estimate a parameter 
  
    
      
          x b  
      
    
      displaystyle  theta  
  
  and let 
  
    
      
        E
          x     
         
        T
         
      
    
      displaystyle  operatorname  E   T  
  
 denote the expected value of 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
      displaystyle T 
  
  Then

        bias
          x     
         
        T
         
         
        E
          x

is called the bias of the statistic 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
      displaystyle T 
  
  with respect to 
  
    
      
          x b  
      
    
      displaystyle  theta  
  
   If 
  
    
      
        bias
          x     
         
        T
         
          x b  
         
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle  operatorname  bias   T  theta     
  
  then 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
      displaystyle T 
  
 is said to be an unbiased estimator of 
  
    
      
          x b  
      
    
      displaystyle  theta  
  
  otherwise  it is said to be a biased estimator of 
  
    
      
          x b  
      
    
      displaystyle  theta  
  
 
The bias of a statistic 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
      displaystyle T 
  
 is always relative to the parameter 
  
    
      
          x b  
      
    
      displaystyle  theta  
  
 it is used to estimate  but the parameter 
  
    
      
          x b  
      
    
      displaystyle  theta  
  
 is often omitted when it is clear from the context what is being estimated 

Types edit 
Statistical bias comes from all stages of data analysis  The following sources of bias will be listed in each stage separately 

Data selection edit 
Selection bias involves individuals being more likely to be selected for study than others  biasing the sample  This can also be termed selection effect  sampling bias and Berksonian bias            

Spectrum bias arises from evaluating diagnostic tests on biased patient samples  leading to an overestimate of the sensitivity and specificity of the test  For example  a high prevalence of disease in a study population increases positive predictive values  which will cause a bias between the prediction values and the real ones            
Observer selection bias occurs when the evidence presented has been pre filtered by observers  which is so called anthropic principle  The data collected is not only filtered by the design of experiment  but also by the necessary precondition that there must be someone doing a study             An example is the impact of the Earth in the past  The impact event may cause the extinction of intelligent animals  or there were no intelligent animals at that time  Therefore  some impact events have not been observed  but they may have occurred in the past            
Volunteer bias occurs when volunteers have intrinsically different characteristics from the target population of the study             Research has shown that volunteers tend to come from families with higher socioeconomic status             Furthermore  another study shows that women are more probable to volunteer for studies than men            
Funding bias may lead to the selection of outcomes  test samples  or test procedures that favor a study s financial sponsor             
Attrition bias arises due to a loss of participants  e g   loss of follow up during a study             
Recall bias arises due to differences in the accuracy or completeness of participant recollections of past events  for example  patients cannot recall how many cigarettes they smoked last week exactly  leading to over estimation or under estimation 
Hypothesis testing edit 
Type I and type II errors in statistical hypothesis testing leads to wrong results              Type I error happens when the null hypothesis is correct but is rejected  For instance  suppose that the null hypothesis is that if the average driving speed limit ranges from    to    km h  it is not considered as speeding  On the other hand  if the average speed is not in that range  it is considered speeding  If someone receives a ticket with an average driving speed of   km h  the decision maker has committed a Type I error  In other words  the average driving speed meets the null hypothesis but is rejected  On the contrary  Type II error happens when the null hypothesis is not correct but is accepted 
Bias in hypothesis testing occurs when the power  the complement of the type II error rate  at some alternative is lower than the supremum of the Type I error rate  which is usually the significance level  
  
    
      
          x b  
      
    
      displaystyle  alpha  
  
   Equivalently  if no rejection rate at any alternative is lower than the rejection rate at any point in the null hypothesis set  the test is said to be unbiased             

Estimator selection edit 
The bias of an estimator is the difference between an estimator s expected value and the true value of the parameter being estimated  Although an unbiased estimator is theoretically preferable to a biased estimator  in practice  biased estimators with small biases are frequently used  A biased estimator may be more useful for several reasons  First  an unbiased estimator may not exist without further assumptions  Second  sometimes an unbiased estimator is hard to compute  Third  a biased estimator may have a lower value of mean squared error  

A biased estimator is better than any unbiased estimator arising from the Poisson distribution                          The value of a biased estimator is always positive and the mean squared error of it is smaller than the unbiased one  which makes the biased estimator be more accurate 
Omitted variable bias is the bias that appears in estimates of parameters in regression analysis when the assumed specification omits an independent variable that should be in the model 
Analysis methods edit 
 Detection bias occurs when a phenomenon is more likely to be observed for a particular set of study subjects  For instance  the syndemic involving obesity and diabetes may mean doctors are more likely to look for diabetes in obese patients than in thinner patients  leading to an inflation in diabetes among obese patients because of skewed detection efforts 
In educational measurement  bias is defined as  Systematic errors in test content  test administration  and or scoring procedures that can cause some test takers to get either lower or higher scores than their true ability would merit               The source of the bias is irrelevant to the trait the test is intended to measure 
Observer bias arises when the researcher subconsciously influences the experiment due to cognitive bias where judgment may alter how an experiment is carried out   how results are recorded 
Interpretation edit 
Reporting bias involves a skew in the availability of data  such that observations of a certain kind are more likely to be reported 

Addressing statistical bias edit 
Depending on the type of bias present  researchers and analysts can take different steps to reduce bias on a data set  All types of bias mentioned above have corresponding measures which can be taken to reduce or eliminate their impacts  
Bias should be accounted for at every step of the data collection process  beginning with clearly defined research parameters and consideration of the team who will be conducting the research             Observer bias may be reduced by implementing a blind or double blind technique  Avoidance of p hacking is essential to the process of accurate data collection  One way to check for bias in results after is rerunning analyses with different independent variables to observe whether a given phenomenon still occurs in dependent variables               Careful use of language in reporting can reduce misleading phrases  such as discussion of a result  approaching  statistical significant as compared to actually achieving it
