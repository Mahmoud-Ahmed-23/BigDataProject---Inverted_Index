							A delegation from the International Monetary Fund  IMF  will be visiting Egypt at the end of this month to resume negotiations over a     bn loan  with presidential adviser Essam Al Haddad blaming the US based lender for delaying talks  AFP Photo 
The International Monetary Fund  IMF  said no new mission is scheduled to visit Egypt at the current time  with the country working on meeting conditions to secure a pivotal     bn loan needed to bolster the economy  Meanwhile  presidential adviser Essam Al Haddad has blamed the US based lender for delaying talks 
Following media reports that a delegation from the fund is planning on visiting Egypt soon  IMF spokesperson Olga Stankova said in a statement that the IMF s staff is working with Egyptian authorities from their headquarters and are making good progress on the technical front         We look forward to the resolution of the remaining technical issues and preparatory work by the authorities  which would enable us to field the mission to conclude the negotiations    she said 
Al Haddad told the Financial Times earlier this week that the Egyptian government has taken all the necessary steps to meet the conditions set by the IMF  and that the lender is responsible for the delay 
The government has already implemented a plan to curb subsidies on energy and bread  and introduced sales tax law on a number of goods and services since December  he said 
He added that Egypt s budget deficit is expected to decrease to    by June      as was requested by the international lender 
However  the IMF has recently published in a report  Regional Economic Outlook  that Egypt s economy is expected to grow at a slower rate during the next fiscal year compared to           
The report predicted Egypt s GDP growth will decrease to    in the coming fiscal year  compared to      last year  while also predicting inflation rates will increase to       by the end of this year 
Al Haddad added that the global lender is holding up talks to finalise the agreement  as it had not yet received consensus from political parties on the government s economic reform programme 
Despite that  the IMF stated last Thursday that they are  making good progress  in their discussions with the Egyptian authorities over the loan package 
Egypt has been negotiating with the IMF for two years now over the proposed     bn loan to support the country s ailing economy 
Tunisia  which preceded Egypt in the Arab Spring upheaval  succeeded in securing a      bn loan from the IMF on Friday to salvage the country s economic strains
