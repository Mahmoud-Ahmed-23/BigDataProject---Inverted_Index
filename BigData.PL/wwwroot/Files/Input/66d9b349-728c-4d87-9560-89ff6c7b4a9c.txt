The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  DARPA  is a research and development agency of the United States Department of Defense responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military                        Originally known as the Advanced Research Projects Agency  ARPA   the agency was created on February          by President Dwight D  Eisenhower in response to the Soviet launching of Sputnik   in       By collaborating with academia  industry  and government partners  DARPA formulates and executes research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science  often beyond immediate U S  military requirements             The name of the organization first changed from its founding name  ARPA  to DARPA  in March       changing back to ARPA in February       then reverted to DARPA in March                 
The Economist has called DARPA  the agency that shaped the modern world   with technologies like  Moderna s COVID    vaccine     weather satellites  GPS  drones  stealth technology  voice interfaces  the personal computer and the internet on the list of innovations for which DARPA can claim at least partial credit              Its track record of success has inspired governments around the world to launch similar research and development agencies            
DARPA is independent of other military research and development and reports directly to senior Department of Defense management  DARPA comprises approximately     government employees in six technical offices  including nearly     program managers  who together oversee about     research and development programs            
Rob McHenry is the current acting director            


History edit 
DARPA achievements for the past    years
Early history             edit 
DARPA s former headquarters in the Virginia Square neighborhood of Arlington County  Virginia  The agency is currently located in a new building at     North Randolph St The Advanced Research Projects Agency  ARPA  was suggested by the President s Scientific Advisory Committee to President Dwight D  Eisenhower in a meeting called after the launch of Sputnik               ARPA was formally authorized by President Eisenhower in      for the purpose of forming and executing research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science  and able to reach far beyond immediate military requirements             The two relevant acts are the Supplemental Military Construction Authorization  Air Force               Public Law         and Department of Defense Directive          in February       It was placed within the Office of the Secretary of Defense  OSD  and counted approximately     people               Its creation was directly attributed to the launching of Sputnik and to U S  realization that the Soviet Union had developed the capacity to rapidly exploit military technology  Initial funding of ARPA was      million              ARPA s first director  Roy Johnson  left a          management job at General Electric for an         job at ARPA                          Herbert York from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was hired as his scientific assistant             
Johnson and York were both keen on space projects  but when NASA was established later in      all space projects and most of ARPA s funding were transferred to it  Johnson resigned and ARPA was repurposed to do  high risk    high gain    far out  basic research  a posture that was enthusiastically embraced by the nation s scientists and research universities              ARPA s second director was Brigadier General Austin W  Betts  who resigned in early      and was succeeded by Jack Ruina who served until                   Ruina  the first scientist to administer ARPA  managed to raise its budget to      million              It was Ruina who hired J  C  R  Licklider as the first administrator of the Information Processing Techniques Office  which played a vital role in creation of ARPANET  the basis for the future Internet             
Additionally  the political and defense communities recognized the need for a high level Department of Defense organization to formulate and execute R amp D projects that would expand the frontiers of technology beyond the immediate and specific requirements of the Military Services and their laboratories  In pursuit of this mission  DARPA has developed and transferred technology programs encompassing a wide range of scientific disciplines that address the full spectrum of national security needs 
From      to       ARPA s emphasis centered on major national issues  including space  ballistic missile defense  and nuclear test detection               During       all of its civilian space programs were transferred to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  NASA  and the military space programs to the individual services             
This allowed ARPA to concentrate its efforts on the Project Defender  defense against ballistic missiles   Project Vela  nuclear test detection   and Project AGILE  counterinsurgency R amp D  programs  and to begin work on computer processing  behavioral sciences  and materials sciences  The DEFENDER and AGILE programs formed the foundation of DARPA sensor  surveillance  and directed energy R amp D  particularly in the study of radar  infrared sensing  and x ray gamma ray detection 
ARPA at this point        played an early role in Transit  also called NavSat  a predecessor to the Global Positioning System  GPS                 Fast forward to      when a joint effort between DARPA and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory began to fine tune the early explorers  discoveries  TRANSIT  sponsored by the Navy and developed under the leadership of Richard Kirschner at Johns Hopkins  was the first satellite positioning system                          
During the late     s  with the transfer of these mature programs to the Services  ARPA redefined its role and concentrated on a diverse set of relatively small  essentially exploratory research programs  The agency was renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  DARPA  in       and during the early     s  it emphasized direct energy programs  information processing  and tactical technologies      citation needed     
Concerning information processing  DARPA made great progress  initially through its support of the development of time sharing   All modern operating systems rely on concepts invented for the Multics system  developed by a cooperation among Bell Labs  General Electric and MIT  which DARPA supported by funding Project MAC at MIT with an initial two million dollar grant             
DARPA supported the evolution of the ARPANET  the first wide area packet switching network   Packet Radio Network  Packet Satellite Network and ultimately  the Internet and research in the artificial intelligence fields of speech recognition and signal processing  including parts of Shakey the robot              DARPA also supported the early development of both hypertext and hypermedia  DARPA funded one of the first two hypertext systems  Douglas Engelbart s NLS computer system  as well as The Mother of All Demos   DARPA later funded the development of the Aspen Movie Map  which is generally seen as the first hypermedia system and an important precursor of virtual reality 

Later history             edit 
The Mansfield Amendment of      expressly limited appropriations for defense research  through ARPA DARPA  only to projects with direct military application 
The resulting  brain drain  is credited with boosting the development of the fledgling personal computer industry  Some young computer scientists left the universities to startups and private research laboratories such as Xerox PARC 
Between      and       DARPA s major projects were dominated by air  land  sea  and space technology  tactical armor and anti armor programs  infrared sensing for space based surveillance  high energy laser technology for space based missile defense  antisubmarine warfare  advanced cruise missiles  advanced aircraft  and defense applications of advanced computing 
Many of the successful programs were transitioned to the Services  such as the foundation technologies in automatic target recognition  space based sensing  propulsion  and materials that were transferred to the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization  SDIO   later known as the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization  BMDO   now titled the Missile Defense Agency  MDA  

Recent history       present  edit 
During the     s  the attention of the Agency was centered on information processing and aircraft related programs  including the National Aerospace Plane  NASP  or Hypersonic Research Program  The Strategic Computing Program enabled DARPA to exploit advanced processing and networking technologies and to rebuild and strengthen relationships with universities after the Vietnam War  In addition  DARPA began to pursue new concepts for small  lightweight satellites  LIGHTSAT  and directed new programs regarding defense manufacturing  submarine technology  and armor anti armor 
In       two engineers  Robert McGhee and Kenneth Waldron  started to develop the Adaptive Suspension Vehicle  ASV  nicknamed the  Walker  at the Ohio State University  under a research contract from DARPA              The vehicle was    feet long    feet wide  and      feet high  and had six legs to support its three ton aluminum body  in which it was designed to carry cargo over difficult terrains  However  DARPA lost interest in the ASV  after problems with cold weather tests             
On February          the agency shut down its so called  LifeLog Project   The project s aim would have been   to gather in a single place just about everything an individual says  sees or does              
On October           the agency broke ground on a new facility in Arlington County  Virginia a few miles from The Pentagon             
In fall       DARPA hosted the     Year Starship Symposium with the aim of getting the public to start thinking seriously about interstellar travel             
On June          NASA and DARPA announced that it planned to build new X planes with NASA s plan setting to create a whole series of X planes over the next    years             
Between      and       DARPA shepherded the first machine to machine computer security competition  the Cyber Grand Challenge  CGC  
bringing a group of top notch computer security experts to search for security vulnerabilities  exploit them  and create fixes that patch those vulnerabilities in a fully automated fashion                          It is one of DARPA prize competitions to spur innovations 
In June       DARPA leaders demonstrated a number of new technologies that were developed within the framework of the GXV T program  The goal of this program is to create a lightly armored combat vehicle of not very large dimensions  which  due to maneuverability and other tricks  can successfully resist modern anti tank weapon systems             
In September       DARPA and the US Air Force announced that the Hypersonic Air breathing Weapon Concept  HAWC  are ready for free flight tests within the next year             
Victoria Coleman became the director of DARPA in November                  
In recent years  DARPA officials have contracted out core functions to corporations  For example  during fiscal year       Chenega ran physical security on DARPA s premises              System High Corp  carried out program security              and Agile Defense ran unclassified IT services              General Dynamics runs classified IT services              Strategic Analysis Inc  provided support services regarding engineering  science  mathematics  and front office and administrative work

The Office of Special Development  OSD  in the     s developed a real time remote sensing  monitoring  and predictive activity system on trails used by insurgents in Laos  Cambodia  and the Republic of Vietnam   This was done from an office in Bangkok  Thailand  that was ostensibly established to catalog and support the Thai fishing fleet  of which two volumes were published   This is a personal recollection without a published citation   A report on the ARPA group under which OSD operated is found here             
A      reorganization created several offices which existed throughout the early     s             

The Electronic Systems Technology Office combined areas of the Defense Sciences Office and the Defense Manufacturing Office  This new office will focus on the boundary between general purpose computers and the physical world  such as sensors  displays and the first few layers of specialized signal processing that couple these modules to standard computer interfaces 
The Software and Intelligent Systems Technology Office and the Computing Systems office will have responsibility associated with the Presidential High Performance Computing Initiative  The Software office will also be responsible for  software systems technology  machine intelligence and software engineering  
The Land Systems Office was created to develop advanced land vehicle and anti armor systems  once the domain of the Tactical Technology Office 
The Undersea Warfare Office combined areas of the Advanced Vehicle Systems and Tactical Technology offices to develop and demonstrate submarine stealth and counter stealth and automation 
A      reorganization merged two offices 

The Transformational Convergence Technology Office  TCTO  and the Information Processing Techniques Office  IPTO  were combined in      to form the Information Innovation Office  I O  
TCTO s mission was to develop new crosscutting capabilities from a broad range of emerging technological and social trends  particularly in areas related to computing and computing reliant subareas of the life sciences  social sciences  manufacturing  and commerce
