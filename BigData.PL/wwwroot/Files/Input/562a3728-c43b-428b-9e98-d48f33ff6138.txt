The University of Florida Cancer and Genetics Research Complex is an integrated medical research facility 
Medical research  or biomedical research   also known as health research  refers to the process of using scientific methods with the aim to produce knowledge about human diseases  the prevention and treatment of illness  and the promotion of health            
Medical research encompasses a wide array of research  extending from  basic research   also called bench science or bench research                involving fundamental scientific principles that may apply to a preclinical understanding   to clinical research  which involves studies of people who may be subjects in clinical trials  Within this spectrum is applied research  or translational research  conducted to expand knowledge in the field of medicine 
Both clinical and preclinical research phases exist in the pharmaceutical industry s drug development pipelines  where the clinical phase is denoted by the term clinical trial  However  only part of the clinical or preclinical research is oriented towards a specific pharmaceutical purpose  The need for fundamental and mechanism based understanding  diagnostics  medical devices  and non pharmaceutical therapies means that pharmaceutical research is only a small part of medical research 
Most of the research in the field is pursued by biomedical scientists  but significant contributions are made by other type of biologists  Medical research on humans has to strictly follow the medical ethics sanctioned in the Declaration of Helsinki and the institutional review board where the research is conducted  In all cases  research ethics are expected 


Impact edit 
The increased longevity of humans over the past century can be significantly attributed to advances resulting from medical research  Among the major benefits of medical research have been vaccines for measles and polio  insulin treatment for diabetes  classes of antibiotics for treating a host of maladies  medication for high blood pressure  improved treatments for AIDS  statins and other treatments for atherosclerosis  new surgical techniques such as microsurgery  and increasingly successful treatments for cancer  New  beneficial tests and treatments are expected as a result of the Human Genome Project  Many challenges remain  however  including the appearance of antibiotic resistance and the obesity epidemic      citation needed     

Phases of medical research edit 
Basic medical research edit 
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island  home to eight scientists awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine  is an internationally renowned basic medical research institution 
Example areas in basic medical research include  cellular and molecular biology  medical genetics  immunology  neuroscience  and psychology  Researchers  mainly in universities or government funded research institutes  aim to establish an understanding of the cellular  molecular and physiological mechanisms of human health and disease      citation needed     

Pre clinical research edit 
Pre clinical research covers understanding of mechanisms that may lead to clinical research with people  Typically  the work requires no ethical approval  is supervised by scientists rather than physicians  and is carried out in a university or company  rather than a hospital      citation needed     

Clinical research edit 
Clinical research is carried out with people as the experimental subjects  It is generally supervised by physicians and conducted by nurses in a medical setting  such as a hospital or research clinic  and requires ethical approval      citation needed     

Role of patients and the public edit 
Further information  Patient and public involvement
Besides being participants in a clinical trial  members of the public can actively collaborate with researchers in designing and conducting medical research  This is known as patient and public involvement  PPI   Public involvement involves a working partnership between patients  caregivers  people with lived experience  and researchers to shape and influence what is researcher and how             PPI can improve the quality of research and make it more relevant and accessible  People with current or past experience of illness can provide a different perspective than professionals and complement their knowledge  Through their personal knowledge they can identify research topics that are relevant and important to those living with an illness or using a service  They can also help to make the research more grounded in the needs of the specific communities they are part of  Public contributors can also ensure that the research is presented in plain language that is clear to the wider society and the specific groups it is most relevant for

Research funding in many countries derives from research bodies and private organizations which distribute money for equipment  salaries  and research expenses  United States  Europe  Asia  Canada  and Australia combined spent        billion in       which reflected growth of      annually from        billion in                  The United States contributed     of governmental funding from these regions in      compared to     in                 
In the United Kingdom  funding bodies such as the National Institute for Health and Care Research  NIHR  and the Medical Research Council derive their assets from UK tax payers  and distribute revenues to institutions by competitive research grants  The Wellcome Trust is the UK s largest non governmental source of funds for biomedical research and provides over      million per year in grants to scientists and funds for research centres            
In the United States  data from ongoing surveys by the National Science Foundation  NSF  show that federal agencies provided only     of the     billion spent on basic research in                  The National Institutes of Health and pharmaceutical companies collectively contribute       billion and     billion  which constitute     and     of the total  respectively  Other significant contributors include biotechnology companies        billion      of total   medical device companies       billion      of total   other federal sources  and state and local governments  Foundations and charities  led by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation  contributed about    of the funding  These funders are attempting to maximize their return on investment in public health             One method proposed to maximize the return on investment in medicine is to fund the development of open source hardware for medical research and treatment             
The enactment of orphan drug legislation in some countries has increased funding available to develop drugs meant to treat rare conditions  resulting in breakthroughs that previously were uneconomical to pursue 

Government funded biomedical research edit 
Since the establishment of the National Institutes of Health  NIH  in the mid     s  the main source of U S  federal support of biomedical research  investment priorities and levels of funding have fluctuated  From      to       NIH support of biomedical research increased from    billion to    billion              Despite the jump in federal spending  advancements measured by citations to publications and the number of drugs passed by the FDA remained stagnant over the same time span              Financial projections indicate federal spending will remain constant in the near future             

US federal funding trends edit 
The National Institutes of Health  NIH  is the agency that is responsible for management of the lion s share of federal funding of biomedical research              It funds over     areas directly related to health              Over the past century there were two notable periods of NIH support 
From      to      funding increased from        billion to        billion              years which represented the start of what is considered the  doubling period  of rapid NIH support              The second notable period started in      and ended in       a period where the NIH moved to organize research spending for engagement with the scientific community             

Privately  industry  funded biomedical research edit 
Further information  industry funded research
Since      the share of biomedical research funding from industry sources has grown from     to                  which has resulted in the development of numerous life saving medical advances  The relationship between industry and government funded research in the US has seen great movement over the years  The      Bayh Dole Act was passed by Congress to foster a more constructive relationship between the collaboration of government and industry funded biomedical research  The Bayh Doyle Act gave private corporations the option of applying for government funded grants for biomedical research which in turn allowed the private corporations to license the technology              Both government and industry research funding increased rapidly from between the years of            industry saw a compound average annual growth rate of      a year and slowed only slightly to a compound average annual growth rate of      from      to                  

Conflicts of interests edit 
 Conflict of interest  in the field of medical research has been defined as  a set of conditions in which professional judgment concerning a primary interest  such as a person s welfare or the validity of research  tends to be unduly influenced by a secondary interest  such as financial gain               
Regulation on industry funded biomedical research has seen great changes since Samuel Hopkins Adams declaration   In      congress passed the Pure Food and Drugs Act of                    In      Congress passed the Shirley Amendment to prohibit the wide dissemination of false information on pharmaceuticals               The Food and Drug Administration was formally created in      under the McNarey Mapes Amendment to oversee the regulation of Food and Drugs in the United States               In      the Kefauver Harris Amendments to the Food  Drug and Cosmetics Act made it so that before a drug was marketed in the United States the FDA must first approve that the drug was safe               The Kefauver Harris amendments also mandated that more stringent clinical trials must be performed before a drug is brought to the market               The Kefauver Harris amendments were met with opposition from industry due to the requirement of lengthier clinical trial periods that would lessen the period of time in which the investor is able to see return on their money   In the pharmaceutical industry patents are typically granted for a    year period of time  and most patent applications are submitted during the early stages of the product development               According to Ariel Katz on average after a patent application is submitted it takes an additional   years before the FDA approves a drug for marketing               As such this would leave a company with only    years to market the drug to see a return on their investments  After a sharp decline of new drugs entering the US market following the      Kefauver Harris amendments economist Sam Petlzman concluded that cost of loss of innovation was greater than the savings recognized by consumers no longer purchasing ineffective drugs               In      the Hatch Waxman Act or the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of      was passed by congress               The Hatch Waxman Act was passed with the idea that giving brand manufacturers the ability to extend their patent by an additional   years would create greater incentives for innovation and private sector funding for investment             
The relationship that exists with industry funded biomedical research is that of which industry is the financier for academic institutions which in turn employ scientific investigators to conduct research   A fear that exists wherein a project is funded by industry is that firms might negate informing the public of negative effects to better promote their product             
A list of studies shows that public fear of the conflicts of interest that exist when biomedical research is funded by industry can be considered valid after a      publication of  Scope and Impact of Financial Conflicts of Interest in Biomedical Research  in The Journal of American Association of Medicine    This publication included    different studies that met specific criteria to determine whether or not an academic institution or scientific investigator funded by industry had engaged in behavior that could be deduced to be a conflict of interest in the field of biomedical research  Survey results from one study concluded that     of scientific investigators employed by a participating academic institution had received research related gifts and discretionary funds from industry sponsors               Another participating institution surveyed showed that      of investigators were financially tied to research sponsors  including paid speaking engagements        consulting arrangements        advisory board positions       and equity                     A      study concluded that     out of     life science companies indicated that investigators were required to withhold information pertaining to their research as to extend the life of the interested companies  patents               Rules and regulations regarding conflict of interest disclosures are being studied by experts in the biomedical research field to eliminate conflicts of interest that could possibly affect the outcomes of biomedical research 

Transparency laws edit 
Two laws which are both still in effect  one passed in      and the other in       were instrumental in defining funding reporting standards for biomedical research  and defining for the first time reporting regulations that were previously not required  The      Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act mandates that all entities receiving over         in federal funds must report annual spending reports  including disclosure of executive salaries              The      amendment to the act mandates that progress reports be submitted along with financial reporting              Data from the federal mandate is managed and made publicly available on usaspending gov              Aside from the main source  usaspending gov  other reporting mechanisms exist  Data specifically on biomedical research funding from federal sources is made publicly available by the National Health Expenditure Accounts  NHEA   data on health services research  approximately      of federal funding on biomedical research  is available through the Coalition of Health Services Research  the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  the Centers for Medicare  amp  Medicaid Services  and the Veterans Health Administration             
Currently  there are not any funding reporting requirements for industry sponsored research  but there has been voluntary movement toward this goal              In       major pharmaceutical stakeholders such as Roche and Johnson and Johnson have made financial information publicly available and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America  PhRMA   the most prominent professional association for biomedical research companies  has recently begun to provide limited public funding reports             

History edit 
Ancient to   th century in other regions edit 
Further information  History of medicine and History of pharmacy
The earliest narrative describing a medical trial is found in the Book of Daniel  which says that Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar ordered youths of royal blood to eat only red meat and wine for three years  while another group of youths ate only beans and water              The experiment was intended to determine if a diet of vegetables and water was healthier than a diet of wine and red meat  At the experiment endpoint  the trial accomplished its prerogative  the youths who ate only beans and water were noticeably healthier              Scientific curiosity to understand health outcomes from varying treatments has been present for centuries  but it was not until the mid   th century when an organizational platform was created to support and regulate this curiosity  In       Vannevar Bush said that biomedical scientific research was  the pacemaker of technological progress   an idea which contributed to the initiative to found the National Institutes of Health  NIH  in       a historical benchmark that marked the beginning of a near century substantial investment in biomedical research             

  th and   st century in the United States edit 
The NIH provides more financial support for medical research than any other agency in the world to date and claims responsibility for numerous innovations that have improved global health              The historical funding of biomedical research has undergone many changes over the past century  Innovations such as the polio vaccine  antibiotics and antipsychotic agents  developed in the early years of the NIH lead to social and political support of the agency  Political initiatives in the early     s lead to a doubling of NIH funding  spurring an era of great scientific progress              There have been dramatic changes in the era since the turn of the   st century to date  roughly around the start of the century  the cost of trials dramatically increased while the rate of scientific discoveries did not keep pace             
Biomedical research spending increased substantially faster than GDP growth over the past decade in the US  between the years of      and      spending increased     per year  while GDP growth increased    over the same period  both measures adjusted for inflation               Industry  not for profit entities  state and federal funding spending combined accounted for an increase in funding from       billion in      to        billion in                   Due to the immediacy of federal financing priorities and stagnant corporate spending during the recession  biomedical research spending decreased    in real terms in                   Despite an overall increase of investment in biomedical research  there has been stagnation  and in some areas a marked decline in the number of drug and device approvals over the same time period             
As of       industry sponsored research accounts for     of expenditures  NIH for     of expenditures  state governments for    of expenditures  non NIH federal sources for    of expenditures and not for profit entities accounted for    of support              Federally funded biomedical research expenditures increased nominally        adjusted for inflation   from      to                   Previous reports showed a stark contrast in federal investment  from      to       federal funding increased       adjusted for inflation              
The NIH manages the majority  over      of federal biomedical research expenditures               NIH support for biomedical research decreased from       billion in       to       billion in       a     decline  in real terms adjusted for inflation   while non NIH federal funding allowed for the maintenance of government financial support levels through the era  the      four year increase   Spending from industry initiated research increased      adjusted for inflation  over the same time period of time  from      to       an increase from     billion in       to       billion in                   Industry sourced expenditures from      to      showed industry sponsored research funding increased       a stark contrast to     increase in recent years             
Of industry sponsored research  pharmaceutical firm spending was the greatest contributor from all industry sponsored biomedical research spending  but only increased      adjusted for inflation  from      to       while device and biotechnology firms accounted for the majority of the spending              The stock performance  a measure that can be an indication of future firm growth or technological direction  has substantially increased for both predominantly medical device and biotechnology producers              Contributing factors to this growth are thought to be less rigorous FDA approval requirements for devices as opposed to drugs  lower cost of trials  lower pricing and profitability of products and predictable influence of new technology due to a limited number of competitors              Another visible shift during the era was a shift in focus to late stage research trials  formerly dispersed  since      an increasingly large portion of industry sponsored research was late phase trials rather than early experimental phases now accounting for the majority of industry sponsored research              This shift is attributable to a lower risk investment and a shorter development to market schedule              The low risk preference is also reflected in the trend of large pharmaceutical firms acquiring smaller companies that hold patents to newly developed drug or device discoveries which have not yet passed federal regulation  large companies are mitigating their risk by purchasing technology created by smaller companies in early phase high risk studies               Medical research support from universities increased from      billion in      to       billion in       a      increase  adjusted for inflation               In      the most heavily funded institutions received     of HIN medical research funding  and the top    institutions received     of NIH medical research funding  the percent of funding allocated to the largest institutions is a trend which has increased only slightly over data from                   Relative to federal and private funding  health policy and service research accounted for a nominal amount of sponsored research  health policy and service research was funded      billion in       which increased to      billion in                  
Stagnant rates of investment from the US government over the past decade may be in part attributable to challenges that plague the field  To date  only two thirds of published drug trial findings have results that can be re produced              which raises concerns from a US regulatory standpoint where great investment has been made in research ethics and standards  yet trial results remain inconsistent  Federal agencies have called upon greater regulation to address these problems  a spokesman from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke  an agency of the NIH  stated that there is  widespread poor reporting of experimental design in articles and grant applications  that animal research should follow a core set of research parameters  and that a concerted effort by all stakeholders is needed to disseminate best reporting practices and put them into practice              

Regulations and guidelines edit 
Medical research is highly regulated  National regulatory authorities are appointed in most countries to oversee and monitor medical research  such as for the development and distribution of new drugs  In the United States  the Food and Drug Administration oversees new drug development  in Europe  the European Medicines Agency  see also EudraLex   and in Japan  the Ministry of Health  Labour and Welfare  The World Medical Association develops the ethical standards for medical professionals involved in medical research  The most fundamental of them is the Declaration of Helsinki  The International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use  ICH  works on the creation of rules and guidelines for the development of new medication  such as the guidelines for Good Clinical Practice  GCP   All ideas of regulation are based on a country s ethical standards code  This is why treatment of a particular disease in one country may not be allowed  but is in another 

Flaws and vulnerabilities edit 
A major flaw and vulnerability in biomedical research appears to be the hypercompetition for the resources and positions that are required to conduct science  The competition seems to suppress the creativity  cooperation  risk taking  and original thinking required to make fundamental discoveries  Other consequences of today s highly pressured environment for research appear to be a substantial number of research publications whose results cannot be replicated  and perverse incentives in research funding that encourage grantee institutions to grow without making sufficient investments in their own faculty and facilities                                                              Other risky trends include a decline in the share of key research grants going to younger scientists  as well as a steady rise in the age at which investigators receive their first funding             
A significant flaw in biomedical research is the toxic culture that particularly impacts medical students and early career researchers  They face challenges such as bullying  harassment  and unethical authorship practices  Intense competition for funding and publication pressures fosters a climate of secrecy and self protection  stifling creativity and collaboration  The power imbalance in academic hierarchies exacerbates these issues  with junior researchers often subjected to exploitative practices and denied proper recognition for their contributions             

Commercialization edit 
After clinical research  medical therapies are typically commercialized by private companies such as pharmaceutical companies or medical device company  In the United States  one estimate found that in       one third of Medicare physician and outpatient hospital spending was on new technologies unavailable in the prior decade             
Medical therapies are constantly being researched  so the difference between a therapy which is investigational versus standard of care is not always clear  particularly given cost effectiveness considerations              Payers have utilization management clinical guidelines which do not pay for  experimental or investigational  therapies  or may require that the therapy is medically necessary or superior to cheaper treatments  For example  proton therapy was approved by the FDA  but private health insurers in the United States considered it unproven or unnecessary given its high cost  although it was ultimately covered for certain cancers
