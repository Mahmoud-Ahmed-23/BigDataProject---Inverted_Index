PubMed Central  PMC  is a free digital repository that archives open access full text scholarly articles that have been published in biomedical and life sciences journals  As one of the major research databases developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information  NCBI   PubMed Central is more than a document repository  Submissions to PMC are indexed and formatted for enhanced metadata  medical ontology  and unique identifiers which enrich the XML structured data for each article             Content within PMC can be linked to other NCBI databases and accessed via Entrez search and retrieval systems  further enhancing the public s ability to discover  read and build upon its biomedical knowledge            
PubMed Central is distinct from PubMed             PubMed Central is a free digital archive of full articles  accessible to anyone from anywhere via a web browser  with varying provisions for reuse   Conversely  although PubMed is a searchable database of biomedical citations and abstracts  the full text article resides elsewhere  in print or online  free or behind a subscriber paywall  


History edit 
PubMed Central began as E biomed  initially proposed in May      by then NIH director Harold Varmus             The idea came to him  abruptly  in December       inspired by the early use of arXiv for preprints after a presentation from Pat Brown of Stanford and David Lipman  director of NCBI                       

But my views broadened abruptly one morning in December of      when I met Pat Brown for coffee  at the caf  that was formerly the famed Tassajara Bakery  on the corner of Cole and Parnassus  during a visit to San Francisco        A few weeks before our coffee  Pat had learned about the methods being used by the physicist Paul Ginsparg and his colleagues at Los Alamos to allow physicists and mathematicians to share their work with one another over the Internet  They were posting  preprints   articles not yet submitted or accepted for publication  at a publicly accessible website  called LanX or arXiv  for anyone to read and critique       
The more I thought about this  the more I was convinced that a radical restructuring of methods for publishing  transmitting  storing  and using biomedical research reports might be possible and beneficial  In a spirit of enthusiasm and political innocence  I wrote a lengthy manifesto  proposing the creation of an NIH supported online system  called E biomed 
The goal of E biomed was to provide free access to all biomedical research  Papers submitted to E biomed could take one of two routes  either immediately published as a preprint  or through a traditional peer review process  The peer review process was to resemble contemporary overlay journals  with an external editorial board retaining control over the process of reviewing  curating  and listing papers which would otherwise be freely accessible on the central E biomed server  Varmus intended to realize the new possibilities presented by communicating scientific results digitally  imagining continuous conversation about published work  versioned documents  and enriched  layered  formats allowing for multiple levels of detail             
The proposal to create a central index of biomedical research was a radical departure from prevailing publishing norms  Prior to the internet  publication indexes operated largely like ISBNs  allocated by registration agencies to secondary publishers  The idea that anyone could own their own address space via a domain name and create their own indexing system was a wholly new idea                        Major commercial publishers had begun experimenting with an indexing system for scientific papers shared across publishers as early as       and were spurred to action following the E biomed proposal  At the October      STM Annual Frankfurt Conference  several publishers led by Springer Verlag reached a hurried conference room consensus to launch their competitor prototype            


At the Board meeting of the STM association  held the afternoon of Monday  October     before the fair s Wednesday opening  discussion focused on an emerging U S  National Library of Medicine  NLM  initiative called E Biomed  later PubMed Central  that had been proposed by Harold Varmus of the National Institutes of Health in the spring of       Varmus envisioned a digital archive of journals  accessible free of charge and with the added value of reference linking   Our consensus was that publishers should be the ones doing the linking   said Bob Campbell  who chaired the meeting   Since we were  higher up the stream   so to speak  we should be able to link our articles ahead of the NLM as part of the process of producing them  Stefan von Holtzbrinck then set the ball rolling by offering to link Nature publications with anyone else s  We decided to issue an announcement of a broad STM reference linking initiative  It was  of course  a strategic move only  since we had neither plan nor prototype  
A small group led by Arnoud de Kemp of Springer Verlag met in an adjacent room immediately following the Board meeting to draft the announcement  which was distributed to all attendees of the STM annual meeting the following day and published in an STM membership publication        The potential benefit of the service that would become CrossRef was immediately apparent  Organizations such as AIP and IOP  Institute of Physics  had begun to link to each other s publications  and the impossibility of replicating such one off arrangements across the industry was obvious  As Tim Ingoldsby later put it   All those linking agreements were going to kill us  


Under pressure from vigorous lobbying from commercial publishers and scientific societies who feared for lost profits              NIH officials announced a revised PubMed Central proposal in August                  PMC would receive submissions from publishers  rather than from authors as in E biomed  Publications were allowed time embargoed paywalls up to one year  PMC would only allow peer reviewed work   no preprints              The then unnamed publisher led linking system shortly thereafter became CrossRef and the larger DOI system  Varmus  Brown  and others including Michael Eisen went on to found the Public Library of Science  PLoS  in       reaching the conclusion  that if we really want to change the publication of scientific research  we must do the publishing ourselves              

Adoption edit

Launched in February       the repository has grown rapidly as the NIH Public Access Policy is designed to make all research funded by the National Institutes of Health  NIH  freely accessible to anyone  and  in addition  many publishers are working cooperatively with the NIH to provide free access to their works      citation needed      In late       the Consolidated Appropriations Act of       H R        was signed into law and included a provision requiring the NIH to modify its policies and require inclusion into PubMed Central complete electronic copies of their peer reviewed research and findings from NIH funded research  These articles are required to be included within    months of publication  This is the first time the US government has required an agency to provide open access to research and is an evolution from the      policy  in which the NIH asked researchers to voluntarily add their research to PubMed Central             
A UK version of the PubMed Central system  UK PubMed Central  UKPMC   has been developed by the Wellcome Trust and the British Library as part of a nine strong group of UK research funders  This system went live in January       On   November       it became Europe PubMed Central  The Canadian member of the PubMed Central International network  PubMed Central Canada  was launched in October      
The National Library of Medicine  NLM Journal Publishing Tag Set  journal article markup language is freely available              The Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers comments that  it is likely to become the standard for preparing scholarly content for both books and journals               A related DTD is available for books              The Library of Congress and the British Library have announced support for the NLM DTD              It has also been popular with journal service providers             
With the release of public access plans for many agencies beyond NIH  PMC is in the process of becoming the repository for a wider variety of articles              This includes NASA content  with the interface branded as  PubSpace                          
As of December               update       the PMC archive contained over     million articles              with contributions coming from publishers or authors depositing their manuscripts into the repository per the NIH Public Access Policy  Earlier data shows that from January      to January      author initiated deposits exceeded         papers during a    month period              PMC identifies about       journals which participate in some capacity to deposit their published content into the PMC repository              Some publishers delay the release of their articles on PubMed Central for a set time after publication  referred to as an  embargo period   ranging from a few months to a few years depending on the journal    Embargoes of six to twelve months are the most common   PubMed Central is a key example of  systematic external distribution by a third party               which some publishers purport to prohibit through private contracts      citation needed     

Technology edit 
Articles are sent to PubMed Central by publishers in XML or SGML  using a variety of article DTDs  Older and larger publishers may have their own established in house DTDs  but many publishers use the NLM Journal Publishing DTD  see above  
Received articles are converted via XSLT to the very similar NLM Archiving and Interchange DTD  This process may reveal errors that are reported back to the publisher for correction  Graphics are also converted to standard formats and sizes  The original and converted forms are archived  The converted form is moved into a relational database  along with associated files for graphics  multimedia  or other associated data  Many publishers also provide PDF of their articles  and these are made available without change             
Bibliographic citations are parsed and automatically linked to the relevant abstracts in PubMed  articles in PubMed Central  and resources on publishers  Web sites  PubMed links also lead to PubMed Central  Unresolvable references  such as to journals or particular articles not yet available at one of these sources  are tracked in the database and automatically come  live  when the resources become available 
An in house indexing system provides search capability  and is aware of biological and medical terminology  such as generic vs  proprietary drug names  and alternate names for organisms  diseases and anatomical parts 
When a user accesses a journal issue  a table of contents is automatically generated by retrieving all articles  letters  editorials  etc  for that issue  When an actual item such as an article is reached  PubMed Central converts the NLM markup to HTML for delivery  and provides links to related data objects  This is feasible because the variety of incoming data has first been converted to standard DTDs and graphic formats 
In a separate submission stream  NIH funded authors may deposit articles into PubMed Central using the NIH Manuscript Submission  NIHMS   Articles thus submitted typically go through XML markup in order to be converted to NLM DTD 

Reception edit 
Reactions to PubMed Central among the scholarly publishing community range between a genuine enthusiasm by some              to cautious concern by others             
While PMC is a welcome partner to open access publishers in its ability to augment the discovery and dissemination of biomedical knowledge  that same truth causes others to worry about traffic being diverted from the published version of record  the economic consequences of less readership  as well as the effect on maintaining a community of scholars within learned societies                          A      analysis found strong evidence that public repositories of published articles were responsible for  drawing significant numbers of readers away from journal websites  and that  the effect of PMC is growing over time              
Libraries  universities  open access supporters  consumer health advocacy groups  and patient rights organizations have applauded PubMed Central  and hope to see similar public access repositories developed by other federal funding agencies so to freely share any research publications that were the result of taxpayer support             
The Antelman study of open access publishing found that in philosophy  political science  electrical and electronic engineering and mathematics  open access papers had a greater research impact              A randomised trial found an increase in content downloads of open access papers  with no citation advantage over subscription access one year after publication             
The NIH policy and open access repository work has inspired a      presidential directive which has sparked action in other federal agencies as well 
In March       PubMed Central accelerated its deposit procedures for the full text of publications on coronavirus  The NLM did so upon request from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and international scientists to improve access for scientists  healthcare providers  data mining innovators  AI healthcare researchers  and the general public             

PMCID edit 
The PMCID  PubMed Central identifier   also known as the PMC reference number  is a bibliographic identifier for the PubMed Central open access database  much like the PMID is the bibliographic identifier for the PubMed database  The two identifiers are distinct however  It consists of  PMC  followed by a string of numbers  The format is             

PMCID  PMC       
Authors applying for NIH awards must include the PMCID in their application      citation needed

   The goal of the semantic web is to express real life  Many things in real life  real questions which we will face are not efficiently computable  There are two solutions to this  The classical  pre web  solution is to constrain the language of expression so that all queries terminate in finite time  The weblike solution is to allow the expression of facts and rules in an overall language which is sufficiently flexible and powerful to express real life  Create subsets fo the web in which specific constraints give you specific computational properties  An anlogy is with the human information systems which existed before the web  Most forced one to keep ones data in a hierarchy  sometimes of fixed depth or a matrix  often with a specific number of dimensions   This gave consistency properties within the information system  I bet DARPA has many of these systems and still does  They only way they could be integrated was to express them in terms of a much more powerful language   global hypertext  Hypertext did not have any of these reassuring properties  People were frightened about getting lost in it  You could follow links forever  As it turns out  it is true of course that there is a problem that you can follow links forever in the Web    Berners Lee  Tim   What the Semantic Web can represent   Web design issues  Archived from the original on October           Retrieved October
