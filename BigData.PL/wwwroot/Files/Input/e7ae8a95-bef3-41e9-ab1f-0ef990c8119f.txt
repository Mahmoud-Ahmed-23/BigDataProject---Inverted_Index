Public housing  also known as social housing  refers to subsidized or affordable housing provided in buildings that are usually owned and managed by local government  central government  nonprofit organizations or a combination thereof  The details  terminology  definitions of poverty  and other criteria for allocation may vary within different contexts  but the right to rent such a home is generally rationed through some form of means testing or through administrative measures of housing needs             One can regard social housing as a potential remedy for housing inequality  Within the OECD  social housing represents an average of    of national housing stock         ranging from      in the Netherlands to less than    in Colombia                       
In the United States  public housing developments are classified as housing projects that are owned by a housing authority or a low income  project based voucher  property   PBV are a component of a public housing agency  PBVs  administered by state and local housing agencies  are distinct from Section   Project Based Rental Assistance  PBRA   a program through which property owners  contract directly with the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  to rent units to families with low incomes            
Affordable housing goals can also be achieved through subsidies  Subsidized housing is owned and operated by private owners who receive subsidies in exchange for providing affordable housing  Owners may be individual landlords or for profit or nonprofit corporations            


History edit 
Boundary Street in       three years later  the London County Council began slum clearance 
Social housing had existed sporadically prior to modern developments  The oldest still in use is the   th century Fuggerei in Augsburg  Bavaria 
The origins of modern municipal housing lie in the dramatic urban population increase caused by the Industrial Revolution of the   th century  In the large cities of the period  many social commentators  such as Octavia Hill and Charles Booth reported on the squalor  sickness and immorality that arose  Henry Mayhew  visiting Bethnal Green  wrote in The Morning Chronicle 

    roads were unmade  often mere alleys  houses small and without foundations  subdivided and often around unpaved courts  An almost total lack of drainage and sewerage was made worse by the ponds formed by the excavation of brickearth  Pigs and cows in back yards  noxious trades like boiling tripe  melting tallow  or preparing cat s meat  and slaughter houses  dustheaps  and  lakes of putrefying night soil  added to the filth            
Some philanthropists began to provide housing in tenement blocks  and some factory owners built entire villages for their workers  such as Saltaire in      and Port Sunlight in       It was in       after the report from a royal commission in England  that the state first took an interest  This led to the Housing of the Working Classes Act of       which empowered Local Government Boards to shut down unhealthy properties and encouraged them to improve the housing in their areas 
The City of London Corporation built tenements in the Farringdon Road in                  The world s first large scale housing project            was built in London to replace one of the capital s most notorious slums   the Old Nichol              Nearly       individuals were crammed into the packed streets  where one child in four died before his or her first birthday  Arthur Morrison wrote the influential A Child of the Jago  an account of the life of a child in the slum  which sparked a public outcry  Construction of the Boundary Estate was begun in      by the Metropolitan Board of Works and completed by the then recently formed London County Council in                  
The success of this project spurred many local councils to embark on similar construction schemes in the early   th century  The Arts and Crafts movement and Ebenezer Howard s garden city ideas led to the leafy London County Council cottage estates such as firstly Totterdown Fields and later Wormholt and Old Oak  The First World War indirectly provided a new impetus  when the poor physical health and condition of many urban recruits to the British Army was noted with alarm  In           of conscripts were unfit to serve  This led to a campaign known as Homes fit for heroes and in      the Government first compelled councils to provide housing  helping them to do so through the provision of subsidies  under the Housing Act                   Public housing projects were tried out in some European countries and the United States in the     s  but only became widespread globally after the Second World War

Minha Casa Minha Vida   My House  My Life    the Brazilian federal government s social housing program  was launched in March      with a budget of R         billion  US         billion  to build one million homes              The second stage of the program  included within the government Growth Acceleration Program  PAC  Programa de Acelera  o do Crescimento  was announced in March                   This stage foresaw the construction of a further two million homes 
All funds for Minha Casa Minha Vida properties were provided by the Brazilian public bank  Caixa Econ mica Federal              The bank financed development and provided mortgages for qualifying families 
As of September               update           million homes were built and distributed to the population  The project has been criticized for its placement and quality of the houses              Houses are built far from the city centre to reduce housing costs which consequently reduces access to the labor market  a study of randomly selected houses of the MCMV project in Rio de Janeiro showed a reduced likelihood of being formally employed in job seekers but income was not affected in those who were already employed             
In addition to addressing the housing deficit  Minha Casa Minha Vida sought to stimulate the economy by generating employment in the construction sector  According to the Brazilian Chamber of Construction Industry  CBIC   the program created millions of jobs  directly and indirectly  contributing to the country s economic growth during its initial phases  However  critics argue that the program s focus on mass production sometimes overlooked the importance of integrating new housing developments with adequate infrastructure  such as schools  healthcare facilities  and transportation networks  which are essential for fostering sustainable urban development

In Canada  public housing is usually a block of purpose built subsidized housing operated by a government agency  often simply referred to as community housing  with easier to manage townhouses  Many cities in Canada still maintain large high rise clustered developments in working class neighborhoods  a system that has fallen out of favour in both the United States and the United Kingdom  However  many public housing corporations still offer a variety of buildings and communities ranging from individual houses to townhouse communities and mid rise and high rise apartments in both working class and middle class neighborhoods that house a significant number of low income Canadians 
Following the decentralisation of public housing to local municipalities  Social Housing Services Corporation  SHSC  was created in the Province of Ontario in      to provide group services for social housing providers  public housing  non profit housing and co operative housing   It is a non profit corporation which provides Ontario housing providers and service managers with bulk purchasing  insurance  investment and information services that add significant value to their operations 
Recently      when       there has been a move toward the integration of public housing with market housing and other uses  Revitalization plans for properties such as in the notorious Downtown Eastside of Vancouver  Regent Park  in Toronto  and Rochester Heights in Ottawa  aim to provide better accommodations for low income residents  and connect them to the greater community  The aim of the reconstruction plans are often to better integrate it into the traditional grid of streets  improve leisure and cultural amenities  However  the residents of these communities often have had little effective input in the plans and have had mixed reactions to the construction 
In       Vancouver  long considered one of the least affordable cities in the world              changed the definition of social housing to mean rental housing in which a minimum of    percent of dwelling units are occupied by households that cannot pay market rents  due to lack of income             

Mexico edit

At the end of the Second World War  enriched by US investments and an oil boom  Mexico had its first demographic boom  in which the primary destination for rural immigrants was Mexico City  Mario Pani Darqui  a famous architect at time  was charged to build its first large scale public housing project  Built for the Direcci n de Pensiones Civiles y Retiro  the National Pensions office  today ISSSTE   the Centro Urbano  or Multifamiliar  Presidente Alem n           in the Colonia del Valle and the Centro Urbano  or Multifamiliar  Benito Ju rez           in the Colonia Roma  introduced formal ideas from Le Corbusier s Ville Radieuse into the urban fabric 
His later project  the Conjunto Urbano Tlatelolco Nonoalco built in          was meant to develop one of the poorest parts of the city  Santiago Tlatelolco  which was becoming a slum  Unfortunately  after a while  instead of giving the residences to the previous residents of Tlatelolco  corruption took place and most of the dwellings were handed to state employees 
During the earthquake of       both the Benito Ju rez and Nonoalco Tlaltelolco complexes suffered major damage  with some buildings collapsing  Today most of the Multifamiliar Benito Ju rez has been demolished 
Mexico has had experience with housing projects since Porfirio D az s regime                         One of those still remains and is the Barrio of Loreto in San  ngel   lvaro Obreg n in Mexico City  that was a project for a paper factory workers 
Another notable public housing project is the Conjunto Habitacional Independencia  located near Tizap n neighborhood  on most of the land that once was the Matsumoto Hacienda  The project was developed during Adolfo L pez Mateos presidential period  started in      and completed in       The development included an integral design considering landscaping  and premises that could provide basic services to the residents  a clinic  a sports complex  theater  movie theater  a supermarket  a kindergarten  three elementary schools  among others  It functioned as public housing until       when the houses and apartments were sold to the residents 

Puerto Rico edit 
Main article  Public housing in Puerto Rico
Neighbourhoods in Puerto Rico are often divided into three types  barrio  urbanizaci n  urbanisation  and residencial p blico  public housing               An urbanizaci n is a type of housing where land is developed into lots  often by a private developer  and where single family homes are built 
More recently  non single family units  such as condominiums and townhouses are being built which also fall into this category               In Puerto Rico  a condominium is a housing unit located in a high rise building  It is popularly called an apartamento  English   apartment    whether or not its resident owns the unit or lives in it as a renter  
Public housing  on the other hand  are housing units built with government funding  primarily through programs of the US Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  and the US Department of Agriculture  USDA               These have traditionally been multi family dwellings in housing complexes called a Barriada or a Caser o  and more recently a Residencial Publico   where all exterior grounds are shared areas 
Increasingly  however  public housing developments are being built that consist of other than the traditional multi family dwellings with all exterior grounds consisting of shared outside area  for example  public housing may consist of single family garden apartments units  Finally  a home that is located in neither an urbanizacion nor of a public housing development is said to be located in  and to be a part of  a barrio             
In Puerto Rico  a barrio also has a second and very different meaning official meaning  the geographical area into which a municipios is divided for official administrative purposes  In this sense  urbanizaciones as well as public housing developments  as well as one or several barrios in the popular sense  may be located in one of these     official geographic areas

Main article  Subsidized housing in the United States
The    story John F  Hylan Houses in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn  New York City 
The Ramona Gardens projects in Los Angeles  California 
In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries  government involvement in housing for the poor was chiefly in the introduction of building standards  Atlanta  Georgia s Techwood Homes  dedicated in       was the nation s first public housing project              Most housing communities were developed from the     s onward and initial public housing was largely slum clearance  with the requirement insisted upon by private builders that for every unit of public housing constructed  a unit of private housing would be demolished 
This also eased concerns of the establishment by eliminating or altering neighborhoods commonly considered a source of disease  and reflected progressive era sanitation initiatives  Moreover  public housing  along with the Federal Highway Program  demolished the older  substandard housing of communities of color across the United States 
However  the advent of makeshift tent communities during the Great Depression caused concern in the Administration  The Federal public housing program was created by the      Act  in which operations were  sustained primarily by tenant rents               As a result  public housing in its earliest decades was usually much more working class and middle class and white than it was by the     s  Many Americans associate large  multi story towers with public housing  but early projects were actually low rise  though Le Corbusier superblocks caught on before World War II 
A unique US public housing initiative was the development of subsidized middle class housing during the late New Deal           under the auspices of the Mutual Ownership Defense Housing Division of the Federal Works Agency under the direction of Colonel Lawrence Westbrook  These eight projects were purchased by the residents after the Second World War and as of      seven of the projects continue to operate as mutual housing corporations owned by their residents  These projects are among the very few definitive success stories in the history of the US public housing effort 
Public housing was only built with the blessing of the local government  and projects were almost never built on suburban greenfields  but through regeneration of older neighborhoods  The destruction of tenements and eviction of their low income residents consistently created problems in nearby neighborhoods with  soft  real estate markets 
Initiatives in housing policy were implemented in ways that perpetuated stigma against African Americans  Initially  public housing was intended to be built widespread  and as such be mixed income  but lobbyists who did not want to see public housing decrease their housing values blocked such housing from going up              These early NIMBY movements limited where public housing was concentrated  predominantly in low income neighborhoods  With the introduction of suburbs and expansion of choices for the white working class  the demographics of public housing changed from more class and racially integrated to predominantly impoverished  single parent  welfare  and people of color              This led to stigmatization of public housing  through pushing the narrative that people living in public housing were  Welfare Queens   or otherwise living in a state of abject poverty and terrible conditions              These demographic changes also decreased support for housing  leading to the government cutting funding for the program              Because of funding cuts and mismanagement by public housing authorities  public housing started to reflect modern associated characteristics of  soul crushing  buildings or  humanitarian disasters  to which the      HOPE VI project s response was demolition             
The federal Housing and Urban Development  HUD  department s      HOPE VI program addressed concerns of distressed properties and blighted superblocks with revitalization and funding projects for the renewal of public housing to decrease its density and allow for tenants with mixed income levels                          The project paired together the demolition of public housing stock and private development  leading to the displacement of many residents              One of the biggest components of this was the repealing of the  one for one  replacement rule  which said that for every unit of housing destroyed a new one must be built              HOPE VI s reasoning for repealing this policy was that it was hindering the construction of new  mixed income units  since the public housing buildings were so massive  those behind HOPE VI believed that trying to match the  one for one  rule would make building new housing extremely difficult              The long term effect of this was that more housing was demolished than built  and many people were displaced without being guaranteed a spot in the new housing that would get built  This led to the widespread displacement and reshuffling of public house residents  namely  low income  Black  single parent families              Narratives that public housing projects were full of crime  drugs  and poverty were used to further justify demolition and destruction of public housing  Such associations between crime  surveillance and policing  and the projects increased in      
Projects continue to have a reputation for violence  drug use  and prostitution  especially in New Orleans  Washington  D C  
Chicago and Detroit  leading to the passage of a      federal  one strike you re out  law  enabling the eviction of tenants convicted of crimes  especially drug related  or merely as a result of being tried for some crimes              Specifically  the Clinton era established  through HUD  the Public Housing Drug Elimination Program  which led to the cracking down of public housing  leading to more policing and surveillance for low income people of color             

Turn to subsidized housing edit 
In the   s and   s  the popularization of neoliberalism caused a turn away from public sector solutions towards private or public private solutions  This  in conjunction with the narrative of public housing being obsolete  led to both the turn away from public housing and towards subsidized housing solutions 
Houses  apartments or other residential units are usually subsidized on a rent geared to income  RGI  basis  Some communities have now embraced a mixed income  with both assisted and market rents  when allocating homes as they become available 
A significant change in the program took place in       with the passage of the Brooke Amendment  Rents now became set at     of a tenant s income with the result that the program began serving the  poorest tenants  
Other attempts to solve these problems include the                  Section   Housing Program  which encourages the private sector to construct affordable homes  and subsidized public housing   This assistance can be  project based   subsidizing properties  or  tenant based   which provides tenants with a voucher  accepted by some landlords  This policy option represented a turn away from the public sector policy of public housing  instead turning towards the private market to address housing needs  The program  in conjunction with HOPE VI  was intended to create income integrated communities  by giving residents the choice of where to move              However  the housing voucher program has historically had long wait times and limited choice on where one can actually move              Additionally  it was found that many people of color did not want to move away from their families  communities  and systems of support  as well as experiencing stigma and difficulties with landlords  safety  or expenses              This leads to the program doing little to actually create a more racially integrated city demographics  mostly reproducing inequality while simultaneously not having enough valid housing units for the long list of applicants

The public owned housing system was established when the Chinese Communist Party started a planned economy in the     s as part of its Great Leap Forward  The system was funded by the central government s budget and were administered and distributed by state owned enterprises  The occupants of the public housing were usually the employees of the enterprises and their family  who were subject to pay rent at a very low price  The size and the type of room the households received were dependent on their job title or administrative level  The central government found it difficult to upkeep the public housing due to the low rent it received  the distribution policy that was intended to be  equalitarianism  was actually corrupt             
The Chinese government commercialized the housing market after the economic reform started in      by Deng Xiaoping  The public houses that were constructed before that the economic reforms were categorized as  Old Public Houses   Chinese             Old Public Houses  were  in principle  not supposed to be privately sold  but the household could sell it after purchasing the ownership of the building  not the property   and such transactions were subject to be review by local housing authorities and the State owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission              However  an informal filing system and unclear policies resulted in problems of corruption and family dispute                         
The concept of the low cost rental housing can be traced to a      policy statement      clarification needed      but did not truly take off until      due to limited funding and administrative problems  The provision of more affordable housing is one of the key components of China s Twelfth Five year Plan  which targets the construction of    million homes by       That program s costs will be split between the private and public sector and are estimated at five trillion yuan by China International Capital Corporation             

Hong Kong edit

In Hong Kong  public housing is one of the major housing policies of the government  Nearly half of Hong Kong s          million population lives in public housing              The two main public housing providers are the Housing Authority and the Housing Society 
The most common types of public housing in Hong Kong are public rental housing  PRH  and subsidised sale flats produced under the Home Ownership Scheme  HOS   In       approximately    per cent of Hong Kong households lived in PRH flats while    per cent resided in subsidised sale flats  of all types              
The origin of large scale public housing in Hong Kong can be traced to the resettlement programme launched by the Hong Kong government in the     s in response to the increasing prevalence of squatter settlements  which emerged as a result of a great influx of refugees following the Communist revolution in China  The squatter villages were considered unsafe as they were susceptible to disastrous fires  including a      blaze in Shek Kip Mei that rendered over        people homeless overnight             
Large scale resettlement estates were built throughout the     s and     s  In       the government of Sir Murray MacLehose launched the Ten Year Housing Programme  which aimed to provide the entire population with  satisfactory housing  within a decade  The government also launched the Home Ownership Scheme  HOS  in      to enable lower income households to purchase flats             
Many public housing estates were built as part of new town development programmes  During the     s  most of the earliest resettlement estates  from the     s and early     s  were also rebuilt to modern standards  Public housing remains a key concern of the Hong Kong Government  which plans to construct some         units between      and

Danchi      literally  group land   is the Japanese word for a large cluster of apartment buildings or houses of a particular style and design  typically built as public housing by government authorities 
The Japan Housing Corporation  JHC   now known as the Urban Renaissance Agency  UR   was founded in       During the     s      s  and     s  the JHC built many danchi in suburban areas to offset the increasing housing demand during the post World War II economic boom              It introduced the Japanese salaryman to a life around the nuclear family in contrast with the multi generation homes before the war             
The rent payment for a danchi is much cheaper than that of an apartment or a mortgage  but for a public danchi the prospective tenant must usually participate in a lottery to be assigned an open apartment  Residents in UR danchi do not have to pay key money or contract renewal fees  making the residences cheaper than comparable housing even if the monthly rents are equivalent

Minglun Social housing located in Taipei 
After Kuomintang s retreat to Taiwan  Taiwan experienced a population surge and  beginning in the     s  faced issues with ageing military dependents  village  To address these housing needs  the government constructed various types of public housing projects across the country  Starting in       approximately         housing units were built  providing accommodation for around      million people              These projects were largely managed by specialised local government agencies  such as the National Housing Bureau              Taiwan s public housing is generally categorized into three types 

Rebuilt Military Dependent Villages  These communities were primarily named with the suffix  New Village        e g   Matsu New Village  and aimed at replacing deteriorating military housing 
Housing for Civil Servants and their Families  These communities served public employees and their families 
Public Housing for Private Purchase  A limited number of units were made available for public purchase by private citizens 
In the late     s  due to an oversupply of housing units in the private market  the government decided to halt large scale public housing projects  except for the continued redevelopment of military dependent villages  This shift aimed to prevent issues like collusion between officials and developers  as well as competition with private developers             
Since the     s  with real estate speculation driving urban housing prices up  the government has focused on new types of public housing initiatives  These include affordable housing units for sale through public private partnerships and social housing projects intended for rental  such as Taiwan s  Social Housing         initiative  However  there have been recurring concerns about potential collusion between government officials and developers in these new projects

The EU was moving to support more affordable  energy efficient and accessible housing with the financial contribution of the CEB and of the EIB through its European Fund for Strategic Investments  Public funding was planned to be directed primarily on affordable housing and secondly in the education and lifelong learning  health and long term care sectors             
In Europe  there is a significant shortage of investment in social housing and a pressing need to renovate existing units      when       Annual investment in housing is predicted at     billion for new building and energy efficiency modifications  The projections do not include the refugee situation caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine                                     

Austria edit 
Main article  Gemeindebau
Karl Marx Hof  a Gemeindebau constructed during the Red Vienna period in D bling  Vienna        
Public housing was an important issue right from the foundation of the Republic of German Austria in       The population was faced with a great deal of uncertainty particularly as regards food and fuel  This led to a significant number of less affluent people to move to the periphery of towns  often building makeshift homes to be closer to where they could grow food  They were called Siedler   settlers    As the political situation became stabilised with foundation of the First Austrian Republic in September       the Siedler movement started creating formal organizations like the Austrian Association for Settlements and Small Gardens              The electoral victory of the Social Democratic Party of Austria in the elections for the Viennese Gemeinderat  city parliament  gave rise to Red Vienna  Part of their programme was the provision of decent homes for the Viennese working class who made up the core of their supporters  Hence the German word Gemeindebau  plural  Gemeindebauten  for  municipality building   In Austria  it refers to residential buildings erected by a municipality  usually to provide public housing   These have been an important part of the architecture and culture of Vienna since the     s 

Belgium edit 
Social housing is a responsibility of the regions in Belgium  The regions do not directly own the houses  semi private social housing corporations do  The government regulates and mostly finances this corporations  Below a certain income limit  people are eligible for social housing  Because there is a major shortage of social housing in Belgium  other priority conditions are often imposed  such as having children to care for              Social housing accounts for approximately      of the Belgian housing market  This is much lower than neighbouring countries such as the Netherlands and France  As of      Flanders  Wallonia and Brussels are responsible for         social houses          people are on the waiting list  For the people on the waiting list there are other possibilities such as subsidies and sociale rental agencies in Flanders             

Denmark edit 
In Denmark  public housing is called alment boligbyggeri and is owned and administered by approximately     self governing  democratic and non profit organizations by and for the tenants themselves  Many of the public housing organizations in Denmark are rooted in the early history of the labor unions and currently forms about     of the total housing stock with about       departments countrywide  A membership of a housing organization is usually required to obtain a rental and they are granted with regard to length of membership                         
Although the buildings are owned and administered by self governing and economically independent organizations  the State of Denmark is strongly regulating public housing in the country  By law  the municipalities have access to     of the rentals  usually reserving them for the poor  the unemployed  the disabled or mentally ill or any other group dependent on social benefits from the municipality  Over the years  these regulations have created many  vulnerable residential areas  within the country  Danish public housing has never had any income restrictions  but in recent years new state regulations has made it mandatory for several of them to favor fully employed renters and disfavor unemployed or part time employed people  This is a relatively new effort by the state to counter the ghettoisation  which is now an officially recognized problem countrywide                         
As in Sweden  state and municipal policies carried out throughout the first decade of the   st century  has led to an increased privatization of public housing  In many areas  residents have been offered to buy their own flats  thereby effectively changing the status of the property  The privatization of public housing was initiated as part of an ideological program by the right wing governments of the early   st century and was launched a few years after the closure of the former Ministry of Housing Affairs in                   The former ministry was re opened as Ministry of Housing  Urban and Rural Affairs in October       when a new coalition government led by social democrats was formed                         

Finland edit 
The right to housing is guaranteed in the Finnish constitution  and public housing in Finland is largely funded through loans which are subsidized and guaranteed by the government  Roughly one third of Finland s housing stock has been built this way              Rents for public housing apartments in Finland are typically significantly lower than market rate housing  Eligibility to live in public housing in Finland is based on a need based evaluation  and those with very low incomes and those who are experiencing homelessness are given priority             A public housing apartment building at the Sandelsinkatu street in Siilinj rvi  Finland
The earliest public housing project in Finland was in Helsinki  In       four wooden houses designed by the architect A  Nyberg were built on Kirstinkuja  formerly Kristiinankatu  for the city s workers  The residents were mainly working class families with several children  The apartments had an average of five people per room  sometimes up to eight  The tiny apartments were equipped with running water  a pantry and an attic cupboard  Every apartment had its own toilet in the cellar  Electric lighting was installed in      
The homes and lives of worker families in Helsinki from      to      are presented in a museum near the Linnanm ki amusement park 
In       Helsinki launched its Housing First policy  with the goal of ending homelessness by prioritizing unconditional housing              With municipal  state  and NGO support  and coupled with health and medical services  the program reduced homelessness by     between      and                  

France edit 
Main articles  Public housing in France and HLM
Public housing of the rue Jean Fautrier in the   th arrondissement of Paris 
After World War II  the population increased at a rate previously unknown  the rural exodus increased  while war damage had reduced the number of houses in many cities  Rental prices dramatically rose  and the government made a law in      to block them  effectively ending the economic benefits of housing investment  Rents were gradually deregulated until debate in the     s led to the current rental law of      theoretically balancing landlord and tenant relations  However  there was a major homelessness crisis in the winter of        and the necessary laws were gradually mobilized producing high levels of construction almost continuously from the     s  Social landlords were a major source of expertise as well as construction actors with links to national and local bodies              The construction industry was at the time inadequate so political support was needed 
It is incorrect to refer to French social housing as public housing  The origins of French social housing lie in the private sector  with the first State aid provided to limited profit companies by the loi Siegfried in       The originally socialist idea was promoted by some French employers in the  nd half of the   th century  Public housing companies followed before World War I              There are still different social housing movements  public  private and some cooperative   Social landlord organizations all have similar regulation and similar access to government loans but there are significant differences             
The government launched a series of major construction plans  including the creation of new towns  villes nouvelles  and new suburbs with HLM  Habitation   Loyer Mod r    low rent housing    The state had the funds and the legal means to acquire the land and could provide some advantages to the companies that then built its huge housing complexes of hundreds of apartments  Quality was also effectively regulated  resulting in decent or even top quality housing for the standard of the     s and     s  The construction of HLMs were subject to much political debate  Much smaller developments are now the norm  This housing is now generally referred to as l habitat social  a slightly wider sphere than just housing 
France still retains this system  a recent law making it an obligation for every town to have at least     HLM  Nowadays HLM represents roughly half of the rental market      in                    Social housing is not all for disadvantaged people who are just one of the target groups  Part of the funding can be provided by employer employee groups to provide housing for local employees  The     target can include intermediate housing for better off groups  although its object is to produce social mix              Gentrification and the very basis of social housing allocation are divisive issues as well as the extent of local control of housing              This housing has always been a multi actor activity and recent local government reorganization continues to change the political landscape 
While they succeeded in giving lower income families a place to live in the drive to provide popular housing  this system also led to the creation of suburban ghettos  with a problem of disrepair  There has been a long term problem of gradual impoverishment of social tenants             There  deprived strata of the population  mostly of immigrant origin and suffering massive under employment  might in the past have been left to simmer away from the more affluent urban centres  sometimes becoming rife with social tensions and violence  This affects a minority of social housing but has a high profile and still produces serious tension 
Tackling this problem at its roots is all but simple  and social mix policies can break up populations seen as difficult by redevelopment  This has not had the hoped for results  It has also been sought to resolve the problem of access to the system by disadvantaged people by a new system where certain groups can apply to court to be housed if refused  the  right to housing    This tends to intensify the controversy over social housing allocation  who should be housed               The French tradition of  universal  social housing allocation   housing for everyone is called into question by EU competition law restricting subsidy except for the disadvantaged  In any event  the system is certainly effective in producing construction  although not with the excesses seen in the recent credit crunch elsewhere      citation needed

Spaniards  reluctance to home rental  and government spending cuts in the     s  reduced rented public housing in Spain to a minimum  Rented public houses were relatively common in the Franco era            With the advent of democracy and the      Constitution  the right to housing became guaranteed  and the management of social housing depended mostly on the autonomous regions               This resulted in a wide variety of laws  which make the issue highly dependent on the region 
In spite of this  a scheme for viviendas de protecci n oficial  VPO  has been widely used  consisting of local councils allowing for building contractors and developers to build in public sites or with public loans on condition that a certain percentage of apartments remain subsidized and under control of the local authorities  This is known as VPO de promoci n privada   privately developed    as opposed to the VPO de promoci n p blica   publicly developed    in which the whole property is owned and managed by a government authority  Publicly developed housing is made almost exclusively for owner occupation  not rent  and made up     of the housing stock in

In the United Kingdom public housing is often referred to by the British public as  council housing  and  council estates   based on the historical role of district and borough councils in running public housing  Mass council house building began in about      in order to replace older and dilapidated properties              This followed the       Addison  Act and the provision of central state subsidies  some local authority or municipal housing was provided before                   
Housing was a major policy area under Wilson s Labour government       to       with an accelerated pace of new building  as there was still a great deal of unfit housing needing replacement  Tower blocks  first built in the     s  featured prominently in this era  The proportion of council housing rose from     to     of the nation s housing total               while the number of council homes built increased steadily  from         in      to         in      and to         in           citation needed     
Allowing for demolitions           million new homes were built between      and                    To encourage home ownership  the government introduced the Option Mortgage Scheme         which made low income house buyers eligible for subsidies  equivalent to tax relief on mortgage interest payments                This scheme had the effect of reducing housing costs for buyers on low incomes              
Since the     s  non profit housing associations have been operating an increasing share of social housing properties in the United Kingdom   From      they have also been known as Registered Social Landlords  RSLs   and public housing has been referred to as  social housing  to encompass both councils and RSLs   Despite being non profit based  RSLs generally charge higher rents than councils   However  the Westminster Government introduced a  rent re structuring  policy for housing associations in England in       which aimed to bring council and RSL rents into line in England by                    Local planning departments may require private sector developers to offer  affordable housing  as a condition of planning permission  section     agreement    This accounts for another     m of Government funding each year for tenants in part of the United Kingdom  As of       Housing Associations are now also referred to as  Private Registered Providers of Social Housing   PRPs               

    s council housing in Haringey  North London 
Local authorities have been discouraged from building council housing since      following the election of Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher as prime minister   The Parker Morris standard was abolished for those that were built  resulting in smaller room sizes and fewer facilities  The Right to Buy was introduced  resulting in the move of some of the best stock from public tenanted to private owner occupation      citation needed     
Since the year        choice based lettings   CBL               have been introduced to help ensure social housing was occupied speedily as tenants moved  This can still favour the local over the non local prospective tenant   In a number of local authority areas  due to the shortage of council housing  three out of four properties may be designated for priority cases  those living in poor overcrowded conditions  with medical or welfare needs  or needing family support  or homeless applicants in order to meet the councils  legal obligations to rehouse people in need   The percentage of properties set aside for vulnerable groups will vary dependent on the demand for council housing in the area   All local authorities have a Housing Strategy to ensure that council houses are let fairly and fulfil the council s legal obligations  deal with people in need  and contribute to sustainability of housing estates  neighbourhood regeneration  and social inclusion              
The           Labour Government wished to move council housing away from local authority management   At first  this was through Large Scale Voluntary Transfers  LSVT  of stock from councils to Housing Associations  HAs    Not all council property could be transferred  as in some local authorities  their housing stock was in poor condition and had a capital value less than the remaining debts from construction costs in effect  the council stock was in negative equity               In some local authority areas  the tenants rejected the transfer option              
The Labour Government introduced a  third way   the Arms Length Management Organisation  ALMO   where the housing stock stays with the Local Authority but is managed by a not for profit organisation at arm s length from the Local Authority   It also introduced the Decent Homes programme  a capital fund to bring social housing up to a modern physical standard   To use this fund  the manager  whether ALMO or HA  had to achieve a   or   star rating from its inspection by the Audit Commission               This was intended to drive up management standards   Council landlords cannot access this funding  another incentive to transfer management of council housing to an ALMO or HA 
Governments since the early     s have also encouraged  mixed tenure  in regeneration areas and on  new build  housing estates  offering a range of ownership and rental options  with a view to engineering social harmony through including  social housing  and  affordable housing  options  A recent research report              has argued that the evidence base for tenure mixing remains thin  Social housing occupants may be stigmatised and forced to use a poor door that is separate and less convenient than the door the unsubsidised occupants use and social housing may be less desirably situated

Public housing in Australia  also referred to as  housing commission   is managed by the states  with funding provided by both the state and federal governments  Policies vary by state  but generally  eligibility is based on personal or household income  asset limits and residency requirements  The allocation of public housing is typically done through a priority system where the applicants in the greatest need are housed first 
There are over         public housing dwellings in Australia  consisting of low density housing on master planned estates located in suburban areas  and also inner city high rise apartments in Melbourne and Sydney 
In recent decades  rooming and relief housing for the homeless have both been privatised  and in recent years this housing has been sold off to avoid maintenance costs and capitalise on sales in Australia s booming property market  In Melbourne  public housing stocks have been in decline for some time  sparking the      Bendigo Street housing dispute in which homeless people are being housed by the community campaign in homes left empty by the state government 
In       a study by the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute found an interesting effect of providing public housing to those living in poverty and who are at risk of losing their homes  When poor Western Australians were granted access to public housing  they began to rely on the region s healthcare system less  with immense savings for Western Australia  The reduction in the stress on hospitals  emergency rooms  and other forms of medical care projected to over     million saved for Western Australia per annum

The Workers  Dwellings Act of      resulted in the New Zealand Government commissioning the building of     houses              
In      the First Labour Government launched a major public housing system it became known as  state housing  for citizens unable to afford private rents  Most state housing built between      and the mid     s consisted of detached two to three bedroom cottage style houses  only      of state houses in      formed part of apartment blocks  all of them in Auckland or in greater Wellington  After World War II ended in       local authorities also started providing social housing  mainly for elderly people with low incomes
