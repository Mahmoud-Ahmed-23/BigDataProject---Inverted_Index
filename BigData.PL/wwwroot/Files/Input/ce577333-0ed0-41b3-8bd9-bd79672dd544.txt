							The Legislative Reform Committee gave the go ahead for the suggested Suez Canal Project regulatory legal frame work  according to Hani Sarie Eldin  Chairman of Sarie   Eldin  amp  Partners         Legal Advisors 
The Suez Canal Project is considered an Economic Zone of a Special Nature  according to Sarie Eldin  a participant in the winning coalition which put together the general Suez Canal Corridor Development Project plan 
In an interview with Daily News Egypt  Sarie Eldin said it was agreed on proposing a draft law of amendments on the law for Economic Zones of a Special Nature          It will be a legislative framework for investing in the Suez Canal  converting the area into an economic authority and holding capabilities equivalent to ministries  governorates  and authorities 
 The authority will literally be a single window   Sarie Eldin said   The Suez Canal Corridor is the biggest national project for public and private investments  Its success in attracting real investments is a quantum leap for the Canal area  putting it on map of international investments  
Sarie Eldin thinks Egypt s legislative environment should witness comprehensive development to revive trust in the Egyptian economy and attract investments  In his view  this is the main entrance of employment  growth and economic recovery

What happened to the law of regulating investment in the Suez Canal area 
It was agreed upon that a draft law of amendments on the Economic Zones of a Special Nature law          to be the legal and regulatory framework proposed to organise investing in area of Suez Canal  which is one of the best investment legislations  We proposed  as legal group works with Suez Canal Authority  major amendments on the law  The Legislative Reform Committee has approved the amendments and passed them to the Cabinet to approve them before President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi issues it  The most important amendment is allowing the economic authority of Suez Canal area to launch a major development company for the area  and own it completely or through cooperation with the private sector  or to leave it completely to the private sector to implement infrastructure projects 
The Suez Canal area will convert into an economic authority and will work as single window in completing all the investors  procedures away from all ruling legislations of economic activity in Egypt and from dealing with any governmental body  The authority will have all the capacities of ministries  governorates and authorities  This amendment cancels the requirement of compelling the authority to own at least     of the major development company  the reason that deactivated the development of the economic zone in the Northwest Gulf of Suez  The authority could not fund its share in the major development company due to the lack of governmental support  The second amendment allows more flexibility in forming a board of directors of the economic authority by all the concerned parties  away from governmental bureaucracy  and no changes on tax system  to be as it is      gains tax for companies and    tax on the earning 
When do you expect the law to be issued 
It was suggested the law will be issued before the Economic Summit in Sharm El Sheikh  but it seems that it will be delayed until after the summit  due to the sequence and number of events  However  it will not take days after finishing the Economic Summit activities to speed up implementation of the needed projects  The investments will not begin except after the formation of the board of directors of the economic authority and the setting of the executive regulations 
The Suez Canal Corridor project is the second biggest project in Egypt after the project of digging the new canal and widening the old one  The project targets public and private investments as well  its success in attracting real investments will result in a developmental quantum leap for the Suez Canal region  as well as the provision of plenty of vacancies to limit unemployment rates that annually increase accompanied by weak reforms in the ailing economy due to political pressure and security turmoil during the last four years 
How can we avoid the fate of the Economic Zone in Northwest Gulf of Suez and the halt of its investments  
The Economic Zone in the Northwest Gulf of Suez is a special case  The end of its investments and its developmentare not due to the legislation  but because of lack of sufficient governmental funds for the start up  in addition to obligating the board of directors to launch a major developmental company and owning at least     of it without providing fund  Moreover  the land of the Economic Zone was disputed 
Failure is not an option in this period  I expect the project to succeed due to the seriousness of the present political regime  and because the regime bargains for it  in addition to the executive procedures taken to make it succeed  The fund is available  the will of investment exists and the regime s support is strong  so why would it not succeed  This is especially as we work on putting a special legislative framework for investing in the area that corrects the past mistakes 
With the completion of the general plan of the area  what will you propose to the investors of the Economic Summit 
We will present in front of the Economic Summit only projects of infrastructure  roads  sewage  water and power plants  and alternative energy  besides announcing section partitioning of the area  Investors who are willing and interested in investing in the area will be invited to determine the projects matching the nature of their businesses  We will not propose specialised investment projects to investors during the summit  what we will propose are only preliminary preparation and development projects 
How do you view the latest governmental amendments on laws of investment 
The amendments are  good  and the government believes they constitute major developments  They recognise the presence of mistakes in current legislations and began amending and reforming them in a way that improve the investment environment and correct all the accumulated mistakes in the environment of doing business  However  legislation alone is not enough to achieve reform  but speeding up implementation is very necessary  in addition to evaluating results  Egypt is not suffering from lack of legislations  but suffering from deficiency in applying the available legislations  The last amendments  especially with respect to giving the investor the minimum level of security regarding crime offences in case a mistake occurs by the investor s company  are very necessary amendments  In addition  regulating and speeding up procedures of entering the market and exiting it will reassure the investor  besides forming active and expeditious committees to settle investment disputes 
 
Are the recent economic reform procedures sufficient for a growth of    and for the attraction of direct investments of    bn annually  
The Egyptian market is able to attract foreign investments that exceed    bn per year provided the continuance of the Egyptian government to reform  follow up with its implementation  evaluate the results and treat inefficiency  Egypt is a large consuming market that has    million consumers in which the demand is growing on about     billion consumers as per the commercial agreements  Continuing with the administrative reform and fighting corruption and bureaucracy enhances the financial reform recently done by the government 
With the statements of officials the roof of ambitions went up so  what do you believe the Economic Summit will come up with 
The Economic Summit must be put in its proper place  It is nothing but a step and a message indicating that the government is serious about reforming the structure of the economy which has been deteriorating for about four years  This would happen through legislative and financial reform that would cut deficit and debt  increasing operating rates  putting a fair exchange rate as well as eliminating the parallel market  The summit is the gate for the government to present its plan and the most important is the steps following what will be agreed upon in the summit as well as forming follow up committees and mechanisms that guarantee implementing those agreements are expected to be signed at the summit 
What about the impressions of Sarie Eldin clients on the investment climate in Egypt 
All investors are currently alerted to the situation in Egypt  They need a clear declaration of taxes and energy policy that the government has initiated and that needs to be completed   In addition  the government has declared its economic orientations during the next stage  but unfortunately this matter needs a lot of work that no one seems to be taking seriously  I believe that the Dispute Settlement Committee was proven effective in resolving the problems raised during the last period  However  a greater activation of the role of such committees and a prompt display to the competent ministerial committees is required  as it       s a mechanism proved successful 
So how can the government terminate those trade disputes forever  
What is more important than settling conflicts is putting limits to the governmental policies and procedures  in addition to the highly productive legislations for those trade disputes including the territorial pricing policies  the means of raising projects and the law that protects decision makers  The criminal law should no longer be politicised in Egypt  for instance an investor or an official should not be interrogated by criminal law due to an administrative error  I wish that the government realises its aspiration to settle     of the investment disputes before the Economic Summit to attract investments for economy recovery 
The government has already settled the dispute of the Emirati Group Al Futtaim         how would that affect the investment climate and the business environment 
Improving the business environment will require the settlement of all investment and trade disputes to reassure investors  attract new investments and allow existing investments to expand  Slowing the pace of litigation and enforcement of contracts delays the entry of investments  raises unemployment and disrupt the recovery of economy  I expect Al Futtaim to double their investments in Egypt by completing the implementation of the Cairo Festival City project  which include at least EG   bn over three years  The total value of the project is EGP   bn and the company did not invest a quarter of them so far 
The Supreme Constitutional Court declared the parliamentary election law unconstitutional  Will this negatively affect the conference and the investment climate 
I think that the sentence will not negatively affect the investment climate in Egypt  and will not disrupt the flow of any immigrant capital looking for attractive opportunities  The invalidity of this law has protected the country from a worse position if it came after the parliament  I believe that if the presidential office amended the law  with a specific time frame that would be both a local and an international message to reassure that the political process did not deviate and that it is on the right path according to the map of the future 
After the amendment of the law it could be sued for unconstitutionality  How can we avoid such scenario  
I do not agree to the idea of immunisation of political rights law that organises the parliamentary elections against any attacks for protecting national security  but I demand the legislature to verify and fill all the gaps in front of any lawyer looking for fame who may sue any of the law articles after being amended  There       s a possibility of attacks on the new law after its amendment  but it is a weak possibility and its occurrence will drag the country to a state of instability and uncertainty about the future  so the legislature should be careful and pay attention to all that ayyad
