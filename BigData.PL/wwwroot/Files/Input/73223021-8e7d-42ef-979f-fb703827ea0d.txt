The Graduate Record Examinations  GRE  is a standardized test that is part of the admissions process for many graduate schools            in the United States and Canada            and a few other countries  The GRE is owned and administered by Educational Testing Service  ETS               The test was established in      by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching             
According to ETS  the GRE aims to measure verbal reasoning  quantitative reasoning  analytical writing  and critical thinking skills that have been acquired over a long period of learning  The content of the GRE consists of certain specific data analysis or interpretation  arguments and reasoning  algebra  geometry  arithmetic  and vocabulary sections  The GRE General Test is offered as a computer based exam administered at testing centers and institution owned or authorized by Prometric  In the graduate school admissions process  the level of emphasis that is placed upon GRE scores varies widely among schools and departments  The importance of a GRE score can range from being a mere admission formality to an important selection factor 
The GRE was significantly overhauled in August       resulting in an exam that is adaptive on a section by section basis  rather than question by question  so that the performance on the first verbal and math sections determines the difficulty of the second sections presented  excluding the experimental section   Overall  the test retained the sections and many of the question types from its predecessor  but the scoring scale was changed to a     to     scale  from a     to     scale              
The cost to take the test is US                 although ETS will reduce the fee under certain circumstances             It also provides financial aid to GRE applicants who prove economic hardship              ETS does not release scores that are older than five years  although graduate program policies on the acceptance of scores older than five years will vary 
Once almost universally required for admission to Ph D  science programs in the U S   its use for that purpose has fallen precipitously             


History edit 
The Graduate Record Examinations was  initiated in      as a joint experiment in higher education by the graduate school deans of four Ivy League universities and the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching              
The first universities to experiment with the test on their students were Harvard University  Yale University  Princeton University and Columbia University              The University of Wisconsin was the first public university to ask their students to take the test in                   It was first given to students at the University of Iowa in       where it was analyzed by psychologist Dewey Stuit              It was first taken by students at Texas Tech University in                   In       it was taken by students at Michigan State University  where it was analyzed by Paul Dressel              It was taken by over        students applying to     colleges in                  
 Until the Educational Testing Service was established in January        the Graduate Record Examination remained a project of the Carnegie Foundation              

     revision edit 
In       ETS announced plans to make significant changes in the format of the GRE  Planned changes for the revised GRE included a longer testing time  a departure from computer adaptive testing  a new grading scale  and an enhanced focus on reasoning skills and critical thinking for both the quantitative and qualitative sections             
On April          ETS announced the decision to cancel plans for revising the GRE              The announcement cited concerns over the ability to provide clear and equal access to the new test after the planned changes as an explanation for the cancellation  The ETS stated  however  that they did plan  to implement many of the planned test content improvements in the future   although specific details regarding those changes were not initially announced 
Changes to the GRE took effect on November          as ETS started to include new types of questions in the exam  The changes mostly centered on  fill in the blank  type answers for the mathematics section that requires the test taker to fill in the blank directly  without being able to choose from a multiple choice list of answers  ETS announced  plans to introduce two of these new types of questions in each quantitative section  while the majority of questions would be presented in the regular format             
Since January       the Reading Comprehension within the verbal sections has been reformatted  passages   line numbers will be replaced with highlighting when necessary in order to focus the test taker on specific information in the passage  to  help students more easily find the pertinent information in reading passages              
In December       ETS announced plans to move forward with significant revisions to the GRE in                   Changes include a new         scoring scale  the elimination of certain question types such as antonyms and analogies  the addition of an online calculator  and the elimination of the CAT format of question by question adjustment  in favor of a section by section adjustment             
On August          the Revised GRE General test replaced General GRE test  The revised GRE is said to be better by design and provides a better test taking experience  The new types of questions in the revised format are intended to test the skills needed in graduate and business schools programs              From July      onwards GRE announced an option for users to customize their scores called ScoreSelect             

Before October      edit 
The earliest versions of the GRE tested only for verbal and quantitative ability  For a number of years before October       the GRE had a separate Analytical Ability section which tested candidates on logical and analytical reasoning abilities  This section was replaced by the Analytical Writing Assessment                         

Structure edit 
The computer based GRE General Test consists of six sections  The first section is always the analytical writing section involving separately timed issue and argument tasks  The next five sections consist of two verbal reasoning sections  two quantitative reasoning sections  and either an experimental or research section  These five sections may occur in any order  The experimental section does not count towards the final score but is not distinguished from the scored sections  Unlike the computer adaptive test before August       the GRE General Test is a multistage test  where the examinee s performance on earlier sections determines the difficulty of subsequent sections  using a technique known as computer adaptive testing  This format allows the examined person to freely move back and forth between questions within each section  and the testing software allows the user to  mark  questions within each section for later review if time remains  The entire testing procedure lasts about   hours    minutes                          One minute breaks are offered after each section and a    minute break after the third section 
The paper based GRE General Test also consists of six sections  The analytical writing is split up into two sections  one section for each issue and argument task  The next four sections consist of two verbal and two quantitative sections in varying order  There is no experimental section on the paper based test 

Verbal section edit 
The computer based verbal sections assess reading comprehension  critical reasoning  and vocabulary usage  The verbal test is scored on a scale of          in   point increments   Before August       the scale was          in    point increments   In a typical examination  each verbal section consists of    questions to be completed in    minutes              Each verbal section consists of about   text completion    sentence equivalence  and    critical reading questions  The changes in      include a reduced emphasis on rote vocabulary knowledge and the elimination of antonyms and analogies  Text completion items have replaced sentence completions and new reading question types allowing for the selection of multiple answers were added 

Quantitative section edit 
The computer based quantitative sections assess knowledge and reasoning skills taught in most Mathematics and Statistics courses in secondary schools              The quantitative test is scored on a scale of          in   point increments  Before August      the scale was          in    point increments   In a typical examination  each quantitative section consists of    questions to be completed in    minutes              Each quantitative section consists of about   quantitative comparisons    problem solving items  and   data interpretation questions  The changes in      include the addition of numeric entry items requiring the examinee to fill in the blank and multiple choice items requiring the examinee to select multiple correct responses

Analytical writing section edit 
The analytical writing section consists of two different essays  an  issue task  and an  argument task    The writing section is graded on a scale of      in half point increments  The essays are written on a computer using a word processing program specifically designed by ETS  The program allows only basic computer functions and does not contain a spell checker or other advanced features  Each essay is scored by at least two readers on a six point holist scale   If the two scores are within one point  the average of the scores is taken   If the two scores differ by more than a point  a third reader examines the response 

Issue Task edit 
The test taker is given    minutes to write an essay about a selected topic              Issue topics are selected from a pool of questions  which the GRE Program has published in its entirety   Individuals preparing for the GRE may access the pool of tasks on the ETS website             

Argument Task edit 
The test taker will be given an argument  i e  a series of facts and considerations leading to a conclusion  and asked to write an essay that critiques the argument   Test takers are asked to consider the argument s logic and to make suggestions about how to improve the logic of the argument   Test takers are expected to address the logical flaws of the argument and not provide a personal opinion on the subject  The time allotted for this essay is    minutes              The Arguments are selected from a pool of topics  which the GRE Program has published in its entirety   Individuals preparing for the GRE may access the pool of tasks on the ETS website             

Experimental section edit 
The experimental section  which can be either verbal or quantitative  contains new questions ETS is considering for future use  Although the experimental section does not count towards the test taker s score  it is unidentified and appears identical to the scored sections  Because test takers have no definite way of knowing which section is experimental  it is typically advised that test takers try their best and be focused on every section  Sometimes an identified research section at the end of the test is given instead of the experimental section              There is no experimental section on the paper based GRE             

Scoring edit 
An examinee can miss one or more questions on a multiple choice section and still receive a perfect score of      Likewise  even if no question is answered correctly      is the lowest possible score              Verbal and quantative reasoning scores are given in one point increments  and analytical writing scores are given in half point increments on a scale of   to                           

Scaled score percentiles edit 
The percentiles for the current General test and the concordance with the prior format             are as follows  According to interpretive data published by ETS  from July         to June          about   million people have taken the test  Based on performance of individuals the mean and standard deviation of verbal section were        and       Whereas  mean and standard deviation for quantitative section were        and       Analytical writing has a mean of      with a standard deviation of

GRE Subject Tests edit 
In addition to the General Test  there are also three GRE Subject Tests testing knowledge in the specific areas of Mathematics  Physics  and Psychology  The length of each exam is     minutes 
In the past  subject tests were also offered in the areas of Computer Science  Economics  Revised Education  Engineering  English Literature  French  Geography  Geology  German  History  Music  Political Science  Sociology  Spanish  and Biochemistry  Cell and Molecular Biology              In April       the Revised Education and Political Science exams were discontinued  In April       the History and Sociology exams were discontinued  with Economics  Engineering  Music  and Geology being discontinued in April                   The Computer Science exam was discontinued after April                   Biochemistry  Cell and Molecular Biology was discontinued in December       The GRE Biology Test and GRE Literature in English Test tests were discontinued in May                   The GRE Chemistry Test was discontinued in May                  

Use in admissions edit 
Many graduate schools in the United States require GRE results as part of the admissions process  The GRE is a standardized test intended to measure all graduates  abilities in tasks of general academic nature  regardless of their fields of specialization  and the extent to which undergraduate education has developed their verbal skills  quantitative skills  and abstract thinking 
In addition to GRE scores  admission to graduate schools depends on several other factors  such as GPA  letters of recommendation  and statements of purpose              Furthermore  unlike other standardized admissions tests  such as the SAT  LSAT  and MCAT   the use and weight of GRE scores vary considerably not only from school to school  but also from department to department and program to program              For instance  most business schools and economics programs require very high GRE or GMAT scores for entry  while engineering programs are known to allow more score variation  Liberal arts programs may only consider the applicant s verbal score  while mathematics and science programs may only consider quantitative ability  Some schools use the GRE in admissions decisions  but not in funding decisions  others use it for selection of scholarship and fellowship candidates  but not for admissions  In some cases  the GRE may be a general requirement for graduate admissions imposed by the university  while particular departments may not consider the scores at all               Graduate schools will typically provide the average scores of previously admitted students and information about how the GRE is considered in admissions and funding decisions  In some cases  programs have hard cut off requirements for the GRE  for example  the Yale Economics PhD program requires a minimum quantitative score of     to apply              The best way to ascertain how a particular school or program evaluates a GRE score in the admissions process is to contact the person in charge of graduate admissions for the specific program in question 
In February       the University of Arizona James E  Rogers College of Law became the first law school to accept either the GRE or the Law School Admissions Test  LSAT  from all applicants                                      The college made the decision after conducting a study showing that the GRE is a valid and reliable predictor of students  first term law school grades 
In the spring of       Harvard Law School announced it was joining University of Arizona Law in accepting the GRE in addition to the LSAT from applicants to its three year J D  program             
After a trial cycle of GRE free admissions for Fall       University of California  Berkeley voted to drop the GRE requirement for most graduate program admissions for Fall      as well              University of Michigan  Ann Arbor shortly followed announcing that they would drop the GRE requirements for Ph D  admissions beginning with the         admissions cycle              By late       the trend had intensified             

MBA edit 
GRE score can be used for taking admission in MBA in foreign colleges 
The GMAT  Graduate Management Admission Test  is a computer adaptive standardized test in mathematics and the English language for measuring aptitude to succeed academically in graduate business studies 
Business schools commonly use the test as one of many selection criteria for admission into an MBA program  Starting in       many business schools began accepting the GRE in lieu of a GMAT score  Policies varied widely for several years  However  as of the           admissions season  most business schools accept both tests equally  Either a GMAT score or a GRE score can be submitted for an application to an MBA program  Business schools also accept either score for their other  non MBA  Masters and Ph D  programs 
The primary issue on which business school test acceptance policies vary is in how old a GRE or GMAT score can be before it is no longer accepted  The standard is that scores cannot be more than   years old  e g   Wharton              MIT Sloan              Columbia Business School              

Intellectual clubs edit 
Some GRE scores are accepted as qualifying evidence to intellectual clubs such as Intertel              Mensa             and the Triple Nine Society              the minimum passing score depending on the selectivity of the society and the time period when the test was taken  Intertel accepts scores in the   th percentile     how       obtained after       while Mensa does not accept any score post September      

Preparation edit 
A variety of resources are available for those wishing to prepare for the GRE  ETS provides preparation software called PowerPrep  which contains two practice tests of retired questions  as well as further practice questions and review material  Since the software replicates both the test format and the questions used  it can be useful to predict the actual GRE scores  ETS does not license their past questions to any other company  making them the only source for official retired material  ETS used to publish the  BIG BOOK  which contained a number of actual GRE questions  however  this publishing was abandoned  Several companies provide courses  books  and other unofficial preparation materials 
Some students taking the GRE use a test preparation company   Students who do not use these courses often rely on material from university text books  GRE preparation books  sample tests  and free web resources 

Testing locations edit 
While the general and subject tests are held at many undergraduate institutions  the computer based general test can be held in over       locations             with appropriate technological accommodations  In the United States  students in major cities or from large universities will usually find a nearby test center  while those in more isolated areas may have to travel a few hours to an urban or university location  Many industrialized countries also have test centers  but at times test takers must cross country borders 

Criticism edit 
Bias edit 
Algorithmic bias edit 
Critics have claimed that the computer adaptive methodology may discourage some test takers since the question difficulty changes with performance              For example  if the test taker is presented with remarkably easy questions halfway into the exam  they may infer that they are not performing well  which will influence their abilities as the exam continues  even though question difficulty is subjective  By contrast  standard testing methods may discourage students by giving them more difficult items earlier on 
Critics have also stated that the computer adaptive method of placing more weight on the first several questions is biased against test takers who typically perform poorly at the beginning of a test due to stress or confusion before becoming more comfortable as the exam continues              On the other hand  standard fixed form tests could equally be said to be  biased  against students with less testing stamina since they would need to be approximately twice the length of an equivalent computer adaptive test to obtain a similar level of precision             

Implicit bias edit 
The GRE has also been subjected to the same racial bias criticisms that have been lodged against other admissions tests  In       The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education noted that the mean score for black test takers in      was     on the verbal section      on the quantitative section  and     on the analytic  while white test takers averaged           and      respectively              The National Association of Test Directors Symposia in      stated a belief that simple mean score differences may not constitute evidence of bias unless the populations are known to be equal in ability              A more effective  accepted  and empirical approach is the analysis of differential test functioning  which examines the differences in item response theory curves for subgroups  the best approach for this is the DFIT framework             

Weak indicator of graduate school performance edit 
The GREs are criticized for not being a true measure of whether a student will be successful in graduate school  Robert Sternberg  now of Cornell University              working at Yale University at the time of the study   a long time critic of modern intelligence testing in general  found the GRE general test was weakly predictive of success in graduate studies in psychology              The strongest relationship was found for the now defunct analytical portion of the exam 
The ETS published a report   What is the Value of the GRE    that points out the predictive value of the GRE on a student s index of success at the graduate level              The problem with earlier studies is the statistical phenomenon of restriction of range  A correlation coefficient is sensitive to the range sampled for the test   Specifically  if only students accepted to graduate programs are studied  in Sternberg  amp  Williams and other research   the relationship is occluded   Validity coefficients range from     to     between the GRE and both first year and overall graduate GPA in ETS  study             
Kaplan and Saccuzzo state that the criterion that the GRE best predicts is first year grades in graduate school  However  this correlation is only in the high tens to low twenties   If the test correlates with a criterion at the    level  then it accounts for     of the variability in that criterion  with the other     resulting from unknown factors and errors               p             Graduate schools may be placing too much importance on standardized tests rather than on factors that more fully account for graduate school success  such as a thesis requiring Honours degree  prior research experience  GPAs  or work experience  While graduate schools do consider these areas  many times schools will not consider applicants that score below a current score of roughly           prior score   Kaplan and Saccuzzo also state that  the GRE predict s  neither clinical skill nor even the ability to solve real world problems   p            
In       a study by a university found a correlation of     to     between the GRE and both first year and overall graduate GPA   The correlation between GRE score and graduate school completion rates ranged from      for the now defunct analytical section  to      for the GRE subject test    Correlations with faculty ratings ranged from     to                 

Historical susceptibility to cheating edit 
In May       Kaplan  Inc warned ETS  in hearings before a New York legislative committee  that the small question pool available to the computer adaptive test made it vulnerable to cheating  ETS assured investigators that it was using multiple sets of questions and that the test was secure  This was later discovered to be incorrect             
In December       prompted by student reports of recycled questions  then Director of GRE Programs for Kaplan  Inc and current CEO of Knewton  Jose Ferreira  led a team of    staff members deployed to   U S  cities to take the exam  Kaplan  Inc then presented ETS with     questions  representing        of the GRE              According to early news releases  ETS appeared grateful to Stanley H  Kaplan  Inc  for identifying the security problem  However  on December     ETS sued Kaplan  Inc  for violation of a federal electronic communications privacy act  copyright laws  breach of contract  fraud  and a confidentiality agreement signed by test takers on test day              On January          an agreement was reached out of court 
Additionally  in       the scoring algorithm for the computer adaptive form of the GRE was discovered to be insecure  ETS acknowledged that Kaplan  Inc employees  led by Jose Ferreira  reverse engineered key features of the GRE scoring algorithms  The researchers found that a test taker s performance on the first few questions of the exam had a disproportionate effect on the test taker s final score  To preserve the integrity of scores  ETS adopted a more sophisticated scoring algorithm
