Former head of Supreme State Security Court Amr Abdel Razek said in a Wednesday statement that a coalition led by former chairman of the Constituent Assembly Amr Moussa would be  needed to build a new Egypt  
Moussa       s office had released a statement last Monday calling on  civil and patriotic  factions to form a coalition committing to a six points agenda for the development of the Egyptian state 
Ahmed Khairy  head of the National Workers Union  also praised Moussa       s call  in statement on Tuesday after meeting with other union leaders including Gebaly Al Meraghy  head of Egypt       s Workers Union and Malek Bioumy  head of the Egyptian Union of Independent Syndicates 
Khairy said the union leaders had agreed to take part in the coalition and would meet on Sunday with Moussa to discuss means for coordination and the criteria to select the candidates from the workers and farmers to be future Members of Parliament 
Moussa s point agenda would constitute the following six points  joining factions to vow loyalty to the      Constitution  respecting the principles of democracy and human rights  supporting the elected president to reconstruct the Egyptian state  coordinating in the upcoming elections  and accepting any civil factions except those proven to be corrupt 
The coalition would not bind parties to merge with one another but to align a vision within a framework aiming to reconstruct Egypt 
Moussa       s press officer Ahmed Kamel explained that meetings with different parties and political figures are taking place and that the final list of members in the coalition is not yet finalised  When asked if the coalition is open to taking members of the former National Democratic Party  Kamel stressed that the coalition will be exclusive to civil factions and that only those sentenced in cases of corruption would be excluded from it
