The process of frequency weighting involves emphasizing the contribution of particular aspects of a phenomenon  or of a set of data  over others to an outcome or result  thereby highlighting those aspects in comparison to others in the analysis  That is  rather than each variable in the data set contributing equally to the final result  some of the data is adjusted to make a greater contribution than others  This is analogous to the practice of adding  extra  weight to one side of a pair of scales in order to favour either the buyer or seller 
While weighting may be applied to a set of data  such as epidemiological data  it is more commonly applied to measurements of light  heat  sound  gamma radiation  and in fact any stimulus that is spread over a spectrum of frequencies 


Weighting in acoustics edit 
Weighting and loudness edit 
In the measurement of loudness  for example  a weighting filter is commonly used to emphasise frequencies around   to        kHz where the human ear is most sensitive  while attenuating very high and very low frequencies to which the ear is insensitive  A commonly used weighting is the A weighting curve  which results in units of dBA sound pressure level  Because the frequency response of human hearing varies with loudness  the A weighting curve is correct only at a level of    phon and other curves known as B   C  and D weighting are also used  the latter being particularly intended for the measurement of aircraft noise 

Weighting in audio measurement edit 
In broadcasting and audio equipment measurements     weighting is the preferred weighting to use because it was specifically devised to allow subjectively valid measurements on noise  rather than pure tones  It is often not realised that equal loudness curves  and hence A weighting  really apply only to tones  as tests with noise bands show increased sensitivity in the   to        kHz region on noise compared to tones 
Other weighting curves are used in rumble measurement and flutter measurement to properly assess subjective effect 
In each field of measurement  special units are used to indicate a weighted measurement as opposed to a basic physical measurement of energy level  For sound  the unit is the phon    kHz equivalent level  
In the fields of acoustics and audio engineering  it is common to use a standard curve referred to as A weighting  one of a set that are said to be derived from equal loudness contours 

Application to hearing in aquatic animals edit 
Auditory frequency weighting functions for marine mammals were introduced by Southall et al                    

Weighting in electromagnetism edit 
Weighting and gamma rays edit 
In the measurement of gamma rays or other ionising radiation  a radiation monitor or dosimeter will commonly use a filter to attenuate those energy levels or wavelengths that cause the least damage to the human body but letting through those that do the most damage  so any source of radiation may be measured in terms of its true danger rather than just its strength  The resulting unit is the sievert or microsievert 

Weighting and television colour components edit 
Another use of weighting is in television  in which the red  green and blue components of the signal are weighted according to their perceived brightness  This ensures compatibility with black and white receivers and also benefits noise performance and allows separation into meaningful luminance and chrominance signals for transmission 

Weighting and UV factor derivation for sun exposure edit 
Skin damage due to sun exposure is very wavelength dependent over the UV range     to          nm  with power at the shorter wavelength causing around    times as much damage as the longer one  In the calculation of UV Index  a weighting curve is used which is known as the McKinlay Diffey Erythema action spectrum     Archived            at the Wayback Machine
