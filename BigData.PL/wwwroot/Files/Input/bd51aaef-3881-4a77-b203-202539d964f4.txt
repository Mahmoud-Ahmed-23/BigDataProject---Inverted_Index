A land mine  or landmine  is an explosive weapon often concealed under or camouflaged on the ground  and designed to destroy or disable enemy targets as they pass over or near it              Land mines are divided into two types  anti tank mines  which are designed to disable tanks or other vehicles  and anti personnel mines  designed to injure or kill people            
Land mines are typically pressure activated  exploding automatically when stepped on by a person or driven over by a vehicle  though alternative detonation mechanisms are sometimes used             A land mine may cause damage by direct blast effect  by fragments that are thrown by the blast  or by both  Land mines are typically laid throughout an area  creating a minefield            which is dangerous to cross 
The use of land mines is controversial because of their indiscriminate nature and their potential to remain dangerous many years after a conflict has ended  harming civilians and the economy  With pressure from a number of campaign groups organised through the International Campaign to Ban Landmines  a global movement to prohibit their use led to the      Convention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti Personnel Mines and on their Destruction  also known as the Ottawa Treaty  To date      nations have signed the treaty  However  China  the Russian Federation and the United States are not signatories            


Definition edit 
The Anti Personnel Mine Ban Convention  also known as the Ottawa Treaty  and the Protocol on Mines  Booby Traps and Other Devices define a mine as a  munition designed to be placed under  on or near the ground or other surface area and to be exploded by the presence  proximity or contact of a person or vehicle                         Similar in function is the booby trap  which the protocol defines as  any device or material which is designed  constructed or adapted to kill or injure and which functions unexpectedly when a person disturbs or approaches an apparently harmless object or performs an apparently safe act              Such actions might include opening a door or picking up an object  Normally  mines are mass produced and placed in groups  while booby traps are improvised and deployed one at a time             Booby traps can also be non explosive devices such as punji sticks             Overlapping both categories is the improvised explosive device  IED   which is  a device placed or fabricated in an improvised manner incorporating explosive material  destructive  lethal  noxious  incendiary  pyrotechnic materials or chemicals designed to destroy  disfigure  distract or harass  They may incorporate military stores  but are normally devised from non military components               Some meet the definition of mines or booby traps and are also referred to as  improvised    artisanal  or  locally manufactured  mines             Other types of IED are remotely activated  so are not considered mines            
Remotely delivered mines are dropped from aircraft or carried by devices such as artillery shells or rockets             Another type of remotely delivered explosive is the cluster munition  a device that releases several submunitions   bomblets   over a large area              The use  transfer  production  and stockpiling of cluster munitions is prohibited by the international CCM treaty  If bomblets do not explode  they are referred to as unexploded ordnance  UXO   along with unexploded artillery shells and other explosive devices that were not manually placed  that is  mines and booby traps are not UXOs   Explosive remnants of war  ERW  include UXOs and abandoned explosive ordnance  AXO   devices that were never used and were left behind after a conflict                        

History edit 
The history of land mines can be divided into three main phases  In the ancient world  buried spikes provided many of the same functions as modern mines  Mines using gunpowder as the explosive were used from the Ming dynasty to the American Civil War  Subsequently  high explosives were developed for use in land mines             

Before explosives edit 
Roman caltrop
Some fortifications in the Roman Empire were surrounded by a series of hazards buried in the ground  These included goads  one foot long          cm  pieces of wood with iron hooks on their ends  lilia  lilies  so named after their appearance   which were pits in which sharpened logs were arranged in a five point pattern  and abatis  fallen trees with sharpened branches facing outwards  As with modern land mines  they were  victim operated   often concealed  and complicated attempts by the enemy to remove the obstacles by making them vulnerable to projectiles such as spears  A notable use of these defenses was by Julius Caesar in the Battle of Alesia  His forces were besieging Vercingetorix  the leader of the Gauls  but Vercingetorix managed to send for reinforcements  To maintain the siege and defend against the reinforcements  Caesar formed a line of fortifications on both sides  and they played an important role in his victory  Lilies were also used by Scots against the English at the Battle of Bannockburn in       and by Germans at the Battle of Passchendaele in the First World War             
A more easily deployed defense used by the Romans was the caltrop  a weapon            cm across with four sharp spikes that are oriented so that when it is thrown on the ground  one spike always points up  As with modern antipersonnel mines  caltrops are designed to disable soldiers rather than kill them  they are also more effective in stopping mounted forces  who lack the advantage of being able to carefully scrutinize each step they take  though forcing foot mounted forces to take the time to do so has benefits in and of itself   They were used by the Jin dynasty in China at the Battle of Zhongdu to slow down the advance of Genghis Khan s army  Joan of Arc was wounded by one in the Siege of Orl ans  in Japan they are known as tetsu bishu and were used by ninjas from the fourteenth century onward  Caltrops are still strung together and used as roadblocks in some modern conflicts             

Gunpowder edit

East Asia edit 
Chinese illustration of a land mine with eight explosive charges  from the Huolongjing    th century
A  self tripped trespass land mine  from the Wubei Zhi      
Gunpowder  an explosive mixture of sulfur  charcoal and potassium nitrate was invented in China by the   th century and was used in warfare soon after  An  enormous bomb   credited to Lou Qianxia  was used in      by the Chinese at the Battle of Zhongdu             
A   th century military treatise  the Huolongjing  Fire Dragon Manual   describes hollow cast iron cannonball shells filled with gunpowder              The wad of the mine was made of hard wood  carrying three different fuses in case of defective connection to the touch hole  These fuses were long and lit by hand  so they required carefully timed calculations of enemy movements             
The Huolongjing also describes land mines that were set off by enemy movement  A   foot         m  length of bamboo was waterproofed by wrapping it in cowhide and covering it with oil  It was filled with compressed gunpowder and lead or iron pellets  sealed with wax and concealed in a trench              The triggering mechanism was not fully described until the early   th century  When the enemy stepped onto hidden boards  they dislodged a pin  causing a weight to fall  A cord attached to the weight was wrapped around a drum attached to two steel wheels  when the weight fell  the wheels struck sparks against flint  igniting a set of fuses leading to multiple mines  A similar mechanism was used in the first wheellock musket in Europe as sketched by Leonardo da Vinci around      AD             
Another victim operated device was the  underground sky soaring thunder   which lured bounty hunters with halberds  pikes  and lances planted in the ground  If they pulled on one of these weapons  the butt end disturbed a bowl underneath and a slow burning incandescent material in the bowl ignited the fuses                         

Western world edit 
At Augsburg in       three centuries after the Chinese invented the first pressure operated mine  a German military engineer by the name of Samuel Zimmermann invented the Fladdermine  flying mine   It consisted of a few pounds of black powder buried near the surface and was activated by stepping on it or tripping a wire that made a flintlock fire  Such mines were deployed on the slope in front of a fort  They were used during the Franco Prussian War  but were probably not very effective because a flintlock does not work for long when left untended                         
The fougasse  was a precursor of modern fragmentation mines and the claymore mine  It consisted of a cone shape hole with gunpowder at the bottom  covered either by rocks and scrap iron  stone fougasse  or mortar shells  similar to large black powder hand grenades  shell fougasse   It was triggered by a flintlock connected to a tripwire on the surface  It could sometimes cause heavy casualties but required high maintenance due to the susceptibility of black powder to dampness  Consequently  it was mainly employed in the defenses of major fortifications  in which role it used in several European wars of the eighteenth century and the American Revolution             
Early land mines suffered from unreliable fuses which were vulnerable to damp  This changed with the invention of the safety fuse  Later  command initiation  the ability to detonate a charge immediately instead of waiting several minutes for a fuse to burn  became possible after electricity was developed  An electric current sent down a wire could ignite the charge with a spark  The Russians claim first use of this technology in the Russo Turkish War of            and with it the fougasse remained useful until it was superseded by the Claymore mine in the     s             
Victim activated mines were also unreliable because they relied on a flintlock to ignite the explosive  The percussion cap  developed in the early   th century  made them much more reliable  and pressure operated mines were deployed on land and sea in the Crimean War                         
During the American Civil War  the Confederate brigadier general Gabriel J  Rains deployed thousands of  torpedoes  consisting of artillery shells with pressure caps  beginning with the Battle of Yorktown in       As a captain  Rains had earlier employed explosive booby traps during the Seminole Wars in Florida in                               Over the course of the war  mines only caused a few hundred casualties  but they had a large effect on morale and slowed down the advance of Union troops              Many on both sides considered the use of mines barbaric  and in response  generals in the Union Army forced Confederate prisoners to remove the mines             

High explosives edit 
Starting in the   th century  more powerful explosives than gunpowder were developed  often for non military reasons such as blasting train tunnels in the Alps and Rockies  Guncotton  up to four times more powerful than gunpowder  was invented by Christian Schonbein in       It was dangerous to make until Frederick Augustus Abel developed a safe method in       From the     s to the First World War  it was the standard explosive used by the British military            
In       Ascanio Sobrero invented nitroglycerine to treat angina pectoris and it turned out to be a much more powerful explosive than guncotton  It was very dangerous to use until Alfred Nobel formulated a solid mixture he called dynamite and paired it with a safe detonator he developed  Even then  dynamite needed to be stored carefully or it could form crystals that detonated easily  Thus  the military still preferred guncotton            
In       the German chemical industry developed trinitrotoluene  TNT   This had the advantage that it was difficult to detonate  so it could withstand the shock of firing by artillery pieces  It was also advantageous for land mines for several reasons  it was not detonated by the shock of shells landing nearby  it was lightweight  unaffected by damp  and stable under a wide range of conditions  it could be melted to fill a container of any shape  and it was cheap to make  Thus  it became the standard explosive in mines after the First World War            

Between the American Civil War and the First World War edit 
The British used mines in the Siege of Khartoum  A Sudanese Mahdist force much larger than British strength was held off for ten months  but the town was ultimately taken and the British massacred  In the Boer War              they succeeded in holding Mafeking against Boer forces with the help of a mixture of real and fake minefields  and they laid mines alongside railroad tracks to discourage sabotage            
In the Russo Japanese War of            both sides used land and sea mines  although the effect on land mainly affected morale  The naval mines were far more effective  destroying several battleships            

First World War edit 
Cutaway diagram of the S mine
One sign of the increasing power of explosives used in land mines was that  by the First World War  they burst into about       high velocity fragments  in the Franco Prussian War         it had only been    to    fragments              Nevertheless  anti personnel mines were not a big factor in the war because machine guns  barbed wire and rapid fire artillery were far more effective defenses  An exception was in Africa  now Tanzania and Namibia  where the warfare was much more mobile            
Towards the end of the war  the British started to use tanks to break through trench defenses  The Germans responded with anti tank guns and mines  Improvised mines gave way to mass produced mines consisting of wooden boxes filled with guncotton  and minefields were standardized to stop masses of tanks from advancing            
Between world wars  the future Allies did little work on land mines  but the Germans developed a series of anti tank mines  the Tellermines  plate mines   They also developed the Schrapnell mine  also known as the S mine   the first bounding mine  When triggered  this jumped up to about waist height and exploded  sending thousands of steel balls in all directions                         Triggered by pressure  trip wires or electronics             it could harm soldiers within an area of about       square feet             

Second World War edit 
The Sch  mine     the most common mine used in the Second World War
Tens of millions of mines were laid in the Second World War  particularly in the deserts of North Africa and the steppes of Eastern Europe  where the open ground favored tanks  However  the first country to use them was Finland  They were defending against a much larger Soviet force with over       tanks  twenty times the number the Finns had  but they had terrain that was broken up by lakes and forests  so tank movement was restricted to roads and tracks  Their defensive line  the Mannerheim Line  integrated these natural defenses with mines  including simple fragmentation mines mounted on stakes             
While the Germans were advancing rapidly using blitzkrieg tactics  they did not make much use of mines  After       however  they were on the defensive and became the most inventive and systematic users of mines  Their production shot up and they began inventing new types of mines as the Allies found ways to counter the existing ones  To make it more difficult to remove antitank mines  they surrounded them with S mines and added anti handling devices that would explode when soldiers tried to lift them  They also took a formal approach to laying mines and they kept detailed records of the locations of mines                         
In the Second Battle of El Alamein in       the Germans prepared for an Allied attack by laying about half a million mines in two fields running across the entire battlefield and five miles deep  Nicknamed the  Devil s gardens   they were covered by    mm anti tank guns and small arms fire  The Allies prevailed  but at the cost of over half their tanks     percent of the losses were caused by mines             
The Soviets learned the value of mines from their war with Finland  and when Germany invaded they made heavy use of them  manufacturing over    million  At the Battle of Kursk  which put an end to the German advance  they laid over a million mines in eight belts with an overall depth of    kilometres             
Mines forced tanks to slow down and wait for soldiers to go ahead and remove the mines  The main method of breaching minefields involved prodding the dirt with a bayonet or stick at an angle of    degrees to avoid pressuring the top of the mine  Since all mines at the beginning of the war had metal casings  metal detectors could be used to speed up the locating of mines  A Polish officer  J zef Kosacki  developed a portable mine detector known as the Polish mine detector  To counter the detector  Germans developed mines with wooden casings  the Sch  mine     anti personnel  and Holzmine     anti tank   Effective  cheap and easy to make  the Sch  mine became the most common mine in the war  Mine casings were also made of glass  concrete and clay  The Russians developed a mine with a pressed cardboard casing  the PMK    and the Italians made an anti tank mine out of bakelite  In       the Germans created the Topfmine  an entirely non metallic mine  They ensured that they could detect their own mines by covering them with radioactive sand  the Allies did not find this out until after the war             
Several mechanical methods for clearing mines were tried  Heavy rollers were attached to tanks or cargo trucks  but they did not last long and their weight made the tanks considerably slower  Tanks and bulldozers pushed ploughs that  pushed aside any mines to a depth of         cm  The Bangalore torpedo  a long thin tube filled with explosives  was invented in      and used to clear barbed wire  larger versions such as the Snake and the Conger were developed for clearing mines  but were not very effective     citation needed       One of the best options was the flail  which had weights attached by chains to rotating drums  The first version  the Scorpion  was attached to the Matilda tank and used in the Second Battle of El Alamein  The Crab  attached to the Sherman tank  was faster  at   kilometers per hour  it was used during D Day and the aftermath             

Cold War edit 
Claymore mine with firing device and electric blasting cap assembly
During the Cold War  the members of NATO were concerned about massive armored attacks by the Soviet Union  They planned for a minefield stretching across the entire West German border  and developed new types of mines  The British designed an anti tank mine  the Mark    to defeat rollers by detonating the second time it was pressed  It also had a     second delay so the tank would be directly over the mine  They also developed the first scatterable mine  the No    Dingbat  The Americans used the M  anti tank mine and tripwire operated bounding anti personnel mines such as the M  and M               
In the Korean War  land mine use was dictated by the steep terrain  narrow valleys  forest cover and lack of developed roads  This made tanks less effective and more easily stopped by mines  However  mines laid near roads were often easy to spot  In response to this problem  the U S  developed the M    a mine that was placed off to the side of the road  When triggered by a tripwire  it fired a rocket  However  the mine was not available until after the war             
The Chinese had a lot of success with massed infantry attacks  The extensive forest cover limited the range of machine guns  but anti personnel mines were effective  However  mines were poorly recorded and marked  often becoming as much a hazard to allies as enemies  Tripwire operated mines were not defended by pressure mines  the Chinese were often able to disable them and reuse them against U N  forces             
Looking for more destructive mines  the Americans developed the Claymore  a directional fragmentation mine that hurls steel balls in a    degree arc at a speed of      m s  They also developed a pressure operated mine  the M    toe popper   These  too  were ready too late for the Korean War             

An L  Bar Mine
In       the British developed the No    anti personnel mine  a minimum metal mine with a narrow diameter  making it difficult to detect with metal detectors or prodding  Its three pronged pressure piece inspired the nickname  carrot mine   However  it was unreliable in wet conditions  In the     s the Canadians developed a similar  but more reliable mine  the C A   Elsie  and the British army adopted it  The British also developed the L  bar mine  a wide anti tank mine with a rectangular shape  which covered more area  allowing a minefield to be laid four times as fast as previous mines  They also upgraded the Dingbat to the Ranger  a plastic mine that was fired from a truck mounted discharger that could fire    mines at a time             
In the     s  the US Operation Doan Brook studied the feasibility of delivering mines by air  This led to three types of air delivered mine  Wide Area Anti Personnel Mines  WAAPMs  were small steel spheres that discharged tripwires when they hit the ground  each dispenser held     mines  The BLU    Dragontooth was small and had a flattened  W  shape to slow its descent  while the gravel mine was larger  Both were packed by the thousand into bombs  All three were designed to inactivate after a period of time  but any that failed to activate presented a safety challenge  Over    million gravel mines were produced between      and       and when they were dropped in places like Vietnam their locations were unmarked and unrecorded  A similar problem was presented by unexploded cluster munitions             
The next generation of scatterable mines arose in response to the increasing mobility of war  The Germans developed the Skorpion system  which scattered AT  mines from a tracked vehicle  The Italians developed a helicopter delivery system that could rapidly switch between SB    anti personnel mines and SB    anti tank mines  The US developed a range of systems called the Family of Scatterable Mines  FASCAM  that could deliver mines by fast jet  artillery  helicopter and ground launcher             

Middle eastern conflicts edit 
The Iraq Iran War  the Gulf War  and the Islamic State have all contributed to land mine saturation in Iraq from the     s through       In       Iraq was the most saturated country in the world with land mines              Countries that provided land mines during the Iran Iraq War included Belgium  Canada  Chile  China  Egypt  France  Italy  Romania  Singapore  the former Soviet Union and the U S   and were concentrated in the Kurdish areas in the northern area of Iraq  During the Gulf War  the U S  deployed         mines  with        being anti personnel mines and        being anti vehicle mines              The U S  did not use land mines during the Iraq War             
Landmines and other unexploded battlefield ordnance contaminate at least     million square meters of land in Afghanistan  Only two of Afghanistan s twenty nine provinces are believed to be free of landmines  The most heavily mined provinces are Herat and Kandahar              Since       nearly        Afghan civilians have been recorded to have been killed or injured by landmines and Explosive Remnants of War  ERW  averaging to around     people per month  Improvised mines and ERW from armed clashes caused nearly    percent of the casualties recorded in                  


Invasion of Ukraine edit 
During the      Russian Invasion of Ukraine  both Russian and Ukrainian forces have used land mines  Ukrainian officials claim Russian forces planted thousands of land mines or other explosive devices during their withdrawal from Ukrainian cities  including in civilian areas              Russian forces have also utilized remotely delivered anti personnel mines such as the POM               

Chemical and nuclear edit 
In the First World War  the Germans developed a device  nicknamed the  Yperite Mine  by the British  that they left behind in abandoned trenches and bunkers  It was detonated by a delayed charge  spreading mustard gas   Yperite    In the Second World War they developed a modern chemical mine  the Spr h B chse     Bounding Gas Mine      but never used it              The United States developed the M  chemical mine  which used mustard gas  in       and the M   chemical mine  which used the VX nerve agent  in                   The Soviets developed the KhF  a  bounding chemical mine               The French had chemical mines and the Iraqis were believed to have them before the invasion of Kuwait              In       the Chemical Weapons Convention came into force  prohibiting the use of chemical weapons and mandating their destruction  By July      all declared stockpiles of chemical weapons were destroyed             
For a few decades during the Cold War  the U S  developed atomic demolition munitions  often referred to as nuclear land mines  These were portable nuclear bombs that could be placed by hand  and could be detonated remotely or with a timer  Some of these were deployed in Europe  Governments in West Germany  Turkey and Greece wanted to have nuclear minefields as a defense against attack from the Warsaw Pact  However  such weapons were politically and tactically infeasible  and by      the last of these munitions was retired                          The British also had a project  codenamed Blue Peacock  to develop nuclear mines to be buried in Germany  the project was cancelled in                              

Characteristics and function edit 
Section of an anti tank mine  Note the yellow main charge wrapped around a red booster charge  and the secondary fuze well on the side of the mine designed for an anti handling device 
Diagram of components
A conventional land mine consists of a casing that is mostly filled with the main charge  It has a firing mechanism such as a pressure plate  this triggers a detonator or igniter  which in turn sets off a booster charge  There may be additional firing mechanisms in anti handling devices             

Firing mechanisms and initiating actions edit 
A land mine can be triggered by a number of things including pressure  movement  sound  magnetism and vibration              Anti personnel mines commonly use the pressure of a person s foot as a trigger  but tripwires are also frequently employed  Because modern anti vehicle mines usually employ magnetic triggers  they can detonate even if the victim s tires or tracks do not directly impact it  Advanced mines are able to sense the difference between friendly and enemy types of vehicles by way of a built in signature catalog  an identification friend or foe system   This theoretically enables friendly forces to use the mined area while denying the enemy access 
Many mines combine the main trigger with a touch or tilt trigger to prevent enemy engineers from defusing the mine  Land mine designs tend to use as little metal as possible to make searching with a metal detector more difficult  land mines made mostly of plastic have the added advantage of being very inexpensive 
Some types of modern mines are designed to self destruct  or chemically render themselves inert after a period of weeks or months to reduce the likelihood of civilian casualties at the conflict s end  These self destruct mechanisms are not absolutely reliable  and most land mines laid historically are not equipped in this manner 
There is a common misconception that a landmine is armed by stepping on it and only triggered by stepping off  This is not the case for almost all types of mine  In virtually all cases the initial pressure trigger detonates the mine  since mines are designed to kill or maim the victim rather than standing still until the mine can be disarmed  This misperception originated with the fictional portrayal of mines  often in movies in which the disarming of a mine is a source of narrative tension             

Anti handling devices edit 
Main article  Anti handling device
Examples of anti handling devices
Anti handling devices detonate the mine if someone attempts to lift  shift or disarm it  The intention is to hinder deminers by discouraging any attempts to clear minefields  There is a degree of overlap between the function of a boobytrap and an anti handling device insofar as some mines have optional fuze pockets into which standard pull or pressure release boobytrap firing devices can be screwed  Alternatively  some mines may mimic a standard design  but actually be specifically intended to kill deminers  such as the MC   and PMN   variants of the PMN mine  Anti handling devices can be found on both anti personnel mines and anti tank mines  either as an integral part of their design or as improvised add ons  For this reason  the standard render safe procedure for mines is often to destroy them on site without attempting to lift them 

Smart mines edit 
Main article  Smart mine
 Smart mines  utilize a number of advanced technologies developed in the late   th and early   st century  Most commonly  this includes mechanisms to deactivate or self destruct the mine after a preset period of time  This is intended to reduce civilian casualties and simplify demining 
Other innovations include  self healing  minefields  which detect gaps in the field and can direct the mines to rearrange their positions  eliminating the gaps             

Anti tank mines edit 
Main article  Anti tank mine
Anti tank mines were created in response to the invention of the tank in the First World War  Though improvised at first  purpose built designs were soon developed  Set off when a tank passes  they attack the tank at one of its weaker areas   the tracks  They are designed to immobilize or destroy vehicles and their occupants  In U S  military terminology destroying the vehicles is referred to as a catastrophic kill while only disabling its movement is referred to as a mobility kill 
Anti tank mines are typically larger than anti personnel mines and require more pressure to detonate  The high trigger pressure  normally requiring     kilograms           lb  prevents them from being set off by infantry or smaller vehicles of lesser importance  More modern anti tank mines use shaped charges to focus and increase the armor penetration of the explosives 

Anti personnel mines edit 
Main article  Anti personnel mine
Anti personnel mine in Cambodia
Anti personnel mines are designed primarily to kill or injure people  as opposed to vehicles  They are often designed to injure rather than kill to increase the logistical support  evacuation  medical  burden on the opposing force  Some types of anti personnel mines can also damage the tracks or wheels of armored vehicles 
In the asymmetric warfare conflicts and civil wars of the   st century  improvised explosives  known as IEDs  have partially supplanted conventional land mines as the source of injury to dismounted  pedestrian  soldiers and civilians  IEDs are used mainly by insurgents and terrorists against regular armed forces and civilians  The injuries from the anti personnel IED were recently reported in BMJ Open to be far worse than with landmines resulting in multiple limb amputations and lower body mutilation             

Warfare edit

Land mines were designed for two main uses 

To create defensive tactical barriers  channelling attacking forces into predetermined fire zones or slowing an invading force s progress to allow reinforcements to arrive 
To act as passive area denial weapons  to deny the enemy use of valuable terrain  resources or facilities when active defense of the area is not desirable or possible  
Land mines are currently used in large quantities mostly for this first purpose  thus their widespread use in the demilitarized zones  DMZs  of likely flashpoints such as Cyprus  Afghanistan and Korea  Syria has used land mines in its civil war              Since       land mine use has risen in Myanmar             during its internal conflict  As of       both Russia and Ukraine have deployed land mines             
In military science  minefields are considered a defensive or harassing weapon  used to slow the enemy down  to deny certain terrain to the enemy  to focus enemy movement into kill zones  or to reduce morale by randomly attacking materiel and personnel  In some engagements during World War II  anti tank mines accounted for half of all vehicles disabled 
Since combat engineers with mine clearing equipment can clear a path through a minefield relatively quickly  mines are usually considered effective only if covered by fire 
The extents of minefields are often marked with warning signs and cloth tape  to prevent friendly troops and non combatants from entering them  Of course  sometimes terrain can be denied using dummy minefields  Most forces carefully record the location and disposition of their own minefields  because warning signs can be destroyed or removed  and minefields should eventually be cleared  Minefields may also have marked or unmarked safe routes to allow friendly movement through them 
Placing minefields without marking and recording them for later removal is considered a war crime under Protocol II of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons  which is itself an annex to the Geneva Conventions 
Artillery and aircraft scatterable mines allow minefields to be placed in front of moving formations of enemy units  including the reinforcement of minefields or other obstacles that have been breached by enemy engineers  They can also be used to cover the retreat of forces disengaging from the enemy  or for interdiction of supporting units to isolate front line units from resupply  In most cases these minefields consist of a combination of anti tank and anti personnel mines  with the anti personnel mines making removal of the anti tank mines more difficult  Mines of this type used by the United States are     citation needed      designed to self destruct after a preset period of time  reducing the requirement for mine clearing to only those mines whose self destruct system did not function  Some designs of these scatterable mines require an electrical charge  capacitor or battery  to detonate  After a certain period of time  either the charge dissipates  leaving them effectively inert or the circuitry is designed such that upon reaching a low level  the device is triggered  destroying the mine 

Guerrilla warfare edit 
None of the conventional tactics and norms of mine warfare applies when they are employed in a guerrilla role      citation needed     

The mines are not used in defensive roles  for specific position or area  
Mined areas are not marked 
Mines are usually placed singly and not in groups covering an area 
Mines are often left unattended  not covered by fire  
Land mines were commonly deployed by insurgents during the South African Border War  leading directly to the development of the first dedicated mine protected armoured vehicles in South Africa              Namibian insurgents used anti tank mines to throw South African military convoys into disarray before attacking them              To discourage detection and removal efforts  they also laid anti personnel mines directly parallel to the anti tank mines              This initially resulted in heavy South African military and police casualties  as the vast distances of road network vulnerable to insurgent sappers every day made comprehensive detection and clearance efforts impractical              The only other viable option was the adoption of mine protected vehicles which could remain mobile on the roads with little risk to their passengers even if a mine was detonated              South Africa is widely credited with inventing the v hull  a vee shaped hull for armoured vehicles which deflects mine blasts away from the passenger compartment             
During the ongoing Syrian Civil War                          Iraqi Civil War                         and Yemeni Civil War       present              land mines have been used for both defensive and guerrilla purposes 

Laying mines edit 
Minefield warning on the Golan Heights  still valid more than    years after creation of the field by the Syrian army
Minefields may be laid by several means  The preferred  but most labour intensive  way is to have engineers bury the mines  since this will make the mines practically invisible and reduce the number of mines needed to deny the enemy an area  Mines can be laid by specialized mine laying vehicles  Mine scattering shells may be fired by artillery from a distance of several tens of kilometers 
Mines may be dropped from helicopters or airplanes  or ejected from cluster bombs or cruise missiles 
Anti tank minefields can be scattered with anti personnel mines to make clearing them manually more time consuming  and anti personnel minefields are scattered with anti tank mines to prevent the use of armored vehicles to clear them quickly  Some anti tank mine types are also able to be triggered by infantry  giving them a dual purpose even though their main and official intention is to work as anti tank weapons 
Some minefields are specifically booby trapped to make clearing them more dangerous  Mixed anti personnel and anti tank minefields  anti personnel mines under anti tank mines  and fuses separated from mines have all been used for this purpose  Often  single mines are backed by a secondary device  designed to kill or maim personnel tasked with clearing the mine 
Multiple anti tank mines have been buried in stacks of two or three with the bottom mine fuzed  to multiply the penetrating power  Since the mines are buried  the ground directs the energy of the blast in a single direction through the bottom of the target vehicle or on the track 
Another specific use is to mine an aircraft runway immediately after it has been bombed to delay or discourage repair  Some cluster bombs combine these functions  One example was the British JP    cluster bomb which includes munitions to damage  crater  the runway as well as anti personnel mines in the same cluster bomb  As a result of the anti personnel mine ban it was withdrawn from British Royal Air Force service  and the last stockpiles of the mine were destroyed on October                      

Demining edit

Metal detectors were first used for demining  after their invention by the Polish officer J zef Kosacki              His invention  known as the Polish mine detector  was used by the Allies alongside mechanical methods  to clear the German mine fields during the Second Battle of El Alamein when     units were shipped to Field Marshal Montgomery s Eighth Army                         
The Nazis used captured civilians who were chased across minefields to detonate the explosives  According to Laurence Rees  Curt von Gottberg  the SS Obergruppenf hrer who  during       conducted another huge anti partisan action called Operation Kottbus on the eastern border of Belarus  reported that  approximately two to three thousand local people were blown up in the clearing of the minefields               
Whereas the placing and arming of mines is relatively inexpensive and simple  the process of detecting and removing them is typically expensive  slow  and dangerous  This is especially true of irregular warfare where mines were used on an ad hoc basis in unmarked and undocumented areas  Anti personnel mines are most difficult to find  due to their small size and many being made almost entirely of non metallic materials specifically to evade metal detectors 
Manual clearing remains the most effective technique for clearing mine fields  although hybrid techniques involving the use of animals and robots are being developed  Many animals are desirable due to having a strong sense of smell capable of detecting a land mine              Animals such as rats and dogs can be trained to detect the explosive agent             
Other techniques involve the use of geolocation technologies  As of          update      a joint team of researchers at the University of New South Wales and Ohio State University was working to develop a system based on multi sensor integration              Furthermore  defence firms have been increasingly competing on the creation of unmanned demining systems  In addition to conventional remote control mine defusing robots that operate either through precise mechanical dismantling  electronic destabilization and kinetic triggering methods  fully autonomous methods are in development  Notably  these autonomous methods utilize unmanned ground systems  or more recently subterranean systems such as the EMC Operations Termite  using either outward pressure differentials along system bodies  or corkscrew mechanisms 
The laying of land mines has inadvertently led to a positive development in the Falkland Islands  Minefields laid near the sea during the Falklands War have become favorite places for penguins  which do not weigh enough to detonate the mines  Therefore  they can breed safely  free of human intrusion  These odd sanctuaries have proven so popular and lucrative for ecotourism that efforts existed to prevent removal of the mines              but the area has since been demined                         

International treaties edit 
Main article  Ottawa Treaty
Party states to the Ottawa Treaty as of                 Signed and ratified             Acceded or succeeded            Only signed
The use of land mines is controversial because they are indiscriminate weapons  harming soldier and civilian alike  They remain dangerous after the conflict in which they were deployed has ended  killing and injuring civilians and rendering land impassable and unusable for decades  To make matters worse  many factions have not kept accurate records  or any at all  of the exact locations of their minefields  making removal efforts painstakingly slow  These facts pose serious difficulties in many developing nations where the presence of mines hampers resettlement  agriculture  and tourism  The International Campaign to Ban Landmines campaigned successfully to prohibit their use  culminating in the      Convention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti Personnel Mines and on their Destruction  known informally as the Ottawa Treaty 
The Treaty came into force on March          The treaty was the result of the leadership of the Governments of Canada  Norway  South Africa and Mozambique working with the International Campaign to Ban Landmines  launched in       The campaign and its leader  Jody Williams  won the Nobel Peace Prize in      for its efforts 
The treaty does not include anti tank mines  cluster bombs or Claymore type mines operated in command mode and focuses specifically on anti personnel mines  because these pose the greatest long term  post conflict  risk to humans and animals since they are typically designed to be triggered by any movement or pressure of only a few kilograms  whereas anti tank mines require much more weight  or a combination of factors that would exclude humans   Existing stocks must be destroyed within four years of signing the treaty 
Signatories of the Ottawa Treaty agree that they will not use  produce  stockpile or trade in anti personnel land mines  In       there were     signatories  as of early           countries have joined the Treaty  Thirty six countries  including the People s Republic of China  the Russian Federation and the United States  which together may hold tens of millions of stockpiled anti personnel mines  are not party to the Convention              Another    have yet to sign on  The United States did not sign because the treaty lacks an exception for the Korean Demilitarized Zone 
Article   of the Treaty permits countries to retain land mines for use in training or development of countermeasures  Sixty four countries have taken this option 
As an alternative to an outright ban     countries follow regulations that are contained in a      amendment of Protocol II of the Convention on Conventional Weapons  CCW   The countries are China  Finland  India  Israel  Morocco  Pakistan  South Korea and the United States  Sri Lanka  which had adhered to this regulation  announced in      that it would join the Ottawa Treaty             
Submunitions and unexploded ordnance from cluster munitions can also function as land mines  in that they continue to kill and maim indiscriminately long after conflicts have ended  The Convention on Cluster Munitions  CCM  is an international treaty that prohibits the use  distribution  or manufacture of cluster munitions  The CCM entered into force in       and has been ratified by over     countries 

Manufacturers edit 
Before the Ottawa Treaty was adopted  the Arms Project of Human Rights Watch identified  almost     companies and government agencies in    countries  that had manufactured  more than     types of anti personnel land mines in recent decades   Five to ten million mines were produced per year with a value of     to           million  The largest producers were probably China  Italy and the Soviet Union  The companies involved included giants such as Daimler Benz  the Fiat Group  the Daewoo Group  RCA and General Electric                         
As of       the Landmine  amp  Cluster Munition Monitor identified four countries that were  likely to be actively producing  land mines  India  Myanmar  Pakistan and South Korea  Another seven states reserved the right to make them but were probably not doing so  China  Cuba  Iran  North Korea  Russia  Singapore  and Vietnam             
In recent years  arms industry manufacturers have been utilizing non static mines that can be specifically targeted in order to remove the imprecision of anti personnel devices  promoting the use of movable underground systems  movable above ground systems and systems that can be expired  automatically or manually via strategic operators  
Development of systems such as Termite  by arms firm EMC Operations has led to criticism from proponents of past multilateral agreements against the placement of land mines and submunitions due to expectations of similar long dormancy period issues after systems break or fail after it was announced that vehicles would likely be armed to destroy static targets  rather than focus purely on demining efforts 

Impacts edit 
Throughout the world there are millions of hectares that are contaminated with land mines             

Casualties edit 
From      to       the Landmine Monitor has recorded over         casualties from mines  IEDs and ERW  it estimates that another       per year go unrecorded  The estimate for all time is over half a million  In       at least       were killed and       injured      of the casualties were civilians and     were children  less than    years old   The largest numbers of casualties were in Afghanistan          Syria          and Ukraine                   

Environmental edit 
Natural disasters can have a significant impact on efforts to demine areas of land  For example  the floods that occurred in Mozambique in      and      may have displaced hundreds of thousands of land mines left from the war  Uncertainty about their locations delayed recovery efforts             

Land degradation edit 
From a study by  Asmeret Asefaw Berhe  land degradation caused by land mines  can be classified into five groups  access denial  loss of biodiversity  micro relief disruption  chemical composition  and loss of productivity   The effects of an explosion depend on    i  the objectives and methodological approaches of the investigation   ii  concentration of mines in a unit area   iii  chemical composition and toxicity of the mines   iv  previous uses of the land and  v  alternatives that are available for the affected populations              

Access denial edit 
The most prominent ecological issue associated with land mines  or fear of them  is denial of access to vital resources  where  access  refers to the ability to use resources  in contrast to  property   the right to use them               The presence and fear of presence of even a single land mine can discourage access for agriculture  water supplies and possibly conservation measures              Reconstruction and development of important structures such as schools and hospitals are likely to be delayed  and populations may shift to urban areas  increasing overcrowding and the risk of spreading diseases             
Access denial can have positive effects on the environment  When a mined area becomes a  no man s land   plants and vegetation have a chance to grow and recover  For example  formerly arable lands in Nicaragua returned to forests and remained undisturbed after the establishment of land mines  Similarly  the penguins of the Falkland Islands have benefited because they are not heavy enough to trigger the mines present              However  these benefits can only last as long as animals  tree limbs  etc  do not detonate the mines  In addition  long idle periods could  potentially end up creating or exacerbating loss of productivity   particularly within land of low quality             

Loss of biodiversity edit 
Land mines can threaten biodiversity by wiping out vegetation and wildlife during explosions or demining  This extra burden can push threatened and endangered species to extinction  They have also been used by poachers to target endangered species  Displaced refugees hunt animals for food and destroy habitat by making shelters             
Shrapnel  or abrasions of bark or roots caused by detonated mines  can cause the slow death of trees and provide entry sites for wood rotting fungi  When land mines make land unavailable for farming  residents resort to the forests to meet all of their survival needs  This exploitation furthers the loss of biodiversity             

Chemical contamination edit 
Near mines that have exploded or decayed  soils tend to be contaminated  particularly with heavy metals  Products produced from the explosives  both organic and inorganic substances  are most likely to be  long lasting  water soluble and toxic even in small amounts               They can be implemented either  directly or indirectly into soil  water bodies  microorganisms and plants with drinking water  food products or during respiration              
Toxic compounds can also find their way into bodies of water and accumulate in land animals  fish and plants  They can act  as a nerve poison to hamper growth   with deadly effect
