							CAIRO  While many of Naguib Mahfouz       s most memorable characters stalked the back streets and alleys of Cairo  the Nobel laureate also had a soft spot for Egypt       s second city 
       Alexandria was a European city  where Italian  French  Greek or English was heard far more than Arabic   he wrote in Al Ahram in      
       The city was beautiful  so clean I could have eaten off the streets  In short  Alexandria was a European city  but it belonged to us  the Egyptians  
Fittingly  this quote is prominently displayed at the Bibliotheca Alexandrina  where an exhibit entitled        Impressions of Alexandria  traces the city       s history back to medieval times through a series of sketches  paintings  maps and photographs         done mostly by Europeans 
The exhibit begins with a print from Hartman Schedel       s      work        The Chronicle of Nuremburg   Drawn in storybook fashion  the print depicts Alexandria as a fantastical city filled with steeples  castles and heavy brick walls 
Schedel also tells his readers that European settlers and traders were living in Alexandria at the time  with Venetian and Genoese merchants doing particularly brisk business trading goods along the Mediterranean Sea coast 
Beyond the graphics and the text  however  the        Chronicle  also shows how Europeans         through a mixture of fantasy  suspect historiography and clever fabrication         used Alexandria as a model for a European enclave in the Orient 
Likewise  the European fascination with Alexandria is apparent in a   th century French decorative map with the title of        Ancienne Vieux D       Alexandria   which depicts the city as a fully Europeanized vision of urban utopia 
Rather than showing Alexandria as the oriental and Islamic city that it surely was at the time  European cartographers eschewed facts in favor of an idealized version of the city  Many historians now believe that mapmakers at the time in fact relied on oral traditions and third party anecdotes rather than cartographic facts and geographic methods 
By the   th century  Europeans were still celebrating Alexandria as the ancient Hellenic seat of Ptolemy  This period is exemplified by        The Lighthouse of Alexandria  by Fisher von Erlach 
Like other European historiographers  Erlach didn       t have much time for facts  his drawing distorts the lighthouse       s actual dimensions and design  and he gives it only six stories when historical documents show that it actually rose to    floors 
Fueled by interest in ancient texts  Alexandria was seen as an almost mythical city  But sometimes  these imaginary views of Alexandria ran up against fact 
In       Corneille Le Bruyn laments the sorry state of Alexandria  which he finds to be in disarray and disrepair  While the author celebrates the city       s ruins and the massive Pompey Pillar  he says        as to the present state of the city of Alexandria  it is almost wholly ruinated and without buildings  having but a few houses inhabited  
Nonetheless  by the end of the   th century  the French army had conquered the coast of Egypt  but while        Prise D       Alexandria  by Grenier shows Napoleon       s achievement as a remarkable and considerable military victory  in fact  only    Alexandrians perished in the fighting  It was a small and barely significant battle 
With the dawning of the colonial age  however  the exhibit swings from cartography to clinical depictions of military maneuvers  Here       s why  Shortly after taking Alexandria  Napoleon recruited     scholars to create a massive encyclopedic collection called        Description De l        gypte   which flew off book shelves in Europe and led to an Egypt craze in Europe 
It       s no wonder the Europeans freaked out         Description  looks like a flawless collection and its depictions of Greek ruins  ancient Egyptian obelisks and other architectural details were among the most graphic and accurate of the age 
Along with a history of Alexandria  the exhibit is also a history of graphic methodology  which shows the development of industrial illustration and photography 
As such  early photographs and daguerreotypes are on display  such as Hector Horeau       s        Aiguille de Cleopatre   and drawings taken from newspapers during the English bombardments of       when gunship diplomacy led to major destruction of the city 
Other highlights include sepia photographs of the city       s modernist architectural treasures  and while Alexandria may not be the ancient capital it once was  these photos show that the city is still a gem on the sea
