							The history of the Middle East has not merely been written in ink  but carved through oil  blood  and fragmented memory  Since the Sykes Picot Agreement of       when colonial architects divided Arab lands in the aftermath of World War I  the region has been managed not as a cradle of civilisation with the right to self determination  but as a geopolitical zone that must remain under control  That colonial pact was not the end of the story   it was its beginning  From drawing borders with a pen  the strategy evolved into fragmenting awareness through sound and image  from military occupation to a silent invasion seeping into the marrow of identity 
 nbsp 
The so called  Greater Middle East  project was never a developmental initiative  but rather a carefully branded blueprint for dismantling the Arab world   hollowing out its spirit  dismantling its identity  and eroding its immunity  When Condoleezza Rice proclaimed that what was happening in Lebanon was the  birth pangs of a New Middle East   her words were not spontaneous   they were calibrated and cynical  as though the blood spilled was a reasonable price for a long awaited geopolitical infant dreamed up in the security think tanks of Washington  London  and Tel Aviv  America was no longer pursuing oil alone   it sought to unravel the Arab psyche  to tear social fabrics apart  and to manufacture generations that would see resistance as a burdensome relic  Arabism as a failed myth  and religion as an endless inner conflict 
 nbsp 
When armies failed to subdue the will of the people  Western intelligence agencies stepped in through subtler channels  Both the CIA and Britain s MI  played pivotal roles in psychological warfare and covert influence operations across the Arab world  Using soft power and digital penetration  they launched invisible waves of mental conditioning via foreign funded media  cultural organisations  and social platforms that morphed from spaces of free expression into elaborate laboratories for emotional and ideological manipulation  Public anger was outsourced  protests were scheduled by Greenwich Mean Time  and dreams of revolution were reduced to trending hashtags  In this engineered confusion  identity was fragmented  and legitimate demands were turned into explosions that ripped through the nation s foundations 
 nbsp 
MI   in particular  has a long and discreet history of meddling in the region s religious and cultural veins  The agency did not limit itself to espionage in the traditional sense but mastered the art of reprogramming consciousness from within  Through selective support of marginal religious currents  it fuelled ideologies that leaned heavily on mystical narratives  most notably the strategic amplification of messianic ideas such as the imminent arrival of the        Mahdi         These narratives were no accident  they were subtly encouraged to promote passive hope over active resistance  turning religion from a liberating force into a mechanism of delay and submission  By nurturing a psychological climate of expectation and detachment  MI  contributed to the erosion of political agency  where people clung to metaphysical salvation while their tangible world collapsed  The result was a population conditioned to wait for divine intervention instead of forging a national revival 
 nbsp 
Within this same orchestrated landscape  Islamic movements were weaponised   sometimes with their complicity  other times with calculated infiltration  These groups promoted distorted religious doctrines that suffocated the spirit of resistance under the guise of        obedience         dulled awareness in the name of        avoiding fitna         and demonised any act of liberation as        rebellion against the ruler         Grand ideals were hollowed out  jihad was twisted into civil war  the caliphate into blood soaked fantasy  and religion into a cloak worn by those plotting to assassinate the homeland rather than defend it 
 nbsp 
Yet none of this manipulation would have taken root without internal vulnerabilities  A decaying educational system  hollow media rhetoric  and a cultural vacuum devoid of inspiring figures created a fertile ground for chaos and extremism  The Arab youth today can quote the price of their smartphones better than they can name the martyrs of their nation  Cities like Beirut  Baghdad  and Damascus   once radiant beacons of Arab thought   have dimmed  Along with them  the dreams of generations have faded  some chronicled by Naguib Mahfouz  others mourned by Mahmoud Darwish  and many still waiting to be written 
 nbsp 
Meanwhile  Israel watched  guided  and rejoiced  It was not merely an occupying force but a strategic mastermind   the spearhead of fragmentation lodged deep within the Arab world  Through intelligence alliances and security networks  it fuelled divisions  promoted fragmentation  and marketed the failures of Arab regimes as proof that unity is impossible  resistance is futile  and surrender is pragmatic  Israel s greatest success lay in transforming the Arab Israeli conflict into an endless series of Arab Arab conflicts  making its presence feel ordinary in a region drowning in self inflicted wounds 
 nbsp 
Today  after decades of psychological  cultural  and political ruin  the Arab citizen is confronted with a question far more complex than any colonial map  Do we still have the capacity to forge a self defined project  Can we afford to dream  Or have our nations become temporary theatres where Western labs redraw our fate  Can we reclaim our awareness before demanding the return of our land or our sovereignty  And perhaps most painfully  what does it mean to be Arab in an age when borders are illusions and the soul of the region lies scattered 
 nbsp 
Perhaps we don t need new maps   we need a compass that will help us navigate back to ourselves in a world where every direction has been obscured  Without the restoration of memory  we will continue to live inside stories written by our adversaries  with pens we have handed them ourselves
