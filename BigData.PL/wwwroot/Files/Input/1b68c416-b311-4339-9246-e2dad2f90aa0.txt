							The Ministry of Planning has released the second follow up report of the NWFE  programme  which reviewed the ongoing progress of Egypt s sustainable transport pillar  This initiative  part of a broader national strategy to develop an integrated  green transport network  supports Egypt s climate action goals while promoting food security  agricultural productivity  and the expansion of renewable energy sources 
Minister of Planning  Economic Development and International Cooperation Rania Al Mashat emphasized the critical role the transport sector plays in supporting economic development and attracting foreign investment  She noted that the NWFE  programme aligns with Egypt s vision of becoming a regional logistics hub by modernizing infrastructure through environmentally sustainable projects 
Launched in November       the sustainable transport pillar of NWFE  was established through a strategic agreement between the Ministry of Transport  the European Investment Bank  EIB   and the Ministry of Planning  Since its inception  the programme has initiated preparatory work on several key transportation projects  These include the extension of Cairo Metro Line   to Shebin El Qanater  the transformation of the Abu Qir railway in Alexandria into an electric metro  the construction of the Rubiki   th of Ramadan Belbis railway line  and the Tanta Mansoura Damietta railway line  In       the programme added the Sherbin Qalin Damanhour railway line to its development agenda  Due to the scale of the Abu Qir metro project  it has been split into two implementation phases 
One of the programme s major milestones was the signing of a partnership agreement in late      between Egyptian ministries and several international financial institutions  As part of the agreement  the European Investment Bank committed to coordinating technical support grants that would fund preliminary studies and assessments for the selected projects  In       these efforts expanded with the signing of co financing agreements for the Rubiki   th of Ramadan Belbis railway line with the French Development Agency and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development  EBRD   The EIB also sent a technical mission to Cairo to evaluate progress and discuss future priorities under the sustainable transport pillar 
That same year  Egypt and its European development partners finalized an agreement to provide   m in technical support from the European Investment Bank  Additional support from the EBRD was also allocated for conducting feasibility studies for three major projects  the extension of Metro Line   from New Marj to Shebin El Qanater  the Abu Qir railway transformation in Alexandria  and the development of the Sherbin Qalin Damanhour railway  Meanwhile  implementation continues on the Tanta Mansoura Damietta railway line  which had already been in progress 
Looking ahead to       the NWFE  programme will prioritize the completion of feasibility studies and the identification of new sources for technical and environmental support grants  A key focus will be to secure investment grants that will facilitate project implementation  The programme also aims to encourage greater private sector participation while maintaining strong coordination with international development partners  These steps fall under a new strategic approach proposed by the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Transport  which seeks to accelerate sustainable transport development and further integrate Egypt into the global green economy
