Google uses its technology to serve advertisements based on website content  the user s geographical location  and other factors  Those wanting to advertise with Google s targeted advertisement system may enroll through Google Ads  AdSense has become one of the most popular programs specializing in creating and placing banner and responsive ads on websites and blogs  Responsive ads            adjust themselves based upon user s device size  These advertisements are less intrusive and the content of the advertisements is often relevant to the website  Many websites use AdSense to make revenue from their web content  website  online videos  online audio content  etc    and it is the most popular advertising network             AdSense has proved particularly useful for generating advertising revenue for small websites that do not have sufficient resources or other major sources of revenue  To display contextually relevant advertisements on a website  webmasters place a brief JavaScript code on the website s pages  Websites that are content rich have been very successful with this advertising program  as noted in a number of publisher case studies on the AdSense website  Google has removed the policy of limiting AdSense ads to three ads per page  Now  AdSense publishers can place several AdSense ads on a page given there is sufficient content on a webpage  According to Google guidelines on ensuring proper ad placement             advertising and promotional material should not exceed page content 
Some webmasters put significant effort into maximizing their AdSense income  They do this mainly by following            best practices 

They produce good quality content that attracts and engages users and provides a good user experience 
They follow webmaster guidelines 
They avoid flooding their website with advertisements 
They do not try methods that encourage users to click ads  Google prohibits webmasters from using phrases like  Click on my AdSense ads  to increase click rates  The phrases accepted are  Sponsored Links  and  Advertisements  
They do not link or redirect to websites with a poor reputation 
The source of all AdSense income is the Ads program  which in turn has a complex pricing model based on a Vickrey second price auction  AdSense requires an advertiser to submit a sealed bid  i e   a bid not observable by competitors   Additionally  for any given click received  advertisers only pay one bid increment above the second highest bid  Google currently shares     of revenue generated by AdSense with content network partners  and     of revenue generated by AdSense with AdSense for Search partners             On June           Google announced rebranding of AdSense with a new logo

History
Google launched its AdSense program  originally named  Content targeting advertising  in March                   The AdSense name was originally used by Applied Semantics  a competitive offering to AdSense  The name was adopted by Google after Google acquired Applied Semantics in April                   Some advertisers complained that AdSense yielded worse results than Google Ads  since it served ads that related contextually to the content on a web page and that content was less likely to be related to a user s commercial desires than search results  For example  someone browsing a blog dedicated to flowers was less likely to be interested in ordering flowers than someone searching for terms related to flowers  As a result  in      Google allowed its advertisers to opt out of the AdSense network             
Paul Buchheit  the founder of Gmail  had the idea to run ads within Google s e mail service  But he and others say it was Susan Wojcicki  with the backing of Sergey Brin  who organized the team that adapted that idea into an enormously successful product              By early      AdSense accounted for an estimated    percent of Google s total revenues              In       Google AdSense announced that it would now be offering new features  including the ability to  enable multiple networks to display ads   In February       Google AdSense started using search history in contextual matching to offer more relevant ads              On January           Google AdSense launched Direct Campaigns  a tool where publishers may directly sell ads  This feature was retired on February          

Types
Content
The content based advertisements can be targeted at users with certain interests or contexts  The targeting can be CPC  cost per click  or CPM  cost per thousand impressions  based  the only significant difference in CPC and CPM is that with CPC targeting  earnings are based on clicks while CPM earnings recently are actually based not just per views impression but on a larger scale  per thousand impressions  therefore driving it from the market  which makes CPC ads more common 
There are various ad sizes available for content ads  The ads can be simple text  image  animated image  flash video  video  or rich media ads  At most ad sizes  users can change whether to show both text and multimedia ads or just one of them  As of November               update       a grey arrow appears beneath AdSense text ads for easier identification  Google made a policy update regarding the number of ads per page  the three ads per page limit has been removed             

Search
AdSense for search allows publishers to display ads relating to search terms on their site and receive     of the revenue generated from those ads             AdSense custom search ads can be displayed either alongside the results from an AdSense Custom Search Engine or alongside internal search results through the use of Custom Search Ads  Custom Search Ads are only available to  white listed  publishers  Although the revenue share from AdSense for Search       is lower than from AdSense for Content       higher returns can be achieved due to the potential for higher Click Through Rates 

Video
AdSense for video allows publishers with video content  e g   video hosting websites  to generate revenue using ad placements from Google s extensive advertising network  The publisher is able to decide what type of ads are shown with their video inventory  Formats available include linear video ads  pre roll or post roll   overlay ads that display AdSense text and display ads over the video content  and the TrueView format              Publishers can also display companion ads   display ads that run alongside video content outside the player  AdSense for video is for publishers running video content within a player and not for YouTube publishers 

Link units
Link units are closely targeted to the interests of users  Because users directly interact with the ad unit  they may be more interested in the ads they eventually see 
AdSense publishers are paid for clicks on the ads that are linked from link unit topics  not for clicks on the initial topics themselves  The ads on the linked page are pay per click Google ads similar to those shown in regular AdSense ad units  Link Units

Discontinued types
Mobile content
AdSense for mobile content allowed publishers to generate earnings from their mobile websites using targeted Google advertisements  Just like AdSense for content  Google matches advertisements to the content of a website   in this case  a mobile website  Instead of traditional JavaScript code  technologies such as Java and Objective C are used  As of February       AdSense for Mobile Content was rolled into the core AdSense for Content offering to better reflect the lessening separation between desktop and mobile content             

Domains
AdSense for domains allows advertisements to be placed on domain names that have not been developed  This offers domain name owners a way to monetize  make money from  domain names that are otherwise dormant or not in use  AdSense for domains is currently being offered to all AdSense publishers  but it wasn t always available to all  On December           TechCrunch reported that AdSense for Domains is available for all US publishers              On February           Google announced that it was shutting down its Hosted AdSense for Domains program             

Feeds
In May       Google announced a limited participation beta version of AdSense for Feeds              a version of AdSense that runs on RSS and Atom feeds that have more than     active subscribers  According to the Official Google Blog   advertisers have their ads placed in the most appropriate feed articles  publishers are paid for their original content  readers see relevant advertising and in the long run  more quality feeds to choose from               AdSense for Feeds works by inserting images into a feed  When the image is displayed by a RSS reader or Web browser  Google writes the advertising content into the image that it returns  The advertisement content is chosen based on the content of the feed surrounding the image  When the user clicks the image  he or she is redirected to the advertiser s website in the same way as regular AdSense advertisements  AdSense for Feeds remained in its beta state until August           when it became available to all AdSense users  On December          Google discontinued AdSense For Feeds program             

How it works
The webmaster who wishes to participate in AdSense inserts the AdSense JavaScript code into a webpage 
Each time this page is visited by an end user  e g   a person surfing the Internet   the JavaScript code uses inlined JSON to display content fetched from Google s servers             
For contextual advertisements  Google s servers use a web cache of the page created by its Mediabot  crawler  to determine a set of high value keywords  If keywords have been cached already  advertisements are served for those keywords based on the Ads bidding system 
For website targeted advertisements  the advertiser chooses the page s  on which to display advertisements  and pays based on cost per mille  CPM   or the price advertisers choose to pay for every thousand advertisements displayed             
For referrals  Google adds money to the advertiser s account when visitors either download the referred software or subscribe to the referred service              The referral program was retired in August                  
Search advertisements are added to the list of results after the visitor user performs a search 
Because the JavaScript is sent to the Web browser when the page is requested  it is possible for other website owners to copy the JavaScript code into their own webpages  To protect against this type of fraud  AdSense publishers can specify the pages on which advertisements should be shown  AdSense then ignores clicks from pages other than those specified   see Click fraud for more information  
Reception

Some webmasters create websites tailored to lure searchers from Google and other engines onto their AdSense website to make money from clicks  Such websites often contain nothing but a large amount of interconnected  automated content  e g   a directory with content from the Open Directory Project  or  scraper  websites relying on RSS feeds for content   Possibly the most popular form of such  AdSense farms  are splogs  spam blogs   which are poorly written content centered around known high paying keywords  Many of these websites reuse content from other websites  such as Wikipedia  to attract visitors  These and related approaches are considered to be search engine spam and can be reported to Google              A Made for AdSense  MFA  website or webpage has little or no content  but is filled with advertisements so that users have no choice but to click on advertisements  Such pages were tolerated in the past  but due to complaints  Google now disables such accounts  There have also been reports of Trojan horses engineered to produce counterfeit Google advertisements that are formatted looking like legitimate ones  The Trojan uploads itself onto an unsuspecting user s computer through a webpage and then replaces the original advertisements with its own set of malicious advertisements             
In May       Hagens Berman law firm filed a national class action lawsuit against Google  claiming the company unlawfully denies payments to thousands of website owners and operators who place ads on their sites sold through Google AdWords             
There were numerous complaints in online discussion forums about a difference in treatment for publishers from China and India  namely that sites from those locations are required to be active for six months before being eligible for AdSense                                     
Due to alleged concerns about click fraud  Google AdSense has been criticized by some search engine optimization firms as a large source of what Google calls  invalid clicks   in which one company clicks on a rival s search engine advertisements to drive up the other company s costs              The payment terms for webmasters have also been criticized  Google withholds payment until an account reaches US                 
Google came under fire when the official Google AdSense Blog showcased the French video website Imineo com  This website violated Google s AdSense Program Policies by displaying AdSense alongside sexually explicit material      citation needed      Typically  websites displaying AdSense have been banned from showing such content              Using both AdSense and Google Ads may cause a website to pay Google a commission when the website advertises itself              In some cases  AdSense displays inappropriate or offensive ads  For example  in a news story about a terrorist attack in India  an advert was generated for a  presumably non existent  educational qualification in terrorism              AdSense uses tracking cookies that are viewed by some users as a threat to privacy              AdSense terms of service require that sites using AdSense explain the use of these cookies in their privacy policy
