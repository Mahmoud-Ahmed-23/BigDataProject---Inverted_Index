Guide for System Design   System Design FundamentalsLet us first begin the System Design Interview Bootcamp with the basics and fundamental terms and concepts used in System Design     Functional and Non Functional RequirementsFunctional Requirements These are the requirements that the end user specifically demands as basic facilities that the system should offer  All these functionalities need to be necessarily incorporated into the system as a part of the contract  These are represented or stated in the form of input to be given to the system  the operation performed and the output expected  They are basically the requirements stated by the user which one can see directly in the final productNon functional requirements These are basically the quality constraints that the system must satisfy according to the project contract  The priority or extent to which these factors are implemented varies from one project to other  They are also called non behavioral requirements Note  Functional vs non Functional requirements    Horizontal and Vertical scalingIn horizontal scaling  we enhance the performance of the server by adding more machines to the network and sharing the processing and memory workload across multiple devices  We add more instances of the server to the existing pool of servers and distribute the load among these servers  In this approach  there is no need to change the server s capacity or replace the server  Also  like vertical scaling  there is no downtime while adding more servers to the network In simple terms upgrading the capacity of a single machine or moving to a new machine with more power is called vertical scaling  You can add more power to your machine by adding better processors  increasing RAM  or other power increasing adjustments  Vertical scaling can be easily achieved by switching from small to bigger machines but remember that this involves downtime     CAP TheoremThe three letters in CAP refer to three desirable properties of distributed systems with replicated data  consistency  among replicated copies   availability  of the system for read and write operations  and partition tolerance  in the face of the nodes in the system being partitioned by a network fault   The CAP theorem states that it is not possible to guarantee all three of the desirable properties   consistency  availability  and partition tolerance at the same time in a distributed system with data replication      MicroservicesMicroservice is a small  loosely coupled distributed service  It has evolved as a solution to the scalability  independently deployable  and innovation challenges with Monolithic architecture  It allows you to take a large application and decompose or break it into easily manageable small components with narrowly defined responsibilities  It is considered the building block of modern applications  Microservices can be written in a variety of programming languages  and frameworks  and each service acts as a mini application on its own      Proxy ServersProxy servers act as intermediaries between client devices and servers  They improve performance by caching frequently requested content  provide security by filtering incoming traffic  and enable load balancing for efficient distribution of requests        Redundancy and ReplicationRedundancy in system design is the intentional inclusion of extra components  systems  or resources to ensure continued functionality in the event of a failure  Redundancy aims to eliminate single points of failure  enhancing system reliability and fault tolerance  This can be achieved through techniques such as duplicating critical hardware components or having backup systems ready to take over seamlessly  Replication  on the other hand  involves creating and maintaining copies of data or entire systems across multiple locations  The primary goal of replication is to improve data availability  distribute the load  and enhance fault tolerance  In distributed databases  data replication ensures that if one server or node fails  another can take over with the same dataset  This redundancy of data contributes to resilience  reducing the risk of data loss and improving overall system performance     Procedure to Design SystemsSystem design is the process of designing the architecture and components of a software system to meet specific business requirements  The process involves defining the system s architecture  components  modules  and interfaces  and identifying the technologies and tools that will be used to implement the system  Here are some steps to get started with system design Understand the requirements  Before you begin designing the system  you need to understand the requirements  This involves talking to stakeholders and users  reviewing existing documentation  and analyzing the business processes that the system will support Define the system architecture  Once you have a clear understanding of the requirements  you can begin defining the system architecture  This involves identifying the major components of the system and the interfaces between them Choose the technology stack  Based on the requirements and the system architecture  you can select the technology stack  This includes choosing the programming language  database  frameworks  and libraries that will be used to implement the system Design the modules  Next  you need to design the modules that will make up the system  This involves defining the functions that each module will perform and the data that it will manipulate Plan for scalability  As you design the system  you need to consider how it will scale  This involves identifying potential bottlenecks and designing the system to handle increased loads Consider security and privacy  Security and privacy should be a key consideration in system design  as mentioned later in this System Design Interview Bootcamp  This involves identifying potential security threats and designing the system to mitigate them Test and validate  Once the system design is complete  you need to test and validate it  This involves creating test cases and scenarios that simulate real world usage and verifying that the system meets the requirements    What is High Level Design High level design or HLD refers to the overall system  a design that consists description of the system architecture and design and is a generic system design that includes System architectureDatabase designBrief description of systems  services  platforms  and relationships among modules High level design or HLD is also known as macro level designing    Storage options in System Design    Block StorageBlock storage involves dividing data into fixed sized blocks and storing them on block devices such as hard drives or solid state drives  SSDs   These blocks are accessed using low level block level protocols  typically through storage area networks  SANs  or direct attached storage  DAS      File StorageFile Storage is very important in every System Design  So it is very important in this System Design Interview Bootcamp to learn about it in detail File storage stores data as files and presents it to its final users as a hierarchical directories structure  It is typically accessed using file level protocols like Network File System  NFS  or Server Message Block  SMB   File storage can be implemented using network attached storage  NAS  devices or distributed file systems     Object StorageFiles are divided into little parts and dispersed over hardware in a flat structure  Instead of being maintained as files in directories or as blocks on servers  the data is divided up into discrete parts called objects and kept in a single repository with object storage  Object storage systems typically use a RESTful API for accessing and managing data     Redundant Disk Arrays  RAID RAID combines multiple physical disk drives into a single logical unit to improve performance  reliability  or a combination of both  RAID is very transparent to the underlying system  This means  that to the host system  it appears as a single big disk presenting itself as a linear array of blocks  This allows older technologies to be replaced by RAID without making too many changes to the existing code     Message QueuesMessage queues facilitate communication between distributed systems by allowing asynchronous communication  This decouples the components  enabling them to operate independently and improving system reliability  It is a form of communication and data transfer mechanism used in computer science and system design  It functions as a temporary storage and routing system for messages exchanged between different components  applications  or systems within a larger software architecture      Kafka Message QueueKafka is a distributed streaming platform that excels in handling real time data streams  It is used for building real time data pipelines and streaming applications    Types of File Systems    Google File System GFS Google Inc  developed the Google File System  GFS   a scalable distributed file system  DFS   to meet the company s growing data processing needs  GFS offers fault tolerance  dependability  scalability  availability  and performance to big networks and connected nodes  GFS is made up of a number of storage systems constructed from inexpensive commodity hardware parts  The search engine  which creates enormous volumes of data that must be kept  is only one example of how it is customized to meet Google s various data use and storage requirements     Hadoop Distributed File System HDFS With growing data velocity the data size easily outgrows the storage limit of a machine  A solution would be to store the data across a network of machines  Such filesystems are called distributed filesystems  Since data is stored across a network all the complications of a network come in  This is where Hadoop comes in  It provides one of the most reliable filesystems  HDFS  Hadoop Distributed File System  is a unique design that provides storage for extremely large files with streaming data access pattern and it runs on commodity hardware     Design Patterns in System Design Interview BootcampDesign patterns are used to represent some of the best practices adapted by experienced object oriented software developers  A design pattern systematically names  motivates  and explains a general design that addresses a recurring design problem in object oriented systems  It describes the problem  the solution  when to apply the solution  and its consequences      Bloom FiltersIt is a space efficient probabilistic data structure used to test whether a given element is a member of a set  It achieves this by using multiple hash functions to map elements to a bit array  While false positives are possible  false negatives are not  This makes Bloom filters valuable in scenarios where memory is constrained  and a slight risk of false positives is acceptable  such as in caching systems and network routing tables     Consistent HashingIt is a technique used in distributed systems to efficiently distribute data across a changing set of nodes  Unlike traditional hash functions  consistent hashing minimizes the impact of adding or removing nodes  ensuring that most keys remain mapped to the same nodes  This is particularly useful in scenarios like distributed caching and load balancing  where maintaining a stable mapping despite node changes is essential for performance and data integrity     QuorumIn distributed systems  a quorum is a strategy to achieve consensus among a majority of nodes  It helps in ensuring that a certain number of nodes must agree on an operation for it to be considered successful  Quorums are crucial for maintaining data consistency and availability  especially in scenarios prone to network partitions  Variations like the  two thirds  or  majority  quorum systems are common in databases  providing a balance between fault tolerance and system responsiveness     ChecksumA checksum is a value derived from the data in a file or message  used to verify its integrity  Various algorithms  like CRC or Adler     calculate checksums  and if the checksum of the received data matches the calculated checksum  it indicates that the data is likely intact  Checksums are widely used in data transmission and storage to detect errors  ensuring data reliability and preventing the propagation of corrupt information     Merkle TreesIt is a hierarchical data structure that facilitates efficient verification of large datasets  It works by recursively hashing pairs of data until a single hash  known as the Merkle root  is obtained  If any part of the data changes  it only affects the path from the altered data to the root  simplifying verification  Merkle trees are commonly used in distributed systems and cryptocurrencies to ensure data consistency and integrity without transmitting the entire dataset     Leader ElectionIt is a crucial concept in distributed systems where nodes must select a leader to coordinate and manage the distributed activities  Algorithms like Paxos and Raft are often employed for leader election  ensuring that one node takes charge while others follow  This leadership structure simplifies decision making  improves coordination  and enhances the efficiency of distributed systems    Databases in System Design    Relational databasesMySQL  It is an open source Relational Database Management System that stores data in a structured format using rows and columns   MYSQL language is easy to use as compared to other programming language like C  C    Java  etc  By learning some basic commands we can work  create and interact with the Database PostgreSQL  PostgreSQL is an advanced and open source relational database system and is used as a database for many web applications  mobile and analytics applications  It supports both SQL  relational  and JSON  non relational  queryingSQL Joins are operations used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them  Common types of joins include Inner Join  Returns rows when there is a match in both tables Left  Outer  Join  Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table Right  Outer  Join  Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table Full  Outer  Join  Returns all rows when there is a match in either table Cross Join  Returns the Cartesian product of rows from both tables  all possible combinations  Self Join  Joins a table with itself based on a related column     Non relational databasesMongoDB  The most popular NoSQL database  is an open source document oriented database  The term  NoSQL  means  non relational   It means that MongoDB isn t based on the table like relational database structure but provides an altogether different mechanism for storage and retrieval of data  This format of storage is called BSON    How to choose a database There are so many databases are available and picking up one database over another is a complicated decision  Well  there is no real formula you can follow but there are a few things you should think about  irstly set aside the idea that you are going to find the one true database that is better than everything else  Now ask a few important questions related to your project How much data do you expect to store when the application is mature How many users do you expect to handle simultaneously at peak load What availability  scalability  latency  throughput  and data consistency does your application need How often will your database schemas change What is the geographic distribution of your user population What is the natural  shape  of your data Does your application need online transaction processing  OLTP   analytic queries  OLAP   or both What ratio of reads to writes do you expect in production What are your preferred programming languages Do you have a budget  If so  will it cover licenses and support contracts How strict are you with invalid data being sent to your database   Ideally  you are very strict and do server side data validation before persisting it to your database Note  Also check SQL vs NoSQL Database    Database SchemasA database schema is a logical representation of data that shows how the data in a database should be stored logically  It shows how the data is organized and the relationship between the tables  Database schema contains table  field  views and relation between different keys like primary key  foreign key Data is stored in the form of files which is unstructured in nature which makes accessing the data difficult  Thus to resolve the issue the data are organized in structured way with the help of database schema Database Queries  Queries are used to retrieve and manipulate data from databases using SQL or other query languages     ACID PropertiesIn order to maintain consistency in a database  before and after the transaction  certain properties are followed  These are called ACID properties  Atomicity  By this  we mean that either the entire transaction takes place at once or doesn t happen at all  There is no midway i e  transactions do not occur partially  Consistency  This means that integrity constraints must be maintained so that the database is consistent before and after the transaction  It refers to the correctness of a database Isolation  This property ensures that multiple transactions can occur concurrently without leading to the inconsistency of the database state  Transactions occur independently without interference Durability  This property ensures that once the transaction has completed execution  the updates and modifications to the database are stored in and written to disk and they persist even if a system failure occurs     Sharding and PartitioningShardingSharding repre sents a technique use d to enhance the scalability and pe rformance of database manageme nt for handling large amounts of data  This approach involves fragmenting the extensive datase t into smaller  self contained se gments known as shards  These shards are  then allocated to separate  servers or nodes  facilitating paralle lism in data processing  As a result  query re sponse times are improve d  high traffic loads can be accommodated  and bottlene cks are mitigated PartitioningPartitioning is an optimization technique  in databases where a single  table is divided into smaller se gments called partitions  These  partitions hold subsets of the table s data base d on specific criteria like value  ranges or categories  This strate gy enhances query pe rformance by reducing the amount of scanne d data  resulting in faster retrie val times  Furthermore  partitioning simplifie s maintenance tasks such as backup and indexing since  they can be focused on individual partitions     Database IndexingIndexing improves database performance by minimizing the number of disc visits required to fulfill a query  It is a data structure technique used to locate and quickly access data in databases  Several database fields are used to generate indexes  The main key or candidate key of the table is duplicated in the first column  which is the Search key  To speed up data retrieval  the values are also kept in sorted order  It should be highlighted that sorting the data is not required  The second column is the Data Reference or Pointer which contains a set of pointers holding the address of the disk block where that particular key value can be found    What is Low Level Design LLD  as the name suggests  stands for low level design  It is a component level design process that follows step by step refinement process  The input to LLD is HLD  LLD describes class diagrams with the help of methods and relations between classes and program specs  It describes the modules so that the programmer can directly code the program from the document  It provides us with the structure and behavior of class as different entities have different character sets  From this design  it is easy for a developer to write down logic and henceforth the actual code for it      What are distributed systems Distributed System is a collection of autonomous computer systems that are physically separated but are connected by a centralized computer network that is equipped with distributed system software  The autonomous computers will communicate among each system by sharing resources and files and performing the tasks assigned to them      Characteristics of Distributed SystemResource Sharing  It is the ability to use any Hardware  Software  or Data anywhere in the System Openness  It is concerned with Extensions and improvements in the system Concurrency  It is naturally present in Distributed Systems  that deal with the same activity or functionality that can be performed by separate users who are in remote locations  Every local system has its independent Operating Systems and Resources Scalability  It increases the scale of the system as a number of processors communicate with more users by accommodating to improve the responsiveness of the system Fault tolerance  It cares about the reliability of the system if there is a failure in Hardware or Software  the system continues to operate properly without degrading the performance the system Transparency  It hides the complexity of the Distributed Systems to the Users and Application programs as there should be privacy in every system Heterogeneity  Networks  computer hardware  operating systems  programming languages  and developer implementations can all vary and differ among dispersed system components     Distributed System FailuresMethod failure   In this type of failure  the distributed system is generally halted and unable to perform the execution  Sometimes it leads to ending up the execution resulting in an associate incorrect outcome  Method failure causes the system state to deviate from specifications  and also method might fail to progress System failure  In system failure  the processor associated with the distributed system fails to perform the execution  This is caused by computer code errors and hardware issues  Hardware issues may involve CPU memory bus failure  This is assumed that whenever the system stops its execution due to some fault then the interior state is lost Secondary storage device failure  A storage device failure is claimed to have occurred once the keep information can t be accessed  This failure is sometimes caused by parity error  head crash  or dirt particles settled on the medium Communication medium failure  A communication medium failure happens once a web site cannot communicate with another operational site within the network  it s typically caused by the failure of the shift nodes and or the links of the human activity system      Failure ModelsTiming failure  Timing failure occurs when a node in a system correctly sends a response  but the response arrives earlier or later than anticipated  Timing failures  also known as performance failures  occur when a node delivers a response that is either earlier or later than anticipated Response failure  When a server s response is flawed  a response failure occurs  The response s value could     be off or transmitted using the inappropriate control flow Omission failure  A timing issue known as an  infinite late  or omission failure occurs when the node s answer never appears to have been sent Crash failure  If a node encounters an omission failure once and then totally stops responding and goes unresponsive  this is known as a crash failure Arbitrary failure   A server may produce arbitrary response at arbitrary times      Distributed System Fundamentals     MapReduceMapReduce is a programming model used for efficient processing in parallel over large data sets in a distributed manner  The data is first split and then combined to produce the final result  The libraries for MapReduce is written in so many programming languages with various different different optimizations  The purpose of MapReduce in Hadoop is to Map each of the jobs and then it will reduce it to equivalent tasks for providing less overhead over the cluster network and to reduce the processing power  The MapReduce task is mainly divided into two phases Map Phase and Reduce Phase       Stateless and Stateful systems       Stateless SystemsIn a stateless system  each request from a client to a server is independent and self contained  The server does not retain any information about the client s previous requests or state  Every request is treated as new  and the server doesn t store any data or context about the client between requests  This design philosophy simplifies scalability since any server can handle any request from the client  Stateless systems are often more fault tolerant and easier to scale horizontally because each request is isolated  and there are no dependencies on previous interactions        Stateful systemsIn a stateful system  the server keeps track of the state or context of the client across multiple requests  The server retains information about the client s interactions  allowing for a continuous and personalized experience  This is particularly useful for applications that involve sessions  user authentication  or complex workflows where the server needs to remember past actions or maintain a certain state  Stateful systems offer advantages in terms of convenience and efficiency      RaftIt is a consensus algorithm designed to manage a replicated log in a distributed system  Developed by Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout  Raft aims to provide a straightforward yet efficient approach to distributed consensus  The primary use case for Raft is ensuring that a group of nodes  servers  can agree on a sequence of entries in a log  even if some nodes may fail or behave unpredictably     UML Diagrams for System DesignUnified Modeling Language  UML  is a general purpose modelling language  The main aim of UML is to define a standard way to visualize the way a system has been designed  It is quite similar to blueprints used in other fields of engineering  UML is not a programming language  it is rather a visual language  We use UML diagrams to portray the behavior and structure of a systemDifferent Types of Diagrams Component Diagrams  They are used to show code modules of a system in Unified Modeling Language  UML   They are generally used for modeling subsystems  It represents how each and every component acts during execution and running of a system program  Activity Diagrams  We use them to illustrate the flow of control in a system and refer to the steps involved in the execution of a use case  We model sequential and concurrent activities using activity diagrams  So  we basically depict workflows visually using an activity diagram Use Case Diagram  It is a vital tool in this System Design Interview Bootcamp  it provides a visual representation of how users interact with a system  It serves as a blueprint for understanding the functional requirements of a system from a user s perspective  aiding in the communication between stakeholders and guiding the development process Sequence diagram  It is the most commonly used interaction diagram   An interaction diagram is used to show the interactive behavior of a system  Since visualizing the interactions in a system can be a difficult task  we use different types of interaction diagrams to capture various features and aspects of interaction in a systemData Flow Diagram  The flow of data of a system or a process is represented by DFD  It also gives insight into the inputs and outputs of each entity and the process itself  DFD does not have control flow and no loops or decision rules are present Entity Relational Model  It is a model for identifying entities to be represented in the database and representation of how those entities are related  The ER data model specifies enterprise schema that represents the overall logical structure of a database graphically  Package diagram  It is a type of UML diagram mainly used to represent the organization and the structure of a system in the form of packages  A package is used as a container to organize the elements present in the system into a more manageable unit  It is very useful to represent the system s architecture and design as a cohesive unit and a concise manner     Scalable web applications     DNSDomain Name System  DNS  is a hostname for IP address translation service  DNS is a distributed database implemented in a hierarchy of name servers  It is an application layer protocol for message exchange between clients and servers  It is required for the functioning of the Internet      Load BalancerA load balancer works as a  traffic cop  sitting in front of your server and routing client requests across all servers  It simply distributes the set of requested operations  database write requests  cache queries  effectively across multiple servers and ensures that no single server bears too many requests that lead to degrading the overall performance of the application  A load balancer can be a physical device or a virtualized instance running on specialized hardware or a software process       N tier ApplicationsAn N tier architecture  also known as multi tier or layered architecture  is a design approach for software applications that divides the entire application into a set of interconnected and logically separated layers or tiers  Each tier represents a specific functionality or set of related functionalities  This architecture enhances modularity  scalability  and maintainability by organizing the application into distinct layers  each with a specific role and responsibility  The  N  in N tier represents the number of tiers or layers in the architecture  and it commonly refers to three tier or four tier architectures      HTTP and REST       HTTPIt is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web  It is an application layer protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents  such as HTML  Developed primarily to facilitate communication between web browsers and servers  HTTP follows a client server model  where the client initiates requests  and the server provides responses        RESTREST is an architectural style for designing networked applications  It was introduced by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation and emphasizes a stateless client server communication model  RESTful systems adhere to a set of constraints to achieve simplicity  scalability  and uniformity      Stream processingIt is a computing paradigm that involves the continuous processing of data streams in real time  Unlike batch processing  where data is collected  stored  and processed in chunks  stream processing deals with data continuously as it is generated  This approach is crucial in scenarios where low latency  real time insights  and immediate actions on data are essential     CachingCaching is a system design concept that involves storing frequently accessed data in a location that is easily and quickly accessible  The purpose of caching is to improve the performance and efficiency of a system by reducing the amount of time it takes to access frequently accessed data Caching can be used in a variety of different systems  including web applications  databases  and operating systems  In each case  caching works by storing data that is frequently accessed in a location that is closer to the user or application  This can include storing data in memory or on a local hard drive      Cache invalidationCache invalidation is a state where we push away the data from the cache memory when the data present is outdated so do we perform this operation of pushing back flushing the cache otherwise this still data will result in inconsistency of data  When cached data gets stale or inaccurate  cache invalidation is the process of removing or updating it  The terms  purge    refresh   and  ban  are often used in content delivery networks  CDNs   web proxies  and application caches as cache invalidation techniques      Cache evictionCache eviction is the process of removing data from a cache when the cache becomes full or when the data is no longer needed  There are several different types of cache eviction algorithms used by computer systems  including Time Based EvictionCount Based EvictionQuery Result EvictionCache Region Clearing    Essential Security Measures in System DesignIn this System Design Interview Bootcamp  ensuring the security of the systems is a top notch priority  This article will deep into the aspects of why it is necessary to build secure systems and maintain them  With various threats like cyberattacks  Data Breaches  and other Vulnerabilities  it has become very important for system administrators to incorporate robust security measures into their systems  Some of the ways to ensure the security of your system are Authentication  It is a crucial step or way to ensure the security of a system  it is very necessary to identify the person who is using that certain device  and to do so users need to authenticate themselves before using the machine  Authorization  It is a process in which the authority of the particular user trying to access a system is checked  It is as important as the authentication process  in this process the users are verified and their authority to access the system is being checked  It is done after the Authentication process  Data Encryption  It is also a crucial step to ensure the safety of any system  Secure Coding Practices  It is necessary to safeguard a system from various types of Cyber Threats  By following these practices  it is possible to safeguard the sensitive an confidential data  restrict unauthorized access  maintain the integrity of the system etc  Proper validation of the input and access control mechanism are important to stop common cyber attacks Network Security  It is also a important security measure in case of System Design  as it helps in maintaining the Confidentiality  Integrity and Availability of the data stored in the system  Network Security comes into play when there is a need to transfer data or for any kind of communication purpose between two systems  having a strict network security policy will create a safe passage to transfer data or information keeping their intergrity and security  Secure Communication Protocols  They are vital for System Design when it comes to data transmission  These protocols help in ensuring the information remains confidential  integral and safe from any unauthorized access  Using secure protocols like SSL TLS and HTTPS while transferring data is highly recommended to securely transmit sensitive data  most of the industries use this Third Party Risk Management  It is essential to learn in this System Design Interview Bootcamp to reduce the vulnerabilities caused by external factors like partners  vendors or services  Modern Systems rely on various Third Party applications like APIs and Cloud Services  so it is easy to get affected by any of them      Machine Learning and System DesignSystem design in machine learning is vital for scalability  performance  and efficiency  It ensures effective data management  model deployment  monitoring  and resource optimization  while also addressing security  privacy  and regulatory compliance  A well designed system enables seamless integration  adaptability  cost control  and collaborative development  ultimately making machine learning solutions robust  reliable  and capable of real world deployment     Containerization and System DesignContainerization is a lightweight form of virtualization that allows applications and their dependencies to be packaged and run consistently across different computing environments  Containers encapsulate an application  its runtime  libraries  and other dependencies  ensuring that it runs consistently regardless of the environment in which it is deployed  Docker  a widely used containerization platform  popularized this approach  but other containerization technologies exist  such as containerd and Podman     The cloud and System DesignCloud computing is like renting tools or services over the internet instead of owning them on your own computer  Big companies  called cloud providers  take care of these services in their special buildings called data centers  This way  you don t have to worry about fixing problems like you would with your own computer  It s also cheaper  easier to use  and can grow or shrink based on what you need There are different companies that offer various services in the cloud  like storing your files  making sure things are secure  and managing who gets access to what  These services help you create flexible and efficient systems  The way you use these cloud services can be different  like using multiple clouds at once  mixing them with your own system  or just sticking to one  It s like having different options for how you want to organize your stuff in the cloud    Interview Guide for System DesignFollow these links for cracking the system design interviews Top    System Design Interview Questions and AnswersMost Commonly
