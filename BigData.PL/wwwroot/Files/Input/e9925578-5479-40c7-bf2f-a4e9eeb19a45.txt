      This article needs attention from an expert in artificial intelligence  The specific problem is  Needs attention from a current expert to incorporate modern developments in this area from the last few decades  including TPUs and better coverage of GPUs  and to clean up the other material and clarify how it relates to the subject  WikiProject Artificial intelligence may be able to help recruit an expert    November      
This article is missing information about its scope  What is AI hardware for the purposes of this article  Event cameras are an application of neuromorphic design  but LISP machines are not an end use application  It previously mentioned memristors  which are not specialized hardware for AI  but rather a basic electronic component  like resister  capacitor  or inductor  Please expand the article to include this information  Further details may exist on the talk page    November

Specialized computer hardware is often used to execute artificial intelligence  AI  programs faster  and with less energy  such as Lisp machines  neuromorphic engineering  event cameras  and physical neural networks  Since       several consumer grade CPUs and SoCs have on die NPUs  As of       the market for AI hardware is dominated by GPUs             


Lisp machines edit 
Main article  Lisp machine
Computer hardware
Lisp machines were developed in the late     s and early     s to make Artificial intelligence programs written in the programming language Lisp run faster 

Dataflow architecture edit 
Main article  Dataflow architecture
Dataflow architecture processors used for AI serve various purposes  with varied implementations like the polymorphic dataflow            Convolution Engine            by Kinara  formerly Deep Vision   structure driven dataflow by Hailo             and dataflow scheduling by Cerebras            

Component hardware edit 
AI accelerators edit 
Main article  AI accelerator
Since the     s  advances in computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non linear hidden units and a very large output layer             By       graphics processing units  GPUs   often with AI specific enhancements  had displaced central processing units  CPUs  as the dominant means to train large scale commercial cloud AI             OpenAI estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from Alex Net        to Alpha Zero         and found a         fold increase in the amount of compute needed  with a doubling time trend of     months
