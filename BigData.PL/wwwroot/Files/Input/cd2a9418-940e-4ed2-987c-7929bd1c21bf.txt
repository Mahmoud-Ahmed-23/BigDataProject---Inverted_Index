Yoshua Bengio OC     FRS     FRSC  born March                     is a Canadian French            computer scientist  and a pioneer of artificial neural networks and deep learning                                   He is a professor at the Universit  de Montr al and scientific director of the AI institute MILA            
Bengio received the      ACM A M  Turing Award  often referred to as the  Nobel Prize of Computing   together with Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun  for their foundational work on deep learning             Bengio  Hinton  and LeCun are sometimes referred to as the  Godfathers of AI                                                                          Bengio is the most cited computer scientist globally  by both total citations and by h index               and the most cited living scientist across all fields  by total citations               In       TIME Magazine included Bengio in its yearly list of the world s     most influential people             


Early life and education edit 
Bengio was born in France to a Jewish family who had emigrated to France from Morocco  The family then relocated to Canada             He received his Bachelor of Science degree  electrical engineering   MSc  computer science  and PhD  computer science  from McGill University                        
Bengio is the brother of Samy Bengio             also an influential computer scientist working with neural networks  who is currently Senior Director of AI and ML Research at Apple             
The Bengio brothers lived in Morocco for a year during their father s military service there             His father  Carlo Bengio was a pharmacist and a playwright  he ran a Sephardic theater company in Montreal that performed pieces in Judeo Arabic                          His mother  C lia Moreno  was an actor in the     s in the Moroccan theater scene led by Tayeb Seddiki  She studied economics in Paris  and then in Montreal in      she co founded with artist Paul St Jean l  cran humain  a multimedia theater troupe             

Career and research edit 
After his PhD  Bengio was a postdoctoral fellow at MIT  supervised by Michael I  Jordan  and AT amp T Bell Labs              Bengio has been a faculty member at the Universit  de Montr al since       heads the MILA  Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms  and is co director of the Learning in Machines  amp  Brains program at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research                         
Along with Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun  Bengio is considered by journalist Cade Metz to be one of the three people most responsible for the advancement of deep learning during the     s and     s              Among the computer scientists with an h index of at least      Bengio was as of      the one with the most recent citations per day  according to MILA                          As of August       he has the highest Discipline H index  D index  a measure of the research citations a scientist has received  of any computer scientist              Thanks to a      article on a novel RNN architecture  Bengio has an Erd s number of               
In October       Bengio co founded Element AI  a Montreal based artificial intelligence incubator that turns AI research into real world business applications              The company sold its operations to ServiceNow in November                   with Bengio remaining at ServiceNow as an advisor                         
Bengio currently serves as scientific and technical advisor for Recursion Pharmaceuticals             and scientific advisor for Valence Discovery

At the first AI Safety Summit in November       British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that Bengio would lead an international scientific report on the safety of advanced AI  An interim version of the report was delivered at the AI Seoul Summit in May       and covered issues such as the potential for cyber attacks and  loss of control  scenarios                                      The full report was published in January      as the International AI Safety Report                         

Views on AI edit 
In March       following concerns raised by AI experts about the existential risk from artificial general intelligence  Bengio signed an open letter from the Future of Life Institute calling for  all AI labs to immediately pause for at least   months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT     The letter has been signed by over        individuals  including AI researchers such as Stuart Russell and Gary Marcus                                     
In May       Bengio stated in an interview to BBC that he felt  lost  over his life s work  He raised his concern about  bad actors  getting hold of AI  especially as it becomes more sophisticated and powerful  He called for better regulation  product registration  ethical training  and more involvement from governments in tracking and auditing AI products                         
Speaking with the Financial Times in May       Bengio said that he supported the monitoring of access to AI systems such as ChatGPT so that potentially illegal or dangerous uses could be tracked               In July       he published a piece in The Economist arguing that  the risk of catastrophe is real enough that action is needed now              
Bengio co authored a letter with Geoffrey Hinton and others in support of SB       a California AI safety bill that would require companies training models which cost more than      million to perform risk assessments before deployment  They claimed the legislation was the  bare minimum for effective regulation of this technology
