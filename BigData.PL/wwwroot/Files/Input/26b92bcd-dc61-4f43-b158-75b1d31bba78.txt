Approach to understanding human thinking
In cognitive psychology  information processing is an approach to the goal of understanding human thinking that treats cognition as essentially computational in nature  with the mind being the software and the brain being the hardware             It arose in the     s and     s  after World War II             The information processing approach in psychology is closely allied to the computational theory of mind in philosophy  it is also related to cognitivism in psychology and functionalism in philosophy            


Two types edit 
Information processing  may  be vertical or horizontal  either of which  may be centralized or decentralized  distributed   The horizontally distributed processing approach of the mid     s became popular under the name connectionism  The connectionist network is made up of different nodes  and it works by a  priming effect   and this happens when a  prime node activates a connected node              But  unlike in semantic networks  it is not a single node that has a specific meaning  but rather the knowledge is represented in a combination of differently activated nodes  Goldstein  as cited in Sternberg        

Models and theories edit 
Further information  Information processing theory
There are several proposed models or theories that describe the way in which we process information 
Every individual has different information overload point with the same information load because individuals have different information processing capacities            

Sternberg s triarchic theory of intelligence edit 
Sternberg s theory of intelligence is made up of three different components  creative  analytical  and practical abilities             Creativeness is the ability to have new original ideas  and being analytical can help a person decide whether the idea is a good one or not   Practical abilities are used to implement the ideas and persuade others of their value              In the middle of Sternberg s theory is cognition and with that is information processing  In Sternberg s theory  he says that information processing is made up of three different parts  meta components  performance components  and knowledge acquisition components             These processes move from higher order executive functions to lower order functions  Meta components are used for planning and evaluating problems  while performance components follow the orders of the meta components  and the knowledge acquisition component learns how to solve the problems             This theory in action can be explained by working on an art project  First is a decision about what to draw  then a plan and a sketch  During this process there is simultaneous monitoring of the process  and whether it is producing the desired accomplishment  All these steps fall under the meta component processing  and the performance component is the art  The knowledge acquisition portion is the learning or improving drawing skills       citation needed     

Information processing model  the working memory edit 
Adapted from Atkinson  R C  and Shiffrin  R M           Human memory  A Proposed System and its Control Processes  
Information processing has been described as  the sciences concerned with gathering  manipulating  storing  retrieving  and classifying recorded information              According to the Atkinson Shiffrin memory model or multi store model  for information to be firmly implanted in memory it must pass through three stages of mental processing  sensory memory  short term memory  and long term memory            
An example of this is the working memory model   This includes the central executive  phonologic loop  episodic buffer  visuospatial sketchpad  verbal information  long term memory  and visual information              The central executive is like the secretary of the brain   It decides what needs attention and how to respond  The central executive then leads to three different subsections   The first is phonological storage  subvocal rehearsal  and the phonological loop   These sections work together to understand words  put the information into memory  and then hold the memory   The result is verbal information storage   The next subsection is the visuospatial sketchpad which works to store visual images   The storage capacity is brief but leads to an understanding of visual stimuli   Finally  there is an episodic buffer   This section is capable of taking information and putting it into long term memory   It is also able to take information from the phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad  combining them with long term memory to make  a unitary episodic representation              
In order for these to work  the sensory register takes in via the five senses  visual  auditory  tactile  olfactory  and taste  These are all present since birth and are able to handle simultaneous processing  e g   food   taste it  smell it  see it   In general  learning benefits occur when there is a developed process of pattern recognition  The sensory register has a large capacity and its behavioral response is very short      seconds   
Within this model  sensory store and short term memory or working memory has limited capacity  Sensory store is able to hold very limited amounts of information for very limited amounts of time   This phenomenon is very similar to having a picture taken with a flash   For a few brief moments after the flash goes off  the flash it seems to still be there   However  it is soon gone and there is no way to know it was there             Short term memory holds information for slightly longer periods of time  but still has a limited capacity  According to Linden              The capacity of STM had initially been estimated at  seven plus or minus two  items             which fits the observation from neuropsychological testing that the average digit span of healthy adults is about seven              However  it emerged that these numbers of items can only be retained if they are grouped into so called chunks  using perceptual or conceptual associations between individual stimuli   Its duration is of      seconds before it is out of the subject s mind  This occurs often with names of people newly introduced to  Images or information based on meaning are stored here as well  but it decays without rehearsal or repetition of such information  
On the other hand  long term memory has a potentially unlimited capacity            and its duration is as good as indefinite  Although sometimes it is difficult to access  it encompasses everything learned until this point in time  One might become forgetful or feel as if the information is on the tip of the tongue       citation needed     

Cognitive development theory edit 
Another approach to viewing the ways in which information is processed in humans was suggested by Jean Piaget in what is called the Piaget s Cognitive Development Theory              Piaget developed his model based on development and growth  He identified four different stages between different age brackets characterized by the type of information and by a distinctive thought process  The four stages are  the sensorimotor  from birth to   years   preoperational      years   concrete operational       years   and formal operational periods     years and older   During the sensorimotor stage  newborns and toddlers rely on their senses for information processing to which they respond with reflexes  In the preoperational stage  children learn through imitation and remain unable to take other people s point of view  The concrete operational stage is characterized by the developing ability to use logic and to consider multiple factors to solve a problem  The last stage is the formal operational  in which preadolescents and adolescents begin to understand abstract concepts and to develop the ability to create arguments and counter arguments       citation needed     
Furthermore  adolescence is characterized by a series of changes in the biological  cognitive  and social realms  In the cognitive area  the brain s prefrontal cortex as well as the limbic system undergoes important changes  The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain that is active when engaged in complicated cognitive activities such as planning  generating goals and strategies  intuitive decision making  and metacognition  thinking about thinking   This is consistent with Piaget s last stage of formal operations              The prefrontal cortex becomes complete between adolescence and early adulthood  The limbic system is the part of the brain that modulates reward sensitivity based on changes in the levels of neurotransmitters  e g   dopamine  and emotions       citation needed     
In short  cognitive abilities vary according to our development and stages in life  It is at the adult stage that we are better able to be better planners  process and comprehend abstract concepts  and evaluate risks and benefits more aptly than an adolescent or child would be able to       citation needed     
In computing  information processing broadly refers to the use of algorithms to transform data the defining activity of computers              indeed  a broad computing professional organization is known as the International Federation for Information Processing  IFIP   It is essentially synonymous with the terms data processing or computation  although with a more general connotation
