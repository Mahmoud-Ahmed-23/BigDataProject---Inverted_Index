Not to be confused with Partisan  military  
A partisan is a committed member or supporter of a political party or political movement  In multi party systems  the term is used for persons who strongly support their party s policies and are reluctant to compromise with political opponents 


United States edit 
The term s meaning has changed dramatically over the last    years in the United States  Before the American National Election Study  described in Angus Campbell et al   in The American Voter  began in       an individual s partisan tendencies were typically determined by their voting behaviour  Since then   partisan  has come to refer to an individual with a psychological identification with one or the other of the major parties  Depending on their political beliefs  candidates may join a party  As they build the framework for career advancement  parties are more often than not the preferred choice for candidates  There are many parties in a system  and candidates often join them instead of standing as an Independent if that is provided for 
In the U S   politicians have generally been identified with a party  Many local elections in the U S   as for mayor  are  nonpartisan   A candidate may have a party affiliation but it is not listed on the ballot  Independents occasionally appear in significant contests but rarely win  At the presidential level  the best independent vote getters were Ross Perot in      and       and John B  Anderson in      
President Dwight D  Eisenhower was nonpartisan until       when he joined the Republican Party and was elected president  According to David A  Crockett   Much of Eisenhower s nonpartisan image was genuine  for he found Truman s campaigning distasteful and inappropriate  and he disliked the partisan aspects of campaigning              With little interest in routine partisanship  Eisenhower left much of the building and sustaining of the Republican Party to his vice president  Richard Nixon             Paul Finkelman and Peter Wallenstein state   With Eisenhower uninvolved in party building  Nixon became the de facto national GOP leader             
Eisenhower s largely nonpartisan stance allowed him to work smoothly with the Democratic leader s Speaker Sam Rayburn in the House and Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson in the Senate  Jean Smith says 

Ike  LBJ  and  Mr  Sam  did not trust one another completely and they did not see eye to eye on every issue  but they understood one another and had no difficulty working together  Eisenhower continued to meet regularly with the Republican leadership  But his weekly sessions with Rayburn and Johnson  usually in the evening  over drinks  were far more productive  For Johnson and Rayburn  it was shrewd politics to cooperate with Ike  Eisenhower was wildly popular in the country      By supporting a Republican president against the Old Guard of his own party  the Democrats hoped to share Ike s popularity

Partiinost  is a transliteration of the Russian term             originated in Marxism Leninism  In Chinese  it is translated as Dangxing  Chinese           It can be variously translated as party mindedness  partisanship  or party spirit  The term can refer to both a philosophical position concerning the sociology of knowledge and an official doctrine of public intellectual life in the Soviet Union             The term may also mean the membership of a person in a certain political party 
The term was coined by Vladimir Lenin in       responding to Peter Struve  to counter what he considered to be the futility of objectivity in political  economic analysis             Class interests and material conditions of existence determine ideology  and thus  in a Marxist Leninist view  true objectivity  in terms of non partisanship  is not possible in a society of antagonistic classes              Marxists  in Lenin s view  should openly acknowledge their partisanship on the side of proletarian revolution   Bourgeois emphasis on the normative goal of objectivity is thus considered delusional   In this sense  partiinost  is a universal and inevitable element of political and ideological life  Still  its presence is not always acknowledged or flatly denied by the ruling class            
Descriptively  partiinost  was not a novel concept and had been described in different words by Thrasymachus  Xenophanes  and Karl Marx              However  Lenin s term has a normative element that was not present in prior descriptions of the phenomenon               In other words  Lenin insisted that partiinost  should be publicly expressed whenever possible 
A clear expression of partiinost  can be found in its entry in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia 

The Communist Party consistently upholds the principle of partiinost    Defending and substantiating the goals and tasks of the working class and the policies of the Communist Party  Marxist Leninist theory mercilessly criticizes the exploiters  system  its politics  and its ideology       By contrast  the bourgeoisie  whose interests conflict with those of the majority  is forced to hide its self seeking aspirations  to pretend that its economic and political aims are those of society as a whole  and to wrap itself in the toga of non partisanship            
Partiinost  is also used by Lenin in Materialism and Empirio criticism to refer to the concept of philosophical factionalism  which he defined broadly as the struggle between idealists and materialists             

Research edit 
Partisanship causes survey respondents to answer political surveys differently  even if the survey asks a question with an objective answer  People with strong partisan beliefs are     more likely to give an incorrect answer that benefits their preferred party than an incorrect answer that benefits another party  This is due to the phenomenon of motivated reasoning  of which there are several types  including  cheerleading  and congenial inference  Motivated reasoning means that a partisan survey respondent may feel motivated to answer the survey in a way that they know is incorrect  when the respondent is uncertain of an answer  partisanship may also motivate them to guess or predict an answer that favorable to their party  Studies have found that offering a cash incentive for correct answers reduces partisan bias in responses by about      from        to about
