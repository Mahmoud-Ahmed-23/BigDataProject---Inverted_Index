Columbidae is a bird family consisting of doves and pigeons  It is the only family in the order Columbiformes  These are stout bodied birds with small heads  relatively short necks and slender bills that in some species feature fleshy ceres  They feed largely on plant matter  feeding on seeds  granivory   fruit  frugivory   and foliage  folivory   
In colloquial English  the smaller species tend to be called  doves   and the larger ones  pigeons              although the distinction is not consistent             and there is no scientific separation between them             Historically  the common names for these birds involve a great deal of variation  The bird most commonly referred to as  pigeon  is the domestic pigeon  descendant of the wild rock dove  which is a common inhabitant of cities as the feral pigeon 
Columbidae contains    genera divided into     species             The family occurs worldwide  often in close proximity to humans  but the greatest diversity is in the Indomalayan and Australasian realms      species       are at risk             and    are extinct             with the most famous examples being the dodo  a large  flightless  island bird  and the passenger pigeon  that once flocked in the billions 


Etymology
Pigeon is a French word that derives from the Latin p pi   for a  peeping  chick             while dove is an ultimately Germanic word  possibly referring to the bird s diving flight             The English dialectal word culver appears to derive from Latin columba             A group of doves has sometimes been called a  dule   taken from the French word deuil   mourning              

Origin and evolution
Columbiformes is one of the most diverse non passerine clades of neoavians  and its origins are in the Cretaceous            and the result of a rapid diversification at the end of the K Pg boundary              Whole genome analyses have found Columbiformes is the sister clade to the clade Pteroclimesites a clade consisting the orders Pterocliformes  sandgrouses  and Mesitornithiformes  mesites                                       The columbiform pteroclimesitean clade  or Columbimorphae  monophyly has been supported from several studies                                                                                                 

Taxonomy and systematics
See also  List of Columbidae genera and List of Columbidae species
The name  Columbidae  for the family was first used by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in a guide to the contents of the British Museum published in                               However  Illiger in      established an older name for the family group   Columbini   and would actually be the proper authority for Columbidae             
The interrelationships of columbids  between subfamilies  and the ergotaxonomy of them has been debated  with many different interpretations of how they should be classified  As many as five to six families  along with many subfamilies and tribes  have been used in the past including the family Raphidae for the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire                                      A      paper on the systematics and nomenclature of the dodo and the solitaire from Young and colleagues also provided an overview of columbid family group nomina  They recommended recognizing three subfamilies  Columbinae  New World doves and quail doves  and columbin doves   Claravinae  American ground doves   and Raphinae  Old World doves and pigeons including the dodo and solitaire               A      paper on the molecular phylogenetic placement of the Cuban endemic blue headed quail dove from Oswald and colleagues found the species to be a sister group to Columbinae  as opposed to being a true columbine or a raphine as previous authors have suggested in the past  These authors recommended that the blue headed quail dove should be placed in fourth monotypic subfamily  Starnoenadinae             
These taxonomic issues are exacerbated by columbids not being well represented in the fossil record              with no truly primitive forms having been found to date      citation needed      The genus Gerandia has been described from Early Miocene deposits in France  but while it was long believed to be a pigeon              it is now considered a sandgrouse              Fragmentary remains of a probably  ptilinopine  Early Miocene pigeon were found in the Bannockburn Formation of New Zealand and described as Rupephaps               Columbina  prattae from roughly contemporary deposits of Florida is nowadays tentatively separated in Arenicolumba  but its distinction from Columbina Scardafella and related genera needs to be more firmly established  e g  by cladistic analysis               Apart from that  all other fossils belong to extant genera

Description
Anatomy and physiology
A landing collared dove  Streptopelia decaocto  displays the contour and flight feathers of its wings 
Overall  the anatomy of Columbidae is characterized by short legs  short bills with a fleshy cere  and small heads on large  compact bodies              Like some other birds  the Columbidae have no gall bladders              Some medieval naturalists concluded they have no bile  gall   which in the medieval theory of the four humours explained the allegedly sweet disposition of doves              In fact  however  they do have bile  as Aristotle had earlier realized   which is secreted directly into the gut             
The wings of most species are large  and have eleven primary feathers              pigeons have strong wing muscles  wing muscles comprise        of their body weight              and are among the strongest fliers of all birds             
In a series of experiments in      by Dr       Mark B  Friedman  using doves  their characteristic head bobbing was shown to be due to their natural desire to keep their vision constant              It was shown yet again in a      experiment by Dr       Barrie J  Frost  in which pigeons were placed on treadmills  it was observed that they did not bob their heads  as their surroundings were constant             

Feathers
Pigeon feather types  excluding down
Columbidae have unique body feathers  with the shaft being generally broad  strong  and flattened  tapering to a fine point  abruptly              In general  the aftershaft is absent  however  small ones on some tail and wing feathers may be present              Body feathers have very dense  fluffy bases  are attached loosely into the skin  and drop out easily              Possibly serving as a predator avoidance mechanism              large numbers of feathers fall out in the attacker s mouth if the bird is snatched  facilitating the bird s escape  The plumage of the family is variable             
Granivorous species tend to have dull plumage  with a few exceptions  whereas the frugivorous species have brightly coloured plumage              The genera Chalcophaps  Ptilinopus and Alectroenas include some of the most brightly coloured pigeons  Pigeons and doves may be sexually monochromatic or dichromatic              In addition to bright colours  some pigeon species may have crests or other ornamentation

Flight
Many Columbidae are excellent fliers due to the lift provided by their large wings  which results in low wing loading              They are highly maneuverable in flight             and have a low aspect ratio due to the width of their wings  allowing for quick flight launches and ability to escape from predators  but at a high energy cost              A few species are long distance migrants  with some populations of the European turtle dove migrating in excess of       km between northern Europe in summer and tropical Africa in winter  and the Oriental turtle dove nearly as far in eastern Asia between eastern Siberia and southern China 

Size
Pigeons and doves exhibit considerable variation in size  ranging in length from    to    centimetres      to           in   and in weight from         g             lb  to above            g           lb               The largest extant species are the crowned pigeons of New Guinea              which are nearly turkey sized  with lengths of            cm                 ft  and weights ranging            kg               lb                                       One of the largest arboreal species  the Marquesan imperial pigeon with a length of         cm          in   currently battles extinction                          The extinct  flightless dodo is the largest columbid to have ever existed  with a height of about              cm                 in   and a range of suggested weights from           kilograms             lb   although the higher estimates are thought to be based on overweight birds                                                 
The least massive columbids belong to species in the genus Columbina  the common ground dove  Columbina passerina  and the plain breasted ground dove  Columbina minuta  which are about the same size as a house sparrow  weighing a little above         g            oz                                       The dwarf fruit dove  which may measure as little as         cm           in  long  has a marginally smaller total length than any other species from this family

Distribution and habitat
Pigeons and doves are distributed everywhere on Earth  having adapted to most terrestrial habitats available on the planet  except for the driest areas of the Sahara Desert  Antarctica and its surrounding islands  and the high Arctic              They have colonised most of the world s oceanic islands  reaching eastern Polynesia and the Chatham Islands in the Pacific  Mauritius  the Seychelles and R union in the Indian Ocean  and the Azores in the Atlantic Ocean 
Columbid species may be arboreal  terrestrial  or semi terrestrial  They inhabit savanna  grassland  shrubland  desert  temperate woodland and forest  tropical rainforests  mangrove forest  and even the barren sands and gravels of atolls             
Some species have large natural ranges  The eared dove ranges across the entirety of South America from Colombia to Tierra del Fuego              the Eurasian collared dove has a massive  if discontinuous  distribution from Britain across Europe  the Middle East  India  Pakistan and China              and the laughing dove across most of sub Saharan Africa  as well as India  Pakistan  and the Middle East             
When including human mediated introductions  the largest range of any species is that of the rock dove  also known as the common pigeon              This species had a large natural distribution from Britain and Ireland to northern Africa  across Europe  Arabia  Central Asia  India  the Himalayas and up into China and Mongolia              The range of the species increased dramatically upon domestication  as the species went feral in cities around the world              The common pigeon is currently resident across most of North America  and has established itself in cities and urban areas in South America  sub Saharan Africa  Southeast Asia  Japan  Australia  and New Zealand              A      study found that the east coast of the United States includes two pigeon genetic megacities  in New York and Boston  and observes that the birds do not mix together             
As well as the rock dove  several other species of pigeon have become established outside of their natural range after escaping captivity  and other species have increased their natural ranges due to habitat changes caused by human activity             
Other species of Columbidae have tiny  restricted distributions  usually seen on small islands  such as the whistling dove  which is endemic to the tiny Kadavu Island in Fiji              the Caroline ground dove  restricted to two islands  Truk and Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands              and the Grenada dove  which is only found on the island of Grenada in the Caribbean             
Some continental species also have tiny distributions  such as the black banded fruit dove  which is restricted to a small area of the Arnhem Land of Australia              the Somali pigeon  found only in a tiny area of northern Somalia              and Moreno s ground dove  endemic to the area around Salta and Tucuman in northern Argentina             

Behaviour
Feeding

Seeds and fruit form the major component of the diets of pigeons and doves                          and the family can be loosely divided between seed eating  granivorous  species  and fruit and mast eating  frugivorous  species  though many species consume both             
The granivorous species typically feed on seed found on the ground  whereas the frugivorous species are more arboreal  tending to feed in trees              The morphological adaptations used to distinguish between the two groups include granivores tending to having thick walls in their gizzards  intestines  and esophagi  with the frugivores evolved with thin walls              and the fruit eating species have short intestines  as opposed to the seed eaters having longer intestines              Frugivores are capable of clinging to branches and even hang upside down to reach fruit                         
In addition to fruit and seeds  a number of other food items are taken by many species  Some  particularly the ground doves and quail doves  eat a large number of prey items such as insects and worms              One species  the atoll fruit dove  is specialised in taking insect and reptile prey              Snails  moths  and other insects are taken by white crowned pigeons  orange fruit doves  and ruddy ground doves              Flowers are also taken by some species            
Urban feral pigeons  descendants of domestic rock doves  Columbia livia   reside in urban environments  disturbing their natural feeding habits  They depend on human activities and interactions to obtain food  causing them to forage for spilled food or food provided by humans

Reproduction
Doves and pigeons build relatively flimsy nests  often using sticks  other vegetable matter  and other debris  which may be placed on trees  on rocky ledges  or on the ground  depending on species  The female may either build the nest  with material gathered by the male  or the male builds the nest by himself  A few species nest colonially  others nest in aggregation            
Most lay a clutch of one or  usually  two white eggs at a time which take       days to hatch  larger species have longer incubation times   Both parents care for the young  unlike most birds  both sexes of doves and pigeons produce  crop milk  to feed their young  This fluid is secreted by a sloughing of epithelial cells from the lining of the crop             
Unfledged baby doves and pigeons are called squabs and are generally able to fly by five weeks old  These fledglings  with their immature squeaking voices  are called squeakers once they are weaned              and leave the nest after       days 

Status and conservation
While many species of pigeons and doves have benefited from human activities and have increased their ranges  many other species have declined in numbers and some have become threatened or even succumbed to extinction              Among the ten species to have become extinct since       the conventional date for estimating modern extinctions  are two of the most famous extinct species  the dodo and the passenger pigeon                        
The passenger pigeon was exceptional for a number of reasons  In modern times  it is the only pigeon species that was not an island species to have become extinct             even though it was once the most numerous species of bird on Earth      citation needed      Its former numbers are difficult to estimate  but one ornithologist  Alexander Wilson  estimated one flock he observed contained over two billion birds              The decline of the species was abrupt  in       a breeding colony was estimated to contain over a hundred million birds  yet the last individual in the species was dead by                   Although habitat loss was a contributing factor  the species is thought to have been massively over hunted  being used as food for slaves and  later  the poor  in the United States throughout the   th      century      citation needed     

The Socorro dove  Zenaida graysoni  is extinct in the wild 
The dodo  and its extinction  was more typical of the extinctions of pigeons in general  Like many species that colonise remote islands with few predators  it lost much of its predator avoidance behaviour  along with its ability to fly              The arrival of people  along with a suite of other introduced species such as rats  pigs  and cats  quickly spelled the end for this species and many other island species that have become extinct             
    columbid species are at risk      of the total   with    species NT     VU     EN     CR  and   EW             Most of these are tropical and live on islands  All of the species are threatened by introduced predators  habitat loss  hunting  or a combination of these factors              In some cases  they may be extinct in the wild  as is the Socorro dove of Socorro Island  Mexico  last seen in the wild in       driven to extinction by habitat loss and introduced feral cats              In some areas  a lack of knowledge means the true status of a species is unknown  DD   the Negros fruit dove has not been seen since                   and may or may not be extinct  and the Polynesian ground dove is classified as critically endangered  as whether it survives or not on remote islands in the far west of the Pacific Ocean is unknown             
Various conservation techniques are employed to prevent these extinctions  including laws and regulations to control hunting pressure  the establishment of protected areas to prevent further habitat loss  the establishment of captive populations for reintroduction back into the wild  ex situ conservation   and the translocation of individuals to suitable habitats to create additional populations                         

Domestication
Main article  Domestic pigeon
The domestic pigeon  Columba livia domestica  is a descendant of the rock dove  Columba livia  that underwent domestication  with studies suggesting domestication as early as    thousand years ago  Domestic pigeons have long been a part of human culture  doves were important symbols of the goddesses Innana  Asherah  and Aphrodite  and revered by the early Christian  Islamic and Jewish religions  Domestication of pigeons led to significant use of homing pigeons for communication  including war pigeons  such as the    pigeons who were awarded the Dickin Medal for  brave service  to their country  in World War II 
The ringneck dove is a smaller species of domestic columbid that was kept as a source of food  As a result of selection for tame individuals who would not escape their cages  they lack a survival instinct and cannot survive release
