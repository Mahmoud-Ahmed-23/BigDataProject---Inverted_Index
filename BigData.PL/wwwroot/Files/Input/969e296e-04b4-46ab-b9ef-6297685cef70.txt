Gender biases in digital technology
This article s lead section may be too short to adequately summarize the key points  Please consider expanding the lead to provide an accessible overview of all important aspects of the article    October      
Gender digital divide is defined as gender biases coded into technology products  technology sector  and digital skills education                        It can refer to women s and other gender identity s use of  and professional development in computing work  The gender digital divide has changed throughout history due to social roles  economics  and educational opportunities  As the gender spectrum continues to exist more prominently in social and professional spaces  the inclusion of other identities is an important area of concern in these types of conversations  These other identities can include any other than cis gender male  Non binary people make up a significant portion of the population and their existence is affected by the digital divide nonetheless      citation needed     


Background edit 
Education systems are increasingly trying to ensure equitable  inclusive  and high quality digital skills  education  and training  Though digital skills open pathways to further learning and skills development  women and girls are still being left behind in digital skills education  Globally  digital skills gender gaps are growing  despite at least a decade of national and international efforts to close them             The economic and political interests of its indicators have also been questioned            

Digital skills gap edit 
Women are less likely to know how to operate a smartphone  navigate the internet  use social media and understand how to safeguard information in digital mediums  abilities that underlie life and work tasks and are relevant to people of all ages  worldwide  There is a gap from the lowest skill proficiency levels  such as using apps on a mobile phone  to the most advanced skills like coding computer software to support the analysis of large data sets            
Women in numerous countries are     less likely than men to know how to leverage ICT for basic purposes  such as using simple arithmetic formulas in a spreadsheet             UNESCO estimates that men are around four times more likely than women to have advanced ICT skills such as the ability to programme computers             Across G   countries    of ICT patents are generated by women             and the global average is at                Recruiters for technology companies in Silicon Valley estimate that the applicant pool for technical jobs in artificial intelligence  AI  and data science is often less than    female             To highlight this difference  in      there were     million college educated women working in STEM compared to     million men  The total workforce at the time was     women and     men which highlights the evident gap            
While the gender gap in digital skills is evident across regional boundaries and income levels  it is more severe for women who are older  less educated  poor  or living in rural areas and developing countries  Making women much less likely to graduate in any field of STEM compared to their male counterpart             Digital skills gap intersects with issues of poverty and educational access            

Root causes edit 
Women and girls who live in patriarchal cultures may struggle more than those who do not to access public ICT facilities  Due to the social challenges these cultures create as well reinforces the struggles and creates an overlap  They may struggle to access these facilities due to unsafe roads  limits on their freedom of movement  or because the facilities themselves are considered unsuitable for women  They may also lack financial freedom creating a large barrier to purchase any form of technology or have any type of internet connection              If they do have access to technology of the internet  it is usually controlled by the men in their households and limit their content selection to content focused on women s appearances  dating  or the role of motherhood               Fears concerning safety and harassment  both online and offline  also inhibit many women and girls from benefiting from or even wanting to use ICTs             
In many contexts  women and girls face concerns of physical violence if they own or borrow digital devices  which in some cases leads to their using the devices in secret  making them more vulnerable to online threats and making it difficult to gain digital skills             
The stereotype of technology as a male domain is common in many contexts and affect girls  confidence in their digital skills from a young age  In OECD countries       of girls aspire towards ICT related careers at age     versus    of boys              This was not always the case  Early decades of computing saw a much larger presence of women  Acting as programmers during World War II  they held highly valued positions              Women s contributions  however  have been largely obscured due to how the history is told  Focusing on the infrastructure and hardware of digital technologies development has placed men at the forefront of its history              Post war computer manufacturers sought to commercialize the machines and opened up a new form of labor market  This post war market utilized discriminatory criteria measures that women were no longer able to meet due to societal  educational  and labor expectations              Managers of early technology firms allowed women well suited for programming because of stereotypes characterizing them as meticulous and good at following step by step directions  Women  including many women of color  flocked to jobs in the computer industry because it was seen as more meritocratic than other fields              As computers became integrated into people s daily life  it was noticed that programmers had influence  Consequently  women were pushed out and the field became more male dominated            
In developed countries like Canada  the digital divide can exist due to factors of lacking digital literacy which prevents individuals from understanding how to use and what to do with technology      citation needed      Other research on the gender divide in Canada has found contrasting results  showing a potential suggestion to the closing of the gap in more developed countries over the last couple years in relation to access to the internet and technology as a whole  However  the amount of activity online is found to be higher for men than women               When looking at issues regarding professional sectors the IT sector in Canada remains male dominated  The presence of women in field with technology has increased significantly but in specific high paying technological fields like computer science it is declining              

Access divide versus skills divide edit 
Due to the declining price of connectivity and hardware  skills deficits have exceeded barriers of access as the primary contributor to the gender digital divide  For years  the divide was assumed to be symptomatic of technical challenges  It was thought that women would catch up with men when the world had cheaper devices and lower connectivity prices  due to the limited purchasing power and financial independence of women compared with men in countries with a patriarchal culture             The cost of ICT access remains an issue and is surpassed by educational gaps  For example  the gender gap in internet penetration is around     in the Arab States and the Asia and Pacific region              whereas the gender gap in ICT skills is as high as     in some Asian and Middle Eastern countries              In sub Saharan Africa  SSA   the Internet penetration rate in      was      percent for men and      percent for women  The Internet user gender gap was      percent in      and up to    percent in                               The Internet penetration rate in      was      percent for men and      percent for women                          
Other research has shown more factors that contribute to access of the internet  In the United States  it was found that individuals who has lower than high school education and made less than    k a year has the lowest access to the internet  They found that the most consistent results form various research is that individuals with the lowest education and lowest income had the lowest access to the internet              When looking at differences with gender  inconsistent results were found  When large divides were found between men and women  access to the internet  socioeconomic factors were the cause  Overall  the gender divide has found to be largely insignificant in countries like the United States and in Canada              
SSA has one of the widest mobile gender gaps in the world where over    million women are not connected              The gender gap in mobile ownership was    percent  a reduction from    percent in       however  in low  and middle income countries it remains substantial with fewer women than men accessing the Internet on a mobile device              Furthermore  women are less likely to use digital services or mobile Internet and tend to use different mobile services than men                         
Many people have access to affordable devices and broadband networks  but do not have the requisite skills to take advantage of this technology to improve their lives             In Brazil  lack of skills  rather than cost of access  was found to be the primary reason low income groups are not using the internet              In India  where lack of skills and lack of need for the internet were the primary limiting factors across all income groups 
Lack of understanding  interest or time is a bigger issue than affordability or availability as the reason for not using the internet             Even though skills deficits prevent both men and women from using digital technologies  they tend to be more severe for women  In a study conducted across    low  and middle income countries  women were     times more likely than men to report lack of skills as a barrier to internet use              Women are also more likely to report that they do not see a reason to access and use ICT              Interest and perception of need are related to skills  as people who have little experience with or understanding of ICTs tend to underestimate their benefits and utility            

Relationship between digital skills and gender equality edit 
In many societies  gender equality does not translate into digital realms and professions  The persistence of growing digital skills gender gaps  even in countries that rank at the top of the World Economic Forum s global gender gap index  reflecting strong gender equality   demonstrates a need for interventions that cultivate the digital skills of women and girls            
For most countries  the primary barriers for women regarding access to digital technology are cost unaffordability followed by illiteracy and lack of digital skills  For instance  in Africa      percent of people aged    and older are illiterate  compared to the global average rate of      percent                         

Gender digital divide and COVID    edit 
Africa edit 
The COVID    pandemic and the measures taken by governments on social distancing and mobility restrictions have contributed to boosting the use of digital technology to bridge some of the physical access gaps              However  the rapid proliferation of digital tools and services stands in stark contrast to the many systemic and structural barriers to technology access and adoption that many people in rural Africa still face              Gender inequalities  intersecting with and compounded by other social differences such as class  race  age   dis ability  etc   shape the extent to which different rural women and men are able not only to access but also use and benefit from these new technologies and ways of delivering information and services             
Beside the potential of digital tools and applications  the COVID    crisis has evidenced the existing digital divide and especially the gender gap              It is estimated that     billion individuals are not connected to the Internet across the globe  including     million in Africa              Only    percent of women in Africa have access to the Internet and only    percent of them can afford to use it                         

Gender responsive digitalization in COVID    response edit 
According to a study by FAO  gender responsive digitalization in COVID    response and beyond could include             

Improve the availability of sex disaggregated data and gender related statistics that capture digital gender gaps in rural areas to better inform policy and business decisions
Promote an enabling environment that includes gender responsive policies  strategies and initiatives
Leverage digital solutions to deliver COVID    relief measures targeted to rural women and girls and facilitate their access to social protection services and alternative income generation opportunities 
Dedicate funds for digital acceleration to support women led enterprises 
Improve the national broadband coverage to ensure affordable  accessible and reliable infrastructure for inclusive digital transformation
Invest in the protection of Internet users  especially illiterate and vulnerable ones  against frauds and abuses as cybercrime  including sexual harassment  According to UN Women  these crimes have reportedly increased during the COVID    pandemic  especially toward women and girls                         
Benefits of digital empowerment edit 
Helping women and girls develop digital skills means stronger women  stronger families  stronger communities  stronger economies and better technology             Digital skills are recognized to be essential life skills required for full participation in society  The main benefits for acquiring digital skills are they            

Facilitate entry into the labour market              
Assist women s safety both online and offline 
Enhance women s community and political engagement 
Bring economic benefits to women and society 
Empower women to help steer the future of technology and gender equality 
Accelerate progress towards international goals            
Digitalization can potentially pave the way for improving the efficiency and functioning of food systems  which in turn can have positive impacts on the livelihoods of women and men farmers and agripreneurs  for example  through the creation of digital job opportunities for young women and men in rural areas             

Closing the digital skills gender gap edit 
Guidelines for Digital Inclusion
             The digital divide has begun at earlier ages as young adults have lived out their childhoods with personal computers  This has made intervention to prevent further gender divides in the digital realm needed in more early education  Increasing girls  and women s digital skills involves early  varied and sustained exposure to digital technologies              Interventions should not be limited to formal education settings  they should reflect a multifaceted approach  enabling women and girls to acquire skills in a variety of formal and informal contexts  at home  in school  in their communities and in the workplace              The digital divide cuts across age groups  therefore solutions need to assume a lifelong learning orientation  The technological changes adds impetus to the  across life  perspective  as skills learned today will not necessarily be relevant in   or    years  Digital skills require regular updating  to prevent women and girls fall further behind            
Women and girls digital skills development are strengthened by            

Adopting sustained  varied and life wide approaches 
Establishing incentives  targets and quotas 
Embedding ICT in formal education 
Supporting engaging experiences 
Emphasising meaningful use and tangible benefits 
Encouraging collaborative and peer learning 
Creating safe spaces and meet women where they are 
Examining exclusionary practices and language 
Recruiting and training gender sensitive teachers 
Promoting role models and mentors 
Bringing parents on board 
Leveraging community connections and recruiting allies 
Supporting technology autonomy and women s digital rights            
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization  FAO   there are seven success factors to empowering rural women through ICTs             

Adapt content so that it is meaningful for them 
Create a safe environment for them to share and learn 
Be gender sensitive 
Provide them with access and tools for sharing
Build partnerships 
Provide the right blend of technologies 
Ensure sustainability
The regulatory role of governments  at local  national  regional  and international levels  is crucial in addressing infrastructural barriers  harmonizing and making the regulatory environment inclusive and gender responsive  and in protecting all stakeholders from fraud and crime             
Initiatives targeted at boosting women s representation in the technology industry are essential to closing the digital skills gender divide  Mentorship programs  networking chances  and scholarships for women seeking jobs in technology are examples of such initiatives  These efforts can help create more inclusive workplaces that respect diversity and promote creativity by boosting the presence of women in the technology industry             

Mentorship programs can be especially beneficial in assisting women in the technology industry  These initiatives allow women to network with experienced professionals who can give advice and support as they advance in their jobs  According to research  mentoring programs can help increase women s confidence and feeling of connection in the workplace  which can improve job happiness and professional growth opportunities             
Women in technology can benefit from networking chances as well  Women can benefit from networking by developing connections with other professionals in their industry  which can lead to new employment possibilities and collaborations  Networking can also assist women in staying current with the newest trends and technologies in their profession             
Scholarships can also be a good method to help women who want to work in technology  Scholarships can assist in covering the costs of education and training  making it simpler for women to gain the skills and knowledge required to thrive in the technology industry  Scholarships can also help to increase gender variety in the technology industry by encouraging more women to enter the profession             
Overall  initiatives targeted at boosting women s representation in the technology industry are essential to closing the digital skills gender divide  We can build more inclusive and innovative environments that help everyone if we assist women in technology 

Female gendering of AI technologies edit 
Men continue to dominate the technology space  and the disparity serves to perpetuate gender inequalities  as unrecognized bias is replicated and built into algorithms and artificial intelligence  AI             
Limited participation of women and girls in the technology sector can stem outward replicating existing gender biases and creating new ones  Women s participation in the technology sector is constrained by unequal digital skills education and training  Learning and confidence gaps that arise as early as primary school amplify as girls move through education  therefore by the time they reach higher education only a fraction pursue advanced level studies in computer science and related information and communication technology  ICT  fields              Divides grow greater in the transition from education to work  The International Telecommunication Union  ITU  estimates that only    of professional software developers are women             
Technologies generated by male dominated teams and companies often reflect gender biases  Establishing balance between men and women in the technology sector will help lay foundations for the creation of technology products that better reflect and ultimately accommodate the rich diversity of human societies             For instance AI  which is a branch of the technology sector that wields influence over people s lives             Today  AI curates information shown by internet search engines  determines medical treatments  makes loan decisions  ranks job applications  translates languages  places ads  recommends prison sentences  influences parole decisions  calibrates lobbying and campaigning efforts  intuits tastes and preferences  and decides who qualifies for insurance  among other tasks  Despite the growing influence of this technology  women make up just     of AI researchers              Closing the gender divide begins with establishing more inclusive and gender equal digital skills education and training            

Digital assistants edit 
Digital assistants encompass a range of internet connected technologies that support users in various ways  When interacting with digital assistants  users are not restricted to a narrow range of input commands  but are encouraged to make queries using whichever inputs seem most appropriate or natural  whether they are typed or spoken  Digital assistants seek to enable and sustain more human like interactions with technology  Digital assistants can include  voice assistants  chatbots  and virtual agents            

Feminization of voice assistants edit 
Voice assistants have become central to technology platforms and  in many countries  to day to day life  Between      and       the frequency of voice based internet search queries increased    times and account for close to one fifth of mobile internet searches  a figure that is projected to increase to     by                    Voice assistants now manage upwards of   billion tasks per month  from the mundane  changing a song  to the essential  contacting emergency services              
Today  most leading voice assistants are exclusively female or female by default  both in name and in sound of voice  Amazon has Alexa  named for the ancient library in Alexandria               Microsoft has Cortana  named for a synthetic intelligence in the video game Halo that projects itself as a sensuous unclothed woman               and Apple has Siri  coined by the Norwegian co creator of the iPhone  S and meaning  beautiful woman who leads you to victory  in Norse               While Google s voice assistant is simply Google Assistant and sometimes referred to as Google Home  its voice is female 
The trend to feminize assistants occurs in a context in which there is a growing gender imbalance in technology companies  such that men commonly represent two thirds to three quarters of a firm s total workforce              Companies like Amazon and Apple have cited academic work demonstrating that people prefer a female voice to a male voice  justifying the decision to make voice assistants female  Further research shows that consumers strongly dislike voice assistants without clear gender markers              Gender bias is thus  hard coded  into technology  Companies often cite research showing that customers want their digital assistants to sound like women  justifying the choice with the profit motive             However  research on the topic is mixed  with studies showing that in some contexts male choices may be preferred             For example  BMW was forced to recall a female voiced navigation system on its   Series cars in the late     s after being flooded with calls from German men who reportedly  refused to take directions from a woman              
Researchers who specialize in human computer interaction have recognized that both men and women tend to characterize female voices as more helpful  The perception may have roots in traditional social norms around women as nurturers  mothers often take on   willingly or not   significantly more care than fathers  and other socially constructed gender biases that predate the digital era
