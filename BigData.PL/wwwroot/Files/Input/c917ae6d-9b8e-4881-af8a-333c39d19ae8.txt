							In a move to expand access to non banking financial services nationwide  the Financial Regulatory Authority  FRA  held a high level coordination meeting with the Ministry of Local Development and the Social Housing and Mortgage Finance Fund  SHMFF   The meeting brought together FRA Chairperson Mohamed Farid  Minister of Local Development Manal Awad  and SHMFF s CEO Mai Abdel Hamid 
The discussions focused on establishing collaborative frameworks to deliver FRA regulated financial and insurance services to broader segments of the population  particularly in underserved governorates  The initiative supports Egypt s national strategy for financial inclusion and sustainable development 
Participants reviewed a broad spectrum of non banking financial tools  including mortgage finance  leasing  factoring  consumer finance  and capital market products  as well as insurance services  The aim is to leverage these tools to enhance economic resilience at the local level and protect vulnerable citizens from financial risks 

Farid stressed the FRA s commitment to strengthening partnerships with government institutions to demonstrate how non banking solutions can support development goals   We are working to design innovative financing  investment  and insurance services tailored to the needs of citizens in governorates across Egypt  especially in marginalized and rural communities   he said 
He highlighted the importance of integrating efforts with the Ministry of Local Development to extend financial services to villages and districts targeted by national initiatives  particularly those under the Decent Life program and local development strategies 
Minister Manal Awad underscored the value of this partnership  describing it as a pivotal step toward empowering governorates with modern financial tools   Our goal is to foster an enabling environment where citizens can access effective financial and insurance services  raise their living standards  and create local job opportunities   she said  Awad also stressed the need to enhance financial literacy and public awareness of available services to ensure active citizen participation in economic life 
To translate the initiative into action  the parties agreed to form joint working groups comprising representatives from the FRA  the Ministry of Local Development  and the SHMFF  These teams will develop an implementation roadmap based on local priorities  aiming to ensure the broadest possible access to non banking financial services 
The collaboration is seen as a model for institutional integration  aligning efforts among key state bodies to accelerate progress toward Egypt s sustainable development goals and improve the quality of life across all governorates
