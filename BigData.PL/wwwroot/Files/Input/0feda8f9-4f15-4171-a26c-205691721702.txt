In the taxonomical structure  genus   species   a species is described as sui generis if its genus was created to classify it  i e   its uniqueness at the time of classification merited the creation of a new genus  the sole member of which was initially the sui generis species   A species that is the sole extant member of its genus  e g   the genus Homo  is not necessarily sui generis  extinctions may have eliminated other congeneric species  A sui generis genus may also be called a monotypic genus 

Creative arts edit 
A book  movie  television series  or other artistic creation is called sui generis when it does not fit into standard genre boundaries  Movie critic Richard Schickel identifies Joe Versus the Volcano as a sui generis movie             Film critic Michael Brooke used the term to describe Fantastic Planet  a      Franco Czech sci fi animated film directed by Ren  Laloux            

Law edit 
In law  it is a term of art used to identify a legal classification that exists independently of other categorizations  either because of its singularity or due to the specific creation of an entitlement or obligation             For example  a court s contempt powers arise sui generis and not from statute or rule             The New York Court of Appeals has used the term in describing cooperative apartment corporations  mostly because this form of housing is considered real property for some purposes and personal property for other purposes            
When citing cases and other authorities  lawyers and judges may refer to  a sui generis case   or  a sui generis authority   meaning it is a special one confined to its own facts and  therefore  may not be of broader application 

Intellectual property law edit 
Generally speaking  protection for intellectual property extends to intellectual creations to incentivize innovation and depends upon the nature of the work and its characteristics             The main types of intellectual property law are  copyright  which protects creative works  patent  which protects invention  trade secret  which protects information not generally known or readily ascertainable that is valuable to the secret holder  and trademark  which protects branding and other exclusive properties of products and services  Any matter that meets these criteria can be protected 
Sui generis statutes exist in many countries that extend intellectual property protection to matter that does not meet characteristic definitions  For example  integrated circuit layouts  ship hull designs  fashion designs in France  databases  and plant varieties require sui generis statutes because of their unique characteristics  The United States  Japan  Australia  and many EU countries protect the topography of semiconductor chips and integrated circuits under sui generis laws  which borrow some aspects from patent or copyright law  In the U S   this sui generis law is known as the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of

In statutory interpretation  sui generis refers to the problem of giving meaning to groups of words where one of the words is ambiguous or inherently unclear 
In road traffic law  a statute may require consideration of large vehicles separately from other vehicles  The word  large  is ambiguous per se but may be considered  heavy   The relevant legislation  in Australian law  contain sections called  Terms used  or  Definitions  that itemise all words deemed ambiguous and confers specific interpretations consistent with natural language  One indicates  heavy vehicle  means a vehicle with a GVM over     tons  and GVM means  gross vehicle mass   the maximum loaded mass of the vehicle  Further explanations cover various contingencies  Thus   large  is equivalent to  heavy  and is  for this unique case  clearly defined sui generis 
In U S  attorney admissions  an applicant for admission to the practice of law may be referred to the state committee on character and fitness  where proceedings are  neither civil nor criminal  but are sui generis              

Town planning law edit 
In town and country planning in the United Kingdom  in particular  relating to the Town and Country Planning  Use Classes  Order       many common types of land use are categorised into specific  use classes   Change of use of land within a use class does not require planning permission  changing between use classes might require planning permission  and approval is always needed if the new use is sui generis 
Examples of sui generis uses include embassies  theatres  amusement arcades  laundrettes  taxi or vehicle hire businesses  petrol filling stations  scrapyards  nightclubs  motor car showrooms  retail warehouses  clubs and hostels             
As of   September      following the Town and Country Planning  Use Classes   Amendment   England  Regulations                   the following uses were added as sui generis             

public houses  wine bars  or drinking establishments  previously Class A  
drinking establishments with expanded food provision  previously Class A  
hot food takeaways  previously Class A  
venues for live music performance
cinemas  previously Class D  a  
concert halls  previously D  b

dance halls  previously D  d  
The grant of private hire vehicle  taxicab  operators licences by local authorities frequently has a condition that the appropriate sui generis change of use planning permission is granted to those premises to ensure those businesses cannot trade lawfully without the relevant planning consent 

International law edit 
When applied to international law   sui generis  refers to situations which are distinct and thus not easily categorized under existing legal frameworks or conventions  Sui generis in international law may suggest novel legal frameworks to address unprecedented issues using a new set of legal principles  For example  the legal status of the internet or space law 
Sui generis systems can be crucial in international law because they allow the international community to develop adaptive legal responses to emerging global challenges and contexts that are not adequately addressed by traditional international law  They often also serve as precursors to the evolution of wider customary international law or the development of new treaties and conventions  The uniqueness of sui generis legal regimes can sometimes make them challenging to interpret  enforce  or harmonize with existing legal frameworks             
Another example of Sui Generis can be seen in the field of laws of war in international law  According to scholar Noura Erakat in Justice for Some  Law and Question of Palestine         especially within the period of the Second Intifada of the Israeli Palestinian conflict  Israel uses the concept of Sui Generis to justify its military actions in the occupied territories  in contravention of pre exssting legal norms  She refers to its use of military pre emptive strikes towards Palestinians suspected of being involved with Palestinian militant organisations such as in the West Bank and Gaza Strip              Erakat highlights its use of Sui Generis through the legal inconsistencies that arises when balancing Israel s responsibility as the occupying power of the west bank and its justification for its use of premptive strikes              Another example Erakat refers to is Israel s legal legal interpretation of the laws of war in The Second Intifada  Erakat argues that  to not grant Palestinian militant groups the rights of belligerent groups and to non combatants in the occupied territories given by the international laws of conflict  it had argued that conflict as  short of war   under the concept of Sui Generis              This for Erakat  allowed Israel to wield international law in order to fulfill its aims during the conflict without following the pre existing legal conventions regarding armed conflict 

Philosophy edit 
Analytic philosophy often uses the expression to indicate an idea  an entity  or a reality that cannot be reduced to a lower concept or included in a higher concept  G       E  Moore  for example  refuted reductive ethical naturalism in moral theories like utilitarianism by arguing that  moral properties  like good or bad  could not be reduced to or equated with non moral properties  like pleasure  because moral properties are sui generis  This can be seen in Moore s open question argument                         

Politics and society edit 
In political philosophy  the unparalleled development of the European Union as compared with other international organizations has led to its designation as a sui generis geopolitical entity  The legal nature of the EU is widely debated because its mixture of intergovernmental and supranational elements causes it to share characteristics with both confederal and federal entities  It is generally considered more than a confederation but less than a federation              thus being appropriately classified as an instance of neither political form  Compared to other international organizations  the EU is often considered  sui generis  because its legal system comprehensively rejects any use of retaliatory sanctions by one member state against another             
A similar case that led to the use of the label sui generis is the relationship of New Caledonia relative to France because the legal status of New Caledonia can aptly be said to lie somewhere between a French overseas collectivity and a sovereign nation  Although other examples of such status for further dependent or disputed territories may exist  this arrangement is unique within the French realm 
The legal status of the Holy See is also described as a sui generis entity possessing an international personality  The Sovereign Military Order of Malta has likewise been described as a  sui generis primary subject of public international law               Another entity widely considered to have sui generis international legal personality is the International Committee of the Red Cross             
In local government  a sui generis entity does not fit with a country s general scheme of local governance  For example  in England  the City of London and the Isles of Scilly are the two sui generis localities  as their forms of local government are both  for historical or geographical reasons  very different from those of elsewhere in the country  
In a press conference during which reporters were trying to analyse his political personality   Huey Long said  say that I am sui generis  and let it go at that              
The Joint Council of Municipalities in Croatia is a sui generis council of municipalities in the east of the country that was formed after the Erdut Agreement and UNTAES mission aimed at protection of the rights of the ethnic Serb community in the region and is  as such  a unique form of local cooperation and minority self government in Croatia                                     

Sociology edit 
In sociology  methodological holists argue that social phenomena exist in their own right  sui generis  and are not reducible to the actions of individuals              For example  Emile Durkheim argued that the suicide rate was a social phenomenon sui generis  existing over and above the actions of individuals              In a social constructionist perspective   sui generis is what has been externalized  then internalized in the overall public and becomes a part of society that exists in its construct  It is not something that is not thought to have been created because it is embedded in everyone s way of thinking and being  Instances include love  going to school  or clothing belonging to a specific gender  These examples are sui generis for they exist in society and are widely accepted without thoughts of where they come from or how they were created
