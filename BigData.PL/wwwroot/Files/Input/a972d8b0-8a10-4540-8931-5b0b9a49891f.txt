Early years
Larry Page and Sergey Brin in     
Google began in January      as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were both PhD students at Stanford University in California                                      The project initially involved an unofficial  third founder   Scott Hassan  the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine  but he left before Google was officially founded as a company                          Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in                              Then Chairman and CEO Eric Schmidt  left  with co founders Sergey Brin  center  and Larry Page  right  in     
Google s original homepage had a simplistic design because the company founders had little experience in HTML  the markup language used for designing web pages            
While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page  they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites              They called this algorithm PageRank  it determined a website s relevance by the number of pages  and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site                          Page told his ideas to Hassan  who began writing the code to implement Page s ideas              Page and Brin would also use their friend Susan Wojcicki s garage as their office when the search engine was set up in                  
Page and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine  BackRub  because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site                                      Hassan  as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being critical to the development of Google  Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later co authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project  describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search engine  published in       H ctor Garc a Molina and Jeffrey Ullman were also cited as contributors to the project              PageRank was influenced by a similar page ranking and site scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex  developed by Robin Li in       with Larry Page s PageRank patent including a citation to Li s earlier RankDex patent  Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu                         
Eventually  they changed the name to Google  the name of the search engine was a misspelling of the word googol                                      a very large number written          followed by     zeros   picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information             
Google was initially funded by an August      investment of          from Andy Bechtolsheim              co founder of Sun Microsystems  This initial investment served as a motivation to incorporate the company to be able to use the funds                          Page and Brin initially approached David Cheriton for advice because he had a nearby office in Stanford  and they knew he had startup experience  having recently sold the company he co founded  Granite Systems  to Cisco for      million  David arranged a meeting with Page and Brin and his Granite co founder Andy Bechtolsheim  The meeting was set for   a m  at the front porch of David s home in Palo Alto and it had to be brief because Andy had another meeting at Cisco  where he now worked after the acquisition  at   a m  Andy briefly tested a demo of the website  liked what he saw  and then went back to his car to grab the check  David Cheriton later also joined in with a          investment                         
Google received money from two other angel investors in       Amazon com founder Jeff Bezos  and entrepreneur Ram Shriram              Page and Brin had first approached Shriram  who was a venture capitalist  for funding and counsel  and Shriram invested          in Google in February       Shriram knew Bezos because Amazon had acquired Junglee  at which Shriram was the president  It was Shriram who told Bezos about Google  Bezos asked Shriram to meet Google s founders and they met six months after Shriram had made his investment when Bezos and his wife were on a vacation trip to the Bay Area  Google s initial funding round had already formally closed but Bezos  status as CEO of Amazon was enough to persuade Page and Brin to extend the round and accept his investment                         
Between these initial investors  friends and family Google raised around             which is what allowed them to open up their original shop in Menlo Park  California             
Craig Silverstein  a fellow PhD student at Stanford  was hired as the first employee                                     
After some additional  small investments through the end of      to early                   a new     million round of funding was announced on June                      with major investors including the venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital              Both firms were initially hesitant about investing jointly in Google  as each wanted to retain a larger percentage of control over the company to themselves  Larry and Sergey however insisted on taking investments from both  Both venture companies finally agreed to investing jointly       million each due to their belief in Google s great potential and through the mediation of earlier angel investors Ron Conway and Ram Shriram who had contacts in the venture companies

Additionally  in      Google s investors felt the need to have a strong internal management  and they agreed to hire Eric Schmidt as the chairman and CEO of Google              Eric was proposed by John Doerr from Kleiner Perkins  He had been trying to find a CEO that Sergey and Larry would accept for several months  but they rejected several candidates because they wanted to retain control over the company  Michael Moritz from Sequoia Capital at one point even menaced requesting Google to immediately pay back Sequoia s      m investment if they did not fulfill their promise to hire a chief executive officer  which had been made verbally during investment negotiations  Eric was not initially enthusiastic about joining Google either  as the company s full potential had not yet been widely recognized at the time  and as he was occupied with his responsibilities at Novell where he was CEO  As part of him joining  Eric agreed to buy    million of Google preferred stocks as a way to show his commitment and to provide funds Google needed
