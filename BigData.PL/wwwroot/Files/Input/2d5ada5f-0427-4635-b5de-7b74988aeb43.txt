In the history of artificial intelligence  an AI winter is a period of reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence research             The field has experienced several hype cycles  followed by disappointment and criticism  followed by funding cuts  followed by renewed interest years or even decades later 
The term first appeared in      as the topic of a public debate at the annual meeting of AAAI  then called the  American Association of Artificial Intelligence               Roger Schank and Marvin Minsky two leading AI researchers who experienced the  winter  of the     s warned the business community that enthusiasm for AI had spiraled out of control in the     s and that disappointment would certainly follow  They described a chain reaction  similar to a  nuclear winter   that would begin with pessimism in the AI community  followed by pessimism in the press  followed by a severe cutback in funding  followed by the end of serious research             Three years later the billion dollar AI industry began to collapse 
There were two major  winters  approximately           and                       and several smaller episodes  including the following 

      failure of machine translation
      criticism of perceptrons  early  single layer artificial neural networks 
         DARPA s frustration with the Speech Understanding Research program at Carnegie Mellon University
      large decrease in AI research in the United Kingdom in response to the Lighthill report
         DARPA s cutbacks to academic AI research in general
      collapse of the LISP machine market
      cancellation of new spending on AI by the Strategic Computing Initiative
    s  many expert systems were abandoned
    s  end of the Fifth Generation computer project s original goals
Enthusiasm and optimism about AI has generally increased since its low point in the early     s  Beginning about       interest in artificial intelligence  and especially the sub field of machine learning  from the research and corporate communities led to a dramatic increase in funding and investment  leading to the current  as of          update       AI boom 


Early episodes edit 
Machine translation and the ALPAC report of      edit 
See also  History of machine translation
Natural language processing  NLP  research has its roots in the early     s and began its existence with the work on machine translation  MT              However  significant advancements and applications began to emerge after the publication of Warren Weaver s influential memorandum  Machine translation of languages  fourteen essays in                  The memorandum generated great excitement within the research community  In the following years  notable events unfolded  IBM embarked on the development of the first machine  MIT appointed its first full time professor in machine translation  and several conferences dedicated to MT took place  The culmination came with the public demonstration of the Georgetown IBM machine  which garnered widespread attention in respected newspapers in                 
Just like all AI booms that have been followed by desperate AI winters  the media tended to exaggerate the significance of these developments  Headlines about the Georgetown IBM experiment proclaimed phrases like  The bilingual machine    Robot brain translates Russian into King s English              and  Polyglot brainchild              However  the actual demonstration involved the translation of a curated set of only    Russian sentences into English  with the machine s vocabulary limited to just     words             To put things into perspective  a      study made by Paul Nation found that humans need a vocabulary of around       to       word families to comprehend written texts with     accuracy            
During the Cold War  the US government was particularly interested in the automatic  instant translation of Russian documents and scientific reports  The government aggressively supported efforts at machine translation starting in       Another factor that propelled the field of mechanical translation was the interest shown by the Central Intelligence Agency  CIA   During that period  the CIA firmly believed in the importance of developing machine translation capabilities and supported such initiatives  They also recognized that this program had implications that extended beyond the interests of the CIA and the intelligence community            

At the outset  the researchers were optimistic  Noam Chomsky s new work in grammar was streamlining the translation process and there were  many predictions of imminent  breakthroughs               Briefing for US Vice President Gerald Ford in      on the junction grammar based computer translation modelHowever  researchers had underestimated the profound difficulty of word sense disambiguation  In order to translate a sentence  a machine needed to have some idea what the sentence was about  otherwise it made mistakes  An apocryphal             example is  the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak   Translated back and forth with Russian  it became  the vodka is good but the meat is rotten               Later researchers would call this the commonsense knowledge problem 
By       the National Research Council had become concerned about the lack of progress and formed the Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee  ALPAC  to look into the problem  They concluded  in a famous      report  that machine translation was more expensive  less accurate and slower than human translation  After spending some    million dollars  the NRC ended all support  Careers were destroyed and research ended                        
Machine translation shared the same path with NLP from the rule based approaches through the statistical approaches up to the neural network approaches  which have in      culminated in large language models 

The failure of single layer neural networks in      edit 
See also  Perceptrons  book  and Frank Rosenblatt
Simple networks or circuits of connected units  including Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch s neural network for logic and Marvin Minsky s SNARC system  have failed to deliver the promised results and were abandoned in the late     s  Following the success of programs such as the Logic Theorist and the General Problem Solver              algorithms for manipulating symbols seemed more promising at the time as means to achieve logical reasoning viewed at the time as the essence of intelligence  either natural or artificial  
Interest in perceptrons  invented by Frank Rosenblatt  was kept alive only by the sheer force of his personality             
He optimistically predicted that the perceptron  may eventually be able to learn  make decisions  and translate languages              
Mainstream research into perceptrons ended partially because the      book Perceptrons by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert emphasized the limits of what perceptrons could do              While it was already known that multilayered perceptrons are not subject to the criticism  nobody in the     s knew how to train a multilayered perceptron  Backpropagation was still years away             
Major funding for projects neural network approaches was difficult to find in the     s and early     s              Important theoretical work continued despite the lack of funding  The  winter  of neural network approach came to an end in the middle     s  when the work of John Hopfield  David Rumelhart and others revived large scale interest              Rosenblatt did not live to see this  however  as he died in a boating accident shortly after Perceptrons was published             

The setbacks of      edit 
The Lighthill report edit 
See also  Lighthill report
In       professor Sir James Lighthill was asked by the UK Parliament to evaluate the state of AI research in the United Kingdom  His report  now called the Lighthill report  criticized the utter failure of AI to achieve its  grandiose objectives   He concluded that nothing being done in AI could not be done in other sciences  He specifically mentioned the problem of  combinatorial explosion  or  intractability   which implied that many of AI s most successful algorithms would grind to a halt on real world problems and were only suitable for solving  toy  versions             
The report was contested in a debate broadcast in the BBC  Controversy  series in       The debate  The general purpose robot is a mirage  from the Royal Institution was Lighthill versus the team of Donald Michie  John McCarthy and Richard Gregory              McCarthy later wrote that  the combinatorial explosion problem has been recognized in AI from the beginning              
The report led to the complete dismantling of AI research in the UK              AI research continued in only a few universities  Edinburgh  Essex and Sussex   Research would not revive on a large scale until       when Alvey  a research project of the British Government  began to fund AI again from a war chest of      million in response to the Japanese Fifth Generation Project  see below   Alvey had a number of UK only requirements which did not sit well internationally  especially with US partners  and lost Phase   funding 

DARPA s early     s funding cuts edit 
During the     s  the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  then known as  ARPA   now known as  DARPA   provided millions of dollars for AI research with few strings attached  J  C  R  Licklider  the founding director of DARPA s computing division  believed in  funding people  not projects              and he and several successors allowed AI s leaders  such as Marvin Minsky  John McCarthy  Herbert A  Simon or Allen Newell  to spend it almost any way they liked 
This attitude changed after the passage of Mansfield Amendment in       which required DARPA to fund  mission oriented direct research  rather than basic undirected research               Pure undirected research of the kind that had gone on in the     s would no longer be funded by DARPA  Researchers now had to show that their work would soon produce some useful military technology  AI research proposals were held to a very high standard  The situation was not helped when the Lighthill report and DARPA s own study  the American Study Group  suggested that most AI research was unlikely to produce anything truly useful in the foreseeable future  DARPA s money was directed at specific projects with identifiable goals  such as autonomous tanks and battle management systems  By       funding for AI projects was hard to find             
AI researcher Hans Moravec blamed the crisis on the unrealistic predictions of his colleagues   Many researchers were caught up in a web of increasing exaggeration  Their initial promises to DARPA had been much too optimistic  Of course  what they delivered stopped considerably short of that  But they felt they couldn t in their next proposal promise less than in the first one  so they promised more               The result  Moravec claims  is that some of the staff at DARPA had lost patience with AI research   It was literally phrased at DARPA that  some of these people were going to be taught a lesson      by      having their two million dollar a year contracts cut to almost nothing    Moravec told Daniel Crevier             
While the autonomous tank project was a failure  the battle management system  the Dynamic Analysis and Replanning Tool  proved to be enormously successful  saving billions in the first Gulf War  repaying all of DARPAs investment in AI             and justifying DARPA s pragmatic policy             

The SUR debacle edit 
As described in             

In       the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  DARPA  began an ambitious five year experiment in speech understanding  The goals of the project were to provide recognition of utterances from a limited vocabulary in near real time  Three organizations finally demonstrated systems at the conclusion of the project in       These were Carnegie Mellon University  CMU   who actually demonstrated two systems  HEARSAY II and HARPY   Bolt  Beranek and Newman  BBN   and System Development Corporation with Stanford Research Institute  SDC SRI 
The system that came closest to satisfying the original project goals was the CMU HARPY system  The relatively high performance of the HARPY system was largely achieved through  hard wiring  information about possible utterances into the system s knowledge base  Although HARPY made some interesting contributions  its dependence on extensive pre knowledge limited the applicability of the approach to other signal understanding tasks 
DARPA was deeply disappointed with researchers working on the Speech Understanding Research program at Carnegie Mellon University  DARPA had hoped for  and felt it had been promised  a system that could respond to voice commands from a pilot  The SUR team had developed a system which could recognize spoken English  but only if the words were spoken in a particular order  DARPA felt it had been duped and  in       they cancelled a three million dollar a year contract             
Many years later  several successful commercial speech recognition systems would use the technology developed by the Carnegie Mellon team  such as hidden Markov models  and the market for speech recognition systems would reach    billion by                  
Reddy gives a review of progress in speech understanding at the end of the DARPA project in a      article in Proceedings of the IEEE             

Contrary view edit 
Thomas Haigh argues that activity in the domain of AI did not slow down  even as funding from DoD was being redirected  mostly in the wake of congressional legislation meant to separate military and academic activities              That indeed professional interest was growing throughout the   s  Using the membership count of ACM s SIGART  the Special Interest Group on Artificial Intelligence  as a proxy for interest in the subject  the author writes                    I located two data sources  neither of which supports the idea of a broadly based AI winter during the     s  One is membership of ACM s SIGART  the major venue for sharing news and research abstracts during the     s  When the Lighthill report was published in      the fast growing group had       members  approximately twice the level in       The next five years are conventionally thought of as the darkest part of the first AI winter  Was the AI community shrinking  No  By mid      SIGART membership had almost tripled  to        Not only was the group growing faster than ever  it was increasing proportionally faster than ACM as a whole which had begun to plateau  expanding by less than     over the entire period from      to        One in every    ACM members was in SIGART 
The setbacks of the late     s and early     s edit 
The collapse of the LISP machine market edit 
In the     s  a form of AI program called an  expert system  was adopted by corporations around the world  The first commercial expert system was XCON  developed at Carnegie Mellon for Digital Equipment Corporation  and it was an enormous success  it was estimated to have saved the company    million dollars over just six years of operation  Corporations around the world began to develop and deploy expert systems and by      they were spending over a billion dollars on AI  most of it to in house AI departments  An industry grew up to support them  including software companies like Teknowledge and Intellicorp  KEE   and hardware companies like Symbolics and LISP Machines Inc  who built specialized computers  called LISP machines  that were optimized to process the programming language LISP  the preferred language for AI research in the USA                         
In       three years after Minsky and Schank s prediction  the market for specialized LISP based AI hardware collapsed  Workstations by companies like Sun Microsystems offered a powerful alternative to LISP machines and companies like Lucid offered a LISP environment for this new class of workstations  The performance of these general workstations became an increasingly difficult challenge for LISP Machines  Companies like Lucid and Franz LISP offered increasingly powerful versions of LISP that were portable to all UNIX systems  For example  benchmarks were published showing workstations maintaining a performance advantage over LISP machines              Later desktop computers built by Apple and IBM would also offer a simpler and more popular architecture to run LISP applications on  By       some of them had become as powerful as the more expensive LISP machines  The desktop computers had rule based engines such as CLIPS available              These alternatives left consumers with no reason to buy an expensive machine specialized for running LISP  An entire industry worth half a billion dollars was replaced in a single year             
By the early     s  most commercial LISP companies had failed  including Symbolics  LISP Machines Inc   Lucid Inc   etc  Other companies  like Texas Instruments and Xerox  abandoned the field  A small number of customer companies  that is  companies using systems written in LISP and developed on LISP machine platforms  continued to maintain systems  In some cases  this maintenance involved the assumption of the resulting support work             

Slowdown in deployment of expert systems edit 
By the early     s  the earliest successful expert systems  such as XCON  proved too expensive to maintain  They were difficult to update  they could not learn  they were  brittle   i e   they could make grotesque mistakes when given unusual inputs   and they fell prey to problems  such as the qualification problem  that had been identified years earlier in research in nonmonotonic logic  Expert systems proved useful  but only in a few special contexts                          Another problem dealt with the computational hardness of truth maintenance efforts for general knowledge  KEE used an assumption based approach supporting multiple world scenarios that was difficult to understand and apply 
The few remaining expert system shell companies were eventually forced to downsize and search for new markets and software paradigms  like case based reasoning or universal database access  The maturation of Common Lisp saved many systems such as ICAD which found application in knowledge based engineering  Other systems  such as Intellicorp s KEE  moved from LISP to a C    variant  on the PC and helped establish object oriented technology  including providing major support for the development of UML  see UML Partners  

The end of the Fifth Generation project edit 
See also  Fifth Generation Computer Systems
In       the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry set aside      million for the Fifth Generation computer project  Their objectives were to write programs and build machines that could carry on conversations  translate languages  interpret pictures  and reason like human beings  By       the impressive list of goals penned in      had not been met  According to HP Newquist in The Brain Makers   On June          The Fifth Generation Project ended not with a successful roar  but with a whimper               As with other AI projects  expectations had run much higher than what was actually possible                         

Strategic Computing Initiative cutbacks edit 
See also  Strategic Computing Initiative
In       in response to the fifth generation project  DARPA again began to fund AI research through the Strategic Computing Initiative  As originally proposed the project would begin with practical  achievable goals  which even included artificial general intelligence as long term objective  The program was under the direction of the Information Processing Technology Office  IPTO  and was also directed at supercomputing and microelectronics  By      it had spent      million and    projects were underway at    institutions  half in industry  half in universities and government labs  AI research was well funded by the SCI             
Jack Schwarz  who ascended to the leadership of IPTO in       dismissed expert systems as  clever programming  and cut funding to AI  deeply and brutally    eviscerating  SCI  Schwarz felt that DARPA should focus its funding only on those technologies which showed the most promise  in his words  DARPA should  surf   rather than  dog paddle   and he felt strongly AI was not  the next wave   Insiders in the program cited problems in communication  organization and integration  A few projects survived the funding cuts  including pilot s assistant and an autonomous land vehicle  which were never delivered  and the DART battle management system  which  as noted above  was successful             

AI winter of the     s and early     s edit 
A survey of reports from the early     s suggests that AI s reputation was still poor 

Alex Castro  quoted in The Economist    June         Investors  were put off by the term  voice recognition  which  like  artificial intelligence   is associated with systems that have all too often failed to live up to their promises              
Patty Tascarella in Pittsburgh Business Times         Some believe the word  robotics  actually carries a stigma that hurts a company s chances at funding              
John Markoff in the New York Times         At its low point  some computer scientists and software engineers avoided the term artificial intelligence for fear of being viewed as wild eyed dreamers              
Many researchers in AI in the mid     s deliberately called their work by other names  such as informatics  machine learning  analytics  knowledge based systems  business rules management  cognitive systems  intelligent systems  intelligent agents or computational intelligence  to indicate that their work emphasizes particular tools or is directed at a particular sub problem  Although this may be partly because they consider their field to be fundamentally different from AI  it is also true that the new names help to procure funding by avoiding the stigma of false promises attached to the name  artificial intelligence                          
In the late     s and early   st century  AI technology became widely used as elements of larger systems                          but the field is rarely credited for these successes  In       Nick Bostrom explained that  a lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications  often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it s not labeled AI anymore               Rodney Brooks stated around the same time that  there s this stupid myth out there that AI has failed  but AI is around you every second of the day              

Current AI spring       present  edit 
Main article  AI boom
AI has reached the highest levels of interest and funding in its history in the     s by every possible measure  including  
publications              
patent applications             
total investment      billion in                    and 
job openings          U S  job openings in                   
The successes of the current  AI spring  or  AI boom  are advances in language translation  in particular  Google Translate   image recognition  spurred by the ImageNet training database  as commercialized by Google Image Search  and in game playing systems such as AlphaZero  chess champion  and AlphaGo  go champion   and Watson  Jeopardy champion   A turning point was in      when AlexNet  a deep learning network  won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge with half as many errors as the second place winner             
The      release of OpenAI s AI chatbot ChatGPT which as of January      has over     million users              has reinvigorated the discussion about artificial intelligence and its effects on the world
