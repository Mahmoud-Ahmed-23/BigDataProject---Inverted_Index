							Oil producing Arab states are under pressure by low oil prices  and a foreseeable opening up of Iran on the world oil markets 
Developing countries have abundantly spent on crude oil and petroleum product imports  which revived their economies  On the contrary  revenues for oil exporting countries have reduced  as they seek market control 
The exporting countries continue to increase their crude oil production  which led to a surplus of  m barrels between world production and consumption  This surplus is expected to increase as Iran starts exporting now that the sanctions have been lifted 
The total world production of crude oil is      m barrels a day  while consumption is estimated at      m  according to a report released by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  
       We will not be able to implement exploration and development plans with the continued decline in Brent         say foreign partners 
An official at a foreign oil company said that oil exporting governments confirmed their lack of intention to reduce their crude oil production  and that they will work to increase their exports to the world markets  This will  in turn  lead to a large drop in the profits of foreign companies and countries 
The official added that foreign oil companies will not be able to continue to invest in the same financial capacity in the implementation of development and exploration plans in their franchise areas  This is due to decreased profits and a significant reduction in labour in order to rationalise expenditure 
The official raised the question of whether foreign companies will remain committed to investment plans agreed upon with the Egyptian government  He predicted that nobody should get their hopes as in increasing oil production in light of the Brent price decrease as Egypt gets a partner share at world prices in accordance to the agreements 
Saudi Arabia acquires     of the global oil production
Saudi Arabia controls about     of the world s crude oil production  It produces about      m barrels of crude oil per day  and exports      m barrels to global markets daily 
Saudi Oil Minister Ali Al Naimi said in previous statements that        it is impossible        for his country to reduce its production of crude oil  despite the prices drop in the global market  This was so Saudi Arabia could stay on the top of OPEC       s list of oil exporting countries 
He explained that Saudi Arabia s economy and industry can afford temporary fluctuations in oil revenues  stressing that Riyadh shall continue its balanced policy firmly and strongly 
In an interview with USA Today at the beginning of the year  Prince Al Waleed bin Talal said that the Saudi decision not to reduce its production of oil is correct  He justified it by saying that  if Saudi Arabia did reduce its production by one or two million barrels  other producers would secure them  which could lead to less production as well as lower prices 
Russia comes in second in exporting oil with a daily production of about      m barrels of crude oil  Its total oil production is estimated at      m barrels a day 
The UAE is in third place on the list of oil exporting countries  It supplies global markets with about      m barrels a day  while its total production is of      m barrels per day 
As for Kuwait  it sells approximately      m barrels of crude oil daily  which puts it in fourth place on the list  Kuwait       s total oil production is estimated to have reached      m barrels per day 
Iran currently comes in fifth for exporting approximately      m barrels of crude oil a day under embargo sanctions  It is expected to add  m barrels per day for export after lifting these bans  as its daily total production currently stands at      m barrels 
The World Bank said that Iran is expected to pump  m barrels of crude a day to the world oil market  which will drop the prices by around     a barrel in      
Qatar is number six on the list  It exports about         barrels per day  while its total output currently stands at         barrels 
Oil companies decrease shale oil production in US 
The US occupies last place in terms of exporting oil by exporting         barrels per day despite producing nearly      m barrels 
Shale oil production companies in the US began to swiftly decrease drilling operations in a way that may lead to a decrease in crude oil production  The move was to keep up with the decline in crude prices and the competition with petroleum producers in the Gulf region 
The US  Energy Information Administration  EIA  said in its short term energy outlook report that the average price of crude Brent reached     in July  and prices declined again in early August to settle at an average of     
The EIA reduced its forecast of crude oil prices for both short and medium term to an average of     per barrel throughout       and nearly     in      
Brent prices to drop to     per barrel by end of     
Medhat Youssef  former Vice Chairman of the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation  EGPC   predicted that the price per oil barrel would drop to     by the end of       This figure compares to a current price of     in light of lifting the ban on Iran  and its entering into the oil exporting competition with large quantities  Its current production is estimated at     m barrels per day  and it seeks to reach nearly    m in the upcoming months 
Youssef said that the drop in Brent prices during the      economic crisis was not the creation of exporting countries that are currently fighting over control of the market  It was  instead  the result of the global financial crisis that was started by the US because of the real estate market 
Expectations of EGP   bn decline in fuel subsidies bill 
A senior Egyptian government official said it is expected that Egypt would achieve an availability of at least EGP   bn in the fuel subsidies bill during FY            because the government has specified subsidies allocations for the price of     per barrel 
Foreign partners have resorted to reducing their investments in crude oil research and exploration despite the continuation of the Brent price drop in FY            The ministry also delayed the announcement of the actual number that was monitored for the research and exploration of oil and gas 
The discords that took place confirmed that there were attempts to pressure partners into not reducing their investments  It is believed that  in the final accounts at the end of this year  it will be discovered that companies have reduced their actual investments in oil and gas to   bn  as a maximum  instead of prior agreed upon investments of     bn 
In its FY           plan  the Ministry of Petroleum hopes to keep crude oil production rates fixed at         barrels daily  However  the current situation will prevent this from happening  as foreign partners have already reduced their investments to     bn in FY            compared to     bn in FY            according to the plan 
The increase in the surplus of oil production in global markets will contribute to the Brent decline  where the current difference between global production and consumption of petroleum is nearly  m barrels per day 
       oil workers dismissed due to oil prices drop
Since crude oil prices began to decline last year  petroleum companies announced their plans of dismissing more than         workers worldwide  A further        workers at least were dismissed  the vast majority being in the field of oil and drilling and services companies  according to research by Graves  amp  Co  a Houston consulting firm 
The dismissal of workers included highly skilled staff  including geologists and petroleum engineers  and they are the ones who feel the greatest burdens of the declines Â  In previous statements  Tim Cook  chairman of Pathfinder Staffing Company in Houston  Texas  said         Each time an oil rig gets shut down  all the jobs at the work site are gone  They disappear        
Statements on the Brent prices decline
John England  deputy chairman of Deloitte s Global Energy  amp  Resources group  said in the company       s      insights that new shale oil and deep water projects in North America could be delayed for their high cost and the dramatic decline of Brent prices  He expressed his optimism about the ability of US producers to withstand the current storm 
 Saudi Arabia is significantly responsible for the dramatic drop of oil prices during recent months   said Richard Fisher  chairman of Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas 
Not long ago  Oilpro newspaper quoted Bob Dudley  CEO of British Petroleum  BP  Global  saying that  it is the law of supply and demand   indicating that  what is happening now reminds him a little of the incident of       as we may go through a period of severe drop in oil prices  
 nbsp 
Dudley added that he will wait for a long time before he can see the price of crude reaching      a barrel again 
Algeria s Minister of Energy  Salah Khabry  said that  OPEC cannot do much on its own to stop the decline of oil prices and it needs producers from outside the organisation to assist in reducing global supply   according to Algerian Libert  newspaper 
He noted that the    OPEC state members obtain     of global production of crude oil 
Khabry had called for an urgent meeting of OPEC on the continuing collapse of oil prices six months ago  amid the increase of US production 
Foreign reserves in Algeria fell by     estimated to       bn in March      compared to       while Saudi Arabia       s reserves fell by    during the same period
