History edit 
On    January       DeepSeek released the chatbot  based on the DeepSeek R  model  for iOS and Android  By    January  DeepSeek R  surpassed ChatGPT as the most downloaded freeware app on the iOS App Store in the United States             which resulted in an     drop in Nvidia s share price                        After a  large scale  cyberattack on the same day disrupted the proper functioning of its servers  DeepSeek limited its new user registration to phone numbers from mainland China  email addresses  or Google account logins                       
On   April       in collaboration with researchers at Tsinghua University  DeepSeek published a paper unveiling a new model that combines the techniques generative reward modeling  GRM  and self principled critique tuning  SPCT   The resulting model is referred to as DeepSeek GRM  The goal of using these techniques is to foster more effective inference time scaling within their LLM and chatbot services  Notably DeepSeek has said that these new models will be released and made open source                        
On    April       Deepseek released its math focused Artificial Intelligence Model named  DeepSeek Prover V     B               This Model is useful for formal theorem proving and mathematical reasoning                         

Usage edit 
DeepSeek can answer questions  solve logic problems  and write computer programs on par with other chatbots  according to benchmark tests used by American AI companies            
Users can access the chatbot for free through the official DeepSeek website or mobile application  without limitation on the number of queries              DeepSeek also offers access to the R  and V  models that power the chatbot via an API with a usage based pricing model              This modality is primarily targeted towards developers and businesses  As of February       API usage is priced at approximately       per million input tokens and       per million output tokens  making it less expensive than some competing services             

Operation edit 
DeepSeek V  uses significantly fewer resources compared to its peers  For example  whereas the world s leading AI companies train their chatbots with supercomputers using as many as        graphics processing units  GPUs   DeepSeek claims to have needed only about       GPUs namely  the H    series chips from Nvidia                          It was trained in around    days at a cost of US      million              which is roughly one tenth of what tech giant Meta spent building its latest AI technology            

Reactions edit 
DeepSeek s success against larger and more established rivals has been described as  upending AI              constituting  the first shot at what is emerging as a global AI space race              and ushering in  a new era of AI brinkmanship              

Challenge to US AI dominance edit 
DeepSeek s competitive performance at relatively minimal cost has been recognized as potentially challenging the global dominance of American AI models              Various publications and news media  such as The Hill and The Guardian  have described the release of the R  chatbot as a  Sputnik moment  for American AI                                      echoing Marc Andreessen s view  OpenAI wrote a letter to the Office of Science and Technology Policy  OSTP   in March       citing issues concerning a possibility that Deepseek could manipulate responses to cause harm             

Chinese perspective edit 
DeepSeek s founder Liang Wenfeng has been compared to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman  with CNN calling him the Sam Altman of China and an evangelist for AI              Chinese state media widely praised DeepSeek as a national asset                          On    January       China s Premier Li Qiang invited Wenfeng to his symposium with experts and asked him to provide opinions and suggestions on a draft for comments of the annual      government work report              On    February             Wenfeng met with Xi Jinping  who encouraged government officials to experiment with DeepSeek              Government officials responded to Xi s approval of the chatbot by reportedly using it to draft legal judgements  propose medical treatment plans  and analyze surveillance videos to search for missing persons             

Performance and success edit 
Leading figures in the American AI sector had mixed reactions to DeepSeek s performance and success              Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Altman whose companies are involved in the United States government backed  Stargate Project  to develop American AI infrastructure both called DeepSeek  super impressive                           Various companies including Amazon Web Services  Toyota  and Stripe are seeking to use the model in their program              When American President Donald Trump announced The Stargate Project  he referred to DeepSeek as a wake up call             and a positive development                                                 
Other leaders in the AI field  however including Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang  Anthropic cofounder and CEO Dario Amodei  and Elon Musk have expressed skepticism of the app s performance or of the sustainability of its success                                     

Stock market implications edit 
DeepSeek s optimization of limited resources has highlighted potential limits of United States sanctions on China s AI development  including export restrictions on advanced AI chips to China                          The success of the company s AI models consequently  sparked market turmoil              and caused shares in major global technology companies to plunge on    January       Nvidia s stock fell by as much as                     as did the stock of rival Broadcom  Other tech firms also sank  including Microsoft  down        Google s owner Alphabet  down over      and Dutch chip equipment maker ASML  down over                  A global sell off of technology stocks on Nasdaq  prompted by the release of the R  model  led to record losses of about           billion in the market capitalizations of AI and computer hardware companies              and by the next day a total of    trillion of value was wiped from American stocks

Concerns edit 
Distillation edit 
DeepSeek has been reported to sometimes claim that it is ChatGPT                          OpenAI said that DeepSeek may have  inappropriately  used outputs from its model as training data in a process called distillation              However  there is currently no method to prove this conclusively             

Censorship edit 
See also  Chinese censorship abroad and Censorship in China
DeepSeek s compliance with Chinese government censorship policies and its data collection practices have raised concerns over privacy and information control in the model  prompting regulatory scrutiny in multiple countries 
Reports indicate that it applies content moderation in accordance with the government s  public opinion guidance  regulations  limiting responses on topics such as the Tiananmen Square massacre and Taiwan s political status                                      DeepSeek models that have been uncensored also display a bias towards Chinese government viewpoints on controversial topics such as Xi Jinping s human rights record and Taiwan s political status                          However  users who have downloaded the models and hosted them on their own devices and servers have reported successfully removing this censorship                         

Asked if Xi Jinping is an autocrat  DeepSeek apologises that this question is  beyond my current scope   The same question posed about Narendra Modi returns a  balanced analysis  of viewpoints  Some sources have observed that the official application programming interface  API  version of R   which runs from servers located in China  uses censorship mechanisms for topics considered politically sensitive for the government of China  For example  the model refuses to answer questions about the      Tiananmen Square massacre  persecution of Uyghurs  comparisons between Xi Jinping and Winnie the Pooh  and human rights in China                                      Although the AI may initially generate an answer  it then deletes it shortly afterwards and replaces it with a message such as              Sorry  that s beyond my current scope  Let s talk about something else  
The integrated censorship mechanisms and restrictions can only be removed to a limited extent in the open source version of the R  model              If the  core Socialist values  defined by the Chinese Internet regulatory authorities are touched on  or the political status of Taiwan is raised  discussions are terminated              Locally hosted instances of R  are still reported to provide answers consistent with Chinese Communist Party propaganda narratives              When tested by NBC News  for instance  DeepSeek s R  described Taiwan as  an inalienable part of China s territory   and stated              We firmly oppose any form of  Taiwan independence  separatist activities and are committed to achieving the complete reunification of the motherland through peaceful means  
In January       however  Western researchers were able to trick DeepSeek into giving certain answers to some of these topics by requesting in its answer to swap certain letters for similar looking numbers             

Security and privacy edit

Many experts fear that the government of China could use the AI system for foreign influence operations  spreading disinformation  surveillance  and the development of cyberweapons                                      An article in Wired commented that the DeepSeek online service sending data to its home country might set  the stage for greater scrutiny              
In February       South Korea s data protection regulator  the Personal Information Protection Commission  PIPC   raised concerns over DeepSeek  confirming that it sent the nation s user data to the owner of TikTok  ByteDance  in China  Accordingly  the PIPC banned new downloads of the app until DeepSeek addressed these concerns  The company s representative in Korea has partially acknowledged its shortcomings in complying with local data protection laws                         
On    January       cybersecurity researchers from Wiz Research found a significant data breach at DeepSeek  This occurred due to an improper configuration of a cloud storage database that was left available online without any security precautions The database at oauth callback deepseek com      and dev deepseek com      contained more than a million sensitive entries  which comprised chat messages  API keys  operational details from the backend  system logs  and internal metadata from   January       The breach was consequential as it provided complete control over the database  which could lead to unauthorized access and increased privileges within DeepSeek s systems  After Wiz Research reported the issue  DeepSeek secured the database in less than an hour  eliminating any immediate risks  However  the exposure sparked serious concerns about DeepSeek s data security practices and the possibility of facing regulatory action under laws like GDPR or CCPA  particularly if the data included personal information from EU or US residents                         
In April       South Korea s Personal Information Protection Commission announced that DeepSeek had transferred personal information on over a million South Koreans to China without consent             

Miscellaneous edit 
The Wall Street Journal reported that the DeepSeek app produces instructions for self harm and dangerous activities more often than its American competitors              Security researchers have found that DeepSeek sends data to a cloud platform affiliated with ByteDance                         
In February       sources claimed that DeepSeek began considering raising external funding for the first time  with Alibaba and Chinese state funds expressing interest in investing in DeepSeek                          On    February  DeepSeek announced plans to release key codes and data to the public starting the following week                         

Restrictions edit 
Many countries have raised concerns about data security and DeepSeek s use of personal data  On    January       the Italian data protection authority announced that it is seeking additional information on DeepSeek s collection and use of personal data              On the same day  the United States National Security Council announced that it had started a national security review of DeepSeek              and the United States Navy instructed all its members not to use DeepSeek due to  security and ethical concerns               On    January       Italy s data protection authority  ordered DeepSeek to block its chatbot in the country after the Chinese artificial intelligence startup failed to address the regulator s concerns over its privacy policy  Italian users who downloaded DeepSeek on mobile devices before the ban reported being able to use the chatbot and having access to the web version of DeepSeek after the ban             
Three days later  South Korea s Personal Information Protection Commission opened an inquiry into DeepSeek s use of personal information              the Dutch Data Protection Authority launched an investigation of DeepSeek              Taiwan s digital ministry advised its government departments against using the DeepSeek service to  prevent information security risks               and  Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued a state ban on government issued devices for DeepSeek  along with Xiaohongshu and Lemon              
In February       access to DeepSeek was banned on the New South Wales Department of Customer Service s devices              That same month  Australia  South Korea  and Canada banned DeepSeek from government devices                                      and South Korea suspended new downloads of DeepSeek due to risks of personal information misuse              In March       the U S  Department of Commerce prohibited DeepSeek on their government devices  due to the danger of disclosing proprietary information with the Chinese Communist Party
