Forms of artificial intelligence research
In the history of artificial intelligence  AI   neat and scruffy are two contrasting approaches to AI research  The distinction was made in the     s  and was a subject of discussion until the mid     s                                  
 Neats  use algorithms based on a single formal paradigm  such as logic  mathematical optimization  or neural networks  Neats verify their programs are correct via rigorous mathematical theory  Neat researchers and analysts tend to express the hope that this single formal paradigm can be extended and improved in order to achieve general intelligence and superintelligence 
 Scruffies  use any number of different algorithms and methods to achieve intelligent behavior  and rely on incremental testing to verify their programs  Scruffy programming requires large amounts of hand coding and knowledge engineering  Scruffy experts have argued that general intelligence can only be implemented by solving a large number of essentially unrelated problems  and that there is no silver bullet that will allow programs to develop general intelligence autonomously  
John Brockman compares the neat approach to physics  in that it uses simple mathematical models as its foundation  The scruffy approach is more biological  in that much of the work involves studying and categorizing diverse phenomena      a     
Modern AI has elements of both scruffy and neat approaches  Scruffy AI researchers in the     s applied mathematical rigor to their programs  as neat experts did                        They also express the hope that there is a single paradigm  a  master algorithm   that will cause general intelligence and superintelligence to emerge             But modern AI also resembles the scruffies             modern machine learning applications require a great deal of hand tuning and incremental testing  while the general algorithm is mathematically rigorous  accomplishing the specific goals of a particular application is not  Also  in the early     s  the field of software development embraced extreme programming  which is a modern version of the scruffy methodology  try things and test them  without wasting time looking for more elegant or general solutions 


Origin in the     s edit 
The distinction between neat and scruffy originated in the mid     s  by Roger Schank  Schank used the terms to characterize the difference between his work on natural language processing  which represented commonsense knowledge in the form of large amorphous semantic networks  from the work of John McCarthy  Allen Newell  Herbert A  Simon  Robert Kowalski and others whose work was based on logic and formal extensions of logic             Schank described himself as an AI scruffy  He made this distinction in linguistics  arguing strongly against Chomsky s view of language      a     
The distinction was also partly geographical and cultural   scruffy  attributes were exemplified by AI research at MIT under Marvin Minsky in the     s  The laboratory was famously  freewheeling  and researchers often developed AI programs by spending long hours fine tuning programs until they showed the required behavior   Important and influential  scruffy  programs developed at MIT included Joseph Weizenbaum s ELIZA  which behaved as if it spoke English  without any formal knowledge at all  and Terry Winograd s     b      SHRDLU  which could successfully answer queries and carry out actions in a simplified world consisting of blocks and a robot arm                          SHRDLU  while successful  could not be scaled up into a useful natural language processing system  because it lacked a structured design  Maintaining a larger version of the program proved to be impossible  i e  it was too scruffy to be extended 
Other AI laboratories  of which the largest were Stanford  Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Edinburgh  focused on logic and formal problem solving as a basis for AI  These institutions supported the work of John McCarthy  Herbert Simon  Allen Newell  Donald Michie  Robert Kowalski  and other  neats  
The contrast between MIT s approach and other laboratories was also described as a  procedural declarative distinction   Programs like SHRDLU were designed as agents that carried out actions  They executed  procedures   Other programs were designed as inference engines that manipulated formal statements  or  declarations   about the world and translated these manipulations into actions  
In his      presidential address to Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence  Nils Nilsson discussed the issue  arguing that  the field needed both   He wrote  much of the knowledge we want our programs to have can and should be represented declaratively in some kind of declarative  logic like formalism  Ad hoc structures have their place  but most of these come from the domain itself   Alex P  Pentland and Martin Fischler of SRI International concurred about the anticipated role of deduction and logic like formalisms in future AI research  but not to the extent that Nilsson described             

Scruffy projects in the     s edit 
The scruffy approach was applied to robotics by Rodney Brooks in the mid     s  He advocated building robots that were  as he put it  Fast  Cheap and Out of Control  the title of a      paper co authored with Anita Flynn  Unlike earlier robots such as Shakey or the Stanford cart  they did not build up representations of the world by analyzing visual information with algorithms drawn from mathematical machine learning techniques  and they did not plan their actions using formalizations based on logic  such as the  Planner  language  They simply reacted to their sensors in a way that tended to help them survive and move             
Douglas Lenat s Cyc project was initiated in          broken anchor      one of earliest and most ambitious projects to capture all of human knowledge in machine readable form  is  a determinedly scruffy enterprise               The Cyc database contains millions of facts about all the complexities of the world  each of which must be entered one at a time  by knowledge engineers  Each of these entries is an ad hoc addition to the intelligence of the system  While there may be a  neat  solution to the problem of commonsense knowledge  such as machine learning algorithms with natural language processing that could study the text available over the internet   no such project has yet been successful 

The Society of Mind edit 
Main article  Society of Mind
In      Marvin Minsky published The Society of Mind which advocated a view of intelligence and the mind as an interacting community of modules or agents that each handled different aspects of cognition  where some modules were specialized for very specific tasks  e g  edge detection in the visual cortex  and other modules were specialized to manage communication and prioritization  e g  planning and attention in the frontal lobes   Minsky presented this paradigm as a model of both biological human intelligence and as a blueprint for future work in AI  
This paradigm is explicitly  scruffy  in that it does not expect there to be a single algorithm that can be applied to all of the tasks involved in intelligent behavior              Minsky wrote  

What magical trick makes us intelligent  The trick is that there is no trick  The power of intelligence stems from our vast diversity  not from any single  perfect principle             
As of       Minsky was still publishing papers evaluating the relative advantages of the neat versus scruffy approaches  e g   Logical Versus Analogical or Symbolic Versus Connectionist or Neat Versus
Scruffy              

Modern AI as both neat and scruffy edit 
New statistical and mathematical approaches to AI were developed in the     s  using highly developed formalisms such as mathematical optimization and neural networks  Pamela McCorduck wrote that  As I write  AI enjoys a Neat hegemony  people who believe that machine intelligence  at least  is best expressed in logical  even mathematical terms              This general trend towards more formal methods in AI was described as  the victory of the neats  by Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell in                   
However  by       Russell and Norvig had changed their minds              Deep learning networks and machine learning in general require extensive fine tuning    they must be iteratively tested until they begin to show the desired behavior  This is a scruffy methodology

Notes edit 


  a b John Brockman writes  Chomsky has always adopted the physicist s philosophy of science  which is that you have hypotheses you check out  and that you could be wrong  This is absolutely antithetical to the AI philosophy of science  which is much more like the way a biologist looks at the world  The biologist s philosophy of science says that human beings are what they are  you find what you find  you try to understand it  categorize it  name it  and organize it  If you build a model and it doesn t work quite right  you have to fix it  It s much more of a  discovery  view of the world             

  Winograd also became a critic of early approaches to AI as well  arguing that intelligent machines could not be built using formal symbols exclusively  but required embodied cognition
