vte
In social psychology  a stereotype is a generalized belief about a particular category of people             It is an expectation that people might have about every person of a particular group  The type of expectation can vary  it can be  for example  an expectation about the group s personality  preferences  appearance or ability  Stereotypes make information processing easier by allowing the perceiver to rely on previously stored knowledge in place of incoming information  Stereotypes are often overgeneralized  inaccurate  and resistant to new information             Although stereotypes generally have negative implications  they aren t necessarily negative  They may be positive  neutral  or negative  They can be broken down into two main categories  explicit stereotypes  which are conscious  and implicit stereotypes  which are subconscious 


Explicit stereotypes edit 
An explicit stereotype is a belief about a group that a person is consciously aware of and knowingly uses to judge others  If person A is making judgments about a particular person B from group G  and person A has an explicit stereotype for group G  their decision bias can be partially mitigated using conscious control  however  attempts to offset bias due to conscious awareness of a stereotype often fail at being truly impartial  due to either underestimating or overestimating the amount of bias being created by the stereotype 

Implicit stereotypes edit 
Main article  Implicit stereotype
Implicit stereotypes are those that lay on individuals  subconsciousness  that they have no control or awareness of              Implicit stereotypes are built based on two concepts  associative networks in semantic  knowledge  memory and automatic activation              Implicit stereotypes are automatic and involuntary associations that people make between a social group and a domain or attribute  For example  a person may believe that both women and men are equally capable of becoming successful electricians  yet still associate the profession more commonly with men             Similarly  a person may believe that both men and women are equally capable of being great teachers  yet still associate the profession more commonly with women 
In social psychology  a stereotype is any thought widely adopted about specific types of individuals or certain ways of behaving intended to represent the entire group of those individuals or behaviors as a whole             These thoughts or beliefs may or may not accurately reflect reality                        Within psychology and across other disciplines  different conceptualizations and theories of stereotyping exist  at times sharing commonalities  as well as containing contradictory elements  Even in the social sciences and some sub disciplines of psychology  stereotypes are occasionally reproduced and can be identified in certain theories  for example  in assumptions about other cultures            

Etymology edit 
The term stereotype comes from the French adjective st r otype and derives from the Greek words          stereos    firm  solid              and        typos    impression               hence  solid impression on one or more ideas theories  
The term was first used in the printing trade in      by Firmin Didot  to describe a printing plate that duplicated any typography  The duplicate printing plate  or the stereotype  is used for printing instead of the original 
Outside of printing  the first reference to stereotype in English was in       as a noun that meant  image perpetuated without change               However  it was not until      that stereotype was first used in the modern psychological sense by American journalist Walter Lippmann in his work Public Opinion             

Relationship with other types of intergroup attitudes edit 
Stereotypes  prejudice  racism  and discrimination             are understood as related but different concepts                                                  Stereotypes are regarded as the most cognitive component and often occurs without conscious awareness  whereas prejudice is the affective component of stereotyping and discrimination is one of the behavioral components of prejudicial reactions                                      In this tripartite view of intergroup attitudes  stereotypes reflect expectations and beliefs about the members of groups perceived as different from one s own  prejudice represents the emotional response  and discrimination refers to actions                         
Although related  the three concepts can exist independently of each other                          According to Daniel Katz and Kenneth Braly  stereotyping leads to racial prejudice when people emotionally react to the name of a group  ascribe characteristics to members of that group  and then evaluate those characteristics             
Possible prejudicial effects of stereotypes            are 

Justification of ill founded prejudices or ignorance
Unwillingness to rethink one s attitudes and behavior
Preventing some people of stereotyped groups from entering or succeeding in activities or fields            
Content edit 
Stereotype content model  adapted from Fiske et al          Four types of stereotypes resulting from combinations of perceived warmth and competence 
Stereotype content refers to the attributes that people think characterize a group  Studies of stereotype content examine what people think of others  rather than the reasons and mechanisms involved in stereotyping             
Early theories of stereotype content proposed by social psychologists such as Gordon Allport assumed that stereotypes of outgroups reflected uniform antipathy                          For instance  Katz and Braly argued in their classic      study that ethnic stereotypes were uniformly negative             
By contrast  a newer model of stereotype content theorizes that stereotypes are frequently ambivalent and vary along two dimensions  warmth and competence  Warmth and competence are respectively predicted by lack of competition and status  Groups that do not compete with the in group for the same resources  e g   college space  are perceived as warm  whereas high status  e g   economically or educationally successful  groups are considered competent  The groups within each of the four combinations of high and low levels of warmth and competence elicit distinct emotions              The model explains the phenomenon that some out groups are admired but disliked  whereas others are liked but disrespected  This model was empirically tested on a variety of national and international samples and was found to reliably predict stereotype content                         
An even more recent model of stereotype content called the agency beliefs communion  ABC  model suggested that methods to study warmth and competence in the stereotype content model  SCM  were missing a crucial element  that being  stereotypes of social groups are often spontaneously generated              Experiments on the SCM usually ask participants to rate traits according to warmth and competence but this does not allow participants to use any other stereotype dimensions              The ABC model  proposed by Koch and colleagues in      is an estimate of how people spontaneously stereotype U S social groups of people using traits  Koch et al  conducted several studies asking participants to list groups and sort them according to their similarity              Using statistical techniques  they revealed three dimensions that explained the similarity ratings  These three dimensions were agency  A   beliefs  B   and communion  C   Agency is associated with reaching goals  standing out and socio economic status and is related to competence in the SCM  with some examples of traits including poor and wealthy  powerful and powerless  low status and high status  Beliefs is associated with views on the world  morals and conservative progressive beliefs with some examples of traits including traditional and modern  religious and science oriented or conventional and alternative  Finally  communion is associated with connecting with others and fitting in and is similar to warmth from the SCM  with some examples of traits including trustworthy and untrustworthy  cold and warm and repellent and likeable              According to research using this model  there is a curvilinear relationship between agency and communion              For example  if a group is high or low in the agency dimension then they may be seen as un communal  whereas groups that are average in agency are seen as more communal              This model has many implications in predicting behaviour towards stereotyped groups  For example  Koch and colleagues recently proposed that perceived similarity in agency and beliefs increases inter group cooperation             

Functions edit 
Early studies proposed that only rigid  repressed  and authoritarian individuals relied on stereotypes  However  contemporary research has refuted this  showing that stereotypes are widespread and better understood as shared group beliefs held in common by members of the same social group              Modern research asserts that full understanding of stereotypes requires considering them from two complementary perspectives  as shared within a particular culture subculture and as formed in the mind of an individual person             

Relationship between cognitive and social functions edit 
Stereotyping can serve cognitive functions on an interpersonal level  and social functions on an intergroup level                         For stereotyping to function on an intergroup level  see social identity approaches  social identity theory and self categorization theory   an individual must see themselves as part of a group and being part of that group must also be salient for the individual             
Craig McGarty  Russell Spears  and Vincent Y  Yzerbyt        argued that the cognitive functions of stereotyping are best understood in relation to its social functions  and vice versa             

Cognitive functions edit 
Stereotypes can help make sense of the world  They are a form of categorization that helps to simplify and systematize information  Thus  information is more easily identified  recalled  predicted  and reacted to              Stereotypes are categories of objects or people  Between stereotypes  objects or people are as different from each other as possible             Within stereotypes  objects or people are as similar to each other as possible            
Gordon Allport has suggested possible answers to why people find it easier to understand categorized information              First  people can consult a category to identify response patterns  Second  categorized information is more specific than non categorized information  as categorization accentuates properties that are shared by all members of a group  Third  people can readily describe objects in a category because objects in the same category have distinct characteristics  Finally  people can take for granted the characteristics of a particular category because the category itself may be an arbitrary grouping 
A complementary perspective theorizes how stereotypes function as time  and energy savers that allow people to act more efficiently             Yet another perspective suggests that stereotypes are people s biased perceptions of their social contexts             In this view  people use stereotypes as shortcuts to make sense of their social contexts  and this makes a person s task of understanding his or her world less cognitively demanding            

Social functions edit 
Social categorization edit 
In the following situations  the overarching purpose of stereotyping is for people to put their collective self  their in group membership  in a positive light             

when stereotypes are used for explaining social events
when stereotypes are used for justifying activities of one s own group  ingroup  to another group  outgroup 
when stereotypes are used for differentiating the ingroup as positively distinct from outgroups
Explanation purposes edit 
An antisemitic      caricature depicting the stereotypical physical features of a Jewish male
As mentioned previously  stereotypes can be used to explain social events                          Henri Tajfel             described his observations of how some people found that the antisemitic fabricated contents of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion only made sense if Jews have certain characteristics  Therefore  according to Tajfel              Jews were stereotyped as being evil and yearning for world domination to match the antisemitic  facts  as presented in The Protocols of the Elders of Zion 

Justification purposes edit 
People create stereotypes of an outgroup to justify the actions that their in group has committed  or plans to commit  towards that outgroup                                      For example  according to Tajfel              Europeans stereotyped African  Indian  and Chinese people as being incapable of achieving financial advances without European help  This stereotype was used to justify European colonialism in Africa  India  and China 

Intergroup differentiation edit 
An assumption is that people want their ingroup to have a positive image relative to outgroups  and so people want to differentiate their ingroup from relevant outgroups in a desirable way              If an outgroup does not affect the ingroup s image  then from an image preservation point of view  there is no point for the ingroup to be positively distinct from that outgroup             
People can actively create certain images for relevant outgroups by stereotyping  People do so when they see that their ingroup is no longer as clearly and or as positively differentiated from relevant outgroups  and they want to restore the intergroup differentiation to a state that favours the ingroup                         

Self categorization edit 
Stereotypes can emphasize a person s group membership in two steps  Stereotypes emphasize the person s similarities with ingroup members on relevant dimensions  and also the person s differences from outgroup members on relevant dimensions              People change the stereotype of their ingroups and outgroups to suit context              Once an outgroup treats an ingroup member badly  they are more drawn to the members of their own group              This can be seen as members within a group are able to relate to each other through a stereotype because of identical situations  A person can embrace a stereotype to avoid humiliation such as failing a task and blaming it on a stereotype             

Social influence and consensus edit 
Stereotypes are an indicator of ingroup consensus              When there are intragroup disagreements over stereotypes of the ingroup and or outgroups  ingroup members take collective action to prevent other ingroup members from diverging from each other             
John C  Turner proposed in                  that if ingroup members disagree on an outgroup stereotype  then one of three possible collective actions follow  First  ingroup members may negotiate with each other and conclude that they have different outgroup stereotypes because they are stereotyping different subgroups of an outgroup  e g   Russian gymnasts versus Russian boxers   Second  ingroup members may negotiate with each other  but conclude that they are disagreeing because of categorical differences amongst themselves  Accordingly  in this context  it is better to categorise ingroup members under different categories  e g   Democrats versus Republican  than under a shared category  e g   American   Finally  ingroup members may influence each other to arrive at a common outgroup stereotype 

Formation edit 
Different disciplines give different accounts of how stereotypes develop  Psychologists may focus on an individual s experience with groups  patterns of communication about those groups  and intergroup conflict  As for sociologists  they may focus on the relations among different groups in a social structure  They suggest that stereotypes are the result of conflict  poor parenting  and inadequate mental and emotional development  Once stereotypes have formed  there are two main factors that explain their persistence  First  the cognitive effects of schematic processing  see schema  make it so that when a member of a group behaves as expected  the behavior confirms and even strengthens existing stereotypes  Second  the affective or emotional aspects of prejudice render logical arguments against stereotypes ineffective in countering the power of emotional responses             

Correspondence bias edit 
Main article  Correspondence bias
Correspondence bias refers to the tendency to ascribe a person s behavior to disposition or personality  and to underestimate the extent to which situational factors elicited the behavior  Correspondence bias can play an important role in stereotype formation             
For example  in a study by Roguer and Yzerbyt        participants watched a video showing students who were randomly instructed to find arguments either for or against euthanasia  The students that argued in favor of euthanasia came from the same law department or from different departments  Results showed that participants attributed the students  responses to their attitudes although it had been made clear in the video that students had no choice about their position  Participants reported that group membership  i e   the department that the students belonged to  affected the students  opinions about euthanasia  Law students were perceived to be more in favor of euthanasia than students from different departments despite the fact that a pretest had revealed that subjects had no preexisting expectations about attitudes toward euthanasia and the department that students belong to  The attribution error created the new stereotype that law students are more likely to support euthanasia             
Nier et al         found that people who tend to draw dispositional inferences from behavior and ignore situational constraints are more likely to stereotype low status groups as incompetent and high status groups as competent  Participants listened to descriptions of two fictitious groups of Pacific Islanders  one of which was described as being higher in status than the other  In a second study  subjects rated actual groups        the poor and wealthy  women and men   in the United States in terms of their competence  Subjects who scored high on the measure of correspondence bias stereotyped the poor  women  and the fictitious lower status Pacific Islanders as incompetent whereas they stereotyped the wealthy  men  and the high status Pacific Islanders as competent  The correspondence bias was a significant predictor of stereotyping even after controlling for other measures that have been linked to beliefs about low status groups  the just world fallacy and social dominance orientation             
Based on the anti public sector bias              D ring and Willems                    found that employees in the public sector are considered as less professional compared to employees in the private sector  They build on the assumption that the red tape and bureaucratic nature of the public sector spills over in the perception that citizens have about the employees working in the sector  With an experimental vignette study  they analyze how citizens process information on employees  sector affiliation  and integrate non work role referencing to test the stereotype confirmation assumption underlying the representativeness heuristic  The results show that sector as well as non work role referencing influences perceived employee professionalism but has little effect on the confirmation of particular public sector stereotypes              Moreover  the results do not confirm a congruity effect of consistent stereotypical information  non work role referencing does not aggravate the negative effect of sector affiliation on perceived employee professionalism 

Illusory correlation edit 
Main article  Illusory correlation
Research shows that stereotypes can develop based on a cognitive mechanism known as illusory correlation        an erroneous inference about the relationship between two events                                     If two statistically infrequent events co occur  observers overestimate the frequency of co occurrence of these events  The underlying reason is that rare  infrequent events are distinctive and salient and  when paired  become even more so  The heightened salience results in more attention and more effective encoding  which strengthens the belief that the events are correlated                                     
In the inter group context  illusory correlations lead people to misattribute rare behaviors or traits at higher rates to minority group members than to majority groups  even when both display the same proportion of the behaviors or traits  Black people  for instance  are a minority group in the United States and interaction with blacks is a relatively infrequent event for an average white American              Similarly  undesirable behavior  e g  crime  is statistically less frequent than desirable behavior  Since both events  blackness  and  undesirable behavior  are distinctive in the sense that they are infrequent  the combination of the two leads observers to overestimate the rate of co occurrence              Similarly  in workplaces where women are underrepresented and negative behaviors such as errors occur less frequently than positive behaviors  women become more strongly associated with mistakes than men             
In a landmark study  David Hamilton and Richard Gifford        examined the role of illusory correlation in stereotype formation  Subjects were instructed to read descriptions of behaviors performed by members of groups A and B  Negative behaviors outnumbered positive actions and group B was smaller than group A  making negative behaviors and membership in group B relatively infrequent and distinctive  Participants were then asked who had performed a set of actions  a person of group A or group B  Results showed that subjects overestimated the frequency with which both distinctive events  membership in group B and negative behavior  co occurred  and evaluated group B more negatively  This despite the fact the proportion of positive to negative behaviors was equivalent for both groups and that there was no actual correlation between group membership and behaviors              Although Hamilton and Gifford found a similar effect for positive behaviors as the infrequent events  a meta analytic review of studies showed that illusory correlation effects are stronger when the infrequent  distinctive information is negative             
Hamilton and Gifford s distinctiveness based explanation of stereotype formation was subsequently extended              A      study by McConnell  Sherman  and Hamilton found that people formed stereotypes based on information that was not distinctive at the time of presentation  but was considered distinctive at the time of judgement              Once a person judges non distinctive information in memory to be distinctive  that information is re encoded and re represented as if it had been distinctive when it was first processed             

Common environment edit 
One explanation for why stereotypes are shared is that they are the result of a common environment that stimulates people to react in the same way            
The problem with the  common environment  is that explanation in general is that it does not explain how shared stereotypes can occur without direct stimuli             Research since the     s suggested that people are highly similar with each other in how they describe different racial and national groups  although those people have no personal experience with the groups they are describing             

Socialization and upbringing edit 
Another explanation says that people are socialised to adopt the same stereotypes             Some psychologists believe that although stereotypes can be absorbed at any age  stereotypes are usually acquired in early childhood under the influence of parents  teachers  peers  and the media 
If stereotypes are defined by social values  then stereotypes only change as per changes in social values             The suggestion that stereotype content depends on social values reflects Walter Lippman s argument in his      publication that stereotypes are rigid because they cannot be changed at will             

An example of a minstrel show              which depicted extreme exaggerations of stereotypical features of African Americans for the purpose of entertainment and comedy 
Studies emerging since the     s refuted the suggestion that stereotype contents cannot be changed at will  Those studies suggested that one group s stereotype of another group would become more or less positive depending on whether their intergroup relationship had improved or degraded                                      Intergroup events  e g   World War II  Persian Gulf conflicts  often changed intergroup relationships  For example  after WWII  Black American students held a more negative stereotype of people from countries that were the United States s WWII enemies              If there are no changes to an intergroup relationship  then relevant stereotypes do not change             

Intergroup relations edit 
According to a third explanation  shared stereotypes are neither caused by the coincidence of common stimuli  nor by socialization  This explanation posits that stereotypes are shared because group members are motivated to behave in certain ways  and stereotypes reflect those behaviors             It is important to note from this explanation that stereotypes are the consequence  not the cause  of intergroup relations  This explanation assumes that when it is important for people to acknowledge both their ingroup and outgroup  they will emphasise their difference from outgroup members  and their similarity to ingroup members             International migration creates more opportunities for intergroup relations  but the interactions do not always disconfirm stereotypes  They are also known to form and maintain them

People are not the only ones who can hold stereotypical beliefs  Artificial Intelligence programs have also been show to at times hold bias or at least present themselves to hold biases when it comes to some of its generation of images  text  and voices  A      study done testing how AI text generators respond when asked about African Americans  What was found was that when asked directly  the program would respond with positivity  but when asked in a more roundabout way about people who speak African American English  results reminiscent of what could be heard back during the Jim Crow era would be received              It s not just race that receives stereotypical results from AI programs  Gender stereotypes can also be found  especially in image generation  Women will often be sexualized by the AI  without prompting  being put in skimpy clothes  given larger chests  and being generated in suggestive positions to give examples  The opposite can often be said for men  as typically if they are not generated to be big and strong  they are visualized to be assertive and associated with careers and dominance             

Activation edit 
The dual process model of cognitive processing of stereotypes asserts that automatic activation of stereotypes is followed by a controlled processing stage  during which an individual may choose to disregard or ignore the stereotyped information that has been brought to mind             
A number of studies have found that stereotypes are activated automatically  Patricia Devine         for example  suggested that stereotypes are automatically activated in the presence of a member  or some symbolic equivalent  of a stereotyped group and that the unintentional activation of the stereotype is equally strong for high  and low prejudice persons  Words related to the cultural stereotype of blacks were presented subliminally  During an ostensibly unrelated impression formation task  subjects read a paragraph describing a race unspecified target person s behaviors and rated the target person on several trait scales  Results showed that participants who received a high proportion of racial words rated the target person in the story as significantly more hostile than participants who were presented with a lower proportion of words related to the stereotype  This effect held true for both high  and low prejudice subjects  as measured by the Modern Racism Scale   Thus  the racial stereotype was activated even for low prejudice individuals who did not personally endorse it                                      Studies using alternative priming methods have shown that the activation of gender and age stereotypes can also be automatic                         
Subsequent research suggested that the relation between category activation and stereotype activation was more complex                          Lepore and Brown         for instance  noted that the words used in Devine s study were both neutral category labels  e g    Blacks   and stereotypic attributes  e g    lazy    They argued that if only the neutral category labels were presented  people high and low in prejudice would respond differently  In a design similar to Devine s  Lepore and Brown primed the category of African Americans using labels such as  blacks  and  West Indians  and then assessed the differential activation of the associated stereotype in the subsequent impression formation task  They found that high prejudice participants increased their ratings of the target person on the negative stereotypic dimensions and decreased them on the positive dimension whereas low prejudice subjects tended in the opposite direction  The results suggest that the level of prejudice and stereotype endorsement affects people s judgements when the category        and not the stereotype per se   is primed             
Research has shown that people can be trained to activate counterstereotypic information and thereby reduce the automatic activation of negative stereotypes  In a study by Kawakami et al          for example  participants were presented with a category label and taught to respond  No  to stereotypic traits and  Yes  to nonstereotypic traits  After this training period  subjects showed reduced stereotype activation                          This effect is based on the learning of new and more positive stereotypes rather than the negation of already existing ones             

Automatic behavioral outcomes edit 
Empirical evidence suggests that stereotype activation can automatically influence social behavior                                                  For example  Bargh  Chen  and Burrows        activated the stereotype of the elderly among half of their participants by administering a scrambled sentence test where participants saw words related to age stereotypes  Subjects primed with the stereotype walked significantly more slowly than the control group  although the test did not include any words specifically referring to slowness   thus acting in a way that the stereotype suggests that elderly people will act  And the stereotype of the elder will affect the subjective perception of them through depression              In another experiment  Bargh  Chen  and Burrows also found that because the stereotype about blacks includes the notion of aggression  subliminal exposure to black faces increased the likelihood that randomly selected white college students reacted with more aggression and hostility than participants who subconsciously viewed a white face              Similarly  Correll et al         showed that activated stereotypes about blacks can influence people s behavior  In a series of experiments  black and white participants played a video game  in which a black or white person was shown holding a gun or a harmless object  e g   a mobile phone   Participants had to decide as quickly as possible whether to shoot the target  When the target person was armed  both black and white participants were faster in deciding to shoot the target when he was black than when he was white  When the target was unarmed  the participants avoided shooting him more quickly when he was white  Time pressure made the shooter bias even more pronounced             

Accuracy edit 
A magazine feature from Beauty Parade from March      stereotyping women drivers  It features Bettie Page as the model 
Stereotypes can be efficient shortcuts and sense making tools  They can  however  keep people from processing new or unexpected information about each individual  thus biasing the impression formation process             Early researchers believed that stereotypes were inaccurate representations of reality              A series of pioneering studies in the     s found no empirical support for widely held racial stereotypes              By the mid     s  Gordon Allport wrote that   It is possible for a stereotype to grow in defiance of all evidence              
Research on the role of illusory correlations in the formation of stereotypes suggests that stereotypes can develop because of incorrect inferences about the relationship between two events  e g   membership in a social group and bad or good attributes   This means that at least some stereotypes are inaccurate                                                 
A      book by Yueh Ting Lee et al  argued that stereotypes are sometimes accurate              Similarly  a      study by Jussim et al  reviewed four studies of racial stereotypes  and seven studies of gender stereotypes regarding demographic characteristics  academic achievement  personality and behavior  and argued that some aspects of ethnic and gender stereotypes are accurate while stereotypes concerning political affiliation and nationality are much less accurate             
A      study by Terracciano et al  found that stereotypic beliefs about nationality do not reflect the actual personality traits of people from different cultures             
In a      paper  Marlene MacKie argued that while stereotypes are inaccurate  this is a definition rather than empirical claim   stereotypes were simply defined as inaccurate  even though the supposed inaccuracy of stereotypes was treated as though it was an empirical discovery             

Effects edit 
Attributional ambiguity edit 
Main article  Attributional ambiguity
Attributive ambiguity refers to the uncertainty that members of stereotyped groups experience in interpreting the causes of others  behavior toward them  Stereotyped individuals who receive negative feedback can attribute it either to personal shortcomings  such as lack of ability or poor effort  or the evaluator s stereotypes and prejudice toward their social group  Alternatively  positive feedback can either be attributed to personal merit or discounted as a form of sympathy or pity                                     
Crocker et al         showed that when black participants were evaluated by a white person who was aware of their race  black subjects mistrusted the feedback  attributing negative feedback to the evaluator s stereotypes and positive feedback to the evaluator s desire to appear unbiased  When the black participants  race was unknown to the evaluator  they were more accepting of the feedback             
Attributional ambiguity has been shown to affect a person s self esteem  When they receive positive evaluations  stereotyped individuals are uncertain of whether they really deserved their success and  consequently  they find it difficult to take credit for their achievements  In the case of negative feedback  ambiguity has been shown to have a protective effect on self esteem as it allows people to assign blame to external causes  Some studies  however  have found that this effect only holds when stereotyped individuals can be absolutely certain that their negative outcomes are due to the evaluators s prejudice  If any room for uncertainty remains  stereotyped individuals tend to blame themselves             
Attributional ambiguity can also make it difficult to assess one s skills because performance related evaluations are mistrusted or discounted  Moreover  it can lead to the belief that one s efforts are not directly linked to the outcomes  thereby depressing one s motivation to succeed             

Stereotype threat edit 
Main article  Stereotype threat
The effect of stereotype threat  ST  on math test scores for girls and boys  Data from Osborne                    
Stereotype threat occurs when people are aware of a negative stereotype about their social group and experience anxiety or concern that they might confirm the stereotype              Stereotype threat has been shown to undermine performance in a variety of domains                         
Claude M  Steele and Joshua Aronson conducted the first experiments showing that stereotype threat can depress intellectual performance on standardized tests  In one study  they found that black college students performed worse than white students on a verbal test when the task was framed as a measure of intelligence  When it was not presented in that manner  the performance gap narrowed  Subsequent experiments showed that framing the test as diagnostic of intellectual ability made black students more aware of negative stereotypes about their group  which in turn impaired their performance              Stereotype threat effects have been demonstrated for an array of social groups in many different arenas  including not only academics but also sports              chess             and business             
Some researchers have suggested that stereotype threat should not be interpreted as a factor in real life performance gaps  and have raised the possibility of publication bias                                      Other critics have focused on correcting what they claim are misconceptions of early studies showing a large effect              However  meta analyses and systematic reviews have shown significant evidence for the effects of stereotype threat  though the phenomenon defies over simplistic characterization                                                                                                     

Self fulfilling prophecy edit 
Main article  Self fulfilling prophecy
Stereotypes lead people to expect certain actions from members of social groups  These stereotype based expectations may lead to self fulfilling prophecies  in which one s inaccurate expectations about a person s behavior  through social interaction  prompt that person to act in stereotype consistent ways  thus confirming one s erroneous expectations and validating the stereotype                                        
Word  Zanna  and Cooper        demonstrated the effects of stereotypes in the context of a job interview  White participants interviewed black and white subjects who  prior to the experiments  had been trained to act in a standardized manner  Analysis of the videotaped interviews showed that black job applicants were treated differently  They received shorter amounts of interview time and less eye contact  interviewers made more speech errors  e g   stutters  sentence incompletions  incoherent sounds  and physically distanced themselves from black applicants  In a second experiment  trained interviewers were instructed to treat applicants  all of whom were white  like the whites or blacks had been treated in the first experiment  As a result  applicants treated like the blacks of the first experiment behaved in a more nervous manner and received more negative performance ratings than interviewees receiving the treatment previously afforded to whites              
A      study by Snyder  Tanke  and Berscheid found a similar pattern in social interactions between men and women  Male undergraduate students were asked to talk to female undergraduates  whom they believed to be physically attractive or unattractive  on the phone  The conversations were taped and analysis showed that men who thought that they were talking to an attractive woman communicated in a more positive and friendlier manner than men who believed that they were talking to unattractive women  This altered the women s behavior  Female subjects who  unknowingly to them  were perceived to be physically attractive behaved in a friendly  likeable  and sociable manner in comparison with subjects who were regarded as unattractive              
A      study by J  Thomas Kellow and Brett D  Jones looked at the effects of self fulfilling prophecy on African American and Caucasian high school freshman students  Both white and black students were informed that their test performance would be predictive of their performance on a statewide  high stakes standardized test  They were also told that historically  white students had outperformed black students on the test  This knowledge created a self fulfilling prophecy in both the white and black students  where the white students scored statistically significantly higher than the African American students on the test  The stereotype threat of underperforming on standardized tests affected the African American students in this study              
In accountancy  there is a popular stereotype which represents members of the profession as being humorless  introspective beancounters                           

Discrimination and prejudice edit 
Because stereotypes simplify and justify social reality  they have potentially powerful effects on how people perceive and treat one another               As a result  stereotypes can lead to discrimination in labor markets and other domains               For example  Tilcsik        has found that employers who seek job applicants with stereotypically male heterosexual traits are particularly likely to engage in discrimination against gay men  suggesting that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is partly rooted in specific stereotypes and that these stereotypes loom large in many labor markets              Agerstr m and Rooth        showed that automatic obesity stereotypes captured by the Implicit Association Test can predict real hiring discrimination against the obese               Similarly  experiments suggest that gender stereotypes play an important role in judgments that affect hiring decisions                           
Stereotypes can cause racist prejudice  For example  scientists and activists have warned that the use of the stereotype  Nigerian Prince  for referring to Advance fee scammers is racist  i e   reducing Nigeria to a nation of scammers and fraudulent princes  as some people still do online  is a stereotype that needs to be called out               

Self stereotyping edit 
Main article  Self stereotyping
Stereotypes can affect self evaluations and lead to self stereotyping                          For instance  Correll              found that specific stereotypes  e g   the stereotype that women have lower mathematical ability  affect women s and men s evaluations of their abilities  e g   in math and science   such that men assess their own task ability higher than women performing at the same level                            Similarly  a study by Sinclair et al         has shown that Asian American women rated their math ability more favorably when their ethnicity and the relevant stereotype that Asian Americans excel in math was made salient  In contrast  they rated their math ability less favorably when their gender and the corresponding stereotype of women s inferior math skills was made salient  Sinclair et al  found  however  that the effect of stereotypes on self evaluations is mediated by the degree to which close people in someone s life endorse these stereotypes  People s self stereotyping can increase or decrease depending on whether close others view them in stereotype consistent or inconsistent manner              
Stereotyping can also play a central role in depression  when people have negative self stereotypes about themselves  According to Cox  Abramson  Devine  and Hollon                     stereotyping can also play a central role in depression  which is characterized by negative self schemas  Stereotypes and self schemas are the same type of cognitive structure  therefore  they suggest that an integrated perspective of prejudice and depression provides useful insight on how stereotypes are acquired  Negative stereotypes are set in motion within the Source  who conveys the prejudice towards the Target  which in turn will lead the Target to suffer from depression  Members of stigmatized groups may internalize the negative evaluation of their group and develop depression  People may also show prejudice internalization through self stereotyping because of negative childhood experiences such as verbal and physical abuse  This depression that is caused by prejudice  i e    deprejudice   can be related to group membership  e g   Me Gay Bad  or not  e g   Me Bad   If someone holds prejudicial beliefs about a stigmatized group and then becomes a member of that group  they may internalize their prejudice and develop depression  People may also show prejudice internalization through self stereotyping because of negative childhood experiences such as verbal and physical abuse              

Substitute for observations edit 
Stereotypes are traditional and familiar symbol clusters  expressing a more or less complex idea in a convenient way  They are often simplistic pronouncements about gender  racial  ethnic  and cultural backgrounds and they can become a source of misinformation and delusion  For example  in a school when students are confronted with the task of writing a theme  they think in terms of literary associations  often using stereotypes picked up from books  films  and magazines that they have read or viewed 
The danger in stereotyping lies not in its existence  but in the fact that it can become a substitute for observation and a misinterpretation of a cultural identity               Promoting information literacy is a pedagogical approach that can effectively combat the entrenchment of stereotypes  The necessity for using information literacy to separate multicultural  fact from fiction  is well illustrated with examples from literature and media              

Role in art and culture edit 
American political cartoon titled The Usual Irish Way of Doing Things  depicting a drunken Irishman lighting a powder keg and swinging a bottle  Published in Harper s Weekly       
Stereotypes are common in various cultural media  where they take the form of dramatic stock characters  The instantly recognizable nature of stereotypes mean that they are effective in advertising and situation comedy               Alexander Fedorov        proposed a concept of media stereotypes analysis  This concept refers to identification and analysis of stereotypical images of people  ideas  events  stories  themes  etc  in media context              
The characters that do appear in movies greatly affect how people worldwide perceive gender relations  race  and cultural communities  Because approximately     of worldwide ticket sales are directed toward Hollywood movies  the American movie industry has been greatly responsible for portraying characters of different cultures and diversity to fit into stereotypical categories               This has led to the spread and persistence of gender  racial  ethnic  and cultural stereotypes seen in the movies     
For example  Russians are usually portrayed as ruthless agents  brutal mobsters and villains in Hollywood movies                                         According to Russian American professor Nina L  Khrushcheva   You can t even turn the TV on and go to the movies without reference to Russians as horrible                The portrayals of Latin Americans in film and print media are restricted to a narrow set of characters  Latin Americans are largely depicted as sexualized figures such as the Latino macho or the Latina vixen  gang members   illegal  immigrants  or entertainers  By comparison  they are rarely portrayed as working professionals  business leaders or politicians              
In Hollywood films  there are several Latin American stereotypes that have historically been used  Some examples are El Bandido  the Halfbreed Harlot  The Male Buffoon  The Female Clown  The Latin Lover  The Dark Lady  The Wise Old Man  and The Poor Peon  Many Hispanic characters in Hollywood films consists of one or more of these basic stereotypes  but it has been rare to view Latin American actors representing characters outside of this stereotypical criteria              
Media stereotypes of women first emerged in the early   th century  Various stereotypic depictions or  types  of women appeared in magazines  including Victorian ideals of femininity  the New Woman  the Gibson Girl  the femme fatale  and the Flapper                  
Stereotypes are also common in video games  with women being portrayed as stereotypes such as the  damsel in distress  or as sexual objects  see Gender representation in video games                Studies show that minorities are portrayed most often in stereotypical roles such as athletes and gangsters               see Race and video games  
In literature and art  stereotypes are clich d or predictable characters or situations  Throughout history  storytellers have drawn from stereotypical characters and situations to immediately connect the audience with new tales              

Role in sports edit 
Female athletes encounter various pressures and stereotypes  which have significant psychological consequences  These stereotypes give rise to challenges in athletes  lives  including diminished self esteem  leading to more profound psychological impacts 
Female athletes have made considerable strides in overcoming obstacles  They have transitioned from being unable to compete competitively due to biological misconceptions to having equal opportunities as male athletes  thanks to Title IX               Today  there is greater societal acceptance of female athletes  However  the intersection of being a female athlete adds additional pressures  Not only are they expected to excel in competition  but they are also required to conform to societal expectations of femininity  Furthermore  female athletes often face scrutiny and criticism regarding their appearance compared to non athletic women 
Young athletes  in particular  confront an intensified amount of pressure  leading some to quit sports because it is no longer enjoyable and the implications of being a young female athlete become overwhelming  They are unfairly labeled as gay or delicate and subjected to derogatory comments such as  like a girl   Additionally  they grapple with body image concerns that can give rise to severe health issues  Even specific sports contribute to the scrutiny female athletes face  with criticism directed at the uniforms required for competition              
The proliferation of stereotypes in women s sports has resulted in a decline in female participation  These social stigmas  including being labeled as gay or delicate  and the expectation to play in a manner deemed  like a girl   have contributed to body image issues  eating disorders  and depression among numerous female athletes 
A      study suggested that sports journalists are sometimes aware of stereotypes  but will downplay their role in perpetuating them  and ignore their prevalence in coverage of college sports
