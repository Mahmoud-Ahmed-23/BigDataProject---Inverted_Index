							Facebook has always been about connecting you to what you love  That means friends and family  but also products  brands and businesses  For years  people have used our apps to buy and sell things from the early days of posting a photo of a bicycle with the caption  for sale   to selling your coffee table on Marketplace and now shopping styles from your favourite brands and influencers on Instagram  It was the people who use our apps who envisioned social commerce  We re helping them make it a reality  
We want to give people a place to experience the joy of shopping versus the chore of buying  And we want to help small businesses adapt and make it easier for people to discover and shop for things they love 
Right now many small businesses are struggling  and with stores closing  more are looking to bring their business online  Our goal is to make shopping seamless and empower anyone from a small business owner to a global brand to use our apps to connect with customers  That s why we re launching Facebook Shops and investing in features across our apps that inspire people to shop and make buying and selling online easier  
Introducing Facebook Shops
Facebook Shops make it easy for businesses to set up a single online store for customers to access on both Facebook and Instagram  Creating a Facebook Shop is free and simple  Businesses can choose the products they want to feature from their catalogue and then customise the look and feel of their shop with a cover image and accent colours that showcase their brand  This means any seller  no matter their size or budget  can bring their business online and connect with customers wherever and whenever it s convenient for them  
People can find Facebook Shops on a business  Facebook Page or Instagram profile  or discover them through stories or ads  From there  you can browse the full collection  save products you re interested in and place an order   either on the business  website or without leaving the app if the business has enabled checkout in the US 
And just like when you re in a physical store and need to ask someone for help  in Facebook Shops you ll be able to message a business through WhatsApp  Messenger or Instagram Direct to ask questions  get support  track deliveries and more  And in the future  you ll be able to view a business  shop and make purchases right within a chat in WhatsApp  Messenger or Instagram Direct  
We re starting to roll out Facebook Shops today  and it will be more widely available in the coming months  You can learn more about how we built Shops with privacy in mind here  
We re also investing in features across our apps like Instagram Shop  live shopping and more that will be integrated with Facebook Shops to help customers discover products they re interested in and make purchasing easier 
Instagram Shop  A New Place to Discover Products and Brands
This summer  starting in the US  we re introducing Instagram Shop  a new way to discover and buy products you love in Instagram Explore  You can get inspired by collections from  shop  browse selections from your favourite brands and creators  filter by categories like beauty and home  and purchase the looks you love all in one place  And later this year  we re adding a new shop tab in the navigation bar  so you can get to Instagram Shop in just one tap  
Live Shopping Features 
People have been using live video on our apps to showcase products for years  from shoe stores announcing new sneakers to beauty influencers trying on different lipsticks  Now  we re making it easier to shop for products in real time  Soon  sellers  brands and creators will be able to tag products from their Facebook Shop or catalogue before going live and those products will be shown at the bottom of the video so people can easily tap to learn more and purchase  We re starting to test this with businesses on Facebook and Instagram  and we ll roll it out more broadly in the coming months  
Connecting Loyalty Programs to Your Facebook Account
We re also testing ways to make it easier to earn rewards with businesses you love by enabling you to connect your loyalty programs  like the points program at your local cafe  to your Facebook account  You ll be able to easily see and keep track of your points and rewards  And we re exploring ways to help small businesses create  manage and surface a loyalty program on Facebook Shops  
Working with Partners
We re also working more closely with partners like Shopify  BigCommerce  WooCommerce  Channel Advisor  CedCommerce  Cafe    Tienda Nube and Feedonomics to give small businesses the support they need  These organisations offer powerful tools to help entrepreneurs start and run their businesses and move online  Now they ll help small businesses build and grow their Facebook Shops and use our other commerce tools 
We hope these tools can relieve some of the pressure small businesses are facing right now and help businesses of all sizes prepare for the future
