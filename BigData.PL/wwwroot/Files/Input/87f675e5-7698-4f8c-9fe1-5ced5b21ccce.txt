Area of research in computer science aiming to understand the emotional state of users
Electronic devices such as robots are increasingly able to mimic human emotion 
Affective computing is the study and development of systems and devices that can recognize  interpret  process  and simulate human affects  It is an interdisciplinary field spanning computer science  psychology  and cognitive science             While some core ideas in the field may be traced as far back as to early philosophical inquiries into emotion             the more modern branch of computer science originated with Rosalind Picard s      paper entitled  Affective Computing             and her      book of the same name            published by MIT Press                        One of the motivations for the research is the ability to give machines emotional intelligence  including to simulate empathy  The machine should interpret the emotional state of humans and adapt its behavior to them  giving an appropriate response to those emotions 


Areas edit 
Detecting and recognizing emotional information edit 
Detecting emotional information usually begins with passive sensors that capture data about the user s physical state or behavior without interpreting the input  The data gathered is analogous to the cues humans use to perceive emotions in others  For example  a video camera might capture facial expressions  body posture  and gestures  while a microphone might capture speech  Other sensors detect emotional cues by directly measuring physiological data  such as skin temperature and galvanic resistance            
Recognizing emotional information requires the extraction of meaningful patterns from the gathered data  This is done using machine learning techniques that process different modalities  such as speech recognition  natural language processing  or facial expression detection   The goal of most of these techniques is to produce labels that would match the labels a human perceiver would give in the same situation   For example  if a person makes a facial expression furrowing their brow  then the computer vision system might be taught to label their face as appearing  confused  or as  concentrating  or  slightly negative   as opposed to positive  which it might say if they were smiling in a happy appearing way    These labels may or may not correspond to what the person is actually feeling 

Emotion in machines edit 
Another area within affective computing is the design of computational devices proposed to exhibit either innate emotional capabilities or that are capable of convincingly simulating emotions  A more practical approach  based on current technological capabilities  is the simulation of emotions in conversational agents in order to enrich and facilitate interactivity between human and machine            
Marvin Minsky  one of the pioneering computer scientists in artificial intelligence  relates emotions to the broader issues of machine intelligence stating in The Emotion Machine that emotion is  not especially different from the processes that we call  thinking               The innovative approach  digital humans  or virtual humans includes an attempt to give these programs  which simulate humans  the emotional dimension as well  including reactions in accordance with the reaction that a real person would react in a certain emotionally stimulating situation as well as facial expressions and gestures             
Emotion in machines often refers to emotion in computational  often AI based  systems  As a result  the terms  emotional AI  and  emotion AI  are being used             

Technologies edit 
In psychology  cognitive science  and in neuroscience  there have been two main approaches for describing how humans perceive and classify emotion  continuous or categorical  The continuous approach tends to use dimensions such as negative vs  positive  calm vs  aroused 
The categorical approach tends to use discrete classes such as happy  sad  angry  fearful  surprise  disgust   Different kinds of machine learning regression and classification models can be used for having machines produce continuous or discrete labels   Sometimes models are also built that allow combinations across the categories  e g  a happy surprised face or a fearful surprised face             
The following sections consider many of the kinds of input data used for the task of emotion recognition 

Emotional speech edit 
Various changes in the autonomic nervous system can indirectly alter a person s speech  and affective technologies can leverage this information to recognize emotion  For example  speech produced in a state of fear  anger  or joy becomes fast  loud  and precisely enunciated  with a higher and wider range in pitch  whereas emotions such as tiredness  boredom  or sadness tend to generate slow  low pitched  and slurred speech              Some emotions have been found to be more easily computationally identified  such as anger             or approval             
Emotional speech processing technologies recognize the user s emotional state using computational analysis of speech features  Vocal parameters and prosodic features such as pitch variables and speech rate can be analyzed through pattern recognition techniques                         
Speech analysis is an effective method of identifying affective state  having an average reported accuracy of    to     in research from      and                               These systems tend to outperform average human accuracy  approximately                  but are less accurate than systems which employ other modalities for emotion detection  such as physiological states or facial expressions              However  since many speech characteristics are independent of semantics or culture  this technique is considered to be a promising route for further research             

Algorithms edit 
The process of speech text affect detection requires the creation of a reliable database  knowledge base  or vector space model              broad enough to fit every need for its application  as well as the selection of a successful classifier which will allow for quick and accurate emotion identification 
As of          update       the most frequently used classifiers were linear discriminant classifiers  LDC   k nearest neighbor  k NN   Gaussian mixture model  GMM   support vector machines  SVM   artificial neural networks  ANN   decision tree algorithms and hidden Markov models  HMMs               Various studies showed that choosing the appropriate classifier can significantly enhance the overall performance of the system              The list below gives a brief description of each algorithm 

LDC   Classification happens based on the value obtained from the linear combination of the feature values  which are usually provided in the form of vector features 
k NN   Classification happens by locating the object in the feature space  and comparing it with the k nearest neighbors  training examples   The majority vote decides on the classification 
GMM   is a probabilistic model used for representing the existence of subpopulations within the overall population  Each sub population is described using the mixture distribution  which allows for classification of observations into the sub populations             
SVM   is a type of  usually binary  linear classifier which decides in which of the two  or more  possible classes  each input may fall into 
ANN   is a mathematical model  inspired by biological neural networks  that can better grasp possible non linearities of the feature space 
Decision tree algorithms   work based on following a decision tree in which leaves represent the classification outcome  and branches represent the conjunction of subsequent features that lead to the classification 
HMMs   a statistical Markov model in which the states and state transitions are not directly available to observation  Instead  the series of outputs dependent on the states are visible  In the case of affect recognition  the outputs represent the sequence of speech feature vectors  which allow the deduction of states  sequences through which the model progressed  The states can consist of various intermediate steps in the expression of an emotion  and each of them has a probability distribution over the possible output vectors  The states  sequences allow us to predict the affective state which we are trying to classify  and this is one of the most commonly used techniques within the area of speech affect detection 
It is proved that having enough acoustic evidence available the emotional state of a person can be classified by a set of majority voting classifiers  The proposed set of classifiers is based on three main classifiers  kNN  C    and SVM RBF Kernel  This set achieves better performance than each basic classifier taken separately  It is compared with two other sets of classifiers  one against all  OAA  multiclass SVM with Hybrid kernels and the set of classifiers which consists of the following two basic classifiers  C    and Neural Network  The proposed variant achieves better performance than the other two sets of classifiers             

Databases edit 
The vast majority of present systems are data dependent  This creates one of the biggest challenges in detecting emotions based on speech  as it implicates choosing an appropriate database used to train the classifier  Most of the currently possessed data was obtained from actors and is thus a representation of archetypal emotions  Those so called acted databases are usually based on the Basic Emotions theory  by Paul Ekman   which assumes the existence of six basic emotions  anger  fear  disgust  surprise  joy  sadness   the others simply being a mix of the former ones              Nevertheless  these still offer high audio quality and balanced classes  although often too few   which contribute to high success rates in recognizing emotions 
However  for real life application  naturalistic data is preferred  A naturalistic database can be produced by observation and analysis of subjects in their natural context  Ultimately  such database should allow the system to recognize emotions based on their context as well as work out the goals and outcomes of the interaction  The nature of this type of data allows for authentic real life implementation  due to the fact it describes states naturally occurring during the human computer interaction  HCI  
Despite the numerous advantages which naturalistic data has over acted data  it is difficult to obtain and usually has low emotional intensity  Moreover  data obtained in a natural context has lower signal quality  due to surroundings noise and distance of the subjects from the microphone  The first attempt to produce such database was the FAU Aibo Emotion Corpus for CEICES  Combining Efforts for Improving Automatic Classification of Emotional User States   which was developed based on a realistic context of children  age        playing with Sony s Aibo robot pet                          Likewise  producing one standard database for all emotional research would provide a method of evaluating and comparing different affect recognition systems 

Speech descriptors edit 
The complexity of the affect recognition process increases with the number of classes  affects  and speech descriptors used within the classifier  It is  therefore  crucial to select only the most relevant features in order to assure the ability of the model to successfully identify emotions  as well as increasing the performance  which is particularly significant to real time detection  The range of possible choices is vast  with some studies mentioning the use of over     distinct features              It is crucial to identify those that are redundant and undesirable in order to optimize the system and increase the success rate of correct emotion detection  The most common speech characteristics are categorized into the following groups                         

Frequency characteristics            
Accent shape   affected by the rate of change of the fundamental frequency 
Average pitch   description of how high low the speaker speaks relative to the normal speech 
Contour slope   describes the tendency of the frequency change over time  it can be rising  falling or level 
Final lowering   the amount by which the frequency falls at the end of an utterance 
Pitch range   measures the spread between the maximum and minimum frequency of an utterance 
Time related features 
Speech rate   describes the rate of words or syllables uttered over a unit of time
Stress frequency   measures the rate of occurrences of pitch accented utterances
Voice quality parameters and energy descriptors 
Breathiness   measures the aspiration noise in speech
Brilliance   describes the dominance of high or low frequencies In the speech
Loudness   measures the amplitude of the speech waveform  translates to the energy of an utterance
Pause Discontinuity   describes the transitions between sound and silence
Pitch Discontinuity   describes the transitions of the fundamental frequency 
Facial affect detection edit 
The detection and processing of facial expression are achieved through various methods such as optical flow  hidden Markov models  neural network processing or active appearance models  More than one modality can be combined or fused  multimodal recognition  e g  facial expressions and speech prosody              facial expressions and hand gestures              or facial expressions with speech and text for multimodal data and metadata analysis  to provide a more robust estimation of the subject s emotional state  

Facial expression databases edit 
Main article  Facial expression databases
Creation of an emotion database is a difficult and time consuming task  However  database creation is an essential step in the creation of a system that will recognize human emotions  Most of the publicly available emotion databases include posed facial expressions only  In posed expression databases  the participants are asked to display different basic emotional expressions  while in spontaneous expression database  the expressions are natural  Spontaneous emotion elicitation requires significant effort in the selection of proper stimuli which can lead to a rich display of intended emotions  Secondly  the process involves tagging of emotions by trained individuals manually which makes the databases highly reliable  Since perception of expressions and their intensity is subjective in nature  the annotation by experts is essential for the purpose of validation 
Researchers work with three types of databases  such as a database of peak expression images only  a database of image sequences portraying an emotion from neutral to its peak  and video clips with emotional annotations  Many facial expression databases have been created and made public for expression recognition purpose  Two of the widely used databases are CK  and JAFFE 

Emotion classification edit 
Main article  Emotion classification
By doing cross cultural research in Papua  New Guinea  on the Fore Tribesmen  at the end of the     s  Paul Ekman proposed the idea that facial expressions of emotion are not culturally determined  but universal  Thus  he suggested that they are biological in origin and can  therefore  be safely and correctly categorized             
He therefore officially put forth six basic emotions  in                  

Anger
Disgust
Fear
Happiness
Sadness
Surprise
However  in the     s Ekman expanded his list of basic emotions  including a range of positive and negative emotions not all of which are encoded in facial muscles              The newly included emotions are 

Amusement
Contempt
Contentment
Embarrassment
Excitement
Guilt
 Pride in achievement
Relief
Satisfaction
Sensory pleasure
Shame
Facial Action Coding System edit 
Main article  Facial Action Coding System
A system has been conceived by psychologists in order to formally categorize the physical expression of emotions on faces  The central concept of the Facial Action Coding System  or FACS  as created by Paul Ekman and Wallace V  Friesen in      based on earlier work by Carl Herman Hjortsj              are action units  AU  
They are  basically  a contraction or a relaxation of one or more muscles  Psychologists have proposed the following classification of six basic emotions  according to their action units      here mean  and   




Emotion
Action units


Happiness
    


Sadness
      


Surprise
     B   


Fear
             


Anger
        


Disgust

Challenges in facial detection edit 
As with every computational practice  in affect detection by facial processing  some obstacles need to be surpassed  in order to fully unlock the hidden potential of the overall algorithm or method employed  In the early days of almost every kind of AI based detection  speech recognition  face recognition  affect recognition   the accuracy of modeling and tracking has been an issue  As hardware evolves  as more data are collected and as new discoveries are made and new practices introduced  this lack of accuracy fades  leaving behind noise issues  However  methods for noise removal exist including neighborhood averaging  linear Gaussian smoothing  median filtering              or newer methods such as the Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algorithm                         
Other challenges include

The fact that posed expressions  as used by most subjects of the various studies  are not natural  and therefore algorithms trained on these may not apply to natural expressions 
The lack of rotational movement freedom  Affect detection works very well with frontal use  but upon rotating the head more than    degrees   there ve been problems              
Facial expressions do not always correspond to an underlying emotion that matches them  e g  they can be posed or faked  or a person can feel emotions but maintain a  poker face   
FACS did not include dynamics  while dynamics can help disambiguate  e g  smiles of genuine happiness tend to have different dynamics than  try to look happy  smiles  
The FACS combinations do not correspond in a     way with the emotions that the psychologists originally proposed   note that this lack of a     mapping also occurs in speech recognition with homophones and homonyms and many other sources of ambiguity  and may be mitigated by bringing in other channels of information  
Accuracy of recognition is improved by adding context  however  adding context and other modalities increases computational cost and complexity
Body gesture edit 
Main article  Gesture recognition
Gestures could be efficiently used as a means of detecting a particular emotional state of the user  especially when used in conjunction with speech and face recognition  Depending on the specific action  gestures could be simple reflexive responses  like lifting your shoulders when you don t know the answer to a question  or they could be complex and meaningful as when communicating with sign language  Without making use of any object or surrounding environment  we can wave our hands  clap or beckon  On the other hand  when using objects  we can point at them  move  touch or handle these  A computer should be able to recognize these  analyze the context and respond in a meaningful way  in order to be efficiently used for Human Computer Interaction 
There are many proposed methods             to detect the body gesture  Some literature differentiates   different approaches in gesture recognition  a  D model based and an appearance based              The foremost method makes use of  D information of key elements of the body parts in order to obtain several important parameters  like palm position or joint angles  On the other hand  appearance based systems use images or videos to for direct interpretation  Hand gestures have been a common focus of body gesture detection methods             

Physiological monitoring edit 
This could be used to detect a user s affective state by monitoring and analyzing their physiological signs  These signs range from changes in heart rate and skin conductance to minute contractions of the facial muscles and changes in facial blood flow  This area is gaining momentum and we are now seeing real products that implement the techniques  The four main physiological signs that are usually analyzed are blood volume pulse  galvanic skin response  facial electromyography  and facial color patterns 

Blood volume pulse edit 
Overview edit 
A subject s blood volume pulse  BVP  can be measured by a process called photoplethysmography  which produces a graph indicating blood flow through the extremities              The peaks of the waves indicate a cardiac cycle where the heart has pumped blood to the extremities  If the subject experiences fear or is startled  their heart usually  jumps  and beats quickly for some time  causing the amplitude of the cardiac cycle to increase  This can clearly be seen on a photoplethysmograph when the distance between the trough and the peak of the wave has decreased  As the subject calms down  and as the body s inner core expands  allowing more blood to flow back to the extremities  the cycle will return to normal 

Methodology edit 
Infra red light is shone on the skin by special sensor hardware  and the amount of light reflected is measured  The amount of reflected and transmitted light correlates to the BVP as light is absorbed by hemoglobin which is found richly in the bloodstream 

Disadvantages edit 
It can be cumbersome to ensure that the sensor shining an infra red light and monitoring the reflected light is always pointing at the same extremity  especially seeing as subjects often stretch and readjust their position while using a computer 
There are other factors that can affect one s blood volume pulse  As it is a measure of blood flow through the extremities  if the subject feels hot  or particularly cold  then their body may allow more  or less  blood to flow to the extremities  all of this regardless of the subject s emotional state 

 The corrugator supercilii muscle and zygomaticus major muscle are the   main muscles used for measuring the electrical activity  in facial electromyography 
Facial electromyography edit 
Main article  Facial electromyography
Facial electromyography is a technique used to measure the electrical activity of the facial muscles by amplifying the tiny electrical impulses that are generated by muscle fibers when they contract             
The face expresses a great deal of emotion  however  there are two main facial muscle groups that are usually studied to detect emotion 
The corrugator supercilii muscle  also known as the  frowning  muscle  draws the brow down into a frown  and therefore is the best test for negative  unpleasant emotional response  The zygomaticus major muscle is responsible for pulling the corners of the mouth back when you smile  and therefore is the muscle used to test for a positive emotional response 

Here we can see a plot of skin resistance measured using GSR and time whilst the subject played a video game  There are several peaks that are clear in the graph  which suggests that GSR is a good method of differentiating between an aroused and a non aroused state  For example  at the start of the game where there is usually not much exciting game play  there is a high level of resistance recorded  which suggests a low level of conductivity and therefore less arousal  This is in clear contrast with the sudden trough where the player is killed as one is usually very stressed and tense as their character is killed in the game 
Galvanic skin response edit 
Main article  Galvanic skin response
Galvanic skin response  GSR  is an outdated term for a more general phenomenon known as Electrodermal activity or EDA   EDA is a general phenomena whereby the skin s electrical properties change   The skin is innervated by the  sympathetic nervous system   so measuring its resistance or conductance provides a way to quantify small changes in the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system   As the sweat glands are activated  even before the skin feels sweaty  the level of the EDA can be captured  usually using conductance  and used to discern small changes in autonomic arousal   The more aroused a subject is  the greater the skin conductance tends to be             
Skin conductance is often measured using two small silver silver chloride electrodes placed somewhere on the skin and applying a small voltage between them  To maximize comfort and reduce irritation the electrodes can be placed on the wrist  legs  or feet  which leaves the hands fully free for daily activity 

Facial color edit 
Overview edit 
The surface of the human face is innervated with a large network of blood vessels  Blood flow variations in these vessels yield visible color changes on the face  Whether or not facial emotions activate facial muscles  variations in blood flow  blood pressure  glucose levels  and other changes occur  Also  the facial color signal is independent from that provided by facial muscle movements             

Methodology edit 
Approaches are based on facial color changes  Delaunay triangulation is used to create the triangular local areas  Some of these triangles which define the interior of the mouth and eyes  sclera and iris  are removed  Use the left triangular areas  pixels to create feature vectors              It shows that converting the pixel color of the standard RGB color space to a color space such as oRGB color space             or LMS channels perform better when dealing with faces              So  map the above vector onto the better color space and decompose into red green and yellow blue channels  Then use deep learning methods to find equivalent emotions 

Visual aesthetics edit 
Aesthetics  in the world of art and photography  refers to the principles of the nature and appreciation of beauty  Judging beauty and other aesthetic qualities is a highly subjective task  Computer scientists at Penn State treat the challenge of automatically inferring the aesthetic quality of pictures using their visual content as a machine learning problem  with a peer rated on line photo sharing website as a data source              They extract certain visual features based on the intuition that they can discriminate between aesthetically pleasing and displeasing images 

Potential applications edit 
Education edit 
Affection influences learners  learning state  Using affective computing technology  computers can judge the learners  affection and learning state by recognizing their facial expressions  In education  the teacher can use the analysis result to understand the student s learning and accepting ability  and then formulate reasonable teaching plans  At the same time  they can pay attention to students  inner feelings  which is helpful to students  psychological health  Especially in distance education  due to the separation of time and space  there is no emotional incentive between teachers and students for two way communication  Without the atmosphere brought by traditional classroom learning  students are easily bored  and affect the learning effect  Applying affective computing in distance education system can effectively improve this situation 
            

Transportation edit 
The applications of sensory computing may contribute to improving road safety  For example  a car can monitor the emotion of all occupants and engage in additional safety measures  such as alerting other vehicles if it detects the driver to be angry              In addition  affective computing systems for monitoring the driver s stress may allow various interventions such as driver assistance systems adjusted according to the stress level             and minimal and direct interventions to change the emotional state of the driver             

Healthcare edit 
Social robots  as well as a growing number of robots used in health care benefit from emotional awareness because they can better judge users  and patient s emotional states and alter their actions programming appropriately  This is especially important in those countries with growing aging populations and or a lack of younger workers to address their needs             
Affective computing is also being applied to the development of communicative technologies for use by people with autism              The affective component of a text is also increasingly gaining attention  particularly its role in the so called emotional or emotive Internet             

Video games edit 
Affective video games can access their players  emotional states through biofeedback devices              A particularly simple form of biofeedback is available through gamepads that measure the pressure with which a button is pressed  this has been shown to correlate strongly with the players  level of arousal              at the other end of the scale are brain computer interfaces                          Affective games have been used in medical research to support the emotional development of autistic children             

Psychomotor training edit 
Training methods of psychomotor operations such as steering and maneuvering are used in various fields such as aviation  transportation and medicine  Integrating affective computing capabilities in this type of training systems  in accordance with the adaptive automation approach  has been found to be effective in improving the quality of training and shortening the required training duration             

Other applications edit 
Affective computing has potential applications in human computer interaction  such as affective mirrors allowing the user to see how he or she performs  emotion monitoring agents sending a warning before one sends an angry email  or even music players selecting tracks based on mood             
One idea put forth by the Romanian researcher Dr  Nicu Sebe in an interview is the analysis of a person s face while they are using a certain product  he mentioned ice cream as an example               Companies would then be able to use such analysis to infer whether their product will or will not be well received by the respective market 
One could also use affective state recognition in order to judge the impact of a TV advertisement through a real time video recording of that person and through the subsequent study of his or her facial expression  Averaging the results obtained on a large group of subjects  one can tell whether that commercial  or movie  has the desired effect and what the elements which interest the watcher most are 

Cognitivist vs  interactional approaches edit 
Within the field of human computer interaction  Rosalind Picard s cognitivist or  information model  concept of emotion has been criticized by and contrasted with the  post cognitivist  or  interactional  pragmatist approach taken by Kirsten Boehner and others which views emotion as inherently social             
Picard s focus is human computer interaction  and her goal for affective computing is to  give computers the ability to recognize  express  and in some cases   have  emotions              In contrast  the interactional approach seeks to help  people to understand and experience their own emotions              and to improve computer mediated interpersonal communication   It does not necessarily seek to map emotion into an objective mathematical model for machine interpretation  but rather let humans make sense of each other s emotional expressions in open ended ways that might be ambiguous  subjective  and sensitive to context                                        example needed     
Picard s critics describe her concept of emotion as  objective  internal  private  and mechanistic   They say it reduces emotion to a discrete psychological signal occurring inside the body that can be measured and which is an input to cognition  undercutting the complexity of emotional experience                                                                     
The interactional approach asserts that though emotion has biophysical aspects  it is  culturally grounded  dynamically experienced  and to some degree constructed in action and interaction                                     Put another way  it considers  emotion as a social and cultural product experienced through our interactions
