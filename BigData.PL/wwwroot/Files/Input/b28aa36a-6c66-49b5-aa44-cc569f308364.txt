Facial recognition system
FaceNet is a facial recognition system developed by Florian Schroff  Dmitry Kalenichenko and James Philbin  a group of researchers affiliated with Google  The system was first presented at the      IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition             The system uses a deep convolutional neural network to learn a mapping  also called an embedding  from a set of face images to a     dimensional Euclidean space  and assesses the similarity between faces based on the square of the Euclidean distance between the images  corresponding normalized vectors in the     dimensional Euclidean space  The system uses the triplet loss function as its cost function and introduced a new online triplet mining method  The system achieved an accuracy of         which is the highest score to date on the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset using the unrestricted with labeled outside data protocol            


Structure edit 
Basic structure edit 
The structure of FaceNet is represented schematically in Figure   

Figure    Overall structure of the FaceNet face recognition system
For training  researchers used input batches of about      images  For each identity represented in the input batches  there were    similar images of that identity and several randomly selected images of other identities  These batches were fed to a deep convolutional neural network  which was trained using stochastic gradient descent with standard backpropagation and the Adaptive Gradient Optimizer  AdaGrad  algorithm  The learning rate was initially set at       which was later lowered while finalizing the model 

Structure of the CNN edit 
The researchers used two types of architectures  which they called NN  and NN   and explored their trade offs  The practical differences between the models lie in the difference of parameters and FLOPS  The details of the NN  model are presented in the table below

Triplet loss edit 
A key innovation of the system was the triplet loss function and its associated mining method   This function was has since become central in a variety of other one shot learning problems 

Performance edit 
On the widely used Labeled Faces in the Wild  LFW  dataset  the FaceNet system achieved an accuracy of        which is the highest score on LFW in the unrestricted with labeled outside data protocol              On YouTube Faces DB the system achieved an accuracy of
