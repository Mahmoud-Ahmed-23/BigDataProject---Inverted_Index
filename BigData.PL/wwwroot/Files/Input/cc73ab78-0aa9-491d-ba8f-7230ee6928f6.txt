							Expert and consultant at GIRA Food Robert Claxton gave a speech at the Experts Guide  The Challenges and Opportunities of Egypt s Poultry Industry seminar on   March  The forum was organised by Business News to discuss the future  opportunities  and challenges of and to the poultry industry in general and specifically in Egypt  Daily News Egypt interviewed Claxton to further discuss the theme in detail 
What do you think of the poultry industry in Egypt 
Although the poultry industry seems to face issues in Egypt  it is better than many other countries  including Indonesia and China  who have bigger populations  for example  China has a population of     billion people 
The sector in Egypt is a promising one  since the price of beef is expensive and it is going to get more expensive  Also  keep in mind  the Egyptian market cannot depend on the pork industry  So  as I said  any growth will be in the poultry and fish industries 
What are the challenges that the industry faces 
There are three challenges  the diseases that impact chickens  which leads to the loss of high percentages of products  The second challenge is the devaluation of the Egyptian currency  the Egyptian feed industry depends on importing     of its production inputs  which allows the global market to control the domestic product       s prices  For example  importing soil and maize in light of the increase of the value of the US dollar will lead to the increase of product prices  The third is that the poultry industry is not operating at its full capacity 
Farms are operating at less than     of their production capacity  Feed mills are operating at     capacity  while slaughterhouses are operating at      The infrastructure of the Egyptian poultry sector is conducive to high growth rates  bearing in mind that the issues afflicting the sector must be resolved 
Numerous countries have recorded high growth rates in the poultry sector in a short period of time  including Turkey  Brazil  Iran  South Africa  and Ukraine  What does Egypt have to do to catch up with these countries 
The situation in Egypt is different  These countries succeeded in reducing production costs and product prices  which allowed them to turn into exporting countries  As for Brazil  it has access to cheap grain and a growing domestic market  It all depended on having access to lower cost feed 
Iran  due to political circumstances  became a closed environment  When they needed protein  they had to produce it themselves 
To get protein  they resorted to poultry since their other option was beef  but to buy beef they had to import it from Brazil  which means they had to have foreign currency  To conclude  Iran had to develop its domestic poultry production 
The poultry industry in Egypt does not need to catch up with countries like Brazil  since it is too far away   The industry in Egypt needs to be supplied by feed at suitable prices and technology to compete with the cheap and high standard imports  It also has to face the issue of diseases separately from the commercial sector  as Thailand did to solve this issue 
I would like to add that the stability of the governmental process is necessary to develop the sector in Egypt  On the other hand  farmers should be educated on profit making methods 
To what extent does the foreign currency crisis affect the industry s development 
The local currency is weighed against the US dollar  For a period of time  things are going to become more expensive  leading to domestic inflation  so that will be a painful situation  At the end of the day  this is more in the hands of politicians 
Can any steps be taken to reduce the costs of the industry here  in Egypt 
Definitely   It has to do with the utilisation of the industry       s capacity  as I said before  If you have capacity that you do not use  then it is adding cost  Mortality from diseases and poor management are issues that should be confronted 
You previously mentioned that Russia has applied fees and customs on importing poultry to protect its domestic industry  Should Egypt take similar steps 
Egypt already has an import tax 
But it went down from     to     in       which led to a peak in imports from        tonnes to         tonnes in the same year  What are your views on this 
I believe it is still high  In any case  imports cannot challenge the Egyptian market  The problem in Egypt is not commercial  It is important that the domestic market receive some level of protection  but it needs to be done in a way that guarantees the existence of affordable meat for consumers 
Are the circumstances in Egypt suitable for attracting investments to the poultry sector 
The problem is that there are more attractive markets worldwide  Egypt needs to make the market  here  more attractive  People need to believe that the atmosphere in Egypt will be stable for their long term investments 
So the security situation in Egypt is also a challenge 
Compared to other low cost countries  including Syria and Iraq  for example  Egypt is far more secure  The concern of the international community is how much effect these places will have on the regional market
