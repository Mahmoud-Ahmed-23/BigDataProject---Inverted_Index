Despite the success of Alien  its sequel took years to develop due to lawsuits  a lack of enthusiasm from   th Century Fox  and repeated management changes  Although relatively inexperienced  Cameron was hired to write a story for Aliens in      on the strength of his scripts for The Terminator        and Rambo  First Blood Part II         The project stalled again until new Fox executive Lawrence Gordon pursued a sequel  On an approximately            million budget  Aliens began principal photography in September      and concluded in January       The film s development was tumultuous and rife with conflicts between Cameron and the British crew at Pinewood Studios  The difficult shoot affected the composer  James Horner  who was given little time to record the music

Plot edit 
Ellen Ripley has been in stasis for    years aboard a shuttlecraft after destroying her spaceship  the Nostromo  to escape an alien creature that slaughtered her crew      i      Ripley is rescued and debriefed by her Weyland Yutani Corporation employers who doubt her claim about alien eggs in a derelict ship on the exomoon LV          ii      now the site of a terraforming colony 
After contact is lost with the colony  Weyland Yutani representative Carter Burke and Colonial Marine Lieutenant Gorman ask Ripley to accompany them to investigate  Still traumatized by her alien encounter  she agrees on condition that they exterminate the creatures  Ripley meets the Colonial Marines aboard the spaceship Sulaco but distrusts their android  Bishop  because the Nostromo     s android  Ash  had betrayed its crew to protect the alien on company orders 
A dropship lands the crew on LV      where they find the battle ravaged colony and two live alien facehuggers in containment tanks  The only colonist found is a traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt  The team locates the other colonists  signals beneath the fusion powered atmosphere processing station and heads to their location  descending into corridors covered in alien secretions  At the station s center  the marines discover opened eggs  dead facehuggers  and cocooned colonists serving as incubators for the alien embryos  The marines kill a newborn alien after it bursts through a colonist s chest  rousing several adult aliens who ambush the marines  killing or capturing many  When the inexperienced Gorman panics  Ripley assumes command and rams their armored personnel carrier into the nest to rescue Corporal Dwayne Hicks  and Privates Hudson and Vasquez  Hicks orders the dropship to recover the survivors  but a stowaway alien kills the pilots  causing the dropship to crash into the station  Low on ammunition and resources  the survivors barricade themselves inside the colony facility 
Ripley discovers that Burke ordered the colonists to investigate the derelict spaceship containing the alien eggs  intending to profit by recovering them for biological weapon research  Before she can expose Burke  Bishop reports that the dropship crash damaged the power plant s cooling system  and it will soon overheat and explode  destroying the colony  Bishop volunteers to travel to the colony transmitter and remotely pilot the remaining dropship to the surface 
Asleep in the medical lab  Ripley and Newt awaken to find themselves trapped with the two released facehuggers  Ripley triggers a fire alarm to alert the marines  who rescue them and kill the creatures  She accuses Burke of releasing the facehuggers to implant her and Newt with alien embryos to smuggle them through Earth s quarantine  The power is suddenly cut  and aliens attack through the ceiling  In the ensuing firefight  the aliens kill Burke  subdue Hudson  and injure Hicks  the cornered Gorman and Vasquez sacrifice themselves to avoid capture  Newt is separated from Ripley and taken by the creatures  Ripley takes Hicks to the dropship but refuses to abandon Newt and arms herself before descending into the processing station hive alone to rescue her  During their escape  they encounter the alien queen amid dozens of eggs  When one opens  Ripley burns the eggs and blows up the queen s ovipositor  Pursued by the enraged queen  Ripley and Newt reach the dropship and escape with Bishop and an unconscious Hicks moments before the station explodes  consuming the colony in a nuclear blast 
Aboard the Sulaco  the queen  stowed away in the dropship s landing gear  attacks the group  The queen rips Bishop in half and advances on Newt  but Ripley battles the creature using an exosuit cargo loader  expelling it into space through an airlock while the damaged Bishop shields Newt  Ripley  Newt  Hicks  and Bishop then enter hypersleep for their return trip to Earth

Production edit 
Early development edit 
The success of Alien        led to immediate discussions of a sequel  but the production company Brandywine Productions struggled to convince   th Century Fox to make it  Studio president Alan Ladd Jr  was supportive of the project but left Fox to found the Ladd Company  and his replacement  Norman Levy  was concerned about the cost of producing an Alien      II                                      Brandywine co founder David Giler said Levy believed a sequel would be a  disaster               Fox executives believed Alien     s success was a fluke  and that it had not generated enough profit or audience interest to warrant a sequel              Box office returns for horror films were also declining              Progress was further slowed when Giler and Brandywine co founders Walter Hill and Gordon Carroll sued Fox for unpaid profits from Alien  Using Hollywood accounting methods  Fox had declared Alien a financial loss despite its earnings of over           million against a             million budget  Brandywine s lawsuit was settled by early       the result being that Fox would finance the development of Alien      II  but was not required to distribute the film                         
Levy s eventual replacement  Joe Wizan  was receptive to a sequel  and although other executives remained noncommittal  Giler s development executive  Larry Wilson  began looking for a scriptwriter by mid                               Wilson came across the script for the in development science fiction film  The Terminator         written by James Cameron  With Cameron s collaborative scriptwriting efforts alongside Sylvester Stallone on Rambo  First Blood Part II         Wilson was convinced to show the script for The Terminator to Giler  Hill  and Carroll                          In November       Cameron submitted a    page film treatment for Alien      II written in three days based on Giler and Hill s suggestion of  Ripley and soldiers                                       The studio had a mixed reaction  one executive calling it a constant stream of horror without character development                          Negotiations to sell the sequel rights to Rambo     s developers Mario Kassar and Andrew G  Vajna failed and the project stalled again             

Revival edit 
 Left to right  Director James Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd  pictured in      
By July       Lawrence Gordon had replaced Wizan  With few projects in development  Gordon looked at sequels to Fox s existing properties and came across the Alien      II treatment  he said he was surprised that no one had pursued it              Production of The Terminator was delayed for nine months because Arnold Schwarzenegger was contractually obligated to film Conan the Destroyer         Cameron used the time to develop his treatment  expanding it to ninety pages                          He drew ideas from  Mother   one of his story concepts about an alien on a space station involving a power loader suit              Because of his low expectations for The Terminator  Cameron had spent much of his free time during its production developing and trying out ideas for Alien      II                         
This script was better received by Fox executives and Gordon  but Cameron also wanted to direct the project                                      Cameron was a relatively new director  his only directing credit being Piranha II  The Spawning         a low budget  independent horror film  and the studio was reluctant to grant his request  His credibility was elevated following the surprise financial and critical success of The Terminator in late       and Gordon gave him the job                                      Cameron s associates tried to persuade him to reject the offer  believing anything good about the film would be attributed to Alien director Ridley Scott and anything negative to Cameron              Scott said he was never offered the chance to direct the sequel  possibly because he was difficult to work with on the original              The title Aliens reportedly came from Cameron writing  Alien  on a whiteboard during a pitch meeting and adding a     suffix                          Cameron also wanted his collaborative partner and girlfriend  Gale Anne Hurd  to serve as the producer  but Fox did not take the request seriously  believing she could not stand up to Cameron  who believed she was the only person who would                          Hurd had several industry associates contact Fox executives to convince them she was a legitimate producer             
Cameron turned in the finished script in February       hours before a Hollywood writer s strike              Cameron recalled the audience reactions while seeing Alien in the theater and believed it would be difficult to recreate the emotion and novelty of the original  He and Hurd agreed to combine the horror of Alien with the action of The Terminator  According to Hill  Cameron said if the first film could be compared to a haunted attraction  Aliens should be like a roller coaster              Cameron believed in having a strong female heroine to distinguish his films from typical Hollywood action fare and wrote the script with a picture of Weaver on his desk              He referred to The Terminator  and how he removed the normal protective forces from Sarah Connor so she had to fend for herself              Cameron had also always wanted to make a film about space infantry             
The final script was well received  but Fox executives  including chairman Barry Diller  were concerned about the budget  Fox estimated the cost as close to          million  but Hurd said it would be closer to            million  Diller offered          million  prompting Cameron and Hurd to quit  Gordon negotiated with Diller until he relented  and Cameron and Hurd returned              In April       conflict turned to the cast  Fox did not want Weaver to return because they expected her to demand a high salary                          Cameron and Hurd were insistent Weaver return as the solo star  Fox refused  saying they would damage the studio s negotiating power with Weaver s agent  Cameron and Hurd again left the project  marrying and going on a honeymoon  When they returned  the Aliens project was ready to move forward  Cameron credited Gordon with Aliens      being greenlit             

Casting edit 
 Left to right  Bill Paxton  pictured in       and Lance Henriksen        portrayed Colonial Marine Private Hudson and the android Bishop  respectively 
Weaver rejected initial offers to return and despite being interested after reading Cameron s script  she had to be convinced Aliens was not being made exclusively for financial reasons                                      Weaver received a         million  equivalent to            million in       salary and a percentage of the box office profits  the highest salary of her career at the time              Negotiations were so lengthy that Cameron and Hurd told Schwarzenegger s agent they intended to write Ripley out of the movie  knowing Weaver s agent would be told   terms were reached shortly afterward             
Cameron wanted an unknown actor to portray Newt  Agents scouted Henn while she was at school in Lakenheath  England  and though she lacked acting experience  Cameron said she had a  great face and expressive eyes               Stephen Lang auditioned for the role of Hicks  but James Remar secured the role on the recommendation of Hill  his close friend  Remar left shortly into filming  ostensibly due to urgent family matters or creative differences with Cameron  but he later admitted he was fired after being arrested for drug possession                                      Hurd hired Michael Biehn the following Friday                          Paxton credited his casting as Hudson to a chance encounter with Cameron at Los Angeles International Airport  during which he mentioned he would be interested in a role  Fox supported Paxton s casting because of positive feedback for his performance in Weird Science                                 Paxton was worried the character would annoy audiences until he realized he was comic relief for the tense scenes              Henriksen was concerned about portraying Bishop after other recent successful portrayals of android characters  such as Ian Holm in Alien and Rutger Hauer in Blade Runner         He played Bishop as an innocent child who pities the short lived humans  He suggested wearing distinctive contact lenses to convey when Bishop was alerted to danger  but Cameron believed they would make the character appear more frightening than the aliens              Biehn  Paxton  and Henriksen had worked with Cameron on The Terminator                         
Aliens was Reiser s first major theatrical role  following small parts in films like Beverly Hills Cop                     The Colonial Marines cast features a mix of British and American actors who underwent three weeks of intensive training with the British Special Air Service  SAS       b      Vietnam War veteran Al Matthews  Apone  helped to train the actors  teaching them how to handle firearms properly because their blanks were still hazardous                          Before he left  Remar accidentally shot a hole through the set of Frank Oz s Little Shop of Horrors on an adjacent stage                          The training was intended to help the marine cast develop camaraderie and treat the other actors  Weaver  Reiser  and Hope  as outsiders                          Biehn s late casting caused him to miss the training  and he said he regretted being unable to customize his armor like the other actors  since he inherited Remar s                           Cameron created a distinct backstory for each marine and instructed the actors to read Starship Troopers so they would understand the space marine archetype                                     
Vasquez was Goldstein s first feature film role  She credited her physique to spending hours at the gym while unemployed  gaining    pounds           kg  at Cameron s request                                      Goldstein wore dark contact lenses and underwent an hour of makeup to cover her freckles and darken her white skin to portray a  Chicano  character  she studied Mexican American gang interviews to develop her demeanor and accent              Ricco Ross  Frost  was committed to Full Metal Jacket         whose filming schedule overlapped for a week with Aliens       Although Cameron offered to let Ross join the filming later  Ross was concerned that Stanley Kubrick s projects often overran  and opted for Aliens instead              Rolston misled the filmmakers to get his part  he had finished filming Revolution         and implied he was its most prominent actor after Al Pacino              William Hope  Gorman  was cast as Hudson before Cameron and Hurd decided to take the character in a different direction             
Cynthia Dale Scott  Dietrich  was an aspiring singer when she was cast              Colette Hiller  Ferro  was upset she had to cut her hair short for the role because she was getting married shortly afterward  and made the filmmakers buy her a long  blonde wig              Trevor Steedman  Wierzbowski  was a stuntman rather than an actor              and Aliens was Daniel Kash s  Spunkmeyer  debut film role  He offered Cameron his coat if he got the part and also auditioned for Hudson              The actors stayed at the Holiday Inn in Langley  Berkshire  during filming  Paxton described the actors  time outside work positively   God  we had the best time          We all hung very hard together  That s where I first met  Henriksen   who I fell in love with   Matthews           was a really good spirit to have around  with a great voice  And all these hilarious British characters  like  Steedman   the stuntman  who used to grab my bicep and go   Blimey  more meat on a cat s cock               

Filming edit 
Aliens was filmed almost entirely at Pinewood Studios in England  pictured in       
Principal photography began in September       on a    day schedule  and an            million budget      iii      not including film prints and marketing                                      Filming took place mainly at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire near London  because of its large sets and the lower cost of filming in England      c      Filming was difficult as Cameron  a Canadian  had little familiarity with British film industry traditions such as tea breaks  which interrupted production for up to an hour each weekday  and was frustrated at losing hours of filming every week                                      In his book The Making of Aliens  J  W  Rinzler described Cameron as aggressive and certain of what he wanted  which irked the crew  The situation was exacerbated by Cameron s hands on approach  often modifying setups such as lighting himself to fit his vision without involving the unionized crew             
The crew was dismissive of Cameron for his relative inexperience  thinking he had not done enough to earn such a prominent position  and that Hurd had her job only because she was his partner                                      Cinematographer Dick Bush insisted on lighting the alien hive brightly  counter to Cameron s request   and was eventually replaced with Adrian Biddle             First assistant director Derek Cracknell also ignored Cameron s requests                          Gale described the situation     x      Cameron  would ask him to set up a shot one way and  Cracknell  would say   Oh no no no  I know what you want            Then he d do it wrong and the whole set would have to be broken down               The situation deteriorated until Cameron and Hurd fired Cracknell and the Pinewood crew walked out in the middle of the day             
Cameron called Fox for advice and was determined to move the production out of England until Hurd convinced him otherwise  The situation was tumultuous because the number of films simultaneously in production meant the crew could not be easily replaced  Cameron and Hurd gathered the crew to discuss their grievances  Cameron explained the importance of the production  and that any member of the crew who could not support it should volunteer to be replaced  The crew agreed to support Cameron if he supported their scheduled working hours              The relationship between filmmakers and crew remained cool  when filming concluded at Pinewood  Cameron told the crew   This has been a long and difficult shoot  fraught by many problems          but the one thing that kept me going  through it all  was the certain knowledge that one day I would drive out the gate of Pinewood and never come back  and that you sorry bastards would still be here               He described most of the crew as  lazy  insolent  and arrogant               Paxton called the crew s work impeccable  but their attitude more relaxed than the American crews to which he was accustomed             
The power plant and alien nest were filmed in the decommissioned Acton Lane Power Station in London  and the sets were left in place until Tim Burton redressed the sets into interiors for Axis Chemicals during the filming of his      film Batman                          While filming the dropship descent from the Sulaco  shaking collapsed the set roof onto the cast and crew  Most of the cast were unharmed  but a large piece of debris hit Cameron in the head                          Because of the tight budget  Hurd made Cameron pay for an early scene of a laser cutting Ripley free from her hypersleep chamber                          According to Henriksen  Paxton was unaware he would be involved in the knife trick scene until it was filmed  Henriksen nicked Paxton s finger during the reshoot              Some of the early establishing scenes were filmed near the end of principal photography to capture the bond that had developed between cast and characters             
Some improvisation was encouraged              Weaver discussed tweaks to her character with Cameron on set  believing she understood how Ripley would act              Her line  Get away from her  you bitch   had to be filmed in one take due to the tight schedule remaining  and the actress thought she had messed it up              Paxton believed he was not good at improvisation and discussed ideas with Cameron before filming  Hudson s signature line  Game over  man  game over   originated from Paxton developing a backstory for the character  in which he was trained on simulators             Henn found it hard to act afraid of the aliens  since she was fond of the actors in the suits  and imagined a dog was chasing her              Other cast members spent time with Henn between scenes  including Weaver and Paxton  who would color or craft things with her                           Biehn said he and Paxton spent much of their free time together              Despite the difficulties  Fox was satisfied with the daily footage  and principal photography concluded in January       on time and on budget                         

Post production edit 
Post production began in late April                   Several scenes were removed from Aliens      theatrical release  including Ripley learning about her daughter s death and a cocooned Burke begging her for death              Fox and Hurd suggested removing a long opening scene detailing the lives of the colonists  Newt s family discovering the derelict alien ship  and her father being attacked by a facehugger  because it ruined the pacing and sense of mystery                          Two scenes with James Remar as Hicks  shown from the back  were used in the film             
Ray Lovejoy was responsible for editing the final     minute cut of Aliens              Fox wanted the film to be under two hours so it could be shown more times per day in theaters  increasing its revenue potential  Fox production president Scott Rudin flew to England to ask Cameron and Hurd if they could cut another    minutes  but Cameron was concerned further cuts would make it nonsensical  and Rudin relented

James Horner        Futile Escape

James Horner was given six weeks to score Aliens but  because filming and editing were behind schedule  he had to compose it in only three

James Horner met Cameron early in their careers  when they worked for director Roger Corman  Aliens was Horner and Cameron s first collaboration  Horner called it a  nightmare                           He arrived in London to compose  expecting a six week schedule  There was nothing for him to score  as Cameron was still filming and editing  and Horner had only three weeks to compose                                      The producers were unwilling to give him any more time  and he was booked to begin scoring The Name of the Rose        shortly afterwards             
Horner recorded the score at Abbey Road Studios with the London Symphony Orchestra                          His schedule was so tight that the music for the climactic battle between Ripley and the queen was written overnight  Cameron first heard the score while it was being recorded by the orchestra and did not like it  but it was too late to make changes  Brad Fiedel s synth inspired tracks for The Terminator had allowed changes to be made quickly based on feedback  but Cameron had no experience managing orchestral music              Cameron cut the score up  using pieces where he believed they fit best  and inserted pieces of Jerry Goldsmith s Alien score and hired unknown composers to fill gaps                          The director said in a later interview he thought the music was good  but did not fit the scenes he had filmed              Horner s  alien sting  sound was initially used only once  during the scene with the cocooned woman  as Cameron disliked it  but he eventually used it throughout the film              Unused portions of Horner s Aliens score were repurposed for Die Hard

Development of the special effects for Aliens began in May       with John Richardson supervising a    person team at Stan Winston Studio                                      L A  Effects Group created miniatures and optical effects  Cameron lacked contacts at the more established special effects studios and avoided using them because he believed his hands on approach would not be welcomed              He also did not rehire many Alien crew members because he did not want to be restricted by their loyalties to the first film  Those who returned were often given a higher status  such as Crispian Sallis  Alien focus puller and Aliens set decorator                           Cameron had enjoyed returning artist Ron Cobb s work on Alien              and conceptual artist Syd Mead was recruited because Cameron was a fan of his work on films such as       The Year We Make Contact                    

Sets and technology edit 
Mead designed the Sulaco  the marines  spaceship  He conceived it as a large sphere with antennae  but Cameron wanted it to be flatter  the full craft had to pass the camera  and a sphere would not work with the aspect ratio              Mead designed the craft as a commercial freighter carrying a military unit  Its exterior was designed with a row of loading doors  a crane  and large gun fixtures to defend against threats              Mirrors were used as a cost cutting measure to increase the number of sleeping pods and add a power loader              Cobb designed the dropship  the armored personnel carrier  APC   and exteriors of the colony and its vehicles                                      The Sulaco     s dropship was designed to be life size  for use on the Sulaco set              but a smaller replica was used for some shots              The APC was a disguised pushback tug for a Boeing                  The derelict alien spacecraft used in Aliens had been in historian Bob Burns III s driveway since its appearance in Alien             
Most of the colony  apart from the main entrance used by the marines  was constructed in scale miniature form  The set was about    foot          m  long to accommodate the sixth scale APC replica  The set was so large it had to be laid out diagonally across the stage  and forced perspective was used to add in buildings that would otherwise not fit              Cobb used a stylized design for the colony  resembling a western frontier town  It featured a makeshift construction from cargo containers  broken filming equipment  and beer crates              The alien nest scene was one of the earliest filmed  Weaver s participation was delayed by three weeks because of production issues on her previous film Half Moon Street         and the scene was one of the few not involving her  The Acton Power Station location was filled with decaying asbestos and three weeks were spent having it professionally cleaned  during which time the alien hive was fabricated in clay spawning hundreds of fiberglass and vacuum formed castings that were installed at the station over a further three weeks              Cameron wanted to vertically pan as the marines entered the hive  but disguising the area above the marines would be time intensive  A hanging miniature  about    foot           m  square  was made from plywood and styrofoam  hung just above the actors  heads  and carefully blended into the larger set  After Remar was replaced  Cameron wanted to reshoot the scene  but the miniature had been destroyed  he was able to edit the scene to conceal Remar             
The marines  smart guns weighed    to    pounds     to         kg   and were constructed from German MG    machine guns attached to a steadicam and augmented with motorcycle parts                          Since getting in and out of the smart gun rig was difficult  the actors kept them on when not filming              The pulse rifle was made from a Thompson submachine gun and a Franchi SPAS    pump action shotgun in a futuristic shell              Weaver was opposed to weapons in general  but Cameron explained weapons were secondary to the core narrative of Ripley bonding with and protecting Newt                                      Weaver found using the weapons strange and difficult  due to their weight and her concern about pulling the wrong trigger                          Automated sentry guns were also constructed for Aliens  although they do not appear in the theatrical cut  Real machine guns were positioned atop remote controlled hydraulic tripods that allowed them to pivot horizontally or vertically  The guns were capable of firing up to     wooden blank rounds per minute that were shattered into small splinters by baffles in the muzzle and incinerated by the heat generated in the barrel             
A cast was made of Henn s upper body and her stunt double s legs to construct a lightweight dummy for Weaver to hold when carrying a gun  Henn s weight plus a gun would have been too heavy              Goldstein had never handled a gun  and held her weapon incorrectly in closeups  so Hurd stood in for her              The flamethrowers were functional  The art department had covered the sets in an unspecified substance to artificially age them  the flamethrowers vaporized it  causing fire and heavy smoke  Goldstein struggled to breathe and  since improvisation was encouraged  Paxton thought she was acting until he also became breathless                         
The nuclear explosion of the colony in the finale was created by shining a light bulb through cotton              Reebok designer Taun Le was commissioned to design custom sneakers for Weaver to wear in the film  The only mandate was that they be laceless so one could easily slide off of Weaver s foot during the finale                         


Creature effects edit

H  R  Giger  who designed the alien creature  was reportedly disappointed that he could not be involved in Aliens              According to Hurd  Giger was contractually obligated to Poltergeist II  The Other Side        and Fox was not allowed to negotiate with him              Giger was replaced by special effects creator Stan Winston  Cameron also contributed to designs but was not as concerned with the warrior aliens because they were on screen only briefly              In redesigning the alien warriors  Cameron remained faithful to Giger s work while building on it  Conscious that the creatures would be seen by audiences as people in costumes  he enhanced the designs by extending their arms and often filmed them hung from wires or from atypical positions to make them appear more inhuman              The aliens were played by dancers and stuntmen in lightweight costumes that allowed them to move quickly  Several   foot           m  mannequins were used for aliens that were contorted into inhuman poses              Although hordes of alien creatures appear to be in the film  there were only    alien suits  simple black leotards covered in molded foam were used for faster moving shots  and detailed models with articulated upper bodies and mouths for closeups              When the aliens were shot and destroyed  puppets were hung up and detonated  The aliens  acidic blood was a combination of titanium tetrachloride  cyclohexylamine  acetic acid and yellow dye             
The facehugger design remained faithful to the original Alien design  but the overall appearance was made to appear more organic  and its eight legs were made more finger like  enhancing the detail on the knuckles and adding fingernails              Unlike in Alien  which only involved one substantial jumping scene  the facehugger models used in Aliens featured full articulation for their tongue  legs  and tail  allowing for more action set pieces  The tail was also lengthened about        in          cm  to give it more functions such as a whip like action              Nine operators were required for the fully articulated facehugger  other less detailed variants were used for simple actions such as scurrying across the floor  The design team struggled with making it scuttle believably while moving the appendages  they eventually developing a control wire along the floor that activated a gear inside it  causing the appendages to move as it was pulled along  Several rubber facehuggers were made to be thrown or blown up              Manipulating the facehugger inside a water tank was also difficult as the tank had to be watertight  limiting the use of control cables  A method was developed that required fewer cables to move the facehugger around the tank  the tail was fitted with a spring that caused it to snap back and forth              Winston added arms to the chestburster alien form  since the adult form had arms   explaining how it could drag itself out of a host s chest  Two chestburster puppets were used  a reinforced one  and an articulated one for movement  A puppeteer punched the former through a fabricated latex foam chest  the scene took several takes to film because it could not pierce the clothing                         
A deleted scene in Alien established a life cycle for the alien creatures in which a lifeform would be cocooned and transformed into an egg that birthed a facehugger                           Inspired by a beehive like hierarchy  Cameron believed the vast field of eggs on the derelict alien craft would come from a much larger creature  the queen  with the other alien creatures serving as her drones              Winston described Cameron s initial queen design as a combination of a praying mantis and Tyrannosaurus rex influenced by the alien warrior design                           Cameron said dinosaur influences were unintentional as he considered them  boring   his goal was to extrapolate on Giger s warrior designs to create a large and powerful creature that was also swift and overtly female  describing it as  hideous and beautiful at the same time  like a black widow spider   The queen has elongated  large forelimbs  with smaller secondary ones underneath  but Winston redesigned the legs by adding a double joint to make it more inhuman               Cameron and Winston worked on several concepts to vivify the queen  including large puppets  miniatures  and costumes with several people inside  A frame was built large enough to hold two people  covered in black polythene bags  and hung on a crane  The prototype was a success  and Cameron wrote the alien queen scene                           The final alien queen was a    foot           m  puppet made of lightweight polyurethane foam              Two people sat inside to control the arms  the legs were controlled by rods connected at the ankles  and a separate person whipped the tail around with fishing line  The head was manipulated with a combination of servomotors and hydraulics controlled by up to four people  The effect was hidden by lighting  steam  slime  and smoke                           The Stan Winston Studio had not used hydraulics and considered them a learning experience  They were essential for moving larger parts of the queen puppet  including the head  and a foot pedal in the body could hydraulically move the tail up and down              Shane Mahan took several weeks to sculpt the head by sight  based on a maquette  computer technology to scale up the model s design did not yet exist               Two heads were built  a lightweight  fragile one  and another that could survive some damage  Each was articulated with hydraulics and cables to control the queen s mouth and lips             
To create the effect of the queen piercing Bishop s chest with her tail  Tom Woodruff Jr  and Alec Gillis constructed a chestplate for Henriksen with a rubber segment of the queen s tail flattened against it  The tail was pulled forward by wire  apparently exploding through Bishop s torso  A rigid piece of tail  attached to a body harness  was used to show more of the tail moving through Bishop  and Henriksen was levered upward as if he was being lifted by the tail  To complete the effect  a dummy of Bishop was constructed with a spring loaded mechanism that forcibly separated his upper and lower body  as if the queen had ripped him in half  Once separated  Henriksen s upper body was below the set and a fake torso attached up to his shoulders  The android blood was milk  and after several days of filming  it was sour and foul smelling              
John Richardson designed the mechanical power loader exosuit  with input from Mead  As with the queen  a prototype was built out of wood and polythene bags stuffed with newspaper to see how the movement would work                                       The finished design was so cumbersome that stuntman John Lees  in a black skinsuit  operated it from behind                           The battle between the queen and power loader was extensively choreographed  as Weaver risked serious injury battling a large  unwieldy animatronic               The camera was sometimes moved to simulate subjects moving faster  The scene of the queen running at Ripley was one of the more difficult shots  the wires and rods had to be concealed  since they could not be removed in post production               Miniatures were used for parts of the scene with go motion  a version of stop motion with motion blur added

The      summer film season began in mid May  The season had been starting earlier each year as studios attempted to beat each other with their biggest films  Fifty five films were scheduled for release between May and September  including the action drama Top Gun and the comedic Sweet Liberty  but the season was not expected to break financial records due to fewer sequels  anticipated blockbusters  and films by Steven Spielberg or starring popular comedians that had dominated the earlier half of the decade  Some industry experts also blamed the burgeoning home video market  which had grown from        million rentals in      to         million by                                 Films expected to do well were aimed at younger audiences and featured comedy or horror  such as Back to School  Ferris Bueller s Day Off  and SpaceCamp               Some films targeted at adults were also seen as potential successes  including Legal Eagles  Ruthless People  and Cobra              
Aliens was seen by industry professionals as a potential sleeper hit based on positive industry word of mouth during filming  enthusiastic industry screenings  and favorable pre release reviews                                      The film s success was considered dependent on its ability to attract audiences outside the young males and blue collar workers typical for the genre               The tagline was   This time  it s war              

Box office edit 
Aliens began a wide release in the United States  U S   and Canada on July                           During its opening weekend  the film earned            million from       theaters an average of        per theater  It was the weekend s number one film  ahead of the martial arts drama The Karate Kid Part II            million in its fifth weekend  and the black comedy Ruthless People            million in its fourth weekend                Based on its opening five day total              million   Aliens exceeded Fox s expectations and was anticipated to become the summer s top film  surpassing The Karate Kid Part II  Back to School  and Top Gun                           The Los Angeles Times reported long lines to see Aliens  even on weekday afternoons

Reception edit 
Critical response edit 
Critics were divided about Aliens      intense action and horror  but consistent in their praise for Weaver s  pictured in       performance 
Aliens opened to generally positive reviews               It appeared on the cover of the July           edition of Time magazine  which called it  The Summer s Scariest Movie                Audience polls by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of  A  on an A  to F scale              
Most reviewers agreed Aliens was a worthy successor to Alien                            Variety and Walter Goodman said it could not replicate the novelty of the first film  but Aliens compensated with special effects  technique  and a constant stream of set piece thrills and scary scenes                          Variety added Aliens was made by an expert craftsman  suggesting its predecessor was a more artistic endeavor               Sheila Benson said Aliens was clever and ironically funny  but lacked Alien     s pure horror  Benson attributed this to an overabundance of creature effects in the intervening years  particularly the      film The Thing  which  Benson said  took alien monstrosities to an extreme               
According to Rick Kogan  Aliens demonstrated that science fiction horror could still be entertaining after many poorly received Alien derived films               Dave Kehr and Richard Schickel called it a rare sequel which surpassed the original  and Kehr appreciated the action used to develop the characters  Schickel wrote that the film had evolved from Alien  giving Weaver new emotional depths                            Jay Scott said Cameron had redefined the war film  combining Rambo with Star Wars               Kogan agreed Cameron possessed a knack for action pacing and excitement  but Kehr believed Cameron pushed some elements beyond believability                           
Roger Ebert called the last hour  painfully  unremittingly intense  in horror and action  leaving him emotionally drained and unhappy  Ebert believed it could not be defined as entertainment  despite his admiration of the filmmaking craft on display               Dennis Fischer wrote for The Hollywood Reporter that the unrelenting scenes of action and suspense worked for Aliens as they had in The Terminator  tension was created by placing the characters in successive  increasingly difficult situations               Gene Siskel described the film as  one extremely violent  protracted attack on the senses                In the Orlando Sentinel  Jay Boyar called it the Jaws of the     s  the most  intensely shocking  film in years              
Reviewers consistently praised Weaver s performance                            Benson called her the  white hot core  around whose  defiant intelligence  and  sensual athleticism  Aliens was built  and Ripley returned not for vengeance but out of compassion               Ebert credited Weaver s sympathetic performance with holding Aliens together               Kogan compared her to a more attractive John Rambo  Sylvester Stallone s action character                Scott agreed  saying Weaver made action stars like Stallone and Schwarzenegger look like male pin up models  He described her as the ultimate adventure heroine  balancing action with femininity and maternal instincts               Pauline Kael was critical of the film overall as too  mechanical   but praised Weaver s physical presence and performance  writing that  without her  Aliens was a subpar B picture              
Most of the cast was also praised  particularly Biehn  Goldstein  Henriksen  Henn and Reiser                                        but Benson noted that less time was spent exploring the new characters than in Alien               Schickel said Henn played her character as endearingly brave and clever  without self pity               Benson praised Horner s  ruminative  intelligent  music               but Fischer criticized it for borrowing too much from Goldsmith s score and Horner s work on Star Trek III  The Search for Spock

Themes edit 
Motherhood edit 
A central theme of Aliens is motherhood                           Alien can be seen as a metaphor for childbirth  but Aliens focuses on Ripley s maternal feelings for Newt  A scene cut from the theatrical release depicts Ripley learning her child died while she was in stasis  helping explain Ripley s motherly attention for Newt  Newt has also lost everything of value  and they form a new family from the remnants of their old ones                            This relationship is mirrored by the alien queen  mother of the alien creatures                            There are no paternal figures  both are single mothers  defending their young  The alien queen seeks revenge against Ripley  who destroyed her brood and her means of reproduction                            According to Richard Schickel  Alien is about survival  Aliens is about fighting to ensure someone else s survival              
Authors Tammy Ostrander and Susan Yunis believed Newt s capture by the aliens forces Ripley to realize she is willing to die to save her  demonstrating a selfless motherhood  unlike the queen s selfish motherhood               Writing for the Los Angeles Times  Nancy Weber wrote that as a mother  she saw in Aliens the constant vigilance required to protect her child from predators  sexism  and threats to childhood innocence               Leilani Nishime believed despite the focus on motherhood  the nuclear family is represented in Aliens with a mother  Ripley   father  Hicks   daughter  Newt   and a loyal  self sacrificing dog  Bishop               
According to Charles Berg  the depictions of aliens in science fiction that became more popular during the     s represented American fears of immigrants  the  other    In Aliens  this can be seen in the white skinned single mother  Ripley  confronting the dark skinned alien queen with an endless brood               Ostrander and Yunis also identified fears of overcrowding  dwindling resources  and pollution  suggesting the alien queen demonizes motherhood and makes it less attractive  She represents mindless  unchecked maternal instinct spawning armies of children  regardless of the lives which must be sacrificed to ensure their survival  Despite imminent destruction by the colony exploding  the queen continues to reproduce               The aliens  life cycle taints the reproductive cycle  Creation involves rape  and birth involves a violent death               In destroying the aliens and their queen  Ripley rejects the unchecked proliferation of their species and sets an example for her own              

Masculinity and femininity edit 
Ripley was often compared to the era s masculine heroes  including Sylvester Stallone s John Rambo 
Ripley has been compared to John Rambo and dubbed Ramboette  Rambette  Fembo  Ramboline  Weaver called herself Rambolina                                        Mary Lee Settle said females in television and film had evolved from escapist fantasy to more accurately reflect their audiences  A gun  which can be seen as a phallic symbol  has a different meaning when wielded by Weaver               Schickel described Ripley as transcending the customary boundaries imposed on her gender  where females serve the male hero  In Aliens  the male characters are neutralized by the climax and Ripley faces the queen alone              Cameron said he does not like cowardly female characters and removes their expected protectors to force them to fend for themselves  He called the overuse of male heroes  commercially shortsighted  in an industry whose audience is    percent female  and where     percent of the time  it s women who decide which film to see                          
The growth of female led action films after the success of Aliens reflects the change in women s roles and the divide between professional critics  who perceive a masculinization of the heroine  and audiences that regardless of gender embrace  emulate  and quote Ripley               The hyper masculine heroes played by Schwarzenegger  Stallone  and Jean Claude Van Damme were replaced by independent women capable of defending themselves and defeating villains in films such as The Silence of the Lambs        and Cameron s Terminator    Judgment Day                      These female characters often perform stereotypical male actions  and have muscular physiques rather than feminine  soft  bodies               When Ripley has seized command of the marines and is no longer a passive outsider in Aliens  the traditional male hero  Hicks  instructs her in the use of their weapons               The comparison of Ripley to Rambo conflates her with the male  musclebound  gun wielding action hero               To balance her masculine traits  Cameron gives Ripley maternal instincts  this counters homophobic audiences  who might see a masculinized female as lesbian or butch               These traits are further offset by the more openly masculine Vasquez  a minor character  Vasquez  who has short hair and bigger muscles  is introduced to the audience by working out  and is asked if she has ever been mistaken for a man               Weber appreciated the change in female characters between the films  contrasting Alien     s hysterical Lambert with the tough Vasquez  who sacrifices herself for her team  not only for the protagonist               

War and trauma edit 
Aliens has been described as an allegory for the Vietnam War  the marines  like the United States  have superior weaponry and technology that proves largely ineffective against an unseen  local enemy                          Like some Vietnam veterans  Ripley developed post traumatic stress disorder after the events of Alien               Writer Joe Abbott contrasted the depiction of the military in Aliens to the      science fiction film Them  In both films  humans are beset by a monstrous invasion  in Them   the military is the hero despite its responsibility for the infestation  Abbott said its post World War II American setting depicts a competent military and a state authority that demands  and receives  the compliance of its citizens  The image of the post Vietnam military is tarnished and scrutinized  in Aliens  it is ill equipped  bumbling  and incapable of combating the threat posed by the alien creatures  Citizen cooperation can no longer be demanded or expected  and it is Ripley  an independent contractor from outside the state and military infrastructures  who saves the day               Unlike Them   the military is not at fault for creating the problem in Aliens  it is the Weyland Yutani corporation   the company    The power of the state has been superseded by the corporation  which also demands conformity for rewards and advancement and reflects a growing mistrust of corporatism  the company is represented by Burke  a self interested opportunist               Ripley is elevated throughout Aliens as she prioritizes the survival and safety of all humans while Burke is often willing to callously sacrifice human life in pursuit of the interests of the company              
According to Weaver  Aliens is about confronting trauma to obtain closure               This may be seen as a reflection of Ronald Reagan s United States presidency and a conservatism that believed the hero must return to confront their fears with ethics and morality on their side                            Comparing Alien with Aliens  Roger Luckhurst said   Even if Alien was a piece of leftist science fiction  the core of  its  myth could be inflected the other way   Cameron s  Aliens would be a defiantly Reaganite version of the story pumped  militarized  libertarian driven by a staunch defense of the nuclear family                Abbott said Aliens adheres to a radical ideology and condemns centrism  similar films were popular because they represented audience dissatisfaction with the social status quo               The film places power in the individual  Ripley   instead of institutions like the military  corporations  or the government               The Bishop character also allows Ripley to confront her distrust of androids that resulted from the deception of Ash  portrayed by Ian Holm  in Alien  Unlike Ash  Bishop is openly an android and conveys both a similarly unassuming personality and a fascination with the alien creatures  Aliens imbues Bishop with a degree of humanity as he volunteers for a potentially suicidal mission  Although the other characters assume he is artificial and thus unafraid  Bishop affirms   Believe me  I d prefer not to  I may be synthetic  but I m not stupid               

Legacy edit 
Cultural influence edit 
Carrie Henn  pictured in       chose not to pursue acting after appearing in Aliens 
A cinematic touchstone  Aliens has had an enduring influence on filmmaking      f      Elements such as a team of soldiers being dismantled by a villain have been repeated to the point of clich               The same is true of Horner s oft imitated score                          which regularly appeared in action film trailers for the following decade                          The film s influence can also be seen in video games   particularly science fiction games   ships  armor  and weapons                            as well as the      Italian film Shocking Dark  a remake of Aliens that relocates much of the plot and scenes to a Venetian setting and incorporates elements of The Terminator  outside Italy  it was released as Terminator II               In Avengers  Infinity War         Spider Man discusses the film with Iron Man  and the two use the xenomorph queen s defeat as inspiration for how to kill Ebony Maw and free Doctor Strange              
Although The Terminator was a success for Cameron  the critical and commercial success of Aliens made him a blockbuster director  It also expanded the Alien series into a franchise  spanning video games  comic books  and toys  although Ripley and the alien creature originated in Alien  Cameron elaborated on the creature s life cycle  added new characters and factions  such as the Colonial Marines   and extended the films  universe              Ripley became a post feminist icon  a proactive hero who retained feminine traits              Aliens features popular quotes  including Paxton s  Game over  man  game over                             and Weaver s  Get away from her  you bitch   which is considered one of Aliens     s most memorable lines and has often been repeated in other media                           Aliens was named by director Roland Emmerich as one of his top ten science fiction films  alongside Alien              
Many cast and crew members reunited at the      San Diego Comic Con to celebrate the film s   th anniversary  including Weaver  Biehn  Paxton  Henriksen  Reiser  Henn  Cameron and Hurd  Cameron said he normally would not participate  and did not do so for The Terminator     s anniversary  but he considered Aliens special because of its impact on his career                            Asked why he thought Aliens      popularity had endured  Cameron said 

I have to take my filmmaker hat off and look at it as a fan and think   Well  I really like those characters           There s certain lines  moments  you remember moments  It s satisfying  it ends in a satisfying way          But I actually think it s those characters  We can all relate to Hudson running around  What the hell are we gonna do now man  What the fuck we gonna do   We all know that guy 
Hurd believed that it was the experience itself 

It s a great midnight screening movie because you can talk back to the screen and you can have this group experience  It not only makes you feel something  it makes you cheer  it makes you jump  When you think of all the things that something can do  which is projected on a screen  it ticks all those boxes and it makes you laugh              
The ensemble cast s popularity led to many members appearing together in later films  including Henriksen  Goldstein  and Paxton in Near Dark        as well as Goldstein and Rolston in Lethal Weapon                       Biehn lost a role in Cameron s Avatar        because Weaver had been cast  and the director did not want to create an obvious association with Aliens              Paxton is also remembered as one of only two actors  along with Lance Henriksen  to play characters killed by an alien  a Terminator  in The Terminator   and a Predator  in      s Predator                 Despite her sudden fame  Henn decided not to pursue acting  so that she could remain close to her family  She said some people resented her fame and was uncertain whether people liked her for being in Aliens or for herself  Henn became a teacher  she maintains a relationship with Weaver and kept a framed picture of her and Weaver that the actress had given her after filming was complete             

Critical reassessment edit 
Aliens is considered one of the greatest science fiction films ever made      g      as well as being among the best films of the     s      h      and one of the greatest action films of all time      i      The British Film Institute called Aliens one of the    greatest action films  saying   A matriarchal masterpiece of God bothering structural engineering  there s really little that Aliens doesn t get right  from its slow burn exemplification of character and world building through to its jab jab hook pause uppercut series of sustained climaxes  Cameron delivers a masterclass in action direction             
The film is also considered one of the best sequels of all time  and equal to  or better than  Alien      j      According to Slant Magazine  it exceeded Alien in every way             In       Den of Geek called it the best blockbuster sequel ever made  and remarkable even as a standalone film             In       the website ranked it the second best film in the series  behind Alien                In       Empire called it the greatest movie sequel ever               Empire also listed Aliens as the   th best film ever made on the magazine s      Greatest Movies Of All Time  list  its readers ranked it the   th best                            The film is listed in the book      Movies You Must See Before You Die               Aliens has a     approval rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes from     reviews  with an average rating of         Its critical consensus reads   While Alien was a marvel of slow building  atmospheric tension  Aliens packs a much more visceral punch  and features a typically strong performance from Sigourney Weaver                The film has a score of    out of     on Metacritic based on    critics  indicating  universal acclaim               
The Ellen Ripley character has also been recognized  the American Film Institute ranked her the eighth most heroic character on its          Years              Heroes and Villains list               and she was ninth on Empire     s           Greatest Movie Characters  list               Despite her character s popularity  the casting of Jenette Goldstein  a Jewish actress of Russian  Moroccan  and Brazilian descent  as the Hispanic Vasquez has been considered odd  Goldstein has said she considers herself unrecognizable as Vasquez on film  but a muscular actress was required  and the filmmakers could not find anyone else with her physique              

Franchise edit 
Main article  Alien franchise
Aliens      success resulted in immediate discussion of a sequel              Alien   was released in       after a tumultuous development involving several writers and directors  Cameron did not return                                         The film was financially successful  but  generally panned  by critics  and its director  David Fincher  disowned it after the release  citing studio interference               The film was also derided by fans because it killed the Hicks and Newt characters off screen  Biehn called it one of his greatest disappointments and refused permission for the use of his likeness in Alien                             Regarding the treatment of his characters  Cameron said 

I thought  the decision to eliminate Newt  Hicks  and Bishop  was dumb          I thought it was a huge slap in the face to the fans          I think it was a big mistake  Certainly  had we been involved we would not have done that  because we felt we earned something with the audience for those characters                          
An early script for Alien    by William Gibson  was adapted as a      audio drama  focusing on Hicks as the protagonist  with Biehn and Henriksen voicing their respective roles                            A five hour      audio drama  River of Pain  takes place between Alien and Aliens and covers the early days of the LV     colony and its downfall to the aliens  Actors returning to voice their characters included William Hope  Mac MacDonald  Stuart Milligan  and Alibe Parsons              A third sequel  Alien Resurrection  was released in                    Instead of a fourth sequel  Fox began development of a prequel crossover film  Alien vs  Predator         pitting the series  aliens against the titular alien race of its science fiction property  Predator                            the film was poorly received                            It was followed by a sequel  Aliens vs  Predator  Requiem         the least financially successful and worst reviewed film in either franchise              
Ridley Scott returned to the series for Prometheus         a prequel to Alien  and its sequel  Alien  Covenant                      A fourth Alien sequel was in development by       but was canceled by the Walt Disney Company following its acquisition of   th Century Fox                            A stand alone film in the Alien franchise  Alien  Romulus  was released on August           it is set between the events of Alien and Aliens
