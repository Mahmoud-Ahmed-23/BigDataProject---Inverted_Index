DALL E  DALL E    and DALL E    stylised DALL E  are text to image models developed by OpenAI using deep learning methodologies to generate digital images from natural language descriptions known as prompts 
The first version of DALL E was announced in January       In the following year  its successor DALL E   was released  DALL E   was released natively into ChatGPT for ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Enterprise customers in October                  with availability via OpenAI s API            and  Labs  platform provided in early November             Microsoft implemented the model in Bing s Image Creator tool and plans to implement it into their Designer app             With Bing s Image Creator tool  Microsoft Copilot runs on DALL E              


History and background edit 
DALL E was revealed by OpenAI in a blog post on   January       and uses a version of GPT              modified to generate images 
On   April       OpenAI announced DALL E    a successor designed to generate more realistic images at higher resolutions that  can combine concepts  attributes  and styles              On    July       DALL E   entered into a beta phase with invitations sent to   million waitlisted individuals             users could generate a certain number of images for free every month and may purchase more             Access had previously been restricted to pre selected users for a research preview due to concerns about ethics and safety                          On    September       DALL E   was opened to everyone and the waitlist requirement was removed              In September       OpenAI announced their latest image model  DALL E    capable of understanding  significantly more nuance and detail  than previous iterations              In early November       OpenAI released DALL E   as an API  allowing developers to integrate the model into their own applications  Microsoft unveiled their implementation of DALL E   in their Designer app and Image Creator tool included in Bing and Microsoft Edge              The API operates on a cost per image basis  with prices varying depending on image resolution  Volume discounts are available to companies working with OpenAI s enterprise team             
The software s name is a portmanteau of the names of animated robot Pixar character WALL E and the Spanish surrealist artist Salvador Dal                         
In February       OpenAI began adding watermarks to DALL E generated images  containing metadata in the C PA  Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity  standard promoted by the Content Authenticity Initiative             

Technology edit 
The first generative pre trained transformer  GPT  model was initially developed by OpenAI in                   using a Transformer architecture  The first iteration  GPT                was scaled up to produce GPT   in                   in       it was scaled up again to produce GPT    with     billion parameters                                    

DALL E edit 
DALL E has three components  a discrete VAE  an autoregressive decoder only Transformer     billion parameters  similar to GPT    and a CLIP pair of image encoder and text encoder             
The discrete VAE can convert an image to a sequence of tokens  and conversely  convert a sequence of tokens back to an image  This is necessary as the Transformer does not directly process image data             
The input to the Transformer model is a sequence of tokenised image caption followed by tokenised image patches  The image caption is in English  tokenised by byte pair encoding  vocabulary size         and can be up to     tokens long  Each image is a         RGB image  divided into       patches of     each  Each patch is then converted by a discrete variational autoencoder to a token  vocabulary size                   
DALL E was developed and announced to the public in conjunction with CLIP  Contrastive Language Image Pre training               CLIP is a separate model based on contrastive learning that was trained on     million pairs of images with text captions scraped from the Internet  Its role is to  understand and rank  DALL E s output by predicting which caption from a list of        captions randomly selected from the dataset  of which one was the correct answer  is most appropriate for an image             
A trained CLIP pair is used to filter a larger initial list of images generated by DALL E to select the image that is closest to the text prompt             

DALL E   edit 
DALL E   uses     billion parameters  a smaller number than its predecessor              Instead of an autoregressive Transformer  DALL E   uses a diffusion model conditioned on CLIP image embeddings  which  during inference  are generated from CLIP text embeddings by a prior model              This is the same architecture as that of Stable Diffusion  released a few months later 

DALL E   edit 
While a technical report was written for DALL E    it does not include training or implementation details of the model  instead focusing on the improved prompt following capabilities developed for DALL E               

Capabilities edit 
DALL E can generate imagery in multiple styles  including photorealistic imagery  paintings  and emoji             It can  manipulate and rearrange  objects in its images             and can correctly place design elements in novel compositions without explicit instruction  Thom Dunn writing for BoingBoing remarked that  For example  when asked to draw a daikon radish blowing its nose  sipping a latte  or riding a unicycle  DALL E often draws the handkerchief  hands  and feet in plausible locations               DALL E showed the ability to  fill in the blanks  to infer appropriate details without specific prompts  such as adding Christmas imagery to prompts commonly associated with the celebration              and appropriately placed shadows to images that did not mention them              Furthermore  DALL E exhibits a broad understanding of visual and design trends      citation needed     
DALL E can produce images for a wide variety of arbitrary descriptions from various viewpoints             with only rare failures              Mark Riedl  an associate professor at the Georgia Tech School of Interactive Computing  found that DALL E could blend concepts  described as a key element of human creativity                          
Its visual reasoning ability is sufficient to solve Raven s Matrices  visual tests often administered to humans to measure intelligence

DALL E   follows complex prompts with more accuracy and detail than its predecessors  and is able to generate more coherent and accurate text                          DALL E   is integrated into ChatGPT Plus             

Image modification edit 
Two  variations  of Girl With a Pearl Earring generated with DALL E  
Given an existing image  DALL E   and DALL E   can produce  variations  of the image as individual outputs based on the original  as well as edit the image to modify or expand upon it  The  inpainting  and  outpainting  abilities of these models use context from an image to fill in missing areas using a medium consistent with the original  following a given prompt 
For example  this can be used to insert a new subject into an image  or expand an image beyond its original borders              According to OpenAI   Outpainting takes into account the image s existing visual elements   including shadows  reflections  and textures   to maintain the context of the original image              

Technical limitations edit 
DALL E   s language understanding has limits  It is sometimes unable to distinguish  A yellow book and a red vase  from  A red book and a yellow vase  or  A panda making latte art  from  Latte art of a panda               It generates images of an astronaut riding a horse when presented with the prompt  a horse riding an astronaut               It also fails to generate the correct images in a variety of circumstances  Requesting more than three objects  negation  numbers  and connected sentences may result in mistakes  and object features may appear on the wrong object              Additional limitations include handling text   which  even with legible lettering  almost invariably results in dream like gibberish   and its limited capacity to address scientific information  such as astronomy or medical imagery

Ethical concerns edit 
DALL E   s reliance on public datasets influences its results and leads to algorithmic bias in some cases  such as generating higher numbers of men than women for requests that do not mention gender              DALL E   s training data was filtered to remove violent and sexual imagery  but this was found to increase bias in some cases such as reducing the frequency of women being generated              OpenAI hypothesise that this may be because women were more likely to be sexualised in training data which caused the filter to influence results              In September       OpenAI confirmed to The Verge that DALL E invisibly inserts phrases into user prompts to address bias in results  for instance   black man  and  Asian woman  are inserted into prompts that do not specify gender or race              OpenAI claims to address concerns for potential  racy content    containing nudity or sexual content generation  with DALL E   through input output filters  blocklists  ChatGPT refusals  and model level interventions              However  DALL E   continues to disproportionally represent people as White  female  and youthful  Users are able to somewhat remedy this through more specific prompts for image generation 
A concern about DALL E   and similar image generation models is that they could be used to propagate deepfakes and other forms of misinformation                          As an attempt to mitigate this  the software rejects prompts involving public figures and uploads containing human faces              Prompts containing potentially objectionable content are blocked  and uploaded images are analysed to detect offensive material              A disadvantage of prompt based filtering is that it is easy to bypass using alternative phrases that result in a similar output  For example  the word  blood  is filtered  but  ketchup  and  red liquid  are not                         
Another concern about DALL E   and similar models is that they could cause technological unemployment for artists  photographers  and graphic designers due to their accuracy and popularity                          DALL E   is designed to block users from generating art in the style of currently living artists              While OpenAI states that images produced using these models do not require permission to reprint  sell  or merchandise              legal concerns have been raised regarding who owns those images                         
In      Microsoft pitched the United States Department of Defense to use DALL E models to train battlefield management systems              In January      OpenAI removed its blanket ban on military and warfare use from its usage policies             

Reception edit

Most coverage of DALL E focuses on a small subset of  surreal              or  quirky              outputs  DALL E s output for  an illustration of a baby daikon radish in a tutu walking a dog  was mentioned in pieces from Input              NBC              Nature              and other publications                                     Its output for  an armchair in the shape of an avocado  was also widely covered                         
ExtremeTech stated  you can ask DALL E for a picture of a phone or vacuum cleaner from a specified period of time  and it understands how those objects have changed               Engadget also noted its unusual capacity for  understanding how telephones and other objects change over time              
According to MIT Technology Review  one of OpenAI s objectives was to  give language models a better grasp of the everyday concepts that humans use to make sense of things              
Wall Street investors have had a positive reception of DALL E    with some firms thinking it could represent a turning point for a future multi trillion dollar industry  By mid       OpenAI had already received over    billion in funding from Microsoft and Khosla Ventures                                      and in January       following the launch of DALL E   and ChatGPT  received an additional     billion in funding from Microsoft             
Japan s anime community has had a negative reaction to DALL E   and similar models                                      Two arguments are typically presented by artists against the software  The first is that AI art is not art because it is not created by a human with intent   The juxtaposition of AI generated images with their own work is degrading and undermines the time and skill that goes into their art  AI driven image generation tools have been heavily criticized by artists because they are trained on human made art scraped from the web              The second is the trouble with copyright law and data text to image models are trained on  OpenAI has not released information about what dataset s  were used to train DALL E    inciting concern from some that the work of artists has been used for training without permission  Copyright laws surrounding these topics are inconclusive at the moment            
After integrating DALL E   into Bing Chat and ChatGPT  Microsoft and OpenAI faced criticism for excessive content filtering  with critics saying DALL E had been  lobotomized               The flagging of images generated by prompts such as  man breaks server rack with sledgehammer  was cited as evidence  Over the first days of its launch  filtering was reportedly increased to the point where images generated by some of Bing s own suggested prompts were being blocked                          TechRadar argued that leaning too heavily on the side of caution could limit DALL E s value as a creative tool             

Open source implementations edit 
Since OpenAI has not released source code for any of the three models  there have been several attempts to create open source models offering similar capabilities                          Released in      on Hugging Face s Spaces platform  Craiyon  formerly DALL E Mini until a name change was requested by OpenAI in June       is an AI model based on the original DALL E that was trained on unfiltered data from the Internet  It attracted substantial media attention in mid       after its release due to its capacity for producing humorous imagery                                      Another example of an open source text to image model is Stable Diffusion by Stability AI
