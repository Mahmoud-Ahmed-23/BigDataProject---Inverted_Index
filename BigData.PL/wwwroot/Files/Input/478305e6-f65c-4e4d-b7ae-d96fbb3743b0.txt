							Amr Moussa has said that an alternative constitution was handed out to members of the Constituent Assembly during a meeting 
He made the statements during a televised interview on Tuesday night  Yara Khalaf  a media and public relations advisor for Moussa said  this a verified piece of information  
 A document was proposed to the members of the assembly and it was signed by Al Gheriany  assembly chairman    Khalaf said 
Khalaf said that the members of the assembly asked for the names of the people who wrote the document but were informed because the writers want to stay anonymous  All they were told is that there are three authors and one is an assembly member  Khalaf said that while the members preferring a civil state rejected the document  parts of it were included in the constitution  currently being drafted by the Islamist dominated assembly 
Khalaf says that these documents  prepared by what she described as  secret committees   started surfacing this week because some television media were prevented from accessing the assembly during last week 
Amr Moussa said on Tuesday night that there is upheaval in Egypt because of the disagreements taking place inside the assembly  as well as the withdrawal of some members  Moussa added that there is a need for a balanced constitution that satisfies all sectors of society 
The draft constitution has already been rejected by more than    civil rights organisations as well as the Ministry of Defence 
Earlier this week     members of the assembly submitted a list of demands to Al Gheriany and withdrew  Their withdrawal came a few days after the withdrawal of church representatives
