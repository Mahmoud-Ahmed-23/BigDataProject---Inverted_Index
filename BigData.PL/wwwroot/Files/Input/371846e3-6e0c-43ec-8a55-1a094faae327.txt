Cognitive science approach
A  second wave  connectionist  ANN  model with a hidden layer
Connectionism is an approach to the study of human mental processes and cognition that utilizes mathematical models known as connectionist networks or artificial neural networks            
Connectionism has had many  waves  since its beginnings  The first wave appeared      with Warren Sturgis McCulloch and Walter Pitts both focusing on comprehending neural circuitry through a formal and mathematical approach             and Frank Rosenblatt who published the      paper  The Perceptron  A Probabilistic Model For Information Storage and Organization in the Brain  in Psychological Review  while working at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory            
The first wave ended with the      book about the limitations of the original perceptron idea  written by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert  which contributed to discouraging major funding agencies in the US from investing in connectionist research             With a few noteworthy deviations  most connectionist research entered a period of inactivity until the mid     s  The term connectionist model was reintroduced in a      paper in the journal Cognitive Science by Jerome Feldman and Dana Ballard 
The second wave blossomed in the late     s  following a      book about Parallel Distributed Processing by James L  McClelland  David E  Rumelhart et al   which introduced a couple of improvements to the simple perceptron idea  such as intermediate processors  now known as  hidden layers   alongside input and output units  and used a sigmoid activation function instead of the old  all or nothing  function  Their work built upon that of John Hopfield  who was a key figure investigating the mathematical characteristics of sigmoid activation functions             From the late     s to the mid     s  connectionism took on an almost revolutionary tone when Schneider             Terence Horgan and Tienson posed the question of whether connectionism represented a fundamental shift in psychology and so called  good old fashioned AI   or GOFAI             Some advantages of the second wave connectionist approach included its applicability to a broad array of functions  structural approximation to biological neurons  low requirements for innate structure  and capacity for graceful degradation             Its disadvantages included the difficulty in deciphering how ANNs process information or account for the compositionality of mental representations  and a resultant difficulty explaining phenomena at a higher level            
The current  third  wave has been marked by advances in deep learning  which have made possible the creation of large language models             The success of deep learning networks in the past decade has greatly increased the popularity of this approach  but the complexity and scale of such networks has brought with them increased interpretability problems            


Basic principle edit 
The central connectionist principle is that mental phenomena can be described by interconnected networks of simple and often uniform units  The form of the connections and the units can vary from model to model  For example  units in the network could represent neurons and the connections could represent synapses  as in the human brain  This principle has been seen as an alternative to GOFAI and the classical theories of mind based on symbolic computation  but the extent to which the two approaches are compatible has been the subject of much debate since their inception            

Activation function edit 
Main article  Activation function
Internal states of any network change over time due to neurons sending a signal to a succeeding layer of neurons in the case of a feedforward network  or to a previous layer in the case of a recurrent network  Discovery of non linear activation functions has enabled the second wave of connectionism 

Memory and learning edit 
Main articles  Artificial neural networks and Deep learning
Neural networks follow two basic principles 

Any mental state can be described as a n dimensional vector of numeric activation values over neural units in a network 
Memory and learning are created by modifying the  weights  of the connections between neural units  generally represented as an n m matrix  The weights are adjusted according to some learning rule or algorithm  such as Hebbian learning            
Most of the variety among the models comes from 

Interpretation of units  Units can be interpreted as neurons or groups of neurons 
Definition of activation  Activation can be defined in a variety of ways  For example  in a Boltzmann machine  the activation is interpreted as the probability of generating an action potential spike  and is determined via a logistic function on the sum of the inputs to a unit 
Learning algorithm  Different networks modify their connections differently  In general  any mathematically defined change in connection weights over time is referred to as the  learning algorithm  
Biological realism edit 
Connectionist work in general does not need to be biologically realistic                                                                                      One area where connectionist models are thought to be biologically implausible is with respect to error propagation networks that are needed to support learning                          but error propagation can explain some of the biologically generated electrical activity seen at the scalp in event related potentials such as the N    and P                 and this provides some biological support for one of the key assumptions of connectionist learning procedures  Many recurrent connectionist models also incorporate dynamical systems theory  Many researchers  such as the connectionist Paul Smolensky  have argued that connectionist models will evolve toward fully continuous  high dimensional  non linear  dynamic systems approaches 

Precursors edit 
Precursors of the connectionist principles can be traced to early work in psychology  such as that of William James              Psychological theories based on knowledge about the human brain were fashionable in the late   th century   As early as       the neurologist John Hughlings Jackson argued for multi level  distributed systems  Following from this lead  Herbert Spencer s Principles of Psychology   rd edition         and Sigmund Freud s Project for a Scientific Psychology  composed       propounded connectionist or proto connectionist theories  These tended to be speculative theories  But by the early   th century  Edward Thorndike was writing about human  learning that posited a connectionist type network             
Hopfield networks had precursors in the Ising model due to Wilhelm Lenz        and Ernst Ising         though the Ising model conceived by them did not involve time  Monte Carlo simulations of Ising model required the advent of computers in the     s             

The first wave edit 
The first wave begun in      with Warren Sturgis McCulloch and Walter Pitts both focusing on comprehending neural circuitry through a formal and mathematical approach   McCulloch and Pitts showed how neural systems could implement first order logic  Their classic paper  A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity         is important in this development here  They were influenced by the work of Nicolas Rashevsky in the     s and symbolic logic in the style of Principia Mathematica                        
Hebb contributed greatly to speculations about neural functioning  and proposed a learning principle  Hebbian learning  Lashley argued for distributed representations as a result of his failure to find anything like a localized engram in years of lesion experiments  Friedrich Hayek independently conceived the model  first in a brief unpublished manuscript in                               then expanded into a book in                  
The Perceptron machines were proposed and built by Frank Rosenblatt  who published the      paper  The Perceptron  A Probabilistic Model For Information Storage and Organization in the Brain  in Psychological Review  while working at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory  He cited Hebb  Hayek  Uttley  and Ashby as main influences 
Another form of connectionist model was the relational network framework developed by the linguist Sydney Lamb in the     s 
The research group led by Widrow empirically searched for methods to train two layered ADALINE networks  MADALINE   with limited success                         
A method to train multilayered perceptrons with arbitrary levels of trainable weights was published by Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko and Valentin Lapa in       called the Group Method of Data Handling  This method employs incremental layer by layer training based on regression analysis  where useless units in hidden layers are pruned with the help of a validation set                                     
The first multilayered perceptrons trained by stochastic gradient descent             was published in      by Shun ichi Amari              In computer experiments conducted by Amari s student Saito  a five layer MLP with two modifiable layers learned useful internal representations to classify non linearily separable pattern classes             
In       Shun ichi Amari produced an early example of self organizing network             

The neural network winter edit 
There was some conflict among artificial intelligence researchers as to what neural networks are useful for  Around late     s  there was a widespread lull in research and publications on neural networks   the neural network winter   which lasted through the     s  during which the field of artificial intelligence turned towards symbolic methods  The publication of Perceptrons        is typically regarded as a catalyst of this event                         

The second wave edit 
The second wave begun in the early     s  Some key publications included  John Hopfield                    which popularized Hopfield networks  the      paper that popularized backpropagation              and the      two volume book about the Parallel Distributed Processing  PDP  by James L  McClelland  David E  Rumelhart et al   which has introduced a couple of improvements to the simple perceptron idea  such as intermediate processors  known as  hidden layers  now  alongside input and output units and using sigmoid activation function instead of the old  all or nothing  function 
Hopfield approached the field from the perspective of statistical mechanics  providing some early forms of mathematical rigor that increased the perceived respectability of the field             Another important series of publications proved that neural networks are universal function approximators  which also provided some mathematical respectability             
Some early popular demonstration projects appeared during this time  NETtalk        learned to pronounce written English  It achieved popular success  appearing on the Today show              TD Gammon        reached top human level in backgammon             

Connectionism vs  computationalism debate edit 
As connectionism became increasingly popular in the late     s  some researchers  including Jerry Fodor  Steven Pinker and others  reacted against it   They argued that connectionism  as then developing  threatened to obliterate what they saw as the progress being made in the fields of cognitive science and psychology by the classical approach of computationalism  Computationalism is a specific form of cognitivism that argues that mental activity is computational  that is  that the mind operates by performing purely formal operations on symbols  like a Turing machine   Some researchers argued that the trend in connectionism represented a reversion toward associationism and the abandonment of the idea of a language of thought  something they saw as mistaken  In contrast  those very tendencies made connectionism attractive for other researchers 
Connectionism and computationalism need not be at odds  but the debate in the late     s and early     s led to opposition between the two approaches   Throughout the debate  some researchers have argued that connectionism and computationalism are fully compatible  though full consensus on this issue has not been reached   Differences between the two approaches include the following 

Computationalists posit symbolic models that are structurally similar to underlying brain structure  whereas connectionists engage in  low level  modeling  trying to ensure that their models resemble neurological structures 
Computationalists in general focus on the structure of explicit symbols  mental models  and syntactical rules for their internal manipulation  whereas connectionists focus on learning from environmental stimuli and storing this information in a form of connections between neurons 
Computationalists believe that internal mental activity consists of manipulation of explicit symbols  whereas connectionists believe that the manipulation of explicit symbols provides a poor model of mental activity 
Computationalists often posit domain specific symbolic sub systems designed to support learning in specific areas of cognition  e g   language  intentionality  number   whereas connectionists posit one or a small set of very general learning mechanisms 
Despite these differences  some theorists have proposed that the connectionist architecture is simply the manner in which organic brains happen to implement the symbol manipulation system  This is logically possible  as it is well known that connectionist models can implement symbol manipulation systems of the kind used in computationalist models              as indeed they must be able if they are to explain the human ability to perform symbol manipulation tasks  Several cognitive models combining both symbol manipulative and connectionist architectures have been proposed  Among them are Paul Smolensky s Integrated Connectionist Symbolic Cognitive Architecture  ICS                          and Ron Sun s CLARION  cognitive architecture    But the debate rests on whether this symbol manipulation forms the foundation of cognition in general  so this is not a potential vindication of computationalism  Nonetheless  computational descriptions may be helpful high level descriptions of cognition of logic  for example 
The debate was largely centred on logical arguments about whether connectionist networks could produce the syntactic structure observed in this sort of reasoning  This was later achieved although using fast variable binding abilities outside of those standardly assumed in connectionist models                         
Part of the appeal of computational descriptions is that they are relatively easy to interpret  and thus may be seen as contributing to our understanding of particular mental processes  whereas connectionist models are in general more opaque  to the extent that they may be describable only in very general terms  such as specifying the learning algorithm  the number of units  etc    or in unhelpfully low level terms  In this sense  connectionist models may instantiate  and thereby provide evidence for  a broad theory of cognition  i e   connectionism   without representing a helpful theory of the particular process that is being modelled  In this sense  the debate might be considered as to some extent reflecting a mere difference in the level of analysis in which particular theories are framed  Some researchers suggest that the analysis gap is the consequence of connectionist mechanisms giving rise to emergent phenomena that may be describable in computational terms             
In the     s  the popularity of dynamical systems in philosophy of mind have added a new perspective on the debate                          some authors     which       now argue that any split between connectionism and computationalism is more conclusively characterized as a split between computationalism and dynamical systems 
In       Alex Graves and others from DeepMind published a series of papers describing a novel Deep Neural Network structure called the Neural Turing Machine             able to read symbols on a tape and store symbols in memory  Relational Networks  another Deep Network module published by DeepMind  are able to create object like representations and manipulate them to answer complex questions  Relational Networks and Neural Turing Machines are further evidence that connectionism and computationalism need not be at odds 

Symbolism vs  connectionism debate edit 
Smolensky s Subsymbolic Paradigm                         has to meet the Fodor Pylyshyn challenge                                                 formulated by classical symbol theory for a convincing theory of cognition in modern connectionism  In order to be an adequate alternative theory of cognition  Smolensky s Subsymbolic Paradigm would have to explain the existence of systematicity or systematic relations in language cognition without the assumption that cognitive processes are causally sensitive to the classical constituent structure of mental representations  The subsymbolic paradigm  or connectionism in general  would thus have to explain the existence of systematicity and compositionality without relying on the mere implementation of a classical cognitive architecture  This challenge implies a dilemma  If the Subsymbolic Paradigm could contribute nothing to the systematicity and compositionality of mental representations  it would be insufficient as a basis for an alternative theory of cognition  However  if the Subsymbolic Paradigm s contribution to systematicity requires mental processes grounded in the classical constituent structure of mental representations  the theory of cognition it develops would be  at best  an implementation architecture of the classical model of symbol theory and thus not a genuine alternative  connectionist  theory of cognition              The classical model of symbolism is characterized by     a combinatorial syntax and semantics of mental representations and     mental operations as structure sensitive processes  based on the fundamental principle of syntactic and semantic constituent structure of mental representations as used in Fodor s  Language of Thought  LOT                            This can be used to explain the following closely related properties of human cognition  namely its     productivity      systematicity      compositionality  and     inferential coherence             
This challenge has been met in modern connectionism  for example  not only by Smolensky s  Integrated Connectionist Symbolic  ICS  Cognitive Architecture                           but also by Werning and Maye s  Oscillatory Networks                                       An overview of this is given for example by Bechtel  amp  Abrahamsen              Marcus             and Maurer             
Recently  Heng Zhang and his colleagues have demonstrated that mainstream knowledge representation formalisms are  in fact  recursively isomorphic  provided they possess equivalent expressive power              This finding implies that there is no fundamental distinction between using symbolic or connectionist knowledge representation formalisms for the realization of artificial general intelligence  AGI   Moreover  the existence of recursive isomorphisms suggests that different technical approaches can draw insights from one another
