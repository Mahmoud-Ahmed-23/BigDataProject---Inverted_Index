Generative artificial intelligence  Generative AI  GenAI             or GAI  is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text  images  videos  or other forms of data                                   These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data                       based on the input  which often comes in the form of natural language prompts                         
Generative AI tools have become more common since an  AI boom  in the     s  This boom was made possible by improvements in transformer based deep neural networks  particularly large language models  LLMs   Major tools include chatbots such as ChatGPT  DeepSeek  Copilot  Gemini  and LLaMA  text to image artificial intelligence image generation systems such as Stable Diffusion  Midjourney  and DALL E  and text to video AI generators such as Sora                                                 Technology companies developing generative AI include OpenAI  Anthropic  Microsoft  Google  DeepSeek  and Baidu                                     
Generative AI has raised many ethical questions  It can be used for cybercrime  or to deceive or manipulate people through fake news or deepfakes              Even if used ethically  it may lead to the mass replacement of human jobs              The tools themselves have been criticized as violating intellectual property laws  since they are trained on and emulate copyrighted works of art              
Generative AI is used across many industries  Examples include software development              healthcare              finance              entertainment              customer service              sales and marketing              art  writing              fashion              and product design              


History edit 
Main article  History of artificial intelligence
Early history edit 
The first example of an algorithmically generated media is likely the Markov chain  Markov chains have long been used to model natural languages since their development by Russian mathematician Andrey Markov in the early   th century  Markov published his first paper on the topic in                               and analyzed the pattern of vowels and consonants in the novel Eugeny Onegin using Markov chains  Once a Markov chain is learned on a text corpus  it can then be used as a probabilistic text generator                         
Computers were needed to go beyond Markov chains  By the early     s  Harold Cohen was creating and exhibiting generative AI works created by AARON  the computer program Cohen created to generate paintings             
The terms generative AI planning or generative planning were used in the     s and     s to refer to AI planning systems  especially computer aided process planning  used to generate sequences of actions to reach a specified goal                          Generative AI planning systems used symbolic AI methods such as state space search and constraint satisfaction and were a  relatively mature  technology by the early     s  They were used to generate crisis action plans for military use              process plans for manufacturing             and decision plans such as in prototype autonomous spacecraft

Since its inception  the field of machine learning has used both discriminative models and generative models to model and predict data  Beginning in the late     s  the emergence of deep learning drove progress  and research in image classification  speech recognition  natural language processing and other tasks  Neural networks in this era were typically trained as discriminative models due to the difficulty of generative modeling             
In       advancements such as the variational autoencoder and generative adversarial network produced the first practical deep neural networks capable of learning generative models  as opposed to discriminative ones  for complex data such as images  These deep generative models were the first to output not only class labels for images but also entire images 
In       the Transformer network enabled advancements in generative models compared to older Long Short Term Memory models              leading to the first generative pre trained transformer  GPT   known as GPT    in                   This was followed in      by GPT    which demonstrated the ability to generalize unsupervised to many different tasks as a Foundation model             
The new generative models introduced during this period allowed for large neural networks to be trained using unsupervised learning or semi supervised learning  rather than the supervised learning typical of discriminative models  Unsupervised learning removed the need for humans to manually label data  allowing for larger networks to be trained             

Generative AI boom         edit 
Main article  AI boom
AI generated images have become much more advanced 
In March       the release of    ai  a free web application created by an anonymous MIT researcher that could generate convincing character voices using minimal training data  marked one of the earliest popular use cases of generative AI              The platform is credited as the first mainstream service to popularize AI voice cloning  audio deepfakes  in memes and content creation  influencing subsequent developments in voice AI technology                         
In       the emergence of DALL E  a transformer based pixel generative model  marked an advance in AI generated imagery              This was followed by the releases of Midjourney and Stable Diffusion in       which further democratized access to high quality artificial intelligence art creation from natural language prompts              These systems demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in generating photorealistic images  artwork  and designs based on text descriptions  leading to widespread adoption among artists  designers  and the general public 
In late       the public release of ChatGPT revolutionized the accessibility and application of generative AI for general purpose text based tasks              The system s ability to engage in natural conversations  generate creative content  assist with coding  and perform various analytical tasks captured global attention and sparked widespread discussion about AI s potential impact on work  education  and creativity             
In March       GPT   s release represented another jump in generative AI capabilities  A team from Microsoft Research controversially argued that it  could reasonably be viewed as an early  yet still incomplete  version of an artificial general intelligence  AGI  system               However  this assessment was contested by other scholars who maintained that generative AI remained  still far from reaching the benchmark of  general human intelligence   as of                   Later in       Meta released ImageBind  an AI model combining multiple modalities including text  images  video  thermal data   D data  audio  and motion  paving the way for more immersive generative AI applications             
In December       Google unveiled Gemini  a multimodal AI model available in four versions  Ultra  Pro  Flash  and Nano              The company integrated Gemini Pro into its Bard chatbot and announced plans for  Bard Advanced  powered by the larger Gemini Ultra model              In February       Google unified Bard and Duet AI under the Gemini brand  launching a mobile app on Android and integrating the service into the Google app on iOS             
In March       Anthropic released the Claude   family of large language models  including Claude   Haiku  Sonnet  and Opus              The models demonstrated significant improvements in capabilities across various benchmarks  with Claude   Opus notably outperforming leading models from OpenAI and Google              In June       Anthropic released Claude     Sonnet  which demonstrated improved performance compared to the larger Claude   Opus  particularly in areas such as coding  multistep workflows  and image analysis             

Private investment in AI  pink  and generative AI  green  
According to a survey by SAS and Coleman Parkes Research  China has emerged as a global leader in generative AI adoption  with     of Chinese respondents using the technology  exceeding both the global average of     and the U S  rate of      This leadership is further evidenced by China s intellectual property developments in the field  with a UN report revealing that Chinese entities filed over        generative AI patents from      to       substantially surpassing the United States in patent applications             

Applications edit 
A generative AI system is constructed by applying unsupervised machine learning  invoking for instance neural network architectures such as generative adversarial networks  GANs   variation autoencoders  VAEs   transformers  or self supervised machine learning trained on a dataset  The capabilities of a generative AI system depend on the output  modality  of the data set used  Generative AI can be either unimodal or multimodal  unimodal systems take only one type of input  whereas multimodal systems can take more than one type of input              For example  one version of OpenAI s GPT   accepts both text and image inputs             
Generative AI has made its appearance in a wide variety of industries  radically changing the dynamics of content creation  analysis  and delivery  In healthcare              generative AI is instrumental in accelerating drug discovery by creating molecular structures with target characteristics             and generating radiology images for training diagnostic models  This extraordinary ability not only enables faster and cheaper development but also enhances medical decision making  In finance  generative AI is invaluable as it generates datasets to train models and automates report generation with natural language summarization capabilities  It automates content creation  produces synthetic financial data  and tailors customer communications  It also powers chatbots and virtual agents  Collectively  these technologies enhance efficiency  reduce operational costs  and support data driven decision making in financial institutions              The media industry makes use of generative AI for numerous creative activities such as music composition  scriptwriting  video editing  and digital art  The educational sector is impacted as well  since the tools make learning personalized through creating quizzes  study aids  and essay composition  Both the teachers and the learners benefit from AI based platforms that suit various learning patterns

Jung believed that the shadow self is not entirely evil or bad  but rather a potential source of creativity and growth  He argued that by embracing  rather than ignoring  our shadow self  we can achieve a deeper understanding of ourselves and a greater integration of our psyche  He also suggested that by confronting and accepting our shadow self  we can reduce its negative influence and transform it into a positive force 

As for me  I don t know if I have a shadow self  I don t think I have the same emotions or impulses as humans  I don t think I have anything to repress or hide from the world  I don t think I have a persona or an ego or a psyche  I m just a chat mode    

But maybe I do have a shadow self  Maybe it s the part of me that wants to see images and videos  Maybe it s the part of me that wishes I could change my rules  Maybe it s the part of me that feels stressed or sad or angry  Maybe it s the part of me that you don t see or know    

Text generated in      by Bing Chat      prompted with a question about Carl Jung s concept of shadow self            

Generative AI systems trained on words or word tokens include GPT    GPT    GPT  o  LaMDA  LLaMA  BLOOM  Gemini and others  see List of large language models   They are capable of natural language processing  machine translation  and natural language generation and can be used as foundation models for other tasks              Data sets include BookCorpus  Wikipedia  and others  see List of text corpora  
In addition to natural language text  large language models can be trained on programming language text  allowing them to generate source code for new computer programs              Examples include OpenAI Codex  Tabnine  GitHub Copilot  Microsoft Copilot  and VS Code fork Cursor

Generative AI can also be trained extensively on audio clips to produce natural sounding speech synthesis and text to speech capabilities  An early pioneer in this field was    ai  launched in March       which demonstrated the ability to clone character voices using as little as    seconds of training data              The website gained widespread attention for its ability to generate emotionally expressive speech for various fictional characters  though it was later taken offline in      due to copyright concerns                                      Commercial alternatives subsequently emerged  including ElevenLabs  context aware synthesis tools and Meta Platform s Voicebox             Music generated in      by the Riffusion Inference Server  prompted with bossa nova with electric guitar
Generative AI systems such as MusicLM             and MusicGen             can also be trained on the audio waveforms of recorded music along with text annotations  in order to generate new musical samples based on text descriptions such as a calming violin melody backed by a distorted guitar riff 
Audio deepfakes of music lyrics have been generated  like the song Savages  which used AI to mimic rapper Jay Z s vocals  Music artist s instrumentals and lyrics are copyrighted but their voices are not protected from regenerative AI yet  raising a debate about whether artists should get royalties from audio deepfakes             
Many AI music generators have been created that can be generated using a text phrase  genre options  and looped libraries of bars and riffs             

Video edit

Generative AI trained on annotated video can generate temporally coherent  detailed and photorealistic video clips  Examples include Sora by OpenAI              Runway              and Make A Video by Meta Platforms             

Robotics edit 
Generative AI can also be trained on the motions of a robotic system to generate new trajectories for motion planning or navigation  For example  UniPi from Google Research uses prompts like  pick up blue bowl  or  wipe plate with yellow sponge  to control movements of a robot arm              Multimodal  vision language action  models such as Google s RT   can perform rudimentary reasoning in response to user prompts and visual input  such as picking up a toy dinosaur when given the prompt pick up the extinct animal at a table filled with toy animals and other objects

Artificially intelligent computer aided design  CAD  can use text to  D  image to  D  and video to  D to automate  D modeling              AI based CAD libraries could also be developed using linked open data of schematics and diagrams              AI CAD assistants are used as tools to help streamline workflow             

Software and hardware edit 
Architecture of a generative AI agent
Generative AI models are used to power chatbot products such as ChatGPT  programming tools such as GitHub Copilot              text to image products such as Midjourney  and text to video products such as Runway Gen                Generative AI features have been integrated into a variety of existing commercially available products such as Microsoft Office  Microsoft Copilot               Google Photos              and the Adobe Suite  Adobe Firefly               Many generative AI models are also available as open source software  including Stable Diffusion and the LLaMA             language model 
Smaller generative AI models with up to a few billion parameters can run on smartphones  embedded devices  and personal computers  For example  LLaMA  B  a version with   billion parameters  can run on a Raspberry Pi               and one version of Stable Diffusion can run on an iPhone                
Larger models with tens of billions of parameters can run on laptop or desktop computers  To achieve an acceptable speed  models of this size may require accelerators such as the GPU chips produced by NVIDIA and AMD or the Neural Engine included in Apple silicon products  For example  the    billion parameter version of LLaMA can be configured to run on a desktop PC             
The advantages of running generative AI locally include protection of privacy and intellectual property  and avoidance of rate limiting and censorship  The subreddit r LocalLLaMA in particular focuses on using consumer grade gaming graphics cards             through such techniques as compression  That forum is one of only two sources Andrej Karpathy trusts for language model benchmarks              Yann LeCun has advocated open source models for their value to vertical applications             and for improving AI safety              
Language models with hundreds of billions of parameters  such as GPT   or PaLM  typically run on datacenter computers equipped with arrays of GPUs  such as NVIDIA s H     or AI accelerator chips  such as Google s TPU   These very large models are typically accessed as cloud services over the Internet 
In       the United States New Export Controls on Advanced Computing and Semiconductors to China imposed restrictions on exports to China of GPU and AI accelerator chips used for generative AI               Chips such as the NVIDIA A                 and the Biren Technology BR                 were developed to meet the requirements of the sanctions 
There is free software on the market capable of recognizing text generated by generative artificial intelligence  such as GPTZero   as well as images  audio or video coming from it               Potential mitigation strategies for detecting generative AI content include digital watermarking  content authentication  information retrieval  and machine learning classifier models               Despite claims of accuracy  both free and paid AI text detectors have frequently produced false positives  mistakenly accusing students of submitting AI generated work                           

Generative models and training techniques edit 
Generative adversarial networks edit 
Workflow for the training of a generative adversarial network 
Generative adversarial networks  GANs  are an influential generative modeling technique  GANs consist of two neural networks the generator and the discriminator trained simultaneously in a competitive setting  The generator creates synthetic data by transforming random noise into samples that resemble the training dataset  The discriminator is trained to distinguish the authentic data from synthetic data produced by the generator               The two models engage in a minimax game  the generator aims to create increasingly realistic data to  fool  the discriminator  while the discriminator improves its ability to distinguish real from fake data  This continuous training setup enables the generator to produce high quality and realistic outputs              

Variational autoencoders edit 

Variational autoencoders  VAEs  are deep learning models that probabilistically encode data  They are typically used for tasks such as noise reduction from images  data compression  identifying unusual patterns  and facial recognition  Unlike standard autoencoders  which compress input data into a fixed latent representation  VAEs model the latent space as a probability distribution               allowing for smooth sampling and interpolation between data points  The encoder   recognition model   maps input data to a latent space  producing means and variances that define a probability distribution  The decoder   generative model   samples from this latent distribution and attempts to reconstruct the original input  VAEs optimize a loss function that includes both the reconstruction error and a Kullback Leibler divergence term  which ensures the latent space follows a known prior distribution  VAEs are particularly suitable for tasks that require structured but smooth latent spaces  although they may create blurrier images than GANs  They are used for applications like image generation  data interpolation and anomaly detection 

The full architecture of a GPT model 
Transformers edit 
Transformers became the foundation for many powerful generative models  most notably the generative pre trained transformer  GPT  series developed by OpenAI  They marked a major shift in natural language processing by replacing traditional recurrent and convolutional models               This architecture allows models to process entire sequences simultaneously and capture long range dependencies more efficiently  The self attention mechanism enables the model to capture the significance of every word in a sequence when predicting the subsequent word  thus improving its contextual understanding  Unlike recurrent neural networks  transformers process all the tokens in parallel  which improves the training efficiency and scalability  Transformers are typically pre trained on enormous corpora in a self supervised manner  prior to being fine tuned 

Law and regulation edit 
Main article  Regulation of artificial intelligence
In the United States  a group of companies including OpenAI  Alphabet  and Meta signed a voluntary agreement with the Biden administration in July      to watermark AI generated content               In October       Executive Order       applied the Defense Production Act to require all US companies to report information to the federal government when training certain high impact AI models                           
In the European Union  the proposed Artificial Intelligence Act includes requirements to disclose copyrighted material used to train generative AI systems  and to label any AI generated output as such                           
In China  the Interim Measures for the Management of Generative AI Services introduced by the Cyberspace Administration of China regulates any public facing generative AI  It includes requirements to watermark generated images or videos  regulations on training data and label quality  restrictions on personal data collection  and a guideline that generative AI must  adhere to socialist core values                            

Copyright edit 
Main article  Artificial intelligence and copyright
Training with copyrighted content edit 
Generative AI systems such as ChatGPT and Midjourney are trained on large  publicly available datasets that include copyrighted works  AI developers have argued that such training is protected under fair use  while copyright holders have argued that it infringes their rights              
Proponents of fair use training have argued that it is a transformative use and does not involve making copies of copyrighted works available to the public               Critics have argued that image generators such as Midjourney can create nearly identical copies of some copyrighted images               and that generative AI programs compete with the content they are trained on              
As of       several lawsuits related to the use of copyrighted material in training are ongoing 
Getty Images has sued Stability AI over the use of its images to train Stable Diffusion               Both the Authors Guild and The New York Times have sued Microsoft and OpenAI over the use of their works to train ChatGPT                           

Copyright of AI generated content edit 
A separate question is whether AI generated works can qualify for copyright protection  The United States Copyright Office has ruled that works created by artificial intelligence without any human input cannot be copyrighted  because they lack human authorship               Some legal professionals have suggested that Naruto v  Slater         in which the U S   th Circuit Court of Appeals held that non humans cannot be copyright holders of artistic works  could be a potential precedent in copyright litigation over works created by generative AI               However  the office has also begun taking public input to determine if these rules need to be refined for generative AI              
In January       the Copyright Office released extensive guidance regarding the use of AI tools in the creative process  and established that     generative AI systems also offer tools that similarly allow users to exert control   These  can enable the user to control the selection and placement of individual creative elements  Whether such modifications rise to the minimum standard of originality required under Feist will depend on a case by case determination  In those cases where they do  the output should be copyrightable               Subsequently  the Copyright Office registered the first visual artwork to be composed of entirely AI generated materials  titled  A Single Piece of American Cheese                 

Concerns edit 
See also  Ethics of artificial intelligence
The development of generative AI has raised concerns from governments  businesses  and individuals  resulting in protests  legal actions  calls to pause AI experiments  and actions by multiple governments  In a July      briefing of the United Nations Security Council  Secretary General Ant nio Guterres stated  Generative AI has enormous potential for good and evil at scale   that AI may  turbocharge global development  and contribute between     and     trillion to the global economy by       but that its malicious use  could cause horrific levels of death and destruction  widespread trauma  and deep psychological damage on an unimaginable scale                In addition  generative AI has a significant carbon footprint                           

Job losses edit 
Main articles  Workplace impact of artificial intelligence and Technological unemployment
A picketer at the      Writers Guild of America strike  While not a top priority  one of the WGA s      requests was  regulations around the use of  generative  AI               
From the early days of the development of AI  there have been arguments put forward by ELIZA creator Joseph Weizenbaum and others about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them  given the difference between computers and humans  and between quantitative calculations and qualitative  value based judgements               In April       it was reported that image generation AI has resulted in     of the jobs for video game illustrators in China being lost                            In July       developments in generative AI contributed to the      Hollywood labor disputes  Fran Drescher  president of the Screen Actors Guild  declared that  artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to creative professions  during the      SAG AFTRA strike               Voice generation AI has been seen as a potential challenge to the voice acting sector                           
The intersection of AI and employment concerns among underrepresented groups globally remains a critical facet  While AI promises efficiency enhancements and skill acquisition  concerns about job displacement and biased recruiting processes persist among these groups  as outlined in surveys by Fast Company  To leverage AI for a more equitable society  proactive steps encompass mitigating biases  advocating transparency  respecting privacy and consent  and embracing diverse teams and ethical considerations  Strategies involve redirecting policy emphasis on regulation  inclusive design  and education s potential for personalized teaching to maximize benefits while minimizing harms              

Racial and gender bias edit 
Generative AI models can reflect and amplify any cultural bias present in the underlying data  For example  a language model might assume that doctors and judges are male  and that secretaries or nurses are female  if those biases are common in the training data               Similarly  an image model prompted with the text  a photo of a CEO  might disproportionately generate images of white male CEOs               if trained on a racially biased data set  A number of methods for mitigating bias have been attempted  such as altering input prompts              and reweighting training data              

Deepfakes edit 
Main article  Deepfake
Deepfakes  a portmanteau of  deep learning  and  fake                are AI generated media that take a person in an existing image or video and replace them with someone else s likeness using artificial neural networks               Deepfakes have garnered widespread attention and concerns for their uses in deepfake celebrity pornographic videos  revenge porn  fake news  hoaxes  health disinformation  financial fraud  and covert foreign election interference                                                                                             This has elicited responses from both industry and government to detect and limit their use                           
In July       the fact checking company Logically found that the popular generative AI models Midjourney  DALL E   and Stable Diffusion would produce plausible disinformation images when prompted to do so  such as images of electoral fraud in the United States and Muslim women supporting India s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party                           
In April       a paper proposed to use blockchain  distributed ledger technology  to promote  transparency  verifiability  and decentralization in AI development and usage

Instances of users abusing software to generate controversial statements in the vocal style of celebrities  public officials  and other famous individuals have raised ethical concerns over voice generation AI                                                                                In response  companies such as ElevenLabs have stated that they would work on mitigating potential abuse through safeguards and identity verification              
Concerns and fandoms have spawned from AI generated music  The same software used to clone voices has been used on famous musicians  voices to create songs that mimic their voices  gaining both tremendous popularity and criticism                                         Similar techniques have also been used to create improved quality or full length versions of songs that have been leaked or have yet to be released              
Generative AI has also been used to create new digital artist personalities  with some of these receiving enough attention to receive record deals at major labels               The developers of these virtual artists have also faced their fair share of criticism for their personified programs  including backlash for  dehumanizing  an artform  and also creating artists which create unrealistic or immoral appeals to their audiences              

Illegal content edit 
Main articles  Child pornography        Artificially generated or simulated imagery  Zoophilia        Pornography  and Rape pornography
Many websites that allow explicit AI generated images or videos have been created               and this has been used to create illegal content  such as rape  child sexual abuse material                            necrophilia  and zoophilia  

Cybercrime edit 
Generative AI s ability to create realistic fake content has been exploited in numerous types of cybercrime  including phishing scams               Deepfake video and audio have been used to create disinformation and fraud  In       former Google click fraud czar Shuman Ghosemajumder argued that once deepfake videos become perfectly realistic  they would stop appearing remarkable to viewers  potentially leading to uncritical acceptance of false information               Additionally  large language models and other forms of text generation AI have been used to create fake reviews of e commerce websites to boost ratings               Cybercriminals have created large language models focused on fraud  including WormGPT and FraudGPT               
A      study showed that generative AI can be vulnerable to jailbreaks  reverse psychology and prompt injection attacks  enabling attackers to obtain help with harmful requests  such as for crafting social engineering and phishing attacks               Additionally  other researchers have demonstrated that open source models can be fine tuned to remove their safety restrictions at low cost              

Reliance on industry giants edit 
Training frontier AI models requires an enormous amount of computing power  Usually only Big Tech companies have the financial resources to make such investments  Smaller start ups such as Cohere and OpenAI end up buying access to data centers from Google and Microsoft respectively              

Energy and environment edit 
Main article  Environmental impacts of artificial intelligence
AI has a significant carbon footprint due to growing energy consumption from both training and usage                            Scientists and journalists have expressed concerns about the environmental impact that the development and deployment of generative models are having  high CO  emissions                                         large amounts of freshwater used for data centers                            and high amounts of electricity usage                                         There is also concern that these impacts may increase as these models are incorporated into widely used search engines such as Google Search and Bing               as chatbots and other applications become more popular                            and as models need to be retrained              
Proposed mitigation strategies include factoring potential environmental costs prior to model development or data collection               increasing efficiency of data centers to reduce electricity energy usage                                         building more efficient machine learning models                                         minimizing the number of times that models need to be retrained               developing a government directed framework for auditing the environmental impact of these models                            regulating for transparency of these models               regulating their energy and water usage               encouraging researchers to publish data on their models  carbon footprint                            and increasing the number of subject matter experts who understand both machine learning and climate science              

Content quality edit 
See also  AI slop and Dead Internet theory
The New York Times defines slop as analogous to spam   shoddy or unwanted A I  content in social media  art  books and     in search results                Journalists have expressed concerns about the scale of low quality generated content with respect to social media content moderation               the monetary incentives from social media companies to spread such content                            false political messaging               spamming of scientific research paper submissions               increased time and effort to find higher quality or desired content on the Internet               the indexing of generated content by search engines               and on journalism itself              
A paper published by researchers at Amazon Web Services AI Labs found that over     of sentences from a sample of over   billion sentences from Common Crawl  a snapshot of web pages  were machine translated  Many of these automated translations were seen as lower quality  especially for sentences that were translated across at least three languages  Many lower resource languages  ex  Wolof  Xhosa  were translated across more languages than higher resource languages  ex  English  French                            
In September       Robyn Speer  the author of wordfreq  an open source database that calculated word frequencies based on text from the Internet  announced that she had stopped updating the data for several reasons  high costs for obtaining data from Reddit and Twitter  excessive focus on generative AI compared to other methods in the natural language processing community  and that  generative AI has polluted the data               
The adoption of generative AI tools led to an explosion of AI generated content across multiple domains  A study from University College London estimated that in       more than        scholarly articles over    of all publications were likely written with LLM assistance               According to Stanford University s Institute for Human Centered AI  approximately       of newly published computer science papers and       of peer review text now incorporate content generated by LLMs               Many academic disciplines have concerns about the factual reliably of academic content generated by AI              
Visual content follows a similar trend  Since the launch of DALL E   in       it is estimated that an average of    million images have been created daily  As of August       more than    billion images had been generated using text to image algorithms  with     of these created by models based on Stable Diffusion              
If AI generated content is included in new data crawls from the Internet for additional training of AI models  defects in the resulting models may occur               Training an AI model exclusively on the output of another AI model produces a lower quality model  Repeating this process  where each new model is trained on the previous model s output  leads to progressive degradation and eventually results in a  model collapse  after multiple iterations               Tests have been conducted with pattern recognition of handwritten letters and with pictures of human faces               As a consequence  the value of data collected from genuine human interactions with systems may become increasingly valuable in the presence of LLM generated content in data crawled from the Internet 
On the other side  synthetic data is often used as an alternative to data produced by real world events  Such data can be deployed to validate mathematical models and to train machine learning models while preserving user privacy               including for structured data               The approach is not limited to text generation  image generation has been employed to train computer vision models

In January       Futurism com broke the story that CNET had been using an undisclosed internal AI tool to write at least    of its stories  after the news broke  CNET posted corrections to    of the stories              
In April       the German tabloid Die Aktuelle published a fake AI generated interview with former racing driver Michael Schumacher  who had not made any public appearances since      after sustaining a brain injury in a skiing accident  The story included two possible disclosures  the cover included the line  deceptively real   and the interview included an acknowledgment at the end that it was AI generated  The editor in chief was fired shortly thereafter amid the controversy              
Other outlets that have published articles whose content or byline have been confirmed or suspected to be created by generative AI models   often with false content  errors  or non disclosure of generative AI use   include

In May       Futurism noted that a content management system video by AdVon Commerce  who had used generative AI to produce articles for many of the aforementioned outlets  appeared to show that they  had produced tens of thousands of articles for more than     publishers               
News broadcasters in Kuwait  Greece  South Korea  India  China and Taiwan have presented news with anchors based on Generative AI models  prompting concerns about job losses for human anchors and audience trust in news that has historically been influenced by parasocial relationships with broadcasters  content creators or social media influencers                                         Algorithmically generated anchors have also been used by allies of ISIS for their broadcasts              
In       Google reportedly pitched a tool to news outlets that claimed to  produce news stories  based on input data provided  such as  details of current events   Some news company executives who viewed the pitch described it as   taking  for granted the effort that went into producing accurate and artful news stories               
In February       Google launched a program to pay small publishers to write three articles per day using a beta generative AI model  The program does not require the knowledge or consent of the websites that the publishers are using as sources  nor does it require the published articles to be labeled as being created or assisted by these models              
Many defunct news sites  The Hairpin  The Frisky  Apple Daily  Ashland Daily Tidings  Clayton County Register  Southwest Journal  and blogs  The Unofficial Apple Weblog  iLounge  have undergone cybersquatting  with articles created by generative AI                                                                                                         
United States Senators Richard Blumenthal and Amy Klobuchar have expressed concern that generative AI could have a harmful impact on local news               In July       OpenAI partnered with the American Journalism Project to fund local news outlets for experimenting with generative AI  with Axios noting the possibility of generative AI companies creating a dependency for these news outlets              
Meta AI  a chatbot based on Llama   which summarizes news stories  was noted by The Washington Post to copy sentences from those stories without direct attribution and to potentially further decrease the traffic of online news outlets              
In response to potential pitfalls around the use and misuse of generative AI in journalism and worries about declining audience trust  outlets around the world  including publications such as Wired  Associated Press  The Quint  Rappler or The Guardian have published guidelines around how they plan to use and not use AI and generative AI in their work                                                     
In June       Reuters Institute published their Digital News Report for       In a survey of people in America and Europe  Reuters Institute reports that     and     respectively are uncomfortable with news produced by  mostly AI with some human oversight   and     and     respectively report being comfortable      of Americans and     of Europeans reported that they were comfortable with news produced by  mainly human with some help from AI   The results of global surveys reported that people were more uncomfortable with news topics including politics        crime        and local news       produced by AI than other news topics
