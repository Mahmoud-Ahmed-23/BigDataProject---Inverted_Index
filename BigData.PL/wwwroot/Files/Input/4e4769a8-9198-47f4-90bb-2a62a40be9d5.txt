Magued Sherif  Managing Director of SODIC  said on Tuesday that the UAE consortium of Aldar Properties and ADQ has requested the acquisition of a majority stake in SODIC  stressing that there is no intention to delist the company from the Egyptian Exchange  EGX   and that its name will remain unchanged 



Last week  SODIC announced that the majority of shareholders agreed to sell their shares 



The company said that after the successful closing of the binding offer of purchase  the consortium will acquire         million shares of SODIC shares at a price of EGP    per share  with the company       s valuation of more than EGP    bn  as the value of the deal reached EGP    bn 



Aldar and ADQ acquisition of the majority of the SODIC s shares will have a major role in supporting the company to continue its investment plan  especially with regard to expansion in several new areas other than the current areas it is working on  according to Sherif 



He further disclosed that the deal reflects the great strength of the Egyptian economy  especially since the consortium has a long term investment plan and possesses high capabilities that will have a role in providing an added value to Egypt s real estate market 



He added that so far  work is underway to complete the procedures for completing the deal through the stock exchange process  which is currently taking place  and explained that a meeting will be held with the nbsp consortium s officials in the coming period to agree on features of the plan for the next period 



Sherif concluded   The acquisition of the majority stake of SODIC by the UAE consortium is a testimony of confidence in the solidity of the Egyptian economy  and the great opportunities it provides for investment  Over and above  it is the largest foreign investment entering the Egyptian real estate sector  and it will certainly be a strong addition to the Egyptian market  because we are talking about a strong  long term investor who intends to expand and invest in Egypt
