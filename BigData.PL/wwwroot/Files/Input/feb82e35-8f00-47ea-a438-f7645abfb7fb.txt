Raymond Kurzweil    k  rzwa l  KURZ wyle  born February           is an American computer scientist  author  entrepreneur  futurist  and inventor  He is involved in fields such as optical character recognition  OCR   text to speech synthesis  speech recognition technology and electronic keyboard instruments  He has written books on health technology  artificial intelligence  AI   transhumanism  the technological singularity  and futurism  Kurzweil is a public advocate for the futurist and transhumanist movements and gives public talks to share his optimistic outlook on life extension technologies and the future of nanotechnology  robotics  and biotechnology 
Kurzweil received the      National Medal of Technology and Innovation  the United States  highest honor in technology  from President Bill Clinton in a White House ceremony  He received the          Lemelson MIT Prize in       He was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in      for the application of technology to improve human machine communication  In      he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame  established by the U S  Patent Office  He has    honorary doctorates and honors from three U S  presidents  The Public Broadcasting Service  PBS  included Kurzweil as one of     revolutionaries who made America  along with other inventors of the past two centuries  Inc  magazine ranked him No    among the  most fascinating  entrepreneurs in the United States and called him  Edison s rightful heir  


Life  inventions  and business career edit 
Early life edit 
Kurzweil grew up in Queens  New York City  He attended NYC Public Education Kingsbury Elementary School PS     He was born to secular Jewish parents who had emigrated from Austria just before the onset of World War II  Through Unitarian Universalism he was exposed to a diversity of religious faiths during his upbringing                        The Unitarian church has a philosophy that there are many paths to the truth  his religious education consisted of studying one religion for six months before moving on to another             His father  Fredric  was a concert pianist  a noted conductor and a music educator  His mother  Hannah  was a visual artist  He is the elder of two children  his sister Enid  an accountant in Santa Barbara  is six years his junior            
Ray Kurzweil decided at age five that he wanted to be an inventor             As a young boy  he had an inventory of parts from various construction toys he had been given and old electronic gadgets he had collected from neighbors  In his youth  Kurzweil was an avid reader of science fiction  At age eight  nine  and ten  he read the entire Tom Swift Jr  series  At age seven or eight  he built a robotic puppet theater and robotic game  He was involved with computers by age     in        when only a dozen computers existed in New York City  and built computing devices and statistical programs for the predecessor of Head Start                        At     Kurzweil wrote a paper detailing his theory of the neocortex             His parents were involved with the arts  and he is quoted in the documentary Transcendent Man            as saying that the household always discussed the future and technology             
Kurzweil attended Martin Van Buren High School  During class  he often held onto his class textbooks to seemingly participate while focusing on his own projects hidden behind the book  His uncle  an engineer at Bell Labs  taught Kurzweil the basics of computer science              In       at     he wrote his first computer program              
Kurzweil created pattern recognition software that analyzed the works of classical composers  then synthesized its own songs in similar styles  In      he was invited to appear on the CBS television program I ve Got a Secret              where he performed a piano piece composed by a computer he had built              Later in the year  he won first prize in the International Science Fair for the invention              his submission to Westinghouse Talent Search of his first computer program alongside several other projects resulted in his being one of the contest s national winners  for which President Lyndon B  Johnson personally congratulated him during a White House ceremony  The experiences impressed upon Kurzweil the belief that nearly any problem could be overcome             

Midlife edit 
While in high school  Kurzweil had corresponded with Marvin Minsky and was invited to visit him at Massachusetts Institute of Technology  which he did  Kurzweil also visited Frank Rosenblatt  a psychologist at Cornell              He attended MIT to study with Minsky  obtaining a B Sc  degree in computer science and literature in       Kurzweil took all the computer programming courses  eight or nine  MIT offered in his first year and a half 
In       during his second year at MIT  Kurzweil started a company that used a computer program to match high school students with colleges  The program  called the Select College Consulting Program  was designed by him and compared thousands of different criteria about each college with questionnaire answers each student applicant submitted  Around that time he sold the company to Harcourt  Brace  amp  World for                    in       plus royalties              In       he founded Kurzweil Computer Products  Inc   and led development of the first omni font optical character recognition system  a computer program capable of recognizing text written in any normal font  Before that time  scanners had been able to read text in only a few fonts  He decided that the technology s best application would be to create a reading machine  which would allow blind people to understand text by having a computer read it to them aloud  But the device required the invention of two enabling technologies the CCD flatbed scanner and the text to speech synthesizer  Development of these technologies was completed at other institutions like Bell Labs  and on January           the finished product was unveiled during a news conference headed by Kurzweil and the leaders of the National Federation of the Blind  Called the Kurzweil Reading Machine  the device was large and covered an entire tabletop  Stevie Wonder heard about the demonstration of this new machine on The Today Show  and later became the user of the first production Kurzweil Reading Machine  beginning a long term association with Kurzweil             
Kurzweil s next major business venture began in       when Kurzweil Computer Products began selling a commercial version of the optical character recognition computer program  LexisNexis was one of the first customers  and bought the program to upload paper legal and news documents to its nascent online databases  He sold Kurzweil Computer Products to Xerox  where it was first known as Xerox Imaging Systems and later as Scansoft  he was a consultant for Xerox until       In       Visioneer  Inc  acquired Scansoft from Xerox to form a new public company with Scansoft as the new company wide name  Scansoft merged with Nuance Communications in      
Kurzweil s next business venture was in electronic music technology  After a      meeting with Stevie Wonder  in which Wonder lamented the divide in capabilities and qualities between electronic synthesizers and traditional musical instruments  Kurzweil was inspired to create a new generation of synthesizers that could duplicate the sounds of real instruments  Kurzweil Music Systems was founded in the same year  and in       the Kurzweil K    was unveiled              The machine could imitate a number of instruments  and according to Kurzweil s press packet  musicians could not tell the difference between the Kurzweil K    on piano mode and a grand piano              though reviewers who actually attempted it questioned that                          The machine s recording and mixing abilities coupled with its ability to imitate different instruments made it possible for a single user to compose and play an entire orchestral piece 
South Korean musical instrument manufacturer Young Chang bought Kurzweil Music Systems in       As with Xerox  Kurzweil remained as a consultant for several years  Hyundai acquired Young Chang in       and in      appointed Kurzweil as Chief Strategy Officer of Kurzweil Music Systems              Concurrent with Kurzweil Music Systems  he created the company Kurzweil Applied Intelligence  KAI  to develop computer speech recognition systems for commercial use  The first product  which debuted in       was an early speech recognition program  KAI was sold to Lernout  amp  Hauspie in                  

Later life edit 
Kurzweil started Kurzweil Educational Systems  KESI  in      to develop new pattern recognition based computer technologies to help people with disabilities such as blindness  dyslexia  and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  ADHD  in school  Products include the Kurzweil      text to speech converter software program  which enables a computer to read electronic and scanned text aloud to blind or visually impaired users  and the Kurzweil      program  a multifaceted electronic learning system that helps with reading  writing  and study skills  Kurzweil sold KESI to Lernout  amp  Hauspie  After the legal and bankruptcy problems of the latter  he and other KESI employees bought back the company  KESI was eventually sold to Cambium Learning Group  Inc

During the     s  Kurzweil founded the Medical Learning Company              In       Kurzweil created a hedge fund called  FatKat   Financial Accelerating Transactions from Kurzweil Adaptive Technologies   which began trading in       He has said that the ultimate aim is to improve the performance of FatKat s A I  investment software program  enhancing its ability to recognize patterns in  currency fluctuations and stock ownership trends               In his      book The Age of Spiritual Machines  Kurzweil predicted that computers would one day be better than humans at making profitable investment decisions  In June       Kurzweil introduced the  Kurzweil National Federation of the Blind Reader   K NFB Reader  a pocket sized device consisting of a digital camera and computer unit  Like the Kurzweil Reading Machine of almost    years before  the K NFB Reader is designed to aid blind people by reading written text aloud  The newer machine is portable and scans text through digital camera images  while the older machine is large and scans text through flatbed scanning 
In December       Google hired Kurzweil in a full time position to  work on new projects involving machine learning and language processing               Google co founder Larry Page personally hired him              Page and Kurzweil agreed on a one sentence job description   to bring natural language understanding to Google               Kurzweil received a Technical Grammy Award on February          specifically for his invention of the Kurzweil K                
Kurzweil has joined the Alcor Life Extension Foundation  a cryonics company  After his death  he has a plan to be perfused with cryoprotectants  vitrified in liquid nitrogen  and stored at an Alcor facility in the hope that future medical technology will be able to revive him             

Personal life edit 
Kurzweil is agnostic about the existence of a soul              Of the possibility of divine intelligence  Kurzweil has said   Does God exist  I would say  Not yet                He married Sonya Rosenwald Kurzweil in                   Sonya is a psychologist in private practice in Newton  Massachusetts  she works with women  children  parents  and families  She holds faculty appointments at Harvard Medical School and William James College in graduate education in psychology  Her research interests and publications are in psychotherapy practice  She also serves as an active overseer at Boston Children s Museum              Ray and Sonya Kurzweil have a son  Ethan  a venture capitalist              and a daughter  Amy  a cartoonist                         

Creative approach edit 
See also  Wait calculation
Kurzweil has said   I realize that most inventions fail not because the R amp D department can t get them to work  but because the timing is wrong         not all of the enabling factors are at play where they are needed  Inventing is a lot like surfing  you have to anticipate and catch the wave at just the right moment                           For the past several decades  Kurzweil s most effective and common approach to doing creative work has been conducted during a lucid dreamlike state immediately preceding his waking state  He claims to have constructed inventions  solved algorithmic  business strategy  organizational  and interpersonal problems  and written speeches in this state             

Books edit 
Kurzweil s first book  The Age of Intelligent Machines  was published in       It discusses the history of computer artificial intelligence  AI  and forecasts future developments  Other AI experts contribute heavily to the book in the form of essays  The Association of American Publishers named it the Most Outstanding Computer Science Book of                  
In       Kurzweil published a book on nutrition  The     Solution for a Healthy Life  Its main idea is that high levels of fat intake are the cause of many health disorders common in the U S   and thus that cutting fat consumption to     of total calories consumed is optimal for most people  In       Kurzweil published The Age of Spiritual Machines  which further elucidates his theories of the future of technology  which stem from his analysis of long term trends in biological and technological evolution  Much emphasis is on the likely course of AI development  along with the future of computer architecture  Kurzweil s next book  Fantastic Voyage  Live Long Enough to Live Forever         returns to human health and nutrition and is co authored by Terry Grossman  a medical doctor and specialist in alternative medicine 
The Singularity Is Near  published in       was made into a movie starring Pauley Perrette  In       Ptolemaic Productions acquired the rights to The Singularity Is Near  The Age of Spiritual Machines  and Fantastic Voyage  including the rights to film Kurzweil s life and ideas for the documentary film Transcendent Man             directed by Barry Ptolemy  Transcend  Nine Steps to Living Well Forever              a follow up to Fantastic Voyage  was released in       Kurzweil s book How to Create a Mind was released in                   In it he describes his Pattern Recognition Theory of Mind  the theory that the neocortex is a hierarchical system of pattern recognizers  and argues that emulating this architecture in machines could lead to artificial superintelligence             
Kurzweil s first novel  Danielle  Chronicles of a Superheroine  follows a girl who uses her intelligence and her friends  help to tackle real world problems  It follows a structure akin to the scientific method  Chapters are organized as year by year episodes from Danielle s childhood and adolescence              The book comes with companion materials  A Chronicle of Ideas and How You Can Be a Danielle  that provide real world context  It was released in                  
Kurzweil s latest book  The Singularity Is Nearer  When We Merge with AI  was published in                  

Films edit 
In       Kurzweil wrote and co produced the film The Singularity Is Near  A True Story About the Future  directed by Anthony Waller and based in part on the book The Singularity Is Near  Part fiction  part nonfiction  the film blends interviews with    big thinkers  such as Marvin Minsky  with a narrative story that illustrates some of Kurzweil s key ideas  including a computer avatar  Ramona  who saves the world from self replicating microscopic robots  An independent  feature length documentary  Transcendent Man  was made about Kurzweil  his life  and his ideas             
In       an independent documentary film  Plug  amp  Pray  premiered at the Seattle International Film Festival  in which Kurzweil and one of his major critics  the late Joseph Weizenbaum  argue about the benefits of eternal life              Independent filmmaker Doug Wolens s feature length documentary film The Singularity        showcases Kurzweil and has been acclaimed as  a large scale achievement in its documentation of futurist and counter futurist ideas  and  the best documentary on the Singularity to date              

Music edit 
Our Lady Peace edit 
On December           Columbia Records released the Canadian alternative rock band Our Lady Peace s album Spiritual Machines  Although not initially so intended  the project evolved into a conceptual interpretation of Kurzweil s      book The Age of Spiritual Machines  The band emailed Kurzweil to ask permission to use the title of his book for their project  Kurzweil s excitement at the prospect prompted them to invite him to record spoken excerpts from his book for the album  As a result  short tracks of spoken dialog by Kurzweil are interspersed among the album s songs  The Kurzweil K    keyboard is also used on the album             

Views edit 
The Law of Accelerating Returns edit 
Main article  The Law of Accelerating Returns
In his      book The Age of Spiritual Machines  Kurzweil proposed  The Law of Accelerating Returns   according to which the rate of change in a wide variety of evolutionary systems  including the growth of technologies  tends to increase exponentially              He further emphasized this issue in his      essay  The Law of Accelerating Returns   which proposes an extension of Moore s law to a wide variety of technologies and argues in favor of John von Neumann s concept of a technological singularity             

Genetics  nanotechnology  and robotics edit 
Kurzweil was working with the Army Science Board in      to develop a rapid response system to deal with the possible abuse of biotechnology  He suggested that a bioterrorist could use the same technologies that empower us to reprogram biology away from cancer and heart disease to reprogram a virus to be more deadly  communicable  and stealthy  But he suggests we have the scientific tools to defend against such an attack  much as we defend against computer software viruses  Kurzweil has testified before Congress on nanotechnology  saying that it has the potential to solve serious global problems such as poverty  disease  and climate change   Nanotech Could Give Global Warming a Big Chill              
In media appearances  Kurzweil has stressed nanotechnology s extreme potential dangers             but argues that  in practice  progress cannot be stopped because that would require a totalitarian system  and any attempt to do so would drive dangerous technologies underground and deprive responsible scientists of the tools needed for defense  He suggests that the proper place of regulation is to ensure that technological progress proceeds safely and quickly but does not deprive the world of profound benefits  He said   To avoid dangers such as unrestrained nanobot replication  we need relinquishment at the right level and to place our highest priority on the continuing advance of defensive technologies  staying ahead of destructive technologies  An overall strategy should include a streamlined regulatory process  a global program of monitoring for unknown or evolving biological pathogens  temporary moratoriums  raising public awareness  international cooperation  software reconnaissance  and fostering values of liberty  tolerance  and respect for knowledge and diversity              

Health and aging edit 
Kurzweil admits that he cared little for his health until age     when he was found to suffer from a glucose intolerance  an early form of type II diabetes  a major risk factor for heart disease   He then found a doctor  Terry Grossman  who shared his unconventional beliefs and helped him to develop an extreme regimen involving hundreds of pills  chemical intravenous treatments  red wine  and various other methods to attempt to extend his lifespan  In       Kurzweil was ingesting      supplements  eight to    glasses of alkaline water and    cups of green tea  every day and drinking several glasses of red wine a week in an effort to  reprogram  his biochemistry              By       he had reduced the number of supplement pills to                  By       Kurzweil further reduced his daily pill regimen to     pills             
Kurzweil asserts that in the future  everyone will live forever              In a      interview  he said that in    years  medical technology could add more than a year to one s remaining life expectancy for each year that passes  and we could then  outrun our own deaths   Among other things  he has supported the SENS Research Foundation s approach to finding a way to repair aging damage  and has encouraged the general public to hasten their research by donating                         

Futurism and transhumanism edit 
Kurzweil s standing as a futurist and transhumanist has led to his involvement in several singularity themed organizations  In       he joined the advisory board of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute              In       he joined the scientific advisory board of the Lifeboat Foundation              On May           Kurzweil was the first speaker at the Singularity Summit at Stanford University in Palo Alto  California              In       he was the keynote speaker at the Research  Innovation  Start up and Employment  RISE  international conference in Seoul  In       Kurzweil  Google  and the NASA Ames Research Center announced the creation of the Singularity University training center for corporate executives and government officials  The university s self described mission is to  assemble  educate and inspire a cadre of leaders who strive to understand and facilitate the development of exponentially advancing technologies and apply  focus and guide these tools to address humanity s grand challenges   Using Vernor Vinge s Singularity concept as a foundation  the university offered its first nine week graduate program to    students in      
Kurzweil views the human body as a system of thousands of  programs  and believes that understanding all their functions could be the key to building truly sentient AI                         

Universal basic income edit 
Kurzweil advocates universal basic income  UBI   arguing that progress in science and technology will lead to an abundance of virtually free resources  enabling every citizen to live without the need to work   We are clearly headed toward a situation where everyone can live very well               According to him  the major hurdle to introducing UBI is not its feasibility  but political will  which is slowly emerging              In a      TED Talk  he predicted that  in the early     s  we ll have universal basic income in the developed world  and worldwide by the end of the     s  You ll be able to live very well on that  The primary concern will be meaning and purpose              

Nuclear weapons edit 
During a September           interview  Kurzweil explained his worries about technology being used for violence  When asked about nuclear armageddon and the Russo Ukrainian War  Kurzweil said   I don t think  nuclear war  is going to happen despite the terrors of that war  It is a possibility but it s unlikely  even with the tensions we ve had with the nuclear power plant that s been taken over  It s very tense but I don t actually see a lot of people worrying that s going to happen  I think we ll avoid that  We had two nuclear bombs go off in         so now we re    years later    we ve never had another one go off through anger    there are other dangers besides nuclear weapons              

Predictions edit 
Past predictions edit 
Kurzweil s first book  The Age of Intelligent Machines  presents his ideas about the future  Written from      to       it was published in       Building on Ithiel de Sola Pool s  Technologies of Freedom          Kurzweil claims to have forecast the dissolution of the Soviet Union due to new technologies such as cellular phones and fax machines disempowering authoritarian governments by removing state control of the flow of information              In the book  Kurzweil also extrapolates trends in improving computer chess software performance  predicting that computers will beat the best human players  by the year                    In May       IBM s Deep Blue computer defeated World Champion Garry Kasparov in a well publicized match             
Kurzweil foresaw the explosive growth in worldwide Internet use that began in the     s  When The Age of Intelligent Machines was published  there were only          million Internet users in the world              and the medium was unreliable  difficult to use  and deficient in content  He also said that the Internet would explode not only in the number of users but in content  eventually granting users access  to international networks of libraries  data bases  and information services   Additionally  Kurzweil claims to have correctly foreseen that the preferred mode of Internet access would be through wireless systems  and estimated that this development would become practical for widespread use in the early   st century  In October       Kurzweil released his report  How My Predictions Are Faring  in PDF format              analyzing the predictions he made in his books The Age of Intelligent Machines  The Age of Spiritual Machines  and The Singularity is Near  Of the     predictions  Kurzweil claimed that     were  entirely correct      were  essentially correct      were  partially correct   and three were  wrong   Combining the  entirely  and  essentially  correct  Kurzweil s claimed accuracy rate comes to     
In Newsweek magazine  Daniel Lyons criticized Kurzweil for some of his incorrect predictions for       such as that the economy would continue to boom  that a U S  company would have a market capitalization of more than         trillion  that a supercomputer would achieve    petaflops  that speech recognition would be in widespread use  and that cars would drive themselves using sensors installed in highways              To the charge that a    petaflop supercomputer had not been produced  Kurzweil responded that he considered Google a giant supercomputer  and that it was indeed capable of    petaflops             
Forbes magazine claimed that Kurzweil s predictions for      were mostly inaccurate  with seven incorrect  four partially correct  and one correct  For example  Kurzweil predicted   The majority of text is created using continuous speech recognition   which was not the case             

Future predictions edit 
In       Kurzweil published a second book  The Age of Spiritual Machines  which explains his futurist ideas in more depth  In it  he says that with radical life extension will come radical life enhancement  He says he is confident that within    years     when       we will have the option to spend some of our time in  D virtual environments that appear just as real as reality  but that they will not yet be able to directly interact with our nervous system  He expounds on his prediction about nanorobotics  claiming that within    years millions of blood cell sized devices  called nanobots  will fight disease inside our bodies and improve our memory and cognitive abilities  Kurzweil also believes a machine will pass the Turing test by       He says that humans will be a hybrid of biological and non biological intelligence that becomes increasingly dominated by its non biological component              In Transcendent Man  he writes   We humans are going to start linking with each other and become a metaconnection  we will all be connected and omnipresent  plugged into a global network that is connected to billions of people and filled with data             
In       Kurzweil said in an expert panel in the National Academy of Engineering that solar power will scale up to produce all of humanity s energy needs in    years  According to him  we need to capture only   part in        of the energy from the Sun that hits Earth s surface to meet all of humanity s energy needs             

Reception edit 
Praise edit 
Kurzweil was called  the ultimate thinking machine  by Forbes in                  and a  restless genius  by The Wall Street Journal in                   PBS included him as one of     revolutionaries who made America   along with other inventors of the past two centuries              Inc  magazine ranked Kurzweil eighth among the  most fascinating  entrepreneurs in the U S  and called him  Edison s rightful heir               Bill Gates called him  the best at predicting the future of artificial intelligence

Although technological singularity is a popular concept in science fiction  authors such as Neal Stephenson             and Bruce Sterling have voiced skepticism about its real world plausibility  Sterling expressed his view in a      talk at the Long Now Foundation called The Singularity  Your Future as a Black Hole                          Other prominent AI thinkers and computer scientists who have criticized Kurzweil s projections include Daniel Dennett              Rodney Brooks              David Gelernter              and Paul Allen              
In the December      issue of IEEE Spectrum  John Rennie criticized Kurzweil for several predictions that did not come true by the originally predicted date              Sun Microsystems co founder Bill Joy agrees with Kurzweil s timeline of future progress  but thinks that technologies such as AI  nanotechnology  and advanced biotechnology will create a dystopian world              Lotus Development Corporation founder Mitch Kapor has called the notion of a technological singularity  intelligent design for the IQ     people    This proposition that we re heading to this point at which everything is going to be just unimaginably different it s fundamentally  in my view  driven by a religious impulse  And all of the frantic arm waving can t obscure that fact for me               Cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter has said of Kurzweil s and Hans Moravec s books   It s an intimate mixture of rubbish and good ideas  and it s very hard to disentangle the two  because these are smart people  they re not stupid               VR pioneer Jaron Lanier has called Kurzweil s ideas  cybernetic totalism  and outlined his view on the culture surrounding Kurzweil s predictions in an essay for the Edge Foundation called  One Half of a Manifesto                           Physicist and futurist Theodore Modis claims that Kurzweil s thesis of a technological singularity lacks scientific rigor
