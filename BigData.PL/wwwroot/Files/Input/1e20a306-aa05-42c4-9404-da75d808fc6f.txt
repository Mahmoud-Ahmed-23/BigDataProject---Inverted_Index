Concept in economics
The expected utility hypothesis is a foundational assumption in mathematical economics concerning decision making under uncertainty  It postulates that rational agents maximize utility  meaning the subjective desirability of their actions  Rational choice theory  a cornerstone of microeconomics  builds this postulate to model aggregate social behaviour 
The expected utility hypothesis states an agent chooses between risky prospects by comparing expected utility values  i e   the weighted sum of adding the respective utility values of payoffs multiplied by their probabilities   The summarised formula for expected utility is

 is realized  and function u expresses the utility of each respective payoff             Graphically the curvature of the u function captures the agent s risk attitude 
Standard utility functions represent ordinal preferences  The expected utility hypothesis imposes limitations on the utility function and makes utility cardinal  though still not comparable across individuals  
Although the expected utility hypothesis is standard in economic modeling  it is violated in psychological experiments  Psychologists and economic theorists have been developing new theories to explain these deficiencies for many years             These include prospect theory  rank dependent expected utility and cumulative prospect theory  and bounded rationality 


Justification edit 
Bernoulli s formulation edit 
Nicolaus Bernoulli described the St  Petersburg paradox  involving infinite expected values  in       prompting two Swiss mathematicians to develop expected utility theory as a solution  Bernoulli s paper was the first formalization of marginal utility  which has broad application in economics in addition to expected utility theory  He used this concept to formalize the idea that the same amount of additional money was less useful to an already wealthy person than it would be to a poor person  The theory can also more accurately describe more realistic scenarios  where expected values are finite  than expected value alone  He proposed that a nonlinear function of the utility of an outcome should be used instead of the expected value of an outcome  accounting for risk aversion  where the risk premium is higher for low probability events than the difference between the payout level of a particular outcome and its expected value  Bernoulli further proposed that it was not the goal of the gambler to maximize his expected gain but to maximize the logarithm of his gain instead      citation needed     
Daniel Bernoulli drew attention to psychological and behavioral components behind the individual s decision making process and proposed that the utility of wealth has a diminishing marginal utility  For example  an extra dollar or an additional good is perceived as less valuable as someone gets wealthier  In other words  desirability related to a financial gain depends on the gain itself and the person s wealth  Bernoulli suggested that people maximize  moral expectation  rather than expected monetary value  Bernoulli made a clear distinction between expected value and expected utility  Instead of using the weighted outcomes  he used the weighted utility multiplied by probabilities  He proved that the utility function used in real life is finite  even when its expected value is infinite            

Ramsey theoretic approach to subjective probability edit 
In       Frank Ramsey introduced Ramsey s Representation Theorem  This representation theorem for expected utility assumes that preferences are defined over a set of bets where each option has a different yield  Ramsey believed that we should always make decisions to receive the best expected outcome according to our personal preferences  This implies that if we can understand an individual s priorities and preferences  we can anticipate their choices             In this model  he defined numerical utilities for each option to exploit the richness of the space of prices  The outcome of each preference is exclusive of each other  For example  if you study  you can not see your friends  However  you will get a good grade in your course  In this scenario  we analyze personal preferences and beliefs and will be able to predict which option a person might choose  e g   if someone prioritizes their social life over academic results  they will go out with their friends   Assuming that the decisions of a person are rational  according to this theorem  we should be able to know the beliefs and utilities of a person just by looking at the choices they make  which is wrong   Ramsey defines a proposition as  ethically neutral  when two possible outcomes have an equal value  In other words  if the probability can be defined as a preference  each proposition should have                   to be indifferent between both options            
Ramsey shows that

        E

Savage s subjective expected utility representation edit 
In the     s  Leonard Jimmie Savage  an American statistician  derived a framework for comprehending expected utility  Savage s framework involved proving that expected utility could be used to make an optimal choice among several acts through seven axioms             In his book  The Foundations of Statistics  Savage integrated a normative account of decision making under risk  when probabilities are known  and under uncertainty  when probabilities are not objectively known   Savage concluded that people have neutral attitudes towards uncertainty and that observation is enough to predict the probabilities of uncertain events             A crucial methodological aspect of Savage s framework is its focus on observable choices cognitive processes and other psychological aspects of decision making matter only to the extent that they directly impact choice 
The theory of subjective expected utility combines two concepts  first  a personal utility function  and second  a personal probability distribution  usually based on Bayesian probability theory   This theoretical model has been known for its clear and elegant structure and is considered by some researchers to be  the most brilliant axiomatic theory of utility ever developed              Instead of assuming the probability of an event  Savage defines it in terms of preferences over acts  Savage used the states  something a person doesn t control  to calculate the probability of an event  On the other hand  he used utility and intrinsic preferences to predict the event s outcome  Savage assumed that each act and state were sufficient to determine an outcome uniquely  However  this assumption breaks in cases where an individual does not have enough information about the event 
Additionally  he believed that outcomes must have the same utility regardless of state  Therefore  it is essential to identify which statement is an outcome correctly  For example  if someone says   I got the job   this affirmation is not considered an outcome since the utility of the statement will be different for each person depending on intrinsic factors such as financial necessity or judgment about the company  Therefore  no state can rule out the performance of an act  Only when the state and the act are evaluated simultaneously is it possible to determine an outcome with certainty             

Savage s representation theorem edit 
The Savage representation theorem  Savage        A preference  lt  satisfies P  P  if and only if there is a finitely additive probability measure P and a function u        C   R such that for every pair of acts f and g             
f  lt  g    Z   u f     dP   Z   u g     dP              
 If and only if all the axioms are satisfied  one can use the information to reduce the uncertainty about the events that are out of their control  Additionally  the theorem ranks the outcome according to a utility function that reflects personal preferences 
The key ingredients in Savage s theory are 

States  The specification of every aspect of the decision problem at hand or  A description of the world leaving no relevant aspect undescribed             
Events  A set of states identified by someone
Consequences  A consequence describes everything relevant to the decision maker s utility  e g   monetary rewards  psychological factors  etc  
Acts  An act is a finite valued function that maps states to consequences 
Von Neumann Morgenstern utility theorem edit 
Main article  Von Neumann Morgenstern utility theorem
The von Neumann Morgenstern axioms edit 
There are four axioms of the expected utility theory that define a rational decision maker  completeness  transitivity  independence of irrelevant alternatives  and continuity             
Completeness assumes that an individual has well defined preferences and can always decide between any two alternatives 

Axiom  Completeness   For every 
  
    
      
        A

 and 
  
    
      
        B

 either

 or both 
This means that the individual prefers

  or is indifferent between

 and 
  
    
      
        B

Transitivity assumes that  as an individual decides according to the completeness axiom  the individual also decides consistently

 we must have

Independence of irrelevant alternatives pertains to well defined preferences as well   It assumes that two gambles mixed with an irrelevant third one will maintain the same order of preference as when the two are presented independently of the third one  The independence axiom is the most controversial      citation needed

Continuity assumes that when there are three lotteries

If all these axioms are satisfied  then the individual is rational  A utility function can represent the preferences  i e   one can assign numbers  utilities  to each outcome of the lottery such that choosing the best lottery according to the preference 
  
    
      
          x ab  
      
    
      displaystyle  succeq  
  
 amounts to choosing the lottery with the highest expected utility  This result is the von Neumann Morgenstern utility representation theorem 
In other words  if an individual s behavior always satisfies the above axioms  then there is a utility function such that the individual will choose one gamble over another if and only if the expected utility of one exceeds that of the other  The expected utility of any gamble may be expressed as a linear combination of the utilities of the outcomes  with the weights being the respective probabilities  Utility functions are also normally continuous functions  Such utility functions are also called von Neumann Morgenstern  vNM   This is a central theme of the expected utility hypothesis in which an individual chooses not the highest expected value but rather the highest expected utility  The expected utility maximizing individual makes decisions rationally based on the theory s axioms 
The von Neumann Morgenstern formulation is important in the application of set theory to economics because it was developed shortly after the Hicks Allen  ordinal revolution  of the     s  and it revived the idea of cardinal utility in economic theory      citation needed      However  while in this context the utility function is cardinal  in that implied behavior would be altered by a nonlinear monotonic transformation of utility  the expected utility function is ordinal because any monotonic increasing transformation of expected utility gives the same behavior

It exhibits constant absolute risk aversion and  for this reason  is often avoided  although it has the advantage of offering substantial mathematical tractability when asset returns are normally distributed  Note that  as per the affine transformation property alluded to above  the utility function 
  
    
      
        K

 gives the same preferences orderings as does  
  
    
      
          x     
        
          e

  thus it is irrelevant that the values of 
  
    
      
          x     
        
          e

 and its expected value are always negative  what matters for preference ordering is which of two gambles gives the higher expected utility  not the numerical values of those expected utilities

Measuring risk in the expected utility context edit 
Often  people refer to  risk  as a potentially quantifiable entity  In the context of mean variance analysis  variance is used as a risk measure for portfolio return  however  this is only valid if returns are normally distributed or otherwise jointly elliptically distributed                                      or in the unlikely case in which the utility function has a quadratic form however  David E  Bell proposed a measure of risk that follows naturally from a certain class of von Neumann Morgenstern utility functions               Let utility of wealth be given by

For general utility functions  however  expected utility analysis does not permit the expression of preferences to be separated into two parameters  one representing the expected value of the variable in question and the other representing its risk 

Risk aversion edit 
Main article  Risk aversion
The expected utility theory takes into account that individuals may be risk averse  meaning that the individual would refuse a fair gamble  a fair gamble has an expected value of zero   Risk aversion implies that their utility functions are concave and show diminishing marginal wealth utility  The risk attitude is directly related to the curvature of the utility function  risk neutral individuals have linear utility functions  risk seeking individuals have convex utility functions  and risk averse individuals have concave utility functions  The curvature of the utility function can measure the degree of risk aversion 
Since the risk attitudes are unchanged under affine transformations of u  the second derivative u   is not an adequate measure of the risk aversion of a utility function  Instead  it needs to be normalized  This leads to the definition of the Arrow Pratt                         measure of absolute risk aversion

Special classes of utility functions are the CRRA  constant relative risk aversion  functions  where RRA w  is constant  and the CARA  constant absolute risk aversion  functions  where ARA w  is constant  These functions are often used in economics to simplify 
A decision that maximizes expected utility also maximizes the probability of the decision s consequences being preferable to some uncertain threshold              In the absence of uncertainty about the threshold  expected utility maximization simplifies to maximizing the probability of achieving some fixed target  If the uncertainty is uniformly distributed  then expected utility maximization becomes expected value maximization  Intermediate cases lead to increasing risk aversion above some fixed threshold and increasing risk seeking below a fixed threshold

The St  Petersburg paradox presented by Nicolas Bernoulli illustrates that decision making based on the expected value of monetary payoffs leads to absurd conclusions               When a probability distribution function has an infinite expected value  a person who only cares about expected values of a gamble would pay an arbitrarily large finite amount to take this gamble  However  this experiment demonstrated no upper bound on the potential rewards from very low probability events  In the hypothetical setup  a person flips a coin repeatedly  The number of consecutive times the coin lands on heads determines the participant s prize  The participant s prize is doubled every time it comes up heads      probability   it ends when the participant flips the coin and comes out in tails  A player who only cares about expected payoff value should be willing to pay any finite amount of money to play because this entry cost will always be less than the expected  infinite value of the game  However  in reality  people do not do this   Only a few participants were willing to pay a maximum of     to enter the game because many were risk averse and unwilling to bet on a very small possibility at a very high price             

Criticism edit 
In the early days of the calculus of probability  classic utilitarians believed that the option with the greatest utility would produce more pleasure or happiness for the agent and  therefore  must be chosen              The main problem with the expected value theory is that there might not be a unique correct way to quantify utility or to identify the best trade offs  For example  some of the trade offs may be intangible or qualitative  Rather than monetary incentives  other desirable ends can also be included in utility  such as pleasure  knowledge  friendship  etc  Originally  the consumer s total utility was the sum of independent utilities of the goods  However  the expected value theory was dropped as it was considered too static and deterministic             The classic counter example to the expected value theory  where everyone makes the same  correct  choice  is the St  Petersburg Paradox            
In empirical applications  several violations of expected utility theory are systematic  and these falsifications have deepened our understanding of how people decide  Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in      presented their prospect theory which showed empirically how preferences of individuals are inconsistent among the same choices  depending on the framing of the choices  i e   how they are presented             
Like any mathematical model  expected utility theory simplifies reality  The mathematical correctness of expected utility theory and the salience of its primitive concepts do not guarantee that expected utility theory is a reliable guide to human behavior or optimal practice  The mathematical clarity of expected utility theory has helped scientists design experiments to test its adequacy and to distinguish systematic departures from its predictions  This has led to the behavioral finance field  which has produced deviations from the expected utility theory to account for the empirical facts 
Other critics argue that applying expected utility to economic and policy decisions has engendered inappropriate valuations  particularly when monetary units are used to scale the utility of nonmonetary outcomes  such as deaths             

Conservatism in updating beliefs edit 
Psychologists have discovered systematic violations of probability calculations and behavior by humans  This has been evidenced by examples such as the Monty Hall problem  where it was demonstrated that people do not revise their degrees on belief in line with experimented probabilities and that probabilities cannot be applied to single cases  On the other hand  in updating probability distributions using evidence  a standard method uses conditional probability  namely the rule of Bayes  An experiment on belief revision has suggested that humans change their beliefs faster when using Bayesian methods than when using informal judgment             
According to the empirical results  there has been almost no recognition in decision theory of the distinction between the problem of justifying its theoretical claims regarding the properties of rational belief and desire  One of the main reasons is that people s basic tastes and preferences for losses cannot be represented with utility as they change under different scenarios             

Irrational deviations edit 
Behavioral finance has produced several generalized expected utility theories to account for
instances where people s choices deviate from those predicted by expected utility theory  These deviations are described as  irrational  because they can depend on the way the problem is presented  not on the actual costs  rewards  or probabilities involved  Particular theories  including prospect theory  rank dependent expected utility  and cumulative prospect theory  are considered insufficient to predict preferences and the expected utility               Additionally  experiments have shown systematic violations and generalizations based on the results of Savage and von Neumann Morgenstern  This is because preferences and utility functions constructed under different contexts differ significantly  This is demonstrated in the contrast of individual preferences under the insurance and lottery context  which shows the degree of indeterminacy of the expected utility theory  Additionally  experiments have shown systematic violations and generalizations based on the results of Savage and von Neumann Morgenstern 
In practice  there will be many situations where the probabilities are unknown  and one operates under uncertainty  In economics  Knightian uncertainty or ambiguity may occur  Thus  one must make assumptions about the probabilities  but the expected values of various decisions can be very sensitive to the assumptions  This is particularly problematic when the expectation is dominated by rare extreme events  as in a long tailed distribution  Alternative decision techniques are robust to the uncertainty of probability of outcomes  either not depending on probabilities of outcomes and only requiring scenario analysis  as in minimax or minimax regret   or being less sensitive to assumptions 
Bayesian approaches to probability treat it as a degree of belief  Thus  they do not distinguish between risk and a wider concept of uncertainty  they deny the existence of Knightian uncertainty  They would model uncertain probabilities with hierarchical models  i e   as distributions whose parameters are drawn from a higher level distribution  hyperpriors  

Preference reversals over uncertain outcomes edit 
Starting with studies such as Lichtenstein  amp  Slovic         it was discovered that subjects sometimes exhibit signs of preference reversals about their certainty equivalents of different lotteries  Specifically  when eliciting certainty equivalents  subjects tend to value  p bets   lotteries with a high chance of winning a low prize  lower than    bets   lotteries with a small chance of winning a large prize   When subjects are asked which lotteries they prefer in direct comparison  however  they frequently prefer the  p bets  over    bets               Many studies have examined this  preference reversal   from both an experimental  e g   Plott  amp  Grether                    and theoretical  e g   Holt                    standpoint  indicating that this behavior can be brought into accordance with neoclassical economic theory under specific assumptions
