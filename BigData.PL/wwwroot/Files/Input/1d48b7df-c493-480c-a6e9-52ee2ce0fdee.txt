							After its successful tour in Paris and London  Osiris Egyptian Sunken Secrets Exhibition was hosted by Rietberg Museum in the Swiss city of Zurich between    February and    July  In a big press conference that was covered by a number of local and international media outlets  the Egypt Minister of Antiquities  Khaled El Anany  provided information about the importance of the exhibited pieces that tells the mythical story of Osiris  the ancient Egyptian god of rebirth  and were found in the old cities of Thonis Heracleion  Canopus  Abo Qeir  and Alexandria eastern port 
       The exhibition hosts     relics that were found below the Egyptian coasts  starting from the     s and going back to the Pharaonic  Roman  and Greek eras         Elham Salah Al Din  head of the museum sector in the Ministry of Antiquities  said 
The relics were chosen from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo  the Graeco Roman Museum  the Alexandria National Museum  and the Bibliotheca Alexandria Museum  The process of hosting such rare pieces is not an easy task 
       The exhibition has been held many times before in many countries around the world  We never deal with individuals  we always communicate with authentic governmental institutions which provide some offers for receiving the relics  We always deal with reliable insurance and packaging companies  The relics must be shipped on EgyptAir flights to guarantee their security         she added 
According to MySwitzerland com  the exhibition features some outstanding exhibits  such as the colossal statue of Hapy  the personification of the inundation of the Nile  which is more than five meters tall  the life sized sculpture of the sacred Apis bull  the shrine with the oldest Egyptian calendar  and the statue of Queen Arsinoe II  that testifies to unique sculptural skills 
The exhibition is open for visitors from all nationalities for six months  An official from the Ministry of Antiquities must accompany the relics in exhibition for the whole scheduled period 
       Foreigners are obsessed with Egypt       s ancient era and when we announce holding any Egyptian exhibition in any country  we usually receive a lot of attention and positive feedback  This can be a great way for reviving the tourism sector in Egypt again and attracting bigger numbers of tourists         she added 
In her opinion  this exhibition would benefit Egypt on many different political  educational  cultural  and economic levels 
       The exhibition is not only a good source of income  it also introduces Egypt       s name and civilisation to people in many different countries and sends an important message about the stability and security of Egypt       s current circumstances  It also builds strong connections between Egypt and the major countries where people study Egypt       s ancient history in their educational curriculum         she explained 
However  the different countries always have various interests in the Egyptian monuments         American exhibitions always pay more attention to the fame of the Egyptian kings and queens  especially Tutankhamun  Ramses  and Tuhotmos  However  European exhibitions prefer to host specialised exhibitions on certain topics such as agriculture  beauty  science  and others        
Since the outbreak of the    January revolution and the political and security unrest that followed it  the tourism sector has witnessed a lot of challenges because of the decreasing numbers of tourists   However  this led to the revival of the domestic tourism  which was a new phenomenon  from different perspectives 
       The last few years have witnessed increasing rates of foreign tourism in Egypt which is a promising indicator  Also  the big numbers of the Egyptians who visit the museums and historical places can be considered another healthy sign  thanks to the print and broadcast media which played a great role in attracting people to domestic tourism         she noted 
The success of this exhibition opens the door for many other international offers the ministry is currently receiving 
       We received some offers from museums in China  Germany  Spain  and other countries  and we are currently studying their documents to come up with the best strategy for the exhibitions that will be held between      and       We are also working in the new Egyptian museum under the direct supervision of the minister himself         she concluded
