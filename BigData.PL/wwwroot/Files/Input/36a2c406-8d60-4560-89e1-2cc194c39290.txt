Temporary inability to see the ethical aspects of decisions
Moral blindness  also known as ethical blindness  is defined as a person s temporary inability to see the ethical aspect of a decision they are making  It is often caused by external factors due to which an individual is unable to see the immoral aspect of their behavior in that particular situation            
While the concept of moral blindness  and more broadly  that of immorality  has its roots in ancient philosophy                        the idea of moral blindness became popular after the events of World War II  particularly the Holocaust             This led to more research by psychologists and some surprising findings  notably by Stanley Milgram and Philip Zimbardo  on human behavior in the context of obedience and authority bias             
Moral blindness has been identified as being a concern in areas such as business organisation and legal systems                       


Overview edit 
Moral blindness is a phenomenon in which people with sufficient moral reasoning abilities are temporarily unable to see reason which causes them to behave in ways counter to their actual moral values  This behaviour can be due to situational or other factors  The idea of moral blindness usually requires the following  people need to deviate from their intrinsic moral beliefs and this deviation should be temporary and unconscious i e  people are unaware at the time of their unethical behaviour                       
Interest in the idea of moral blindness increased after Hannah Arendt s Eichmann in Jerusalem  A Report on the Banality of Evil            which focused on Adolf Eichmann  a German Austrian Nazi soldier who was responsible for the deportation of Jews to extermination camps and thus played a major role in the Holocaust            
The ideas of moral blindness and the  banality of evil  also influenced the field of psychology and led to some notable studies in the   s such as the obedience studies by Stanley Milgram and the Stanford Prison Experiment by Philip Zimbardo  These studies looked at the impact of authority on obedience and individual behaviour            
Subsequent research has looked at moral blindness in contexts beyond war crimes and genocide  The idea has been expanded to study people s behaviour in areas as diverse as organisational behavior and mental health to name a few                                   

Origins and early theories edit 
Roots in philosophy edit 
The origins of the concept of moral blindness lie in philosophy and can be traced to ancient Greek philosophers such as Socrates who spoke of moral intellectualism  Plato who spoke about emotions clouding moral judgements  and Aristotle who first used the term  ethics  for the field of moral philosophy             Early spiritual leaders such as the Buddha and Confucius also spoke about moral behaviour in their discourses although they were more prescriptive in nature             Modern contributions to moral judgement came from Western philosophers such as Descartes  Locke  Hume  and Kant around the   th and   th century                                     and more contemporary philosophers such as G E  Moore  who in his book Principia Ethica talks about the  indefinability of good              
Normative ethics seeks to define the rightness or wrongness of an action  Two opposing views that have developed in this area are deontology where the morality of an action depends on its appropriateness with respect to rules and consequentialism where an action s morality depends on its results  These views are often reflected in responses to Greene s trolley problem             

In psychology edit 
Moral blindness has been studied jointly across philosophy and psychology with empirical studies of morality going back to the     s  The focus on a normative approach to moral behaviour led to research focused on the cognitive and developmental context  Piaget put forth his prominent theory of cognitive development in      which Kohlberg developed to come up with the three stages of moral development in                   Later  in       James Rest published his influential Four Component Model of Morality  FCM  where he identified four distinct stages from which immoral behaviour could arise  moral sensitivity  moral judgment  moral motivation  and moral implementation              This model was meant to convey the complexity behind moral behaviour  Competence in one stage did not imply competence in another  so immoral behaviour could result from failure at any stage              The above cognitive focus was found to be in contrast to some of the observed behavior  The field of behavioral ethics eventually emerged to study how people react to moral dilemmas             

Theoretical and experimental research in psychology edit 
A major driver for modern research on moral blindness is purported to be post World War II sentiments towards people such as Adolf Eichmann  responsible for genocide under the Nazi regime during the Holocaust   His capture and subsequent trial in      had many observers comment on his ordinary nature and appearance which seemed at contrast with his  evil  behaviour  Hannah Arendt  who was covering the trial for the New Yorker  coined the term the  banality of evil  in reference to Eichmann as during the trial  Eichmann showed no remorse nor did he accept responsibility   he claimed to have done what he was told to do  This is believed to have influenced researchers such as Milgram to study individual behaviour in response to obedience to authority                                    
In his obedience studies in          Milgram had subjects think they were administering electric shocks to another participant  who in fact was a confederate of the experimenters  These studies had been designed to answer questions such as   Could it be that Eichmann and his million accomplices in the Holocaust were just following orders  Could we call them all accomplices               To most people s surprise      of the subjects from the original study went ahead to pull a switch that would have administered the maximum of     volts             
Later in       Zimbardo in his Stanford Prison Experiment studied showed how  good people behave in pathological ways that are alien to their nature              Male undergraduate students at Stanford were assigned to be guards or prisoners in a simulated prison setting  The experiment was designed to see how far subjects would go to internalise their roles and obey external orders and later raised some ethical concerns about the nature of the study itself             
Post these findings  researchers began to study moral agency  its exercise and drivers of moral blindness  In his research  Bandura argued that moral disengagement could arise out of various forces  individual  situational  or institutional  along with mechanisms such as diffusion of responsibility and disconnected division of tasks could lead to immoral behaviour                                    
More recent research has led to the development of the concept of  bounded ethicality    the idea that people can be unintentionally unethical when it comes to their behaviour as well as judging others  behaviour  something they may realise only on further reflection                          Studies on individual unethicality have also looked at the role of social norms and as well as how we view others  unethical behaviour                         

Applications and related ideas edit 
Moral blindness has been studied and applied in a range of domains beyond war crimes  politics  and administration  A major area of application has been in the field of management and organisational behaviour with research looking at a wide range of topics such as corporate transgressions  business ethics  and moral disengagement at work                        Law and justice is another area where moral blindness  especially when it comes to lawyers  is seen as a concern                         Some research has also referred to psychopathy being a specific kind of moral blindness although the findings are not conclusive             
The field has also been expanded to study broader ideas such as moral blind spots  overestimating ability to act ethically               ethical erosion  gradual decline of ethics over time               and ethical fading  when ethical concerns around a situation  fade  during decision making
