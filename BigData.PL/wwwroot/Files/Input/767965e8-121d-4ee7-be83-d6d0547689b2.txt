History of NLP
Natural Language Processing  NLP  emerged in      when Alan Turing published his groundbreaking paper titled Computing Machinery and Intelligence  Turing s work laid the foundation for NLP  which is a subset of Artificial Intelligence  AI  focused on enabling machines to automatically interpret and generate human language  Over time  NLP technology has evolved  giving rise to different approaches for solving complex language related tasks 
   Heuristic Based NLP
The Heuristic based approach to NLP was one of the earliest methods used in natural language processing  It relies on predefined rules and domain specific knowledge  These rules are typically derived from expert insights  A classic example of this approach is Regular Expressions  Regex   which are used for pattern matching and text manipulation tasks 
   Statistical and Machine Learning Based NLP
As NLP advanced  Statistical NLP emerged  incorporating machine learning algorithms to model language patterns  This approach applies statistical rules and learns from data to tackle various language processing tasks  Popular machine learning algorithms in this category include 

Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machines  SVM 
Hidden Markov Models  HMM 

   Neural Network Based NLP  Deep Learning 
The most recent advancement in NLP is the adoption of Deep Learning techniques  Neural networks  particularly Recurrent Neural Networks  RNNs   Long Short Term Memory Networks  LSTMs   and Transformers  have revolutionized NLP tasks by providing superior accuracy  These models require large amounts of data and considerable computational power for training
