General game playing  GGP  is the design of artificial intelligence programs to be able to play more than one game successfully                                   For many games like chess  computers are programmed to play these games using a specially designed algorithm  which cannot be transferred to another context  For instance  a chess playing computer program cannot play checkers  General game playing is considered as a necessary milestone on the way to artificial general intelligence            
General video game playing   GVGP  is the concept of GGP adjusted to the purpose of playing video games  For video games  game rules have to be either learnt over multiple iterations by artificial players like TD Gammon             or are predefined manually in a domain specific language and sent in advance to artificial players                       like in traditional GGP  Starting in       significant progress was made following the deep reinforcement learning approach  including the development of programs that can learn to play Atari      games                                                          as well as a program that can learn to play Nintendo Entertainment System games                                     
The first commercial usage of general game playing technology was Zillions of Games in       General game playing was also proposed for trading agents in supply chain management there under price negotiation in online auctions from      onwards                                                 


History edit 
This section needs to be updated  Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information    October      
In       Barney Pell defined the concept of Meta Game Playing  and developed the  MetaGame  system  This was the first program to automatically generate game rules of chess like games  and one of the earliest programs to use automated game generation   Pell then developed the system Metagamer              This system was able to play a number of chess like games  given game rules definition in a special language called Game Description Language  GDL   without any human interaction once the games were generated             
In       the commercial system Zillions of Games was developed by Jeff Mallett and Mark Lefler  The system used a LISP like language to define the game rules  Zillions of Games derived the evaluation function automatically from the game rules based on piece mobility  board structure and game goals  It also employed usual algorithms as found in computer chess systems  alpha beta pruning with move ordering  transposition tables  etc              The package was extended in      by the addition of the Axiom plug in  an alternate metagame engine that incorporates a complete Forth based programming language 
In       z Tree was developed by Urs Fischbacher              z Tree is the first and the most cited software tool for experimental economics  z Tree allows the definition of game rules in z Tree language for game theoretic experiments with human subjects  It also allows definition of computer players  which participate in a play with human subjects             
In       the Stanford Project General Game Playing was established            
In       the development of PyVGDL started             

GGP implementations edit 
Stanford project edit 
General Game Playing is a project of the Stanford Logic Group of Stanford University  California  which aims to create a platform for general game playing  It is the most well known effort at standardizing GGP AI  and generally seen as the standard for GGP systems  The games are defined by sets of rules represented in the Game Description Language  In order to play the games  players interact with a game hosting server                         that monitors moves for legality and keeps players informed of state changes 
Since       there have been annual General Game Playing competitions at the AAAI Conference  The competition judges competitor AI s abilities to play a variety of different games  by recording their performance on each individual game  In the first stage of the competition  entrants are judged on their ability to perform legal moves  gain the upper hand  and complete games faster  In the following runoff round  the AIs face off against each other in increasingly complex games  The AI that wins the most games at this stage wins the competition  and until      its creator used to win a         prize              So far  the following programs were victorious

There are other general game playing systems  which use their own languages for defining the game rules  Other general game playing software include

GVGP implementations edit 
Reinforcement learning edit 
GVGP could potentially be used to create real video game AI automatically  as well as  to test game environments  including those created automatically using procedural content generation and to find potential loopholes in the gameplay that a human player could exploit              GVGP has also been used to generate game rules  and estimate a game s quality based on Relative Algorithm Performance Profiles  RAPP   which compare the skill differentiation that a game allows between good AI and bad AI             

Video Game Description Language edit 
The General Video Game AI Competition  GVGAI  has been running since       In this competition  two dimensional video games similar to  and sometimes based on      s era arcade and console games are used instead of the board games used in the GGP competition  It has offered a way for researchers and practitioners to test and compare their best general video game playing algorithms  The competition has an associated software framework including a large number of games written in the Video Game Description Language  VGDL   which should not be confused with GDL and is a coding language using simple semantics and commands that can easily be parsed  One example for VGDL is PyVGDL developed in                              The games used in GVGP are  for now  often   dimensional arcade games  as they are the simplest and easiest to quantify              To simplify the process of creating an AI that can interpret video games  games for this purpose are written in VGDL manually      clarification needed      VGDL can be used to describe a game specifically for procedural generation of levels  using Answer Set Programming  ASP  and an Evolutionary Algorithm  EA   GVGP can then be used to test the validity of procedural levels  as well as the difficulty or quality of levels based on how an agent performed             

Algorithms edit 
Since GGP AI must be designed to play multiple games  its design cannot rely on algorithms created specifically for certain games  Instead  the AI must be designed using algorithms whose methods can be applied to a wide range of games  The AI must also be an ongoing process  that can adapt to its current state rather than the output of previous states  For this reason  open loop techniques are often most effective             
A popular method for developing GGP AI is the Monte Carlo tree search  MCTS  algorithm              Often used together with the UCT method  Upper Confidence Bound applied to Trees   variations of MCTS have been proposed to better play certain games  as well as to make it compatible with video game playing                                      Another variation of tree search algorithms used is the Directed Breadth first Search  DBS               in which a child node to the current state is created for each available action  and visits each child ordered by highest average reward  until either the game ends or runs out of time              In each tree search method  the AI simulates potential actions and ranks each based on the average highest reward of each path  in terms of points earned                         

Assumptions edit 
In order to interact with games  algorithms must operate under the assumption that games all share common characteristics  In the book Half Real  Video Games Between Real Worlds and Fictional Worlds  Jesper Juul gives the following definition of games  Games are based on rules  they have variable outcomes  different outcomes give different values  player effort influences outcomes  the player is attached to the outcomes  and the game has negotiable consequences               Using these assumptions  game playing AI can be created by quantifying the player input  the game outcomes  and how the various rules apply  and using algorithms to compute the most favorable path
