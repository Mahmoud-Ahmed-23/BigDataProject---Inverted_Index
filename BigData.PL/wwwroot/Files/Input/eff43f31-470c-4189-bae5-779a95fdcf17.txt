The establishment of Alphabet Inc  was prompted by a desire to make the core Google business  cleaner and more accountable  while allowing greater autonomy to group companies that operate in businesses other than Internet services                        Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin announced their resignation from their executive posts in December       with the CEO role to be filled by Sundar Pichai  who is also the CEO of Google  Page and Brin remain employees  board members  and controlling shareholders of Alphabet Inc            


History edit 
On August           Google announced plans to create a new public holding company  Alphabet Inc  Google co founder and CEO Larry Page made this announcement in a blog post on Google s official blog              Alphabet was created to restructure Google by moving subsidiaries from Google to Alphabet  thus narrowing Google s scope  The new holding company would consist of Google as well as other businesses including X Development  Calico  Nest  Verily  Fiber  CapitalG  and GV                                      Sundar Pichai  the company s Product Chief  became the new chief executive officer of Google  replacing Page  who transitioned to the role of running Alphabet  along with co founder Sergey Brin                         
In his announcement  Page stated that the planned holding company would allow for  more management scale  as we can run things independently that aren t very related  to Google  He clarified that  as a result of the new holding company  Google would be  a bit slimmed down  with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in Alphabet instead               He further stated that the motivation behind the reorganization is to make Google  cleaner and more accountable and better  and that he wanted to improve  the transparency and oversight of what we re doing                        
Former executive Eric Schmidt revealed in the conference in      the inspiration for this structure came from Warren Buffett and his management structure of Berkshire Hathaway a decade ago              Schmidt said he encouraged Page and Brin to meet with Buffett in Omaha to see how Berkshire Hathaway was a holding company made of subsidiaries with strong CEOs who were trusted to run their businesses             
Before it became a subsidiary of Alphabet  Google Inc  was first structured as the owner of Alphabet              The roles were reversed after a placeholder subsidiary was created for the ownership of Alphabet  at which point the newly formed subsidiary was merged with Google  Google s stock was then converted to Alphabet s stock  Under the Delaware General Corporation Law  where Alphabet is incorporated   a holding company reorganization such as this can be done without a vote of shareholders  as this reorganization was              The restructuring process was completed on October                     Alphabet retains Google Inc  s stock price history and continues to trade under Google Inc  s former ticker symbols  GOOG  and  GOOGL              
On December          Page and Brin jointly announced that they would step down from their respective roles  remaining as employees and still the majority vote on the board of directors  Sundar Pichai  the CEO of Google  assumed the CEO role at Alphabet while retaining the same at Google             
The firm completed a stock split in mid                  
On January           Pichai wrote a letter to all employees announcing that the company would be laying off about        jobs  or    of its global workforce  In the letter  Pichai wrote   Over the past two years we ve seen periods of dramatic growth  To match and fuel that growth  we hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today              
In January       Waymo  the autonomous driving division of Alphabet Inc   which operates extensively in San Francisco  filed an application with the California Public Utilities Commission to expand service in Los Angeles  Such a license would allow the company to make full use of its fleet in the city instead of test drives by invitation             
In August       following the lawsuit filed by the United States Department of Justice in       a United States district court has found Alphabet guilty of violating antitrust law  This marked the first antitrust ruling against a U S  company in    years  Alphabet has appealed the ruling             
On    December       Alphabet s shares rose about    after the company unveiled its new quantum computing chip  Willow  The chip solved a complex problem in five minutes  a task that would take a classical computer longer than the age of the universe  Willow reduces error rates in quantum computing and can correct them in real time  which could lead to breakthroughs in science  medicine  and finance  Alphabet s stock was up     for the year  marking its best day since April
