Midjourney is a generative artificial intelligence program and service created and hosted by the San Francisco based independent research lab Midjourney  Inc  Midjourney generates images from natural language descriptions  called prompts  similar to OpenAI s DALL E and Stability AI s Stable Diffusion                        It is one of the technologies of the AI boom 
The tool is in open beta as of August       which it entered on July                      The Midjourney team is led by David Holz  who co founded Leap Motion             Holz told The Register in August      that the company was already profitable             Users create artwork with Midjourney using Discord bot commands or the official website                       


History edit 
Midjourney  Inc  was founded in San Francisco  California  by David Holz             previously a co founder of Leap Motion             The Midjourney image generation platform entered open beta on July                      On March           the Midjourney Discord server launched with a request to post high quality photographs to Twitter and Reddit for systems training      citation needed     

Model versions edit 
The company has been working on improving its algorithms  releasing new model versions every few months  Version   of their algorithm was launched in April                   and version   on July                 On November          the alpha iteration of version   was released to users                          Starting from the  th version  MJ models were trained on Google TPUs             
On March           the alpha iteration of version   was released              The     model is more opinionated than version    applying more of its own stylization to images  while the     RAW model adds improvements while working better with more literal prompts  The version     included a new  aesthetics system   and the ability to  zoom out  by generating surroundings to an existing image              On December           the alpha iteration of version   was released  The model was trained from scratch over a nine month period  Support was added for better text rendition and a more literal interpretation of prompts

Functionality edit 
Midjourney is accessible through a Discord bot or by accessing their website  Users can use Midjourney through Discord either through their official Discord server  by directly messaging the bot  or by inviting the bot to a third party server  To generate images  users use the  imagine command and type in a prompt              the bot then returns a set of four images  which users are given the option to upscale  To generate images on the website  users initially needed to have generated at least       images through the bot  this limitation has since been removed 

Vary  Region    remix feature edit 
Midjourney released a Vary  Region  feature on September          as part of MidJourney V     This feature allows users to select a specific area of an image and apply variations only to that region while keeping the rest of the image unchanged             

Midjourney web interface edit 
Midjourney introduced its web interface to make its tools more accessible  moving beyond its initial reliance on Discord  This web based platform was launched in August      alongside the release of Midjourney version      The web editor consolidates tools such as image editing  panning  zooming  region variation  and inpainting into a single interface                          
The introduction of the web interface also syncs conversations between Midjourney s Discord channels and web rooms  further enhancing collaboration across both platforms  This shift was in response to growing competition from other AI image generation platforms like Adobe Firefly and Google s Imagen  which had already launched as native web apps with integration into popular design tools 
            

Image Weight edit 
This feature lets users control how much influence an uploaded image has on the final output  By adjusting the  image weight  parameter  users can prioritize either the content of the prompt or the characteristics of the image  For instance  setting a higher weight will ensure that the generated result closely follows the image s structure and details  while a lower weight allows the text prompt to have more influence over the final output             

Style Reference edit 
With Style Reference  users can upload an image to use as a stylistic guide for their creation  This tool enables MidJourney to extract the style whether it is the color palette  texture  or overall atmosphere from the reference image and apply it to a newly generated image  The feature allows users to fine tune the aesthetics of their creations by integrating specific artistic styles or moods             

Character Reference edit 
The Character Reference feature allows for a more targeted approach in defining characters  Users can upload an image of a character  and the system uses that image as a reference to generate similar characters in the output  This feature is particularly useful in maintaining consistency in appearance for characters across different images             

Uses edit 
Midjourney s founder  David Holz  told The Register that artists use Midjourney for rapid prototyping of artistic concepts to show to clients before starting work themselves            
The advertising industry has been quick to embrace AI tools such as Midjourney  DALL E  and Stable Diffusion  among others  The tools that enable advertisers to create original content and brainstorm ideas quickly are providing new opportunities  such as  custom ads created for individuals  a new way to create special effects  or even making e commerce advertising more efficient   according to Ad Age                  promotion      
Architects have described using the software to generate mood boards for the early stages of projects  as an alternative to searching Google Images             

Notable usage and controversy edit 
Th  tre D op ra Spatial  a Midjourney image that won first prize in a digital art competition
Image from Alice and Sparkle  a children s book illustrated by Midjourney  Time describes this image as  showing the limits of the AI powered technology  The illustration has several apparent flaws  including the character appearing to have claws              
The program was used by the British magazine The Economist to create the front cover for an issue in June                               In Italy  the leading newspaper Corriere della Sera published a comic created with Midjourney by writer Vanni Santoni in August                   Charlie Warzel used Midjourney to generate two images of Alex Jones for Warzel s newsletter in The Atlantic  The use of an AI generated cover was criticised by people who felt it was taking jobs from artists  Warzel called his action a mistake in an article about his decision to use generated images              Last Week Tonight with John Oliver included a    minute segment on Midjourney in an episode broadcast in August                              
A Midjourney image called Th  tre D op ra Spatial won first place in the digital art competition at the      Colorado State Fair  Jason Allen  who wrote the prompt that led Midjourney to generate the image  printed the image onto a canvas and entered it into the competition using the name Jason M  Allen via Midjourney  Other digital artists were upset by the news              Allen was unapologetic  insisting that he followed the competition s rules  The two category judges were unaware that Midjourney used AI to generate images  although they later said that had they known this  they would have awarded Allen the top prize anyway             
In December       Midjourney was used to generate the images for an AI generated children s book that was created over a weekend  Titled Alice and Sparkle  the book features a young girl who builds a robot that becomes self aware  The creator  Ammaar Reeshi  used Midjourney to generate a large number of images  from which he chose    for the book              Both the product and process drew criticism  One artist wrote that  the main problem    is that it was trained off of artists  work  It s our creations  our distinct styles that we created  that we did not consent to being used              

A fake Midjourney created image of Pope Francis wearing a puffer jacket  which went viral in     
In       the realism of AI based text to image generators  such as Midjourney  DALL E  or Stable Diffusion                          reached such a high level that it led to a significant wave of viral AI generated photos  Widespread attention was gained by a Midjourney generated photo of Pope Francis wearing a white puffer coat                          the fictional arrest of Donald Trump              and a hoax of an attack on the Pentagon              as well as the usage in professional creative arts                         
Research has suggested that the images Midjourney generates can be biased  For example  even neutral prompts in one study returned unequal results on the aspects of gender  skin color  and location              A study by researchers at the nonprofit group Center for Countering Digital Hate found the tool to be easy to use to generate racist and conspiratorial images              In October       Rest of World reported that Midjourney tends to generate images based on national stereotypes             

An anatomically incorrect diagram of a rat s penis and testicles illustrated by Midjourney  published in a now retracted Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology paper              which went viral in                  
In       a Frontiers journal published a paper             which contained gibberish figures generated with Midjourney  one of which was a diagram of a rat with large testicles and a large penis towering over himself  The paper was retracted a day after the images went viral on Twitter             

Content moderation and censorship in Midjourney edit 
Prior to May       Midjourney implemented a moderation mechanism predicated on a banned word system  This method prohibited the use of language associated with explicit content  such as sexual or pornographic themes  as well as extreme violence  Moreover  the system also banned certain individual words  including those of religious and political figures  such as Allah or Xi Jinping  This practice occasionally stirred controversy due to perceived instances of censorship within the Midjourney platform                         
Commencing in May       with subsequent updates post version    Midjourney transitioned to an AI powered content moderation system  This advanced mechanism allowed for a more nuanced interpretation of user prompts by analyzing them in their entirety  It consequently facilitated the context dependent use of words that had previously been prohibited  For instance  users can now prompt the AI to generate a portrait of Xi Jinping  At the same time  the system will prevent the generation of contentious images  such as depictions of global leaders  including Xi Jinping  in situations of arrest             

Litigation edit 
On January           three artists Sarah Andersen  Kelly McKernan  and Karla Ortiz filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Stability AI  Midjourney  and DeviantArt  claiming that these companies have infringed on the rights of millions of artists by training AI tools on five billion images scraped from the web  without the consent of the original artists             
The legal action was initiated in San Francisco by attorney Matthew Butterick in partnership with the Joseph Saveri Law Firm  the same team challenging Microsoft  GitHub  and OpenAI  developers of ChatGPT and DALL E  in court  In July       U S  District Judge William Orrick inclined to dismiss most of the lawsuit filed by Andersen  McKernan  and Ortiz but allowed them to file a new complaint              Another lawsuit was filed in November      against Midjourney  Stability AI  DeviantArt and Runway AI for using the copyrighted work of over       artists
