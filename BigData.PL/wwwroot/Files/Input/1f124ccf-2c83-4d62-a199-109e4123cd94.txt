devices over the Internet  A web browser is used to access web pages  Web browsers can be defined as programs that display text  data  pictures  animation  and video on the Internet  Hyperlinked resources on the World Wide Web can be accessed using software interfaces provided by Web browsers Web Technology can be Classified into the Following Sections World Wide Web  WWW   The World Wide Web is based on several different technologies  Web browsers  Hypertext Markup Language  HTML   and Hypertext Transfer Protocol  HTTP  Web Browser  The web browser is an application software to access and interact World Wide Web  It provides an interface between the server and the client  sending requests to the server for web documents and services Web Pages  A webpage is a digital document that is linked to the World Wide Web and viewable by anyone connected to the internet who has a web browser Web Server  A Web server is a program which processes the network requests of the users and serves them with files that create web pages  This exchange takes place using Hypertext Transfer Protocol  HTTP  Web Development  Web development refers to the building  creating  and maintaining of websites  It includes aspects such as web design  web publishing  web programming  and database management  It is the creation of an application that works over the internet  i e   websites Web Development can be Classified into Two Ways Frontend Development  The part of a website that the user interacts with directly is termed as front end  It is also referred to as the  client side  of the application  Backend Development  The Backend is the server side of a website  It is the part of the website that users cannot see or interact with  It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users  It is used to store and arrange data Frontend Development LanguagesThe front end portion is built by using some languages which are discussed below HTML  HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language  It is used to design the front end portion of web pages using a markup language  HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language  Hypertext defines the link between the web pages  The markup language is used to define the text documentation within the tag which defines the structure of web pages CSS  Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable  CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages  More importantly  CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page JavaScript  JavaScript is a famous scripting language used to create magic on the sites to make the site interactive for the user  It is used to enhancing the functionality of a website to running cool games and web based software AJAX  Ajax is an acronym for Asynchronous Javascript and XML  It is used to communicate with the server without refreshing the web page and thus increasing the user experience and better performance There are many other languages through which one can do front end development depending upon the framework for example Flutter user Dart  React uses JavaScript and Django uses Python  and much more Backend Development LanguagesThe back end portion is built by using some languages which are discussed below PHP  PHP is a server side scripting language designed specifically for web development  Since PHP code executed on the server side  so it is called a server side scripting language Node js  Node js is an open source and cross platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser  You need to remember that NodeJS is not a framework  and it s not a programming language  Most people are confused and understand it s a framework or a programming language  We often use Node js for building back end services like APIs like Web App or Mobile App  It s used in production by large companies such as Paypal  Uber  Netflix  Wallmart  and so on Python  Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently Ruby  Ruby is a dynamic  reflective  object oriented  general purpose programming language  Ruby is a pure Object Oriented language developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto  Everything in Ruby is an object except the blocks but there are replacements too for it i e procs and lambda  The objective of Ruby s development was to make it act as a sensible buffer between human programmers and the underlying computing machinery Java  Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages and platforms  It is highly scalable  Java components are easily available JavaScript  JavaScript can be used as both  front end and back end  programming Golang  Golang is a procedural and statically typed programming language having the syntax similar to C programming language  Sometimes it is termed as Go Programming Language C   C  is a general purpose  modern and object oriented programming language pronounced as  C sharp   DBMS  The software which is used to manage database is called Database Management System  DBMS   DatabasesIn web technology  a database is a structured collection of data that is stored electronically and accessed via a web application  It serves as the backend component where data is stored  managed  and retrieved  Databases can be relational  like MySQL  PostgreSQL  using structured tables and SQL for queries  or non relational  like MongoDB  CouchDB  which store data in flexible  document oriented formats  They enable web applications to handle dynamic content  user data  transactions  and more by providing efficient storage  retrieval  and manipulation capabilities  Database management systems  DBMS  are used to interact with the database  ensuring data integrity  security  and performance There are basically two types of databases    SQL Relational DatabaseA relational database stores data in tables  similar to a spreadsheet  where each table has rows and columns  The rows hold individual records  and the columns define the data attributes  Tables can be linked to each other through special keys  allowing related data to be connected MySQL  MySQL is an open source relational database management system that uses SQL for managing structured data  It s known for its reliability  ease of use  and performance  widely used in web applications Postgre SQL  PostgreSQL is a powerful  open source relational database that supports advanced SQL features and complex queries  It handles structured data  ensures ACID compliance  and is known for its reliability and extensibility MariaDB  MariaDB is an open source relational database that evolved from MySQL  offering improved performance  security  and features  It supports SQL queries  ACID compliance  and is highly compatible with MySQL    NoSQL DatabasesA NoSQL database stores data in a flexible  non tabular format  unlike traditional relational databases  Instead of using tables with rows and columns  NoSQL databases might use documents  key value pairs  wide columns  or graphs to store data  This allows them to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi structured data efficiently  They are designed to scale easily and manage big data applications  Mongodb  MongoDB is a NoSQL database storing data in JSON like documents  It handles unstructured data  supports powerful queries  and scales easily across servers  making it popular for flexible  scalable applications Cassandra  Apache Cassandra is an open source NoSQL database that is used for handling big data  It has the capability to handle structure  semi structured  and unstructured data Redis  Redis is an in memory NoSQL database known for its speed  It supports various data structures like strings  hashes  and lists  making it ideal for caching  real time analytics  and messaging Data FormatFormat of data is used by web applications to communicate with each other  It is light weight text based data interchange format which means  it is simpler to read and write Below are two common data formats used in web development XML  Extensible Markup Language  XML  is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human readable and machine readable JSON  JSON or JavaScript Object Notation is a format for structuring data API  API is an abbreviation for Application Programming Interface which is a collection of communication protocols and subroutines used by various programs to communicate between them  Web ProtocolsWeb protocols are set of rules followed by everyone communicating over the web HTTP  The Hypertext Transfer Protocol  HTTP  is designed to enable communications between clients and servers  HTTP works as a request response protocol between a client and server  A web browser may be the client  and an application on a computer that hosts a web site may be the server Other Protocols TCP IP ModelUDPFTPSMTPSOAPGraphicsGraphical elements are one of the key feature of any webpage  They can be used to convey important points better than text does and beautify the webpage Canvas  The HTML  canvas  element is used to draw graphics via JavaScript SVG  SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics  It basically defines vector based graphics in XML format Some
