Progress in machine classification of images  The error rate of AI by year  Red line   the error rate of a trained human on a particular task  
Progress in artificial intelligence  AI  refers to the advances  milestones  and breakthroughs that have been achieved in the field of artificial intelligence over time  AI is a multidisciplinary branch of computer science that aims to create machines and systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence  AI applications have been used in a wide range of fields including medical diagnosis  finance  robotics  law  video games  agriculture  and scientific discovery  However  many AI applications are not perceived as AI   A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications  often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it s not labeled AI anymore                          Many thousands of AI applications are deeply embedded in the infrastructure of every industry              In the late     s and early     s  AI technology became widely used as elements of larger systems                        but the field was rarely credited for these successes at the time 
Kaplan and Haenlein structure artificial intelligence along three evolutionary stages 

Artificial narrow intelligence   AI capable only of specific tasks 
Artificial general intelligence   AI with ability in several areas  and able to autonomously solve problems they were never even designed for 
Artificial superintelligence   AI capable of general tasks  including scientific creativity  social skills  and general wisdom            
To allow comparison with human performance  artificial intelligence can be evaluated on constrained and well defined problems  Such tests have been termed subject matter expert Turing tests  Also  smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an ever increasing number of positive results 
Humans still substantially outperform both GPT   and models trained on the ConceptARC benchmark that scored     on most  and     on one category  while humans     on all and     on one category

There are many useful abilities that can be described as showing some form of intelligence  This gives better insight into the comparative success of artificial intelligence in different areas 
AI  like electricity or the steam engine  is a general purpose technology  There is no consensus on how to characterize which tasks AI tends to excel at              Some versions of Moravec s paradox observe that humans are more likely to outperform machines in areas such as physical dexterity that have been the direct target of natural selection              While projects such as AlphaZero have succeeded in generating their own knowledge from scratch  many other machine learning projects require large training datasets                          Researcher Andrew Ng has suggested  as a  highly imperfect rule of thumb   that  almost anything a typical human can do with less than one second of mental thought  we can probably now or in the near future automate using AI              
Games provide a high profile benchmark for assessing rates of progress  many games have a large professional player base and a well established competitive rating system  AlphaGo brought the era of classical board game benchmarks to a close when Artificial Intelligence proved their competitive edge over humans in       Deep Mind s AlphaGo AI software program defeated the world s best professional Go Player Lee Sedol              Games of imperfect knowledge provide new challenges to AI in the area of game theory  the most prominent milestone in this area was brought to a close by Libratus  poker victory in                               E sports continue to provide additional benchmarks  Facebook AI  Deepmind  and others have engaged with the popular StarCraft franchise of videogames                         
Broad classes of outcome for an AI test may be given as 

optimal  it is not possible to perform better  note  some of these entries were solved by humans 
super human  performs better than all humans
high human  performs better than most humans
par human  performs similarly to most humans
sub human  performs worse than most humans

Proposed tests of artificial intelligence edit 
See also  Turing test        Versions
In his famous Turing test  Alan Turing picked language  the defining feature of human beings  for its basis              The Turing test is now considered too exploitable to be a meaningful benchmark             
The Feigenbaum test  proposed by the inventor of expert systems  tests a machine s knowledge and expertise about a specific subject              A paper by Jim Gray of Microsoft in      suggested extending the Turing test to speech understanding  speaking and recognizing objects and behavior             
Proposed  universal intelligence  tests aim to compare how well machines  humans  and even non human animals perform on problem sets that are generic as possible  At an extreme  the test suite can contain every possible problem  weighted by Kolmogorov complexity  however  these problem sets tend to be dominated by impoverished pattern matching exercises where a tuned AI can easily exceed human performance levels                                                             

Exams edit 
According to OpenAI  in      ChatGPT GPT   scored the   th percentile on the Uniform Bar Exam  On the SATs  GPT   scored the   th percentile on math  and the   rd percentile in Reading  amp  Writing  On the GREs  it scored on the   th percentile on the writing test    th percentile on the quantitative section  and   th percentile on the verbal section  It scored in the   th to    th percentile on the      USA Biology Olympiad semifinal exam  It scored a perfect     on several AP exams             
Independent researchers found in      that ChatGPT GPT      performed at or near the passing threshold  for the three parts of the United States Medical Licensing Examination  GPT     was also assessed to attain a low  but passing  grade from exams for four law school courses at the University of Minnesota              GPT   passed a text based radiology board style examination                         

Competitions edit 
Main article  Competitions and prizes in artificial intelligence
Many competitions and prizes  such as the Imagenet Challenge  promote research in artificial intelligence  The most common areas of competition include general machine intelligence  conversational behavior  data mining  robotic cars  and robot soccer as well as conventional games             

Past and current predictions edit 
An expert poll around       conducted by Katja Grace of the Future of Humanity Institute and associates  gave median estimates of   years for championship Angry Birds    years for the World Series of Poker  and   years for StarCraft  On more subjective tasks  the poll gave   years for folding laundry as well as an average human worker       years for expertly answering  easily Googleable  questions    years for average speech transcription    years for average telephone banking  and    years for expert songwriting  but over    years for writing a New York Times bestseller or winning the Putnam math competition

Human level artificial general intelligence  AGI  edit 
AI pioneer and economist Herbert A  Simon inaccurately predicted in        Machines will be capable  within twenty years  of doing any work a man can do   Similarly  in      Marvin Minsky wrote that  Within a generation    the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved              
Four polls conducted in      and      suggested that the median estimate among experts for when AGI would arrive was      to       depending on the poll                         
The Grace poll around      found results varied depending on how the question was framed  Respondents asked to estimate  when unaided machines can accomplish every task better and more cheaply than human workers  gave an aggregated median answer of    years and a     chance of it occurring within   years  Other respondents asked to estimate  when all occupations are fully automatable  That is  when for any occupation  machines could be built to carry out the task better and more cheaply than human workers  estimated a median of     years and a     probability of    years  The median response for when  AI researcher  could be fully automated was around    years  No link was found between seniority and optimism  but Asian researchers were much more optimistic than North American researchers on average  Asians predicted    years on average for  accomplish every task   compared with the    years predicted by North Americans
