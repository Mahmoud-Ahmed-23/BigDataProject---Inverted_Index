Reviews and RatingsKunwar PratapPlaced in Axtria as a Data AnalystThe course is structured in a very great way along with a thorough explanation of the STL  This course helped me to write efficient codes for particular problems like which data structure will be suitable to reduce the time complexity  Also  code problems have time constraints and C   STL helped me to write code within time constraints  In this course  everything was there that I needed like the internal design of the containers and how that particular container will be used  So overall this course helped very much in my coding journey Chitturi Raja RajeswariPlaced in TCS Digital as a Systems Engineer The course content is very good and informative  I have gained in depth knowledge about C   STL  the coding practice problems have also helped me to learn to code using STL in the C   Programming language  This course has also helped me to prepare for placements and got placed Ritik BansalPlaced in Cerner Corporation as a Software Engineer InternThe course includes all the in depth concepts for C   STL  Especially the lecture videos by Sandeep Jain Sir really helped me to learn C   concepts  The STL concepts explained in this course help one to write easy and efficient codes during Competitive programming challenges  I was able to crack Cerner Corporation  Samsung R amp D  Cognizant  and Wipro in my college campus placements with the help of GFG Courses Rajat SharmaSWE Internship at Microsoft The courses were structured in such a beautiful way that even with a little knowledge of programming  there were no difficulties in the learning  I have had a fantastic experience with GfG 
In beginning  I invested in GfG on the C   STL course that was my first course and I found that useful  later I invested in DSA Self paced  It helped me a lot in competitive programming by clearing all my basics of data structure  I reached   stars in CodeChef and Expert on CodeForces  Later I used GFG for practicing interview questions and OS DBMS CN for SDE Interview Preparation course for clearing all my CS core basics which ultimately help me to secure an internship at Microsoft
