Background edit 
The development of cyberspace has brought both advantages and disadvantages to society  While cyberspace has helped further technological innovation  it has also brought various forms of cyber crime             Since the dawn of cyberspace  individual  group  and nation state threat actors have engaged in cyber related offenses to exploit victim vulnerabilities             There are a number of threat actor categories who have different motives and targets 

Financially motivated actors edit 
Cyber criminals have two main objectives  First  they want to infiltrate a system to access valuable data or items  Second  they want to ensure that they avoid legal consequence after infiltrating a system  Cyber criminal can be broken down into three sub groups  mass scammers automated hackers  criminal infrastructure providers  and big game hunters            
Mass scammers and automated hackers include cyber criminals who attacks a system to gain monetary success  These threat actors use tools to infect organization computer systems  They then seek to gain financial compensation for victims to retrieve their data             Criminal infrastructure providers are a group of threat actors that aim to use tools to infect a computer system of an organization  Criminal infrastructure providers then sell the organization s infrastructure to an outside organization so they can exploit the system  Typically  victims of criminal infrastructure providers are unaware that their system has been infected             Big game hunters are another sub group of cyber criminals that aim to attack one single  but high value target  Big game hunters spend extra time learning about their target  including system architecture and other technologies used by their target  Victims can be targeted by email  phone attacks or by social engineering skills            

Nation state actors edit 
Nation state threat actors aim to gain intelligence of national interest  Nation state actors can be interested in a number of sectors  including nuclear  financial  and technology information             There are two ways nations use nation state actors  First  some nations make use of their own governmental intelligence agencies  Second  some nations work with organizations that specialize in cyber crime  States that use outside groups can be tracked  however  states might not necessarily take accountability for the act conducted by the outside group  Nation state actors can attack both other nations or other outside organizations  including private companies and non governmental organizations  They typically aim to bolster their nation state s counterintelligence strategy             Nation state attacks can include  strategic sabotage or critical infrastructure attacks  Nation states are considered an incredibly large group of threat actors in the cyber realm            

Ideologues  hacktivists and terrorists  edit 
Threat actors that are considered ideologues include two groups of attackers  hackers and terrorists  These two groups of attackers can be grouped together because they are similar in goals  However  hacktivists and terrorists differ in how they commit cyber crimes 
Hacktivism is a term that was coined in the early days of the World Wide Web  It is derived from a combination of two words  hacking and activism             Hacktivists typically are individuals or entities that are ready to commit cyber crimes to further their own beliefs and ideologues             Many hactivists include anti capitalists or anti corporate idealists and their attacks are inspired by similar political and social issues             Terrorism includes individuals or groups of people that aim to cause terror to achieve their goals  The main difference between hacktivists and terrorists is their end goal  Hacktivists are willing to break security laws to spread their message while terrorists aim to cause terror to achieve their goals  Ideologues  unlike other types of threat actors  are typically not motivated by financial incentives            

Thrill seekers and trolls edit 
A thrill seeker is a type of threat actor that attacks a system for the sole purpose of experimentation             Thrill seekers are interested in learning more about how computer systems and networks operate and want to see how much data they can infiltrate within a computer system  While they do not aim to cause major damage  they can cause problems to an organization s system  As time has gone on  thrill seekers have evolved into modern trolls  Similar to thrill seekers  a troll is a type of person or group that attacks a system for recreation  However  unlike thrill seekers  trolls aim to cause malice             Modern day trolls can cause misinformation and harm 

Insiders and competitors edit 
Insiders are a type of threat actor that can either be an insider who sells network information to other adversaries  or it can be a disgruntled employee who feels like they need to retaliate because they feel like they have been treated unfairly             Insider attacks can be challenging to prevent  however  with a structured logging and analysis plan in place  insider threat actors can be detected after a successful attack  Business competitors can be another threat actor that can harm organizations  Competitors can gain access to organization secrets that are typically secure  Organizations can try to gain a stronger knowledge of business intelligence to protect themselves against a competition threat actor

Techniques edit 
Phishing
Phishing is one method that threat actors use to obtain sensitive data  including usernames  passwords  credit card information  and social security numbers  Phishing attacks typically occur when a threat actor sends a message designed to trick a victim into either revealing sensitive information to the threat actor or to deploy malicious software on the victim s system             
Cross Site Scripting
Cross site scripting is a type of security vulnerability that can be found when a threat actor injects a client side script into an otherwise safe and trusted web applications              The code then launches an infectious script onto a victim s system  This allows a threat actor to access sensitive data             
SQL Injections
SQL injection is a code injection technique used by threat actors to attack any data driven applications  Threat actors can inject malicious SQL statements  This allows threat actors to extract  alter  or delete victim s information
