Information retrieval  IR  in computing and information science is the task of identifying and retrieving information system resources that are relevant to an information need   The information need can be specified in the form of a search query  In the case of document retrieval  queries can be based on full text or other content based indexing  Information retrieval is the science            of searching for information in a document  searching for documents themselves  and also searching for the metadata that describes data  and for databases of texts  images or sounds 
Automated information retrieval systems are used to reduce what has been called information overload  An IR system is a software system that provides access to books  journals and other documents  it also stores and manages those documents  Web search engines are the most visible IR applications 


Overview edit 
An information retrieval process begins when a user enters a query into the system  Queries are formal statements of information needs  for example search strings in web search engines  In information retrieval  a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection  Instead  several objects may match the query  perhaps with different degrees of relevance 
An object is an entity that is represented by information in a content collection or database  User queries are matched against the database information  However  as opposed to classical SQL queries of a database  in information retrieval the results returned may or may not match the query  so results are typically ranked  This ranking of results is a key difference of information retrieval searching compared to database searching            
Depending on the application the data objects may be  for example  text documents  images             audio             mind maps            or videos  Often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system  but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates or metadata 
Most IR systems compute a numeric score on how well each object in the database matches the query  and rank the objects according to this value  The top ranking objects are then shown to the user  The process may then be iterated if the user wishes to refine the query            

History edit 
there is     a machine called the Univac     whereby letters and figures are coded as a pattern of magnetic spots on a long steel tape  By this means the text of a document  preceded by its subject code symbol  can be recorded     the machine     automatically selects and types out those references which have been coded in any desired way at a rate of     words a minute        J  E  Holmstrom      
The idea of using computers to search for relevant pieces of information was popularized in the article As We May Think by Vannevar Bush in                  It would appear that Bush was inspired by patents for a  statistical machine    filed by Emanuel Goldberg in the     s and     s   that searched for documents stored on film             The first description of a computer searching for information was described by Holmstrom in                  detailing an early mention of the Univac computer  Automated information retrieval systems were introduced in the     s  one even featured in the      romantic comedy Desk Set  In the     s  the first large information retrieval research group was formed by Gerard Salton at Cornell  By the     s several different retrieval techniques had been shown to perform well on small text corpora such as the Cranfield collection  several thousand documents              Large scale retrieval systems  such as the Lockheed Dialog system  came into use early in the     s 
In       the US Department of Defense along with the National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST   cosponsored the Text Retrieval Conference  TREC  as part of the TIPSTER text program  The aim of this was to look into the information retrieval community by supplying the infrastructure that was needed for evaluation of text retrieval methodologies on a very large text collection  This catalyzed research on methods that scale to huge corpora  The introduction of web search engines has boosted the need for very large scale retrieval systems even further 
By the late     s  the rise of the World Wide Web fundamentally transformed information retrieval  While early search engines such as AltaVista        and Yahoo         offered keyword based retrieval  they were limited in scale and ranking refinement  The breakthrough came in      with the founding of Google  which introduced the PageRank algorithm              using the web s hyperlink structure to assess page importance and improve relevance ranking 
During the     s  web search systems evolved rapidly with the integration of machine learning techniques  These systems began to incorporate user behavior data  e g   click through logs   query reformulation  and content based signals to improve search accuracy and personalization  In       Microsoft launched Bing  introducing features that would later incorporate semantic web technologies through the development of its Satori knowledge base  Academic analysis             have highlighted Bing s semantic capabilities  including structured data use and entity recognition  as part of a broader industry shift toward improving search relevance and understanding user intent through natural language processing 
A major leap occurred in       when Google deployed BERT  Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers  to better understand the contextual meaning of queries and documents  This marked one of the first times deep neural language models were used at scale in real world retrieval systems              BERT s bidirectional training enabled a more refined comprehension of word relationships in context  improving the handling of natural language queries  Because of its success  transformer based models gained traction in academic research and commercial search applications             
Simultaneously  the research community began exploring neural ranking models that outperformed traditional lexical based methods  Long standing benchmarks such as the Text REtrieval Conference  TREC   initiated in       and more recent evaluation frameworks  Microsoft MARCO MAchine Reading COmprehension                     became central to training and evaluating retrieval systems across multiple tasks and domains  MS MARCO has also been adopted in the TREC Deep Learning Tracks  where it serves as a core dataset for evaluating advances in neural ranking models within a standardized benchmarking environment             
As deep learning became integral to information retrieval systems  researchers began to categorize neural approaches into three broad classes  sparse  dense  and hybrid models  Sparse models  including traditional term based methods and learned variants like SPLADE  rely on interpretable representations and inverted indexes to enable efficient exact term matching with added semantic signals              Dense models  such as dual encoder architectures like ColBERT  use continuous vector embeddings to support semantic similarity beyond keyword overlap              Hybrid models aim to combine the advantages of both  balancing the lexical  token  precision of sparse methods with the semantic depth of dense models  This way of categorizing models balances scalability  relevance  and efficiency in retrieval systems             
As IR systems increasingly rely on deep learning  concerns around bias  fairness  and explainability have also come to the picture  Research is now focused not just on relevance and efficiency  but on transparency  accountability  and user trust in retrieval algorithms

Model types edit 
Categorization of IR models  translated from German entry  original source Dominik Kuropka 
In order to effectively retrieve relevant documents by IR strategies  the documents are typically transformed into a suitable representation  Each retrieval strategy incorporates a specific model for its document representation purposes  The picture on the right illustrates the relationship of some common models  In the picture  the models are categorized according to two dimensions  the mathematical basis and the properties of the model 

First dimension  mathematical basis edit 
Set theoretic models represent documents as sets of words or phrases  Similarities are usually derived from set theoretic operations on those sets  Common models are 
Standard Boolean model
Extended Boolean model
Fuzzy retrieval
Algebraic models represent documents and queries usually as vectors  matrices  or tuples  The similarity of the query vector and document vector is represented as a scalar value 
Vector space model
Generalized vector space model
 Enhanced  Topic based Vector Space Model
Extended Boolean model
Latent semantic indexing a k a  latent semantic analysis
Probabilistic models treat the process of document retrieval as a probabilistic inference  Similarities are computed as probabilities that a document is relevant for a given query  Probabilistic theorems like Bayes  theorem are often used in these models 
Binary Independence Model
Probabilistic relevance model on which is based the okapi  BM    relevance function
Uncertain inference
Language models
Divergence from randomness model
Latent Dirichlet allocation
Feature based retrieval models view documents as vectors of values of feature functions  or just features  and seek the best way to combine these features into a single relevance score  typically by learning to rank methods  Feature functions are arbitrary functions of document and query  and as such can easily incorporate almost any other retrieval model as just another feature 
Second dimension  properties of the model edit 
Models without term interdependencies treat different terms words as independent  This fact is usually represented in vector space models by the orthogonality assumption of term vectors or in probabilistic models by an independency assumption for term variables 
Models with immanent term interdependencies allow a representation of interdependencies between terms  However the degree of the interdependency between two terms is defined by the model itself  It is usually directly or indirectly derived  e g  by dimensional reduction  from the co occurrence of those terms in the whole set of documents 
Models with transcendent term interdependencies allow a representation of interdependencies between terms  but they do not allege how the interdependency between two terms is defined  They rely on an external source for the degree of interdependency between two terms   For example  a human or sophisticated algorithms  
Third Dimension  representational approach based classification edit 
In addition to the theoretical distinctions  modern information retrieval models are also categorized on how queries and documents are represented and compared  using a practical classification distinguishing between sparse  dense and hybrid models             

Sparse models utilize interpretable  term based representations and typically rely on inverted index structures  Classical methods such as TF IDF and BM   fall under this category  along with more recent learned sparse models that integrate neural architectures while retaining sparsity             
Dense models represent queries and documents as continuous vectors using deep learning models  typically transformer based encoders  These models enable semantic similarity matching beyond exact term overlap and are used in tasks involving semantic search and question answering             
Hybrid models aim to combine the strengths of both approaches  integrating lexical  tokens  and semantic signals through score fusion  late interaction  or multi stage ranking pipelines             
This classification has become increasingly common in both academic and the real world applications and is getting widely adopted and used in evaluation benchmarks for Information Retrieval models                         

 Performance and correctness measures edit 
Main article  Evaluation measures  information retrieval 
The evaluation of an information retrieval system  is the process of assessing how well a system meets the information needs of its users  In general  measurement considers a collection of documents to be searched and a search query  Traditional evaluation metrics  designed for Boolean retrieval     clarification needed      or top k retrieval  include precision and recall  All measures assume a ground truth notion of relevance  every document is known to be either relevant or non relevant to a particular query  In practice  queries may be ill posed and there may be different shades of relevance
