							CAIRO  Mahmoud Ezzat  Secretary General of the Muslim Brotherhood  MB   has denied reports that the banned  but tolerated Islamist group convened to establish an official political following President Mubarak       s announced plans to amend the constitution 
 As far as I know no such meeting took place and no action or decisions were taken concerning Al Azhar University  demonstrations  or the constitutional amendments   Ezzat said in a phone interview with The Daily Star Egypt 
 The real news is that    members of the group were arrested today after dawn  Jan            nine from Sharqia  eight from Gharbiya and two from Mansourah   he said 
The    detainees were allegedly dragged out of their homes after returning from a nearby mosque to perform the dawn prayer during the fourth day of Eid Al Adha  
Ezzat insisted the group did not officially announce any plans to become a licensed political party  
He said   Some members of the People       s Assembly from the group spoke about that issue but no official steps have been taken   
Ezzat explained that the MB had been demanding official party status for thirty years and still continue to do so to no avail    
His statements came following reports last week that the group had held a press conference on Dec     announcing their pursuit of licensing as an official political party 
 It is the right for all political parties and powers to create official parties   said Gamal Eid  president of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information 
Not only should the MB have a political party  but also any other religion or ideology should have the same space to build its own party  Eid added 
 Yes  sure and why not   said Gamal El Bana  an Islamic intellectual and writer   and Copts should make one too   he added 
 If Egyptians want to set up a political party in Egypt  no one should stop them  I am with freedom and democracy all the way and I see the freedom of creating a political party a holy thing   El Bana added 
But Ezzat believes the political parties committee  entrusted with issuing licenses for legalization of new parties is an obstacle towards a multi party environment 
       The new the political parties committee  which I call the        anti new parties committee        will make sure that nothing will ever change   Ezzat said
