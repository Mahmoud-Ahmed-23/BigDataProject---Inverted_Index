 Rogue state   or sometimes  outlaw state   is a term applied by some international theorists to states that they consider threatening to the world s peace  These states meet certain criteria  such as being ruled by authoritarian or totalitarian governments that severely restrict human rights  sponsoring terrorism  or seeking to proliferate weapons of mass destruction             The term is used most by the United States  although the US State Department officially stopped using the term in            citation needed      in his speech at the United Nations  UN  in       U S  President Donald Trump reiterated this phrase             U S  politicians have used the term to describe countries such as Iran  Syria  North Korea  Afghanistan  Cuba and Venezuela             However  the term has been applied to other countries  as well as to the United States itself            


Usage by the United States edit 
As early as July       President Ronald Reagan stated that  we are not going to tolerate   attacks from outlaw states by the strangest collection of misfits  looney tunes  and squalid criminals since the advent of the Third Reich   but it fell to the Clinton administration to elaborate on this concept             In the      issue of Foreign Affairs  U S  National Security Advisor Anthony Lake labelled five nations as rogue states  North Korea  Cuba  Iran  Libya under Muammar Gaddafi  and Iraq under Saddam Hussein  He described these regimes as  recalcitrant and outlaw states that not only choose to remain outside the family but also assault its basic values              Cuba was put on the list solely because of the political influence of the Cuban American community and specifically that of the Cuban American National Foundation      citation needed       pre Jorge Mas Santos   whereas Syria and Pakistan avoided being added to the list because the United States hoped that Syria could play a constructive role in the Arab Israeli peace process  and because Washington had long maintained close relations with Pakistan      citation needed     
Three other nations  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  Sudan  and the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan  were treated as rogue states as well      citation needed      The US State Department at times labelled Yugoslavia as a  rogue state  because its leader  Slobodan Milo evi   had been accused of violating the rights of his nation s citizens  including but not limited to attempted genocide in Croatia and orchestrating the Srebrenica massacre in eastern Bosnia      citation needed     
The United States employed several tools to isolate and punish  rogue states   Tough unilateral economic sanctions  often at congressional behest  were imposed on or tightened against Iran  Libya  Cuba  Sudan  and Afghanistan  After the conclusion of the Gulf War in       the United States selectively used airpower against Iraq for years during the Iraqi no fly zones to force them in complying with various United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding disarmament  i e   Resolution      and human rights  i e   Resolution       Cruise missiles were fired at Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for terrorist attacks against U S  embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August       In March       NATO launched a massive air bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in response to the Yugoslav Army s crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in the province of Kosovo      citation needed     
In the last six months of the Clinton administration  U S  Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced that the term rogue state would be abolished in June       in favour of the term states of concern             as three of the nations listed as  rogue states   Libya  Iran  and North Korea  no longer met the conditions established to define a rogue state      citation needed     
Libya was removed from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list in      after achieving success through diplomacy             Relations with Libya also became more mutual following the eight month Libyan Civil War in       which resulted in the National Transitional Council ousting longtime Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi from power            
In       after the US reopened its embassy in Cuba and restarted diplomatic relations with the Cuban government  Cuba was removed from the list of State sponsors of terrorism and was no longer referred to as a  rogue state              
More recently  the administration of U S  President Donald Trump labelled Venezuela a  rogue state   During the      UN general assembly  UN ambassador Nikki Haley called Venezuela a global threat and a  dangerous narco state   Some figures of the Venezuelan government  like Vice President Tareck el Aissami and Minister of Defense Vladimir Padrino L pez  were permanently banned from entering US territory  due to their involvement with human rights abuses and drug cartels  Later in       the US government banned all high ranking Venezuelan government officials from entering US territory                          Currently  due to the      Venezuelan presidential crisis  Nicolas Maduro s government  which controls Venezuela de facto  is not recognized as legitimate by the United States or most other states in the Western Hemisphere  with the exceptions of Cuba  Dominica  Nicaragua  Saint Kitts and Nevis  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  and Suriname             
On    June       U S  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the People s Republic of China a  rogue actor  at the Virtual Copenhagen Democracy Summit  saying that  General Secretary Xi Jinping has green lighted a brutal campaign of repression against Chinese Muslims  a human rights violation on a scale we haven t seen since World War II   In addition  Pompeo cited China s handling of COVID      malicious cyber campaigns  it conducted  and its treatment of Hong Kong citizens as reasons for labeling China as a rogue actor             

Later terms edit 
In the aftermath of the September    attacks  the Bush administration returned to using a similar term  The concept of rogue states was replaced by the Bush administration with the concept of an Axis of Evil  which encompassed Iraq  Iran  and North Korea  U S  President George W  Bush first spoke of this  Axis of Evil  during his January      State of the Union Address              More terms  such as Outposts of Tyranny  would follow suit             
Because the U S  government remains the most active proponent of the expression rogue state  the term has received much criticism from those who disagree with American foreign policy  Both the concepts of rogue states and the Axis of Evil have been criticized by scholars  including philosopher Jacques Derrida and linguist Noam Chomsky  who considered it more or less a justification of imperialism and a useful word for propaganda              Some critics charge that rogue state merely means any state that is generally hostile to the U S   or even one that opposes the U S  without necessarily posing a wider threat                          Others  such as author William Blum  argued that the term is also applicable to the U S  and Israel  In his Rogue State  A Guide to the World s Only Superpower  Blum claimed that the United States defines itself as a rogue state through its foreign policy      page      needed     

United States as a rogue state edit

Usage by Turkey edit
