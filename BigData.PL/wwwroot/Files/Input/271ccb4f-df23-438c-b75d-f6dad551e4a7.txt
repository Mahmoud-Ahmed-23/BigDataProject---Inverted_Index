							Bookshelves are stacked with nostalgia  Browsing through the books is a flash from the past year  Readers everywhere were treated to a literary rollercoaster of emotions We witnessed the end of an era with the final installment in the Harry Potter series  though there are hints at an encore  while Middle East politics heated up with the launch of Jimmy Carter       s controversial book on the Palestinian situation  The local literary scene was just as eventful  as Alaa El Aswany       s latest novel hit the stands unleashing the expected gasps from shocked readers  Fans of Naguib Mahfouz were not left out in the cold         The Children of the Alley  was finally released in Egypt in Arabic    The beauty of books is that as we turn the final page of the year  we can still glance at our bookshelves and get the same rush of emotion we felt when we first read them  After all  there       s always more room on the shelves for the exciting year ahead  
Harry Potter and the Deathly HallowsBy JK RowlingWe saw the tears from JK Rowling         and her fans         as she bid farewell to the blockbuster Harry Potter series  Leading up to the publication of the seventh         and supposedly final         installment  the book hit stores among speculation  internet leaks  and lines of children dressed in Hogwart uniforms    Even months after the book       s publication  Rowling triggered controversy by revealing that Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore was gay USA Today named        Deathly Hallows  its book of the year         wands down         Rowling gave her story an ending that was as graceful  unpredictable and satisfying as the series itself  She made us believe that the imagination         like her own little wizard  now all grown up         still lives   wrote USA Today 
Palestine  Peace Not ApartheidBy Jimmy CarterThe crowning achievement of Jimmy Carter       s presidency was the Camp David Accords  and he has continued his public and private diplomacy ever since  winning the Nobel Peace Prize in      for his decades of work for peace  human rights  and international development  So it was no surprise when his insider look at the Palestinian issue grabbed readers        attention The book       s title spurred a huge controversy  In an interview with Amazon  Carter said         Forced segregation in the West Bank and terrible oppression of the Palestinians create a situation accurately described by the word  I made it plain in the text that this abuse is not based on racism  but on the desire of a minority of Israelis to confiscate and colonize Palestinian land        My surprise is that most critics of the book have ignored the facts about Palestinian persecution and its proposals for future peace and resorted to personal attacks on the author  No one could visit the occupied territories and deny that the book is accurate  
The Grass is Singing By Doris LessingBritish novelist and Nobel laureate was described by the Swedish Academy as        that epicist of the female experience  who with skepticism  fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilization to scrutiny   The    year old author         too ill to travel to Sweden for the ceremony         concluded in her acceptance speech that the        storyteller is deep inside every one of us  Her first novel         The Grass is Singing          set in South Africa under white rule  tells the story of human disintegration through Mary Turner  a confident  independent woman who is transformed by depression and frustration spurred on by the failure of her husband  The monotony of farm life drones on until the arrival of a vigorous black servant  Mary is suddenly trapped in a web of attraction as well as repulsion as she battles with racism in colonial South Africa 
A Thousand Splendid SunsBy Khaled HoisseiniHosseini       s first novel  bestselling        The Kite Runner   was a hard act to follow  But his newest novel has dominated the bestseller lists since its publication last summer  This Afghan epic tells the story of the nation       s tumultuous times from a female perspective  Hosseini       s style is sweet and simple  tugging at his readers        heartstrings 
ChicagoBy Alaa El AswanyThe Arabic publication caused quite a stir earlier this year with its reference to the G spot  written in English for want of a familiar Arabic term   El Aswany tackles the tough societal issues in his own frank manner as a mosaic of Egyptians and American lives run into each other at a university campus in Chicago  The English translation just hit bookstores 
Awlad Haritna  Children of the Alley By Naguib MahfouzThis year  Mahfouz       s most controversial novel finally launched its local  Arabic publication  Originally issued in      as a serial in a local newspaper  it was never republished in Egypt until this year The allegorical novel tells the story of the multi generational struggle of the descendants of the patriarch Gabalawi against social  political  and economic injustice  It provoked religious leaders in Egypt who opposed it because of its reference to the Prophet Mohamed  though Mahfouz did not refer to him specifically by name
