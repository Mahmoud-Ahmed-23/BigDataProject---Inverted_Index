Artificial intelligence  AI  refers to the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence  such as learning  reasoning  problem solving  perception  and decision making  It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals             Such machines may be called AIs 
High profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines  e g   Google Search   recommendation systems  used by YouTube  Amazon  and Netflix   virtual assistants  e g   Google Assistant  Siri  and Alexa   autonomous vehicles  e g   Waymo   generative and creative tools  e g   ChatGPT and AI art   and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games  e g   chess and Go   However  many AI applications are not perceived as AI   A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications  often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it s not labeled AI anymore                        
Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools  The traditional goals of AI research include learning  reasoning  knowledge representation  planning  natural language processing  perception  and support for robotics      a      General intelligence the ability to complete any task performed by a human on an at least equal level is among the field s long term goals             To reach these goals  AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques  including search and mathematical optimization  formal logic  artificial neural networks  and methods based on statistics  operations research  and economics      b      AI also draws upon psychology  linguistics  philosophy  neuroscience  and other fields            
Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in                  and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history                        followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding  known as AI winters                         Funding and interest vastly increased after      when deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques              This growth accelerated further after      with the transformer architecture              and by the early     s many billions of dollars were being invested in AI and the field experienced rapid ongoing progress in what has become known as the AI boom  The emergence of advanced generative AI in the midst of the AI boom and its ability to create and modify content exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about the risks of AI and its long term effects in the future  prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology 


Goals
The general problem of simulating  or creating  intelligence has been broken into subproblems  These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display  The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research      a     

Reasoning and problem solving
Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step by step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions              By the late     s and     s  methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information  employing concepts from probability and economics             
Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a  combinatorial explosion   They become exponentially slower as the problems grow              Even humans rarely use the step by step deduction that early AI research could model  They solve most of their problems using fast  intuitive judgments              Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem 

Knowledge representation
An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts 
Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering             allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real world facts  Formal knowledge representations are used in content based indexing and retrieval              scene interpretation              clinical decision support              knowledge discovery  mining  interesting  and actionable inferences from large databases               and other areas             
A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program  An ontology is the set of objects  relations  concepts  and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge              Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects  properties  categories  and relations between objects              situations  events  states  and time              causes and effects              knowledge about knowledge  what we know about what other people know               default reasoning  things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing               and many other aspects and domains of knowledge 
Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge  the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous               and the sub symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge  much of what people know is not represented as  facts  or  statements  that they could express verbally               There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition  the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications      c     

Planning and decision making
An  agent  is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world  A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen      d                  In automated planning  the agent has a specific goal              In automated decision making  the agent has preferences there are some situations it would prefer to be in  and some situations it is trying to avoid  The decision making agent assigns a number to each situation  called the  utility   that measures how much the agent prefers it  For each possible action  it can calculate the  expected utility   the utility of all possible outcomes of the action  weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur  It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility             
In classical planning  the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be              In most real world problems  however  the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in  it is  unknown  or  unobservable   and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action  it is not  deterministic    It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked             
In some problems  the agent s preferences may be uncertain  especially if there are other agents or humans involved  These can be learned  e g   with inverse reinforcement learning   or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences              Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions              The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large  so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be 
A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action  A policy associates a decision with each possible state  The policy could be calculated  e g   by iteration   be heuristic  or it can be learned             
Game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents             

Learning
Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically              It has been a part of AI from the beginning      e     


There are several kinds of machine learning  Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance              Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers  and comes in two main varieties  classification  where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in  and regression  where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input              
In reinforcement learning  the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones  The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as  good               Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem              Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning             
Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity  by sample complexity  how much data is required   or by other notions of optimization             


Natural language processing
Natural language processing  NLP              allows programs to read  write and communicate in human languages such as English  Specific problems include speech recognition  speech synthesis  machine translation  information extraction  information retrieval and question answering             
Early work  based on Noam Chomsky s generative grammar and semantic networks  had difficulty with word sense disambiguation     f      unless restricted to small domains called  micro worlds   due to the common sense knowledge problem               Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages  and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure 
Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding  representing words  typically as vectors encoding their meaning               transformers  a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism               and others              In       generative pre trained transformer  or  GPT   language models began to generate coherent text                          and by       these models were able to get human level scores on the bar exam  SAT test  GRE test  and many other real world applications             

Perception
Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors  such as cameras  microphones  wireless signals  active lidar  sonar  radar  and tactile sensors  to deduce aspects of the world  Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input             
The field includes speech recognition              image classification              facial recognition  object recognition             object tracking              and robotic perception             

Social intelligence
Kismet  a robot head which was made in the     s  it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions             
Affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize  interpret  process  or simulate human feeling  emotion  and mood              For example  some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously  it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction  or to otherwise facilitate human computer interaction 
However  this tends to give na ve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents              Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and  more recently  multimodal sentiment analysis  wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject             

General intelligence
A machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence            

Techniques
AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above      b     

Search and optimization
AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions              There are two very different kinds of search used in AI  state space search and local search 

State space search
State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state              For example  planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals  attempting to find a path to a target goal  a process called means ends analysis             
Simple exhaustive searches             are rarely sufficient for most real world problems  the search space  the number of places to search  quickly grows to astronomical numbers  The result is a search that is too slow or never completes               Heuristics  or  rules of thumb  can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal             
Adversarial search is used for game playing programs  such as chess or Go  It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves  looking for a winning position             

Local search
Illustration of gradient descent for   different starting points  two parameters  represented by the plan coordinates  are adjusted in order to minimize the loss function  the height  Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem  It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally             
Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function  Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks              through the backpropagation algorithm 
Another type of local search is evolutionary computation  which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by  mutating  and  recombining  them  selecting only the fittest to survive each generation             
Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms  Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization  inspired by bird flocking  and ant colony optimization  inspired by ant trails              

Logic
Formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation             
Formal logic comes in two main forms  propositional logic  which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as  and    or    not  and  implies               and predicate logic  which also operates on objects  predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as  Every X is a Y  and  There are some Xs that are Ys               
Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement  conclusion  from other statements that are given and assumed to be true  the premises               Proofs can be structured as proof trees  in which nodes are labelled by sentences  and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules 
Given a problem and a set of premises  problem solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms  In the case of Horn clauses  problem solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem              In the more general case of the clausal form of first order logic  resolution is a single  axiom free rule of inference  in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved             
Inference in both Horn clause logic and first order logic is undecidable  and therefore intractable  However  backward reasoning with Horn clauses  which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog  is Turing complete  Moreover  its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages             
Fuzzy logic assigns a  degree of truth  between   and    It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true             
Non monotonic logics  including logic programming with negation as failure  are designed to handle default reasoning              Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains 

Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning
A simple Bayesian network  with the associated conditional probability tables
Many problems in AI  including in reasoning  planning  learning  perception  and robotics  require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information  AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics              Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan  using decision theory  decision analysis              and information value theory              These tools include models such as Markov decision processes              dynamic decision networks              game theory and mechanism design             
Bayesian networks             are a tool that can be used for reasoning  using the Bayesian inference algorithm       g                  learning  using the expectation maximization algorithm       h                  planning  using decision networks              and perception  using dynamic Bayesian networks              
Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering  prediction  smoothing  and finding explanations for streams of data  thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time  e g   hidden Markov models or Kalman filters

Classifiers and statistical learning methods
The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types  classifiers  e g    if shiny then diamond    on one hand  and controllers  e g    if diamond then pick up    on the other hand  Classifiers             are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match  They can be fine tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning  Each pattern  also called an  observation   is labeled with a certain predefined class  All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set  When a new observation is received  that observation is classified based on previous experience             
There are many kinds of classifiers in use              The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm               K nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid     s  and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine  SVM  displaced k nearest neighbor in the     s              
The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the  most widely used learner               at Google  due in part to its scalability              
Neural networks are also used as classifiers              

Artificial neural networks
A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes  akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain 
An artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons  which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain  It is trained to recognise patterns  once trained  it can recognise those patterns in fresh data  There is an input  at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output  Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold  the data is transmitted to the next layer  A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least   hidden layers              
Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training  The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm               Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data  In theory  a neural network can learn any function              
In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction               Recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input  which allows short term memories of previous input events  Long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks               Perceptrons              use only a single layer of neurons  deep learning              uses multiple layers  Convolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are  close  to each other this is especially important in image processing  where a local set of neurons must identify an  edge  before the network can identify an object              


Deep learning

Deep learning              uses several layers of neurons between the network s inputs and outputs  The multiple layers can progressively extract higher level features from the raw input  For example  in image processing  lower layers may identify edges  while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits  letters  or faces              
Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence  including computer vision  speech recognition  natural language processing  image classification               and others  The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of                    The sudden success of deep learning in           did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough  deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people  as far back as the     s      i      but because of two factors  the incredible increase in computer power  including the hundred fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs  and the availability of vast amounts of training data  especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing  such as ImageNet      j     

GPT
Generative pre trained transformers  GPT  are large language models  LLMs  that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences  Text based GPT models are pretrained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet  The pretraining consists of predicting the next token  a token being usually a word  subword  or punctuation   Throughout this pretraining  GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human like text by repeatedly predicting the next token  Typically  a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful  useful  and harmless  usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback  RLHF   Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called  hallucinations   These can be reduced with RLHF and quality data  but the problem has been getting worse for reasoning systems               Such systems are used in chatbots  which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text                           
Current models and services include Gemini  formerly Bard   ChatGPT  Grok  Claude  Copilot  and LLaMA               Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data  modalities  such as images  videos  sound  and text              

Hardware and software
Main articles  Programming languages for artificial intelligence and Hardware for artificial intelligence
In the late     s  graphics processing units  GPUs  that were increasingly designed with AI specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software had replaced previously used central processing unit  CPUs  as the dominant means for large scale  commercial and academic  machine learning models  training               Specialized programming languages such as Prolog were used in early AI research               but general purpose programming languages like Python have become predominant              
The transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every    months a trend known as Moore s law  named after the Intel co founder Gordon Moore  who first identified it  Improvements in GPUs have been even faster               a trend sometimes called Huang s law               named after Nvidia co founder and CEO Jensen Huang

Health and medicine
Main article  Artificial intelligence in healthcare
The application of AI in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life               Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath  medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI  if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients                           
For medical research  AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data  This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication               It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research                            New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways  For example  AlphaFold          demonstrated the ability to approximate  in hours rather than months  the  D structure of a protein               In       it was reported that AI guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug resistant bacteria               In       researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson s disease drug treatments  Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping  or aggregation  of alpha synuclein  the protein that characterises Parkinson s disease   They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten fold and reduce the cost by a thousand fold                           

Games
Main article  Game artificial intelligence
Game playing programs have been used since the     s to demonstrate and test AI s most advanced techniques               Deep Blue became the first computer chess playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion  Garry Kasparov  on    May                    In       in a Jeopardy  quiz show exhibition match  IBM s question answering system  Watson  defeated the two greatest Jeopardy  champions  Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings  by a significant margin               In March       AlphaGo won   out of   games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol  becoming the first computer Go playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps  Then  in       it defeated Ke Jie  who was the best Go player in the world               Other programs handle imperfect information games  such as the poker playing program Pluribus               DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models  such as with MuZero  which could be trained to play chess  Go  or Atari games               In       DeepMind s AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II  a particularly challenging real time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map               In       an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition  winning against four of the world s best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning               In       Google DeepMind introduced SIMA  a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen open world video games by observing screen output  as well as executing short  specific tasks in response to natural language instructions              

Mathematics
Large language models  such as GPT    Gemini  Claude  LLaMa or Mistral  are increasingly used in mathematics  These probabilistic models are versatile  but can also produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations  They sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from  but also methods such as supervised fine tuning              or trained classifiers with human annotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections               A February      study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low  even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data               One technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correct reasoning steps  rather than just the correct result               The Alibaba Group developed a version of its Qwen models called Qwen  Math  that achieved state of the art performance on several mathematical benchmarks  including     accuracy on the MATH dataset of competition mathematics problems               In January       Microsoft proposed the technique rStar Math that leverages Monte Carlo tree search and step by step reasoning  enabling a relatively small language model like Qwen  B to solve     of the AIME      and     of the MATH benchmark problems              
Alternatively  dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as AlphaTensor  AlphaGeometry and AlphaProof all from Google DeepMind               Llemma from EleutherAI              or Julius              
When natural language is used to describe mathematical problems  converters can transform such prompts into a formal language such as Lean to define mathematical tasks 
Some models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests  others to serve as educational tools in mathematics              
Topological deep learning integrates various topological approaches 

Finance
Finance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied AI tools are being deployed  from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance  where automated  robot advisers  have been in use for some years              
According to Nicolas Firzli  director of the World Pensions  amp  Investments Forum  it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative AI informed financial products and services  He argues that  the deployment of AI tools will simply further automatise things  destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking  financial planning  and pension advice in the process  but I m not sure it will unleash a new wave of  e g   sophisticated  pension innovation

Generative AI
Vincent van Gogh in watercolour created by generative AI softwareThese paragraphs are an excerpt from Generative artificial intelligence  edit 
Generative artificial intelligence  Generative AI  GenAI               or GAI  is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text  images  videos  or other forms of data                                         These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data                           based on the input  which often comes in the form of natural language prompts                             
Generative AI tools have become more common since an  AI boom  in the     s  This boom was made possible by improvements in transformer based deep neural networks  particularly large language models  LLMs   Major tools include chatbots such as ChatGPT  DeepSeek  Copilot  Gemini  and LLaMA  text to image artificial intelligence image generation systems such as Stable Diffusion  Midjourney  and DALL E  and text to video AI generators such as Sora                                                      Technology companies developing generative AI include OpenAI  Anthropic  Microsoft  Google  DeepSeek  and Baidu                                        

Generative AI has raised many ethical questions  It can be used for cybercrime  or to deceive or manipulate people through fake news or deepfakes               Even if used ethically  it may lead to the mass replacement of human jobs               The tools themselves have been criticized as violating intellectual property laws  since they are trained on and emulate copyrighted works of art              
Agents
Artificial intelligent  AI  agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment  make decisions  and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals  These agents can interact with users  their environment  or other agents  AI agents are used in various applications  including virtual assistants  chatbots  autonomous vehicles  game playing systems  and industrial robotics  AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming  available computational resources  and hardware limitations  This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities  In real world applications  AI agents often face time constraints for decision making and action execution  Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms  enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training  Using machine learning  AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks                                        

Sexuality
Applications of AI in this domain include AI enabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer prediction               AI integrated sex toys  e g   teledildonics                AI generated sexual education content               and AI agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners  e g   Replika                 AI is also used for the production of non consensual deepfake pornography  raising significant ethical and legal concerns              
AI technologies have also been used to attempt to identify online gender based violence and online sexual grooming of minors                           

Other industry specific tasks
There are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions  In a      survey  one in five companies reported having incorporated  AI  in some offerings or processes               A few examples are energy storage  medical diagnosis  military logistics  applications that predict the result of judicial decisions  foreign policy  or supply chain management 
AI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing  AI has been used to investigate if and how people evacuated in large scale and small scale evacuations using historical data from GPS  videos or social media  Further  AI can provide real time information on the real time evacuation conditions                                        
In agriculture  AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation  fertilization  pesticide treatments or increasing yield  Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development  AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes  monitor soil moisture  operate agricultural robots  conduct predictive analytics  classify livestock pig call emotions  automate greenhouses  detect diseases and pests  and save water 
Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications  mainly for  classification  regression  clustering  forecasting  generation  discovery  and the development of new scientific insights   For example  it is used for discovering exoplanets  forecasting solar activity  and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy  Additionally  it could be used for activities in space  such as space exploration  including the analysis of data from space missions  real time science decisions of spacecraft  space debris avoidance  and more autonomous operation 
During the      Indian elections  US    million was spent on authorized AI generated content  notably by creating deepfakes of allied  including sometimes deceased  politicians to better engage with voters  and by translating speeches to various local languages              

Ethics
Main article  Ethics of artificial intelligence
AI has potential benefits and potential risks               AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems  Demis Hassabis of DeepMind hopes to  solve intelligence  and then use that to solve everything else                However  as the use of AI has become widespread  several unintended consequences and risks have been identified               In production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes  especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning              

Risks and harm
Privacy and copyright
Further information  Information privacy and Artificial intelligence and copyright
Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data  The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy  surveillance and copyright 
AI powered devices and services  such as virtual assistants and IoT products  continuously collect personal information  raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties  The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI s ability to process and combine vast amounts of data  potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency 
Sensitive user data collected may include online activity records  geolocation data  video  or audio               For example  in order to build speech recognition algorithms  Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them               Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy              
AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data  such as data aggregation  de identification and differential privacy               Since       some privacy experts  such as Cynthia Dwork  have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness  Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted  from the question of  what they know  to the question of  what they re doing with it                
Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works  including in domains such as images or computer code  the output is then used under the rationale of  fair use   Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law  relevant factors may include  the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work  and  the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work                             Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a  robots txt  file               In       leading authors  including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen  sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI                            Another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors              

Dominance by tech giants
The commercial AI scene is dominated by Big Tech companies such as Alphabet Inc   Amazon  Apple Inc   Meta Platforms  and Microsoft                                         Some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers  allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace                           

Power needs and environmental impacts

In January       the International Energy Agency  IEA  released Electricity       Analysis and Forecast to       forecasting electric power use               This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency  The report states that power demand for these uses might double by       with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation              
Prodigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuels use  and might delay closings of obsolete  carbon emitting coal energy facilities  There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US  making large technology firms  e g   Microsoft  Meta  Google  Amazon  into voracious consumers of electric power  Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source  A ChatGPT search involves the use of    times the electrical energy as a Google search  The large firms are in haste to find power sources   from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion  The tech firms argue that   in the long view   AI will be eventually kinder to the environment  but they need the energy now  AI makes the power grid more efficient and  intelligent   will assist in the growth of nuclear power  and track overall carbon emissions  according to technology firms              
A      Goldman Sachs Research Paper  AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge  found  US power demand  is  likely to experience growth not seen in a generation      and forecasts that  by       US data centers will consume    of US power  as opposed to    in       presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means               Data centers  need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid  The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all              
In       the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers  In March      Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear powered data center for      Million  US                Nvidia CEO Jen Hsun Huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers              
In September       Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with      of all electric power produced by the plant for    years  Reopening the plant  which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit   reactor in       will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission  If approved  this will be the first ever US re commissioning of a nuclear plant   over     megawatts of power   enough for         homes   of energy will be produced  The cost for re opening and upgrading is estimated at      billion  US  and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the      US Inflation Reduction Act               The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost    billion  US  to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan  Closed since       the plant is planned to be reopened in October       The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane  a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon spinoff of Constellation              
After the last approval in September       Taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of Taoyuan with a capacity of more than   MW in       due to power supply shortages               Taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by                    On the other hand  Singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in      due to electric power  but in       lifted this ban              
Although most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the      Fukushima nuclear accident  according to an October      Bloomberg article in Japanese  cloud gaming services company Ubitus  in which Nvidia has a stake  is looking for land in Japan near nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI               Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient  cheap and stable power for AI              
On   November       the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  rejected an application submitted by Talen Energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station Susquehanna to Amazon s data center               
According to the Commission Chairman Willie L  Phillips  it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors              
In      a report prepared by the International Energy Agency estimated the greenhouse gas emissions from the energy consumption of AI at     million tons  By       these emissions could rise to         million tonnes depending on what measures will be taken  This is below      of the energy sector emissions  The emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at    of the energy sector emissions  but rebound effects  for example if people will pass from public transport to autonomous cars  can reduce it              

Misinformation
See also  YouTube        Moderation and offensive content
YouTube  Facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content  These AI programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement  that is  the only goal was to keep people watching   The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation  conspiracy theories  and extreme partisan content  and  to keep them watching  the AI recommended more of it  Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject  so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation               This convinced many users that the misinformation was true  and ultimately undermined trust in institutions  the media and the government               The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal  but the result was harmful to society  After the U S  election in       major technology companies took some steps to mitigate the problem              
In       generative AI began to create images  audio  video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs  recordings  films  or human writing  It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda               One such potential malicious use is deepfakes for computational propaganda               AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton expressed concern about AI enabling  authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates  on a large scale  among other risks               Some AI researchers have suggested using  personhood credentials  as a way to overcome online deception enabled by AI models              

Algorithmic bias and fairness
Main articles  Algorithmic bias and Fairness  machine learning 
Machine learning applications will be biased     k      if they learn from biased data               The developers may not be aware that the bias exists               Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed                            If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people  as it can in medicine  finance  recruitment  housing or policing  then the algorithm may cause discrimination               The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases 
On June           Google Photos s new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as  gorillas  because they were black  The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people               a problem called  sample size disparity                Google  fixed  this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a  gorilla   Eight years later  in       Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla  and neither could similar products from Apple  Facebook  Microsoft and Amazon              
COMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U S  courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist  In       Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias  despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants  Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly      the errors for each race were different the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re offend               In       several researchers     l      showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re offense were different for whites and blacks in the data              
A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature  such as  race  or  gender    The feature will correlate with other features  like  address    shopping history  or  first name    and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on  race  or  gender                Moritz Hardt said  the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn t work               
Criticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make  predictions  that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past  If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past  machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future  If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations  some of these  recommendations  will likely be racist               Thus  machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past  It is descriptive rather than prescriptive      m     
Bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male  among AI engineers  about    are black and     are women              
There are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness  These notions depend on ethical assumptions  and are influenced by beliefs about society  One broad category is distributive fairness  which focuses on the outcomes  often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities  Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible  Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome  The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context  notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders  The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them  Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases  but it may conflict with anti discrimination laws              
At its      Conference on Fairness  Accountability  and Transparency  ACM FAccT        the Association for Computing Machinery  in Seoul  South Korea  presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes  they are unsafe  and the use of self learning neural networks trained on vast  unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed      dubious             discuss                  

Lack of transparency
See also  Explainable AI  Algorithmic transparency  and Right to explanation
Many AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions               Particularly with deep neural networks  in which there are a large amount of non linear relationships between inputs and outputs  But some popular explainability techniques exist              
It is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works  There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests  but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended  For example  a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as  cancerous   because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale               Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at  low risk  of dying from pneumonia  Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor  but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care  they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data  The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real  but misleading              
People who have been harmed by an algorithm s decision have a right to an explanation               Doctors  for example  are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make  Early drafts of the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation in      included an explicit statement that this right exists      n      Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight  Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real  if the problem has no solution  the tools should not be used              
DARPA established the XAI   Explainable Artificial Intelligence   program in      to try to solve these problems              
Several approaches aim to address the transparency problem  SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output               LIME can locally approximate a model s outputs with a simpler  interpretable model               Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification  These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned               Deconvolution  DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned  and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning               For generative pre trained transformers  Anthropic developed a technique based on dictionary learning that associates patterns of neuron activations with human understandable concepts              

Bad actors and weaponized AI
Main articles  Lethal autonomous weapon  Artificial intelligence arms race  and AI safety
Artificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors  such as authoritarian governments  terrorists  criminals or rogue states 
A lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates  selects and engages human targets without human supervision      o      Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and  if produced at scale  they are potentially weapons of mass destruction               Even when used in conventional warfare  they currently cannot reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person               In          nations  including China  supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations  Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons  however the United States and others disagreed               By       over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots              
AI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways  Face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance  Machine learning  operating this data  can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding  Recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect  Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation  Advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets  It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware               All these technologies have been available since      or earlier AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China                           
There many other ways that AI is expected to help bad actors  some of which can not be foreseen  For example  machine learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours              

Technological unemployment
Main articles  Workplace impact of artificial intelligence and Technological unemployment
Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI  and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment              
In the past  technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment  but economists acknowledge that  we re in uncharted territory  with AI               A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long term unemployment  but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed               Risk estimates vary  for example  in the     s  Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated     of U S  jobs are at  high risk  of potential automation  while an OECD report classified only    of U S  jobs as  high risk       p                   The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation  and for implying that technology  rather than social policy  creates unemployment  as opposed to redundancies               In April       it was reported that     of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence                           
Unlike previous waves of automation  many middle class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence  The Economist stated in      that  the worry that AI could do to white collar jobs what steam power did to blue collar ones during the Industrial Revolution  is  worth taking seriously                Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks  while job demand is likely to increase for care related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy              
From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence  there have been arguments  for example  those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum  about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them  given the difference between computers and humans  and between quantitative calculation and qualitative  value based judgement              

Existential risk
Main article  Existential risk from artificial intelligence
It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it  This could  as physicist Stephen Hawking stated   spell the end of the human race                This scenario has been common in science fiction  when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human like  self awareness   or  sentience  or  consciousness   and becomes a malevolent character      q      These sci fi scenarios are misleading in several ways 
First  AI does not require human like sentience to be an existential risk  Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them  Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI  it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it  he used the example of a paperclip factory manager                Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged  reasoning that  you can t fetch the coffee if you re dead                In order to be safe for humanity  a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity s morality and values so that it is  fundamentally on our side               
Second  Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk  The essential parts of civilization are not physical  Things like ideologies  law  government  money and the economy are built on language  they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe  The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything  even to take actions that are destructive              
The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed  with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI               Personalities such as Stephen Hawking  Bill Gates  and Elon Musk               as well as AI pioneers such as Yoshua Bengio  Stuart Russell  Demis Hassabis  and Sam Altman  have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI 
In May       Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to  freely speak out about the risks of AI  without  considering how this impacts Google                He notably mentioned risks of an AI takeover               and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes  establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI              
In       many leading AI experts endorsed the joint statement that  Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war               
Some other researchers were more optimistic  AI pioneer J rgen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement  emphasising that in     of all cases  AI research is about making  human lives longer and healthier and easier                While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors   they can also be used against the bad actors                             Andrew Ng also argued that  it s a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests                Yann LeCun  scoffs at his peers  dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even  eventually  human extinction                In the early     s  experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine               However  after       the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research              

Ethical machines and alignment
Main articles  Machine ethics  AI safety  Friendly artificial intelligence  Artificial moral agents  and Human Compatible
Friendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans  Eliezer Yudkowsky  who coined the term  argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority  it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk              
Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions  The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas              
The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality              
and was founded at an AAAI symposium in                   
Other approaches include Wendell Wallach s  artificial moral agents               and Stuart J  Russell s three principles for developing provably beneficial machines              

Open source
Active organizations in the AI open source community include Hugging Face               Google               EleutherAI and Meta               Various AI models  such as Llama    Mistral or Stable Diffusion  have been made open weight                            meaning that their architecture and trained parameters  the  weights   are publicly available  Open weight models can be freely fine tuned  which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use case               Open weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused  Since they can be fine tuned  any built in security measure  such as objecting to harmful requests  can be trained away until it becomes ineffective  Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities  such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism  and that once released on the Internet  they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed  They recommend pre release audits and cost benefit analyses              

Frameworks
Artificial Intelligence projects can be guided by ethical considerations during the design  development  and implementation of an AI system  An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework  developed by the Alan Turing Institute and based on the SUM values  outlines four main ethical dimensions  defined as follows                           

Respect the dignity of individual people
Connect with other people sincerely  openly  and inclusively
Care for the wellbeing of everyone
Protect social values  justice  and the public interest
Other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference  the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI  and the IEEE s Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative  among others               however  these principles are not without criticism  especially regards to the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks              
Promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design  development and implementation  and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists  product managers  data engineers  domain experts  and delivery managers              
The UK AI Safety Institute released in      a testing toolset called  Inspect  for AI safety evaluations available under a MIT open source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third party packages  It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge  ability to reason  and autonomous capabilities              

Regulation
Main articles  Regulation of artificial intelligence  Regulation of algorithms  and AI safety
The first global AI Safety Summit was held in the United Kingdom in November      with a declaration calling for international cooperation 
The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI  it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms               The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally               According to AI Index at Stanford  the annual number of AI related laws passed in the     survey countries jumped from one passed in      to    passed in      alone                            Between      and       more than    countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI               Most EU member states had released national AI strategies  as had Canada  China  India  Japan  Mauritius  the Russian Federation  Saudi Arabia  United Arab Emirates  U S   and Vietnam  Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy  including Bangladesh  Malaysia and Tunisia               The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June       stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values  to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology               Henry Kissinger  Eric Schmidt  and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November      calling for a government commission to regulate AI               In       OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence  which they believe may happen in less than    years               In       the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance  the body comprises technology company executives  governments officials and academics               In       the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI  called the  Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights  Democracy and the Rule of Law   It was adopted by the European Union  the United States  the United Kingdom  and other signatories              
In a      Ipsos survey  attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country      of Chinese citizens  but only     of Americans  agreed that  products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks                A      Reuters Ipsos poll found that     of Americans agree  and     disagree  that AI poses risks to humanity               In a      Fox News poll      of Americans thought it  very important   and an additional     thought it  somewhat important   for the federal government to regulate AI  versus     responding  not very important  and    responding  not at all important                            
In November       the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks                  countries including the United States  China  and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit  calling for international co operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence                            In May      at the AI Seoul Summit     global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI                           

History
Main article  History of artificial intelligence
For a chronological guide  see Timeline of artificial intelligence 
In       AI patents in China and the US numbered more than three fourths of AI patents worldwide               Though China had more AI patents  the US had     more patents per AI patent applicant company than China              
The study of mechanical or  formal  reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity  The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing s theory of computation  which suggested that a machine  by shuffling symbols as simple as     and      could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning                            This  along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics  information theory and neurobiology  led researchers to consider the possibility of building an  electronic brain       r      They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI               such as McCullouch and Pitts design for  artificial neurons  in                    and Turing s influential      paper  Computing Machinery and Intelligence   which introduced the Turing test and showed that  machine intelligence  was plausible                           
The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in           s                 The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the     s      t      They and their students produced programs that the press described as  astonishing       u      computers were learning checkers strategies  solving word problems in algebra  proving logical theorems and speaking English      v                 Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U S  universities in the latter     s and early     s              
Researchers in the     s and the     s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field               In      Herbert Simon predicted   machines will be capable  within twenty years  of doing any work a man can do                In      Marvin Minsky agreed  writing that  within a generation          the problem of creating  artificial intelligence  will substantially be solved                They had  however  underestimated the difficulty of the problem      w      In       both the U S  and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill              and ongoing pressure from the U S  Congress to fund more productive projects               Minsky s and Papert s book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real world tasks  thus discrediting the approach altogether               The  AI winter   a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult  followed            
In the early     s  AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems               a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts  By       the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars  At the same time  Japan s fifth generation computer project inspired the U S  and British governments to restore funding for academic research             However  beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in       AI once again fell into disrepute  and a second  longer lasting winter began             
Up to this point  most of AI s funding had gone to projects that used high level symbols to represent mental objects like plans  goals  beliefs  and known facts  In the     s  some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition  especially perception  robotics  learning and pattern recognition               and began to look into  sub symbolic  approaches               Rodney Brooks rejected  representation  in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive      x      Judea Pearl  Lofti Zadeh  and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic                           But the most important development was the revival of  connectionism   including neural network research  by Geoffrey Hinton and others               In       Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits  the first of many successful applications of neural networks              
AI gradually restored its reputation in the late     s and early   st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems  This  narrow  and  formal  focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields  such as statistics  economics and mathematics                By       solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used  although in the     s they were rarely described as  artificial intelligence   a tendency known as the AI effect               
However  several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile  fully intelligent machines  Beginning around       they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence  or  AGI    which had several well funded institutions by the     s            
Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in      and was adopted throughout the field             
For many specific tasks  other methods were abandoned      y     
Deep learning s success was based on both hardware improvements  faster computers               graphics processing units  cloud computing               and access to large amounts of data               including curated datasets               such as ImageNet   Deep learning s success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI      z      The amount of machine learning research  measured by total publications  increased by     in the years                        

The number of Google searches for the term  AI  accelerated in      
In       issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences  publications vastly increased  funding became available  and many researchers re focussed their careers on these issues  The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study              
In the late     s and early     s  AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest  In       AlphaGo  developed by DeepMind  beat the world champion Go player  The program taught only the game s rules and developed a strategy by itself  GPT   is a large language model that was released in      by OpenAI and is capable of generating high quality human like text               ChatGPT  launched on November           became the fastest growing consumer software application in history  gaining over     million users in two months               It marked what is widely regarded as AI s breakout year  bringing it into the public consciousness               These programs  and others  inspired an aggressive AI boom  where large companies began investing billions of dollars in AI research  According to AI Impacts  about     billion annually was invested in  AI  around      in the U S  alone and about     of the new U S  Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in  AI                About          AI  related U S  job openings existed in                    According to PitchBook research      of newly funded startups in      claimed to be AI companies              

Philosophy
Main article  Philosophy of artificial intelligence
Philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines               Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious  and the associated ethical implications               Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI  such as epistemology and free will               Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI              

Defining artificial intelligence
See also  Turing test  Intelligent agent  Dartmouth workshop  and Synthetic intelligence
Alan Turing wrote in       I propose to consider the question  can machines think                 He advised changing the question from whether a machine  thinks   to  whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour                He devised the Turing test  which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation               Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine  it does not matter if it is  actually  thinking or literally has a  mind   Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but  it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks               

The Turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence  but it penalizes non human intelligent behavior              
Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior  not internal structure             However  they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans   Aeronautical engineering texts   they wrote   do not define the goal of their field as making  machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons                 AI founder John McCarthy agreed  writing that  Artificial intelligence is not  by definition  simulation of human intelligence               
McCarthy defines intelligence as  the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world                Another AI founder  Marvin Minsky  similarly describes it as  the ability to solve hard problems                The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals             These definitions view intelligence in terms of well defined problems with well defined solutions  where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the  intelligence  of the machine and no other philosophical discussion is required  or may not even be possible 
Another definition has been adopted by Google               a major practitioner in the field of AI  This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence  similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence 
Some authors have suggested in practice  that the definition of AI is vague and difficult to define  with contention as to whether classical algorithms should be categorised as AI               with many companies during the early     s AI boom using the term as a marketing buzzword  often even if they did  not actually use AI in a material way               

Evaluating approaches to AI
No established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history      aa      The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the     s eclipsed all other approaches  so much so that some sources  especially in the business world  use the term  artificial intelligence  to mean  machine learning with neural networks    This approach is mostly sub symbolic  soft and narrow  Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers 

Symbolic AI and its limits
Symbolic AI  or  GOFAI                simulated the high level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles  express legal reasoning and do mathematics  They were highly successful at  intelligent  tasks such as algebra or IQ tests  In the     s  Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis   A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action               
However  the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily  such as learning  recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning  Moravec s paradox is the discovery that high level  intelligent  tasks were easy for AI  but low level  instinctive  tasks were extremely difficult               Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the     s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation  and on having a  feel  for the situation  rather than explicit symbolic knowledge               Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented  eventually  AI research came to agree with him      ab                 
The issue is not resolved  sub symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does  such as algorithmic bias  Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence                            in part because sub symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI  it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision  The emerging field of neuro symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches 

Neat vs  scruffy
Main article  Neats and scruffies
 Neats  hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple  elegant principles  such as logic  optimization  or neural networks    Scruffies  expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems  Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor  scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work  This issue was actively discussed in the     s and     s               but eventually was seen as irrelevant  Modern AI has elements of both 

Soft vs  hard computing
Main article  Soft computing
Finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems              Soft computing is a set of techniques  including genetic algorithms  fuzzy logic and neural networks  that are tolerant of imprecision  uncertainty  partial truth and approximation  Soft computing was introduced in the late     s and most successful AI programs in the   st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks 

Narrow vs  general AI
Main articles  Weak artificial intelligence and Artificial general intelligence
AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible  narrow AI  in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field s long term goals                            General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure  and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions  The sub field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively 

Machine consciousness  sentience  and mind
Main articles  Philosophy of artificial intelligence and Artificial consciousness
The philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind  consciousness and mental states  in the same sense that human beings do  This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine  rather than its external behavior  Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field  to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence  Russell and Norvig add that   t he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on                However  the question has become central to the philosophy of mind  It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction 

Consciousness
Main articles  Hard problem of consciousness and Theory of mind
David Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind  which he named the  hard  and  easy  problems of consciousness               The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals  makes plans and controls behavior  The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all  assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something  Dennett s consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion   While human information processing is easy to explain  human subjective experience is difficult to explain  For example  it is easy to imagine a color blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red  but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like              

Computationalism and functionalism
Main articles  Computational theory of mind and Functionalism  philosophy of mind 
Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing  Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind body problem  This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the     s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam              
Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as  strong AI    The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds       ac      Searle challenges this claim with his Chinese room argument  which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind              

AI welfare and rights
It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient  has the ability to feel   and if so  to what degree               But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer  then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures  similarly to animals                            Sapience  a set of capacities related to high intelligence  such as discernment or self awareness  may provide another moral basis for AI rights               Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society              
In       the European Union considered granting  electronic personhood  to some of the most capable AI systems  Similarly to the legal status of companies  it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities               Critics argued in      that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights  and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios  They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part to society on their own                           
Progress in AI increased interest in the topic  Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience  if it emerges  would be particularly easy to deny  They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming  which could lead to large scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited                           

Future
Superintelligence and the singularity
A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind               If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software  it might be able to reprogram and improve itself  The improved software would be even better at improving itself  leading to what I  J  Good called an  intelligence explosion  and Vernor Vinge called a  singularity               
However  technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely  and typically follow an S shaped curve  slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do              

Transhumanism
Main article  Transhumanism
Robot designer Hans Moravec  cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either  This idea  called transhumanism  has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger              
Edward Fredkin argues that  artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution   an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler s  Darwin among the Machines  as far back as       and expanded upon by George Dyson in his      book Darwin Among the Machines  The Evolution of Global Intelligence              

Decomputing
Arguments for decomputing have been raised by Dan McQuillan  Resisting AI  An Anti fascist Approach to Artificial Intelligence         meaning an opposition to the sweeping application and expansion of artificial intelligence  Similar to degrowth  the approach criticizes AI as an outgrowth of the systemic issues and capitalist world we live in  It argues that a different future is possible  in which distance between people is reduced rather than increased through AI intermediaries              

In fiction
Main article  Artificial intelligence in fiction
The word  robot  itself was coined by Karel  apek in his      play R U R   the title standing for  Rossum s Universal Robots  
Thought capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity               and have been a persistent theme in science fiction              
A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley s Frankenstein  where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters  This includes such works as Arthur C  Clarke s and Stanley Kubrick s       A Space Odyssey  both        with HAL       the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship  as well as The Terminator        and The Matrix         In contrast  the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still        and Bishop from Aliens        are less prominent in popular culture              
Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories  most notably with the  Multivac  super intelligent computer  Asimov s laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics               while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov s laws through popular culture  they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons  one of which is their ambiguity              
Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human  showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel  and thus to suffer  This appears in Karel  apek s R U R   the films A I  Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina  as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep   by Philip K  Dick  Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence

  It is among the reasons that expert systems proved to be inefficient for capturing knowledge                         

  
 Rational agent  is general term used in economics  philosophy and theoretical artificial intelligence  It can refer to anything that directs its behavior to accomplish goals  such as a person  an animal  a corporation  a nation  or in the case of AI  a computer program 

  Alan Turing discussed the centrality of learning as early as       in his classic paper  Computing Machinery and Intelligence               In       at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference  Ray Solomonoff wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning   An Inductive Inference Machine              

  See AI winter        Machine translation and the ALPAC report of     

  
Compared with symbolic logic  formal Bayesian inference is computationally expensive  For inference to be tractable  most observations must be conditionally independent of one another  AdSense uses a Bayesian network with over          million edges to learn which ads to serve             

  Expectation maximization  one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning  allows clustering in the presence of unknown latent variables             

  
Some form of deep neural networks  without a specific learning algorithm  were described by 
Warren S  McCulloch and Walter Pitts

Karl Steinbuch and Roger David Joseph                     
Deep or recurrent networks that learned  or used gradient descent  were developed by

Backpropagation was independently developed by 
Seppo Linnainmaa                     
Paul Werbos                     

  Geoffrey Hinton said  of his work on neural networks in the     s   our labeled datasets were thousands of times too small   And  our computers were millions of times too slow               

  In statistics  a bias is a systematic error or deviation from the correct value  But in the context of fairness  it refers to a tendency in favor or against a certain group or individual characteristic  usually in a way that is considered unfair or harmful  A statistically unbiased AI system that produces disparate outcomes for different demographic groups may thus be viewed as biased in the ethical sense

  Moritz Hardt  a director at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems  argues that machine learning  is fundamentally the wrong tool for a lot of domains  where you re trying to design interventions and mechanisms that change the world               

  When the law was passed in       it still contained a form of this provision 

  This is the United Nations  definition  and includes things like land mines as well              

  See table       is both the OECD average and the U S  average              

  Sometimes called a  robopocalypse              

   Electronic brain  was the term used by the press around this time                           

  
Daniel Crevier wrote   the conference is generally recognized as the official birthdate of the new science                Russell and Norvig called the conference  the inception of artificial intelligence               

  
Russell and Norvig wrote  for the next    years the field would be dominated by these people and their students               

  
Russell and Norvig wrote   it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything kind of smartish               

  
The programs described are Arthur Samuel s checkers program for the IBM      Daniel Bobrow s STUDENT  Newell and Simon s Logic Theorist and Terry Winograd s SHRDLU 

  Russell and Norvig write   in almost all cases  these early systems failed on more difficult problems              

  
Embodied approaches to AI              were championed by Hans Moravec              and Rodney Brooks              and went by many names  Nouvelle AI               Developmental robotics              

  Matteo Wong wrote in The Atlantic   Whereas for decades  computer science fields such as natural language processing  computer vision  and robotics used extremely different methods  now they all use a programming method called  deep learning   As a result  their code and approaches have become more similar  and their models are easier to integrate into one another               

  Jack Clark wrote in Bloomberg   After a half decade of quiet breakthroughs in artificial intelligence       has been a landmark year  Computers are smarter and learning faster than ever   and noted that the number of software projects that use machine learning at Google increased from a  sporadic usage  in      to more than       projects in                   

  Nils Nilsson wrote in        Simply put  there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about               

  
Daniel Crevier wrote that  time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus s comments  Had he formulated them less aggressively  constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier               

  
Searle presented this definition of  Strong AI  in                    Searle s original formulation was  The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind  in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states                Strong AI is defined similarly by Russell and Norvig   Stong AI   the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking  as opposed to simulating thinking
