The service supports text translation between many languages and language varieties  It also supports several speech translation systems that currently power the Microsoft Translator live conversation feature  Skype Translator  and Skype for Windows Desktop  and the Microsoft Translator Apps for iOS and Android            


Development edit 
History edit 
The first version of Microsoft s machine translation system was developed between      and      within Microsoft Research  This system was based on semantic predicate argument structures known as logical forms  LF  and was spun from the grammar correction feature developed for Microsoft Word  This system was eventually used to translate the entire Microsoft Knowledge Base into Spanish  French  German  and Japanese            
Microsoft s approach to machine translation  like most modern machine translation systems  is  data driven              rather than relying on writing explicit rules to translate natural language  algorithms are trained to understand and interpret translated parallel texts  allowing them to automatically learn how to translate new natural language text  Microsoft s experience with the LF system led directly to a treelet translation system that simplified the LF to dependency trees and eventually to an order template model  significantly improving in speed and enabling the incorporation of new target languages       citation needed     
The consumer facing translation site known as Bing Translator  previously known as Windows Live translator  was launched in      and provides free text and website translations on the web  Text is translated directly within the Bing Translator webpage while websites are translated through the Bilingual Viewer tools      citation needed     
In       the service was extended to include numerous Microsoft Translator products through a cloud based application programming interface  which supports products available to both consumer and enterprise users  An additional speech translation capability was introduced in March                 
In May       an update to the API was introduced  This new version offered neural machine translation as the default method of translating  In addition to translation  the new version features transliteration and a bilingual dictionary to look up words to find alternative translations and view examples in sentences            
Speech translation was integrated into Microsoft Speech services in September       providing end to end speech  speech to text  and text to speech translation      citation needed     

Translation methodology and research edit 
Microsoft Translator uses machine translation to create instantaneous translations from one natural language to another  This system is based on four distinct areas of computer learning research seen below            




Type of learning
Impact on translation


Neural networksNeural machine translation
Neural networks try to mimic how the brain works to translate between languages  At a high level  neural network translation works in two stages  First  a first stage models the word that needs to be translated based on the context of this word  and its possible translations  within the full sentence  Second  the neural network translates this word model  not the word itself but the model the neural networks built of it   within the context of the sentence  into the other language             Neural machine translation is the default translation method for the Microsoft Translator API 


Syntax based SMTMain article  Statistical machine translation
Syntax based translation is based on the idea of translating syntactic units  rather than a word or string of words  Microsoft has used syntax based SMT to translate much of its computer related texts from English into multiple target languages  Ongoing research in this area has produced improvements in word inflections and word ordering 


Phrase based SMT
In phrase based SMT  the machine learns correspondence between languages from parallel text without the aid of linguist knowledge  This produces better translations in less time than other systems 


Bitext word alignment
SMT systems rely on existing translated data to learn how to automatically translate from one language to another  To train the systems  identifying word correspondences  or word alignments  is crucial  Microsoft has developed work in both discriminative            and generative             approaches to word alignment  resulting in faster algorithms and higher quality and translations 


Language modeling
Language modeling uses n gram models to construct comprehensible translations in the target language  This ensures that the output translation is fluent and readable 

Accuracy edit 
The quality of Microsoft Translator s machine translation outputs are evaluated using a method called the BLEU score             
BLEU  Bilingual Evaluation Understudy  is an algorithm for evaluating the quality of text which has been machine translated from one natural language to another  Quality is considered to be the correspondence between a machine s output and that of a human  BLEU was one of the first metrics to achieve a high correlation with human judgments of quality  and remains one of the most popular automated and inexpensive metrics 
Because machine translation is based on statistical algorithms rather than human translators  the automatic translations it produces are not always entirely accurate  Microsoft Translator has introduced various feedback features  such as the Collaborative Translation Framework  into its products to allow users to suggest alternative translations  These alternative translations are then integrated into the Microsoft Translator algorithms to improve future translations 
In November       Microsoft Translator introduced translation using deep neural networks in nine of its highest traffic languages  including all of its speech languages and Japanese  Neural networks provide better translation than industry standard statistical machine learning             

Core products edit 
Microsoft Translator is a cloud based API that is integrated into numerous Microsoft products and services              The Translator API can be used on its own and can be customized for use in a pre publishing or post publishing environment  The API  which is available through subscription  is free for lower translation volumes  and is charged according to a tiered payment system for volumes exceeding two million characters per month             The remaining core products are available for free 

Microsoft Translator cloud translation edit 
The Microsoft Translator is a cloud based automatic translation service that can be used to build applications  websites  and tools requiring multi language support 

Text translation  The Microsoft Translator Text API can be used to translate text into any of the languages supported by the service 
Speech translation  Microsoft Translator is integrated into Microsoft Speech services which is an end to end REST based API that can be used to build applications  tools  or any solution requiring multi languages speech translation  Speech to speech translation is available to or from any of the conversation languages  and speech to text translation is available from the conversation languages into any of the Microsoft Translator supported language systems 
Custom Translator edit 
Custom Translator is a feature of the Microsoft Translator services that allows enterprises  app developers  and language service providers to build neural translation systems that understand the terminology used in their own business and industry  The customized translations can then be delivered into existing applications  workflows and websites using a normal call to the Microsoft Translator API  Custom Translator can be used when translating text with the Microsoft Translator Text API and when translating speech with Microsoft Speech services             

Live feature edit 
A personal universal translator that enables up to     people to have live  multi device  multi language  in person translated conversations              This feature is currently free and available in the Microsoft Translator apps  Android  iOS or Windows  and from the Microsoft Translator website 

Microsoft Translator Hub edit 
The Microsoft Translator Hub allows enterprises and language service providers to build their own translation systems that understand business  and industry specific terminology              The Hub can also be used in conjunction with the CTF  allowing administrators to approve CTF results and add them directly to the Hub  The Microsoft Translator Hub is only available for statistical machine translation and cannot be used with the newest version of the Microsoft Translator API 
The Hub has also been used for language preservation  allowing communities to create their own language translation systems for language and cultural preservation              The Hub has been used to create translation systems for languages such as Hmong  Mayan  Nepali  and Welsh 

Multilingual App Toolkit  MAT  edit
