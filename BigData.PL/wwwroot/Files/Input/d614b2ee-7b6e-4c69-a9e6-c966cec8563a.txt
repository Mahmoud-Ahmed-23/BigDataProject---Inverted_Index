A digital object identifier  DOI  is a persistent identifier or handle used to uniquely identify various objects  standardized by the International Organization for Standardization  ISO              DOIs are an implementation of the Handle System                        they also fit within the URI system  Uniform Resource Identifier   They are widely used to identify academic  professional  and government information  such as journal articles  research reports  data sets  and official publications 
A DOI aims to resolve to its target  the information object to which the DOI refers  This is achieved by binding the DOI to metadata about the object  such as a URL where the object is located  Thus  by being actionable and interoperable  a DOI differs from ISBNs or ISRCs which are identifiers only  The DOI system uses the indecs Content Model to represent metadata 
The DOI for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document  whereas its location and other metadata may change  Referring to an online document by its DOI should provide a more stable link than directly using its URL  But if its URL changes  the publisher must update the metadata for the DOI to maintain the link to the URL                                   It is the publisher s responsibility to update the DOI database  If they fail to do so  the DOI resolves to a dead link  leaving the DOI useless            
The developer and administrator of the DOI system is the International DOI Foundation  IDF   which introduced it in                  Organizations that meet the contractual obligations of the DOI system and are willing to pay to become a member of the system can assign DOIs              The DOI system is implemented through a federation of registration agencies coordinated by the IDF              The cumulative number of DOIs has increased exponentially over time  from    million registrations in      to     million in                   The rate of registering organizations   members   has also increased over time from       in      to       in       but the federated nature of the system means it is not immediately clear how many members there are in total today              Fake registries have even appeared             


 Nomenclature and syntax edit 
A DOI is a type of Handle System handle  which takes the form of a character string divided into two parts  a prefix and a suffix  separated by a slash 

prefix suffix

The prefix identifies the registrant of the identifier and the suffix is chosen by the registrant and identifies the specific object associated with that DOI  Most legal Unicode characters are allowed in these strings  which are interpreted in a case insensitive manner  The prefix usually takes the form    NNNN  where NNNN is a number greater than or equal to       whose limit depends only on the total number of registrants                          The prefix may be further subdivided with periods  like    NNNN N             
For example  in the DOI name              the prefix is         and the suffix is      The      part of the prefix distinguishes the handle as part of the DOI namespace  as opposed to some other Handle System namespace      A      and the characters      in the prefix identify the registrant  in this case the registrant is the International DOI Foundation itself      is the suffix  or item ID  identifying a single object  in this case  the latest version of the DOI Handbook  
DOI names can identify creative works  such as texts  images  audio or video items  and software  in both electronic and physical forms  performances  and abstract works             such as licenses  parties to a transaction  etc 
The names can refer to objects at varying levels of detail  thus DOI names can identify a journal  an individual issue of a journal  an individual article in the journal  or a single table in that article  The choice of level of detail is left to the assigner  but in the DOI system it must be declared as part of the metadata that is associated with a DOI name  using a data dictionary based on the indecs Content Model 

Display edit 
The official DOI Handbook explicitly states that DOIs should be displayed on screens and in print in the format doi                         
Contrary to the DOI Handbook  Crossref  a major DOI registration agency  recommends displaying a URL  for example  https   doi org              instead of the officially specified format                          This URL is persistent  there is a contract that ensures persistence in the doi org domain      citation needed       so it is a PURL providing the location of an name resolver which will redirect HTTP requests to the correct online location of the linked item                         
The Crossref recommendation is primarily based on the assumption that the DOI is being displayed without being hyperlinked to its appropriate URL the argument being that without the hyperlink it is not as easy to copy and paste the full URL to actually bring up the page for the DOI  thus the entire URL should be displayed  allowing people viewing the page containing the DOI to copy and paste the URL  by hand  into a new window tab in their browser in order to go to the appropriate page for the document the DOI represents             

Content edit 
Major content of the DOI system currently includes 

Scholarly materials  journal articles  books  ebooks  etc   through Crossref  a consortium of around       publishers  Airiti  a leading provider of Chinese and Taiwanese electronic academic journals  and the Japan Link Center  JaLC              an organization providing link management and DOI assignment for electronic academic journals in Japanese 
Research datasets through DataCite  a consortium of leading research libraries  technical information providers  and scientific data centers 
European Union official publications through the EU publications office 
The Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure project at Tsinghua University and the Institute of Scientific and Technical Information of China  ISTIC   two initiatives sponsored by the Chinese government 
Permanent global identifiers for both commercial and non commercial audio visual content titles  edits  and manifestations through the Entertainment ID Registry  commonly known as EIDR 
In the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development s publication service OECD iLibrary  each table or graph in an OECD publication is shown with a DOI name that leads to an Excel file of data underlying the tables and graphs  Further development of such services is planned             
Other registries include Crossref and the multilingual European DOI Registration Agency  mEDRA               Since       RFCs can be referenced as doi          rfc                

Features and benefits edit 
The IDF designed the DOI system to provide a form of persistent identification  in which each DOI name permanently and unambiguously identifies the object to which it is associated  although when the publisher of a journal changes  sometimes all the DOIs will be changed  with the old DOIs no longer working   It also associates metadata with objects  allowing it to provide users with relevant pieces of information about the objects and their relationships  Included as part of this metadata are network actions that allow DOI names to be resolved to web locations where the objects they describe can be found  To achieve its goals  the DOI system combines the Handle System and the indecs Content Model with a social infrastructure 
The Handle System ensures that the DOI name for an object is not based on any changeable attributes of the object such as its physical location or ownership  that the attributes of the object are encoded in its metadata rather than in its DOI name  and that no two objects are assigned the same DOI name  Because DOI names are short character strings  they are human readable  may be copied and pasted as text  and fit into the URI specification  The DOI name resolution mechanism acts behind the scenes  so that users communicate with it in the same way as with any other web service  it is built on open architectures  incorporates trust mechanisms  and is engineered to operate reliably and flexibly so that it can be adapted to changing demands and new applications of the DOI system              DOI name resolution may be used with OpenURL to select the most appropriate among multiple locations for a given object  according to the location of the user making the request              However  despite this ability  the DOI system has drawn criticism from librarians for directing users to non free copies of documents  that would have been available for no additional fee from alternative locations             
The indecs Content Model as used within the DOI system associates metadata with objects  A small kernel of common metadata is shared by all DOI names and can be optionally extended with other relevant data  which may be public or restricted  Registrants may update the metadata for their DOI names at any time  such as when publication information changes or when an object moves to a different URL 
The International DOI Foundation  IDF  oversees the integration of these technologies and operation of the system through a technical and social infrastructure  The social infrastructure of a federation of independent registration agencies offering DOI services was modelled on existing successful federated deployments of identifiers such as GS  and ISBN 

Comparison with other identifier schemes edit 
A DOI name differs from commonly used Internet pointers to material  such as the Uniform Resource Locator  URL   in that it identifies an object itself as a first class entity  rather than the specific place where the object is located at a certain time  It implements the Uniform Resource Identifier  Uniform Resource Name  concept and adds to it a data model and social infrastructure             
A DOI name also differs from standard identifier registries such as the ISBN  ISRC  etc  The purpose of an identifier registry is to manage a given collection of identifiers  whereas the primary purpose of the DOI system is to make a collection of identifiers actionable and interoperable  where that collection can include identifiers from many other controlled collections             
The DOI system offers persistent  semantically interoperable resolution to related current data and is best suited to material that will be used in services outside the direct control of the issuing assigner  e g   public citation or managing content of value   It uses a managed registry  providing both social and technical infrastructure   It does not assume any specific business model for the provision of identifiers or services and enables other existing services to link to it in defined ways  Several approaches for making identifiers persistent have been proposed 
The comparison of persistent identifier approaches is difficult because they are not all doing the same thing  Imprecisely referring to a set of schemes as  identifiers  does not mean that they can be compared easily  Other  identifier systems  may be enabling technologies with low barriers to entry  providing an easy to use labeling mechanism that allows anyone to set up a new instance  examples include Persistent Uniform Resource Locator  PURL   URLs  Globally Unique Identifiers  GUIDs   etc    but may lack some of the functionality of a registry controlled scheme and will usually lack accompanying metadata in a controlled scheme 
The DOI system does not have this approach and should not be compared directly to such identifier schemes  Various applications using such enabling technologies with added features have been devised that meet some of the features offered by the DOI system for specific sectors  e g   ARK  
A DOI name does not depend on the object s location and  in this way  is similar to a Uniform Resource Name  URN  or PURL but differs from an ordinary URL  URLs are often used as substitute identifiers for documents on the Internet although the same document at two different locations has two URLs  By contrast  persistent identifiers such as DOI names identify objects as first class entities  two instances of the same object would have the same DOI name 

Resolution edit 
DOI name resolution is provided through the Handle System  developed by Corporation for National Research Initiatives  and is freely available to any user encountering a DOI name  Resolution redirects the user from a DOI name to one or more pieces of typed data  URLs representing instances of the object  services such as e mail  or one or more items of metadata  To the Handle System  a DOI name is a handle  and so has a set of values assigned to it and may be thought of as a record that consists of a group of fields  Each handle value must have a data type specified in its  lt type gt  field  which defines the syntax and semantics of its data  While a DOI persistently and uniquely identifies the object to which it is assigned  DOI resolution may not be persistent  due to technical and administrative issues 
To resolve a DOI name  it may be input to a DOI resolver  such as one at the official website doi org 
Another approach  which avoids typing or copying and pasting into a resolver is to include the DOI in a document as a URL which uses the resolver as an HTTP proxy  such as https   doi org   preferred              or http   dx doi org   both of which support HTTPS  For example  the DOI             can be included in a reference or hyperlink as https   doi org              This approach allows users to click on the DOI as a normal hyperlink  Indeed  as previously mentioned  this is how Crossref recommends that DOIs always be represented  preferring HTTPS over HTTP   so that if they are cut and pasted into other documents  emails  etc   they will be actionable 
Other DOI resolvers and HTTP Proxies include the Handle System and PANGAEA  At the beginning of the year       a new class of alternative DOI resolvers was started by http   doai io  This service is unusual in that it tries to find a non paywalled  often author archived  version of a title and redirects the user to that instead of the publisher s version                          Since then  other open access favoring DOI resolvers have been created  notably https   oadoi org  in October                   later Unpaywall   While traditional DOI resolvers solely rely on the Handle System  alternative DOI resolvers first consult open access resources such as BASE  Bielefeld Academic Search Engine                          
An alternative to HTTP proxies is to use one of a number of add ons and plug ins for browsers  thereby avoiding the conversion of the DOIs to URLs              which depend on domain names and may be subject to change  while still allowing the DOI to be treated as a normal hyperlink  A disadvantage of this approach for publishers is that  at least at present  most users will be encountering the DOIs in a browser  mail reader  or other software which does not have one of these plug ins installed 

IDF organizational structure edit 
Logo of the foundation
The International DOI Foundation  IDF   a non profit organization created in       is the governance body of the DOI system              It safeguards all intellectual property rights relating to the DOI system  manages common operational features  and supports the development and promotion of the DOI system  The IDF ensures that any improvements made to the DOI system  including creation  maintenance  registration  resolution and policymaking of DOI names  are available to any DOI registrant  It also prevents third parties from imposing additional licensing requirements beyond those of the IDF on users of the DOI system 
The IDF is controlled by a Board elected by the members of the Foundation  with an appointed Managing Agent who is responsible for co ordinating and planning its activities  Membership is open to all organizations with an interest in electronic publishing and related enabling technologies  The IDF holds annual open meetings on the topics of DOI and related issues 
Registration agencies  appointed by the IDF  provide services to DOI registrants  they allocate DOI prefixes  register DOI names  and provide the necessary infrastructure to allow registrants to declare and maintain metadata and state data  Registration agencies are also expected to actively promote the widespread adoption of the DOI system  to cooperate with the IDF in the development of the DOI system as a whole  and to provide services on behalf of their specific user community  A list of current RAs is maintained by the International DOI Foundation  The IDF is recognized as one of the federated registrars for the Handle System by the DONA Foundation  of which the IDF is a board member   and is responsible for assigning Handle System prefixes under the top level    prefix             
Registration agencies generally charge a fee to assign a new DOI name  parts of these fees are used to support the IDF  The DOI system overall  through the IDF  operates on a not for profit cost recovery basis 

Standardization edit 
The DOI system is an international standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization in its technical committee on identification and description  TC   SC               The Draft International Standard ISO DIS        Information and documentation   Digital Object Identifier System met the ISO requirements for approval  The relevant ISO Working Group later submitted an edited version to ISO for distribution as an FDIS  Final Draft International Standard  ballot              which was approved by      of those voting in a ballot closing on    November                   The final standard was published on    April                 
DOI is a registered URI under the info URI scheme specified by IETF RFC                   info doi  is the infoURI Namespace of Digital Object Identifiers             
The DOI syntax is a NISO standard  first standardized in       ANSI NISO Z           Syntax for the Digital Object Identifier             
The maintainers of the DOI system have registered a DOI namespace for URNs
