Alexey Ivakhnenko  Ukrainian                                     March           October       was a Soviet and Ukrainian mathematician most famous for developing the group method of data handling  GMDH   a method of inductive statistical learning  for which he is considered as one of the founders of deep learning                       


Early life and education edit 
Aleksey was born in Kobelyaky  Poltava Governorate in a family of teachers             In      he graduated from Electrotechnical college in Kyiv and worked for two years as an engineer on the construction of large power plant in Berezniki  Then in       after graduation from the Leningrad Electrotechnical Institute  Ivakhnenko worked in the All Union Electrotechnical Institute in Moscow during wartime  There he investigated the problems of automatic control in the laboratory  led by Sergey Lebedev   
He continued research in other institutions in Ukraine after return to Kyiv in       In that year he received the Ph D  degree and later  in      had received D Sc  degree  In       he was appointed as a Head of the Department of Combined Control Systems at the Institute of Cybernetics  Simultaneously working at first as a Lecturer  and from       as a Professor of Automatic Control and Technical Cybernetics at the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute 

Research edit 
Ivakhnenko is known to be the founder of Inductive modelling  a scientific approach used for pattern recognition and complex systems forecasting             He had used this approach during development of the group method of data handling  GMDH   In      the journal  Avtomatika  had published his article  Group Method of Data Handling   a rival of the method of stochastic approximation              marking the beginning of a new stage in his scientific work  He led the development of this approach  with a professional team of mathematicians and engineers at the Institute of Cybernetics 

Group method of data handling edit 
The GMDH method presents a unique approach to solving problems in artificial intelligence and even a new philosophy to scientific research  which became possible using modern computers             A researcher may not adhere 
precisely to traditional deductive way of building models  from general theory   to a particular model    monitoring an object  studying its structure  understanding the principles of its operation  developing theory and testing the model of an object  Instead  the new approach is proposed  from specified data   to a general model   after the input of data  a researcher selects a class of models  the type of models variants generation and sets the criterion for model selection  As most routine work is transferred to a computer  the impact of human influence on the objective result is minimised  In fact  this approach can be considered as one of the implementations of the artificial intelligence thesis  which states that a computer can act as powerful advisor to humans 
The development of GMDH consists of a synthesis of ideas from different areas of science  the cybernetic concept of  black box  and the principle of successive genetic selection of pairwise features  Godel s incompleteness theorems and the Gabor s principle of  freedom of decisions choice              the Adh mar s incorrectness and the Beer s principle of external additions            
GMDH is the original method for solving problems for structural parametric identification of models for experimental data under uncertainty             Such a problem occurs in the construction of a mathematical model that approximates the unknown pattern of investigated object or process             It uses information about it that is implicitly contained in data  GMDH differs from other methods of modelling by the active application of the following principles  automatic models generation  inconclusive decisions  and consistent selection by external criteria for finding models of optimal complexity  It had an original multilayered procedure for automatic models structure generation  which imitates the evolutionary process of biological selection with consideration of pairwise successive features  Such procedure is currently used in deep learning networks              To compare and choose optimal models  two or more subsets of a data sample are used  This makes it possible to avoid preliminary assumptions  because sample division implicitly acknowledges different types of uncertainty during the automatic construction of the optimal model 
In the early     s Ivakhnenko had established an organic analogy between the problem of constructing models for noisy data and signal passing through the channel with noise              This made possible to lay the foundations of the theory of noise immune modelling             The main result of this theory is that the complexity of optimal predictive model depends on the level of uncertainty in the data  the higher this level  e g  due to noise    the simpler must be the optimal model  with less estimated parameters   This initiated the development of the GMDH theory as an inductive method of automatic adaptation of optimal model complexity to the level of information in fuzzy data  Therefore  GMDH is often considered to be the original information technology for knowledge extraction from experimental data 

Results edit 
Alongside to GMDH  Ivakhnenko had developed the following set of results  

Principle of construction of self organizing deep learning networks            
Theory of models self organization according to experimental data             
Method of control with forecast optimization             
New principles of automatic control of speed for AC and asynchronous electric motors             
Theory of invariant systems for adaptive control with compensation of measured disturbances              He had developed the principle of indirect measurement of disturbances  called as  differential fork  that was used later in practice 
Principle of combined control  with negative feedback for the controlled variables and positive feedback for the controlled disturbances               A number of such systems  for the speed control of electric motors had been implemented in practice  That proved the practical feasibility of invariant conditions in a combined control systems that unite the advantages of closed systems for control by deviation  high precision  and open systems  performance  
The non searching extreme regulators on the basis of situations recognition             
Principle of self learning pattern recognition  It was demonstrated at first in the cognitive system  Alpha              created under his leadership 
Basis for the construction of cybernetic prediction devices             
Noise immune principles of robust modelling for data with noises            
Design of multilayered neural networks with active neurons  where each neuron is an algorithm 
Ivakhnenko is well known for his achievements in the theory of invariance and theory of combined automatic control systems  that operates on the principle of measured disturbances compensation  He had developed devices and methods for the adaptive control of systems with magnetic amplifiers and motors  
He is the author of the first Soviet monograph on engineering cybernetics              which was published worldwide in seven languages              In his study  a further development of the principles of combined control was connected with the implementation of methods of evolutionary self organisation  pattern recognition and forecasting in control systems 
In recent years  his main innovation   the GMDH method   was developed as a method of inductive modelling  complex processes  and systems forecasting  His ideas are utilised now in deep learning networks             The effectiveness of the method was confirmed repeatedly during the solution of real complex problems in ecology  meteorology  economics and technology  which aided increase its popularity among the international scientific community              In parallel  there were conducted developments of evolutionary self organising algorithms in a related field   clustering problems of pattern recognition              Advances in the modelling of environmental processes reflected in the monographs                          economic processes   in the books              
             The results of exploration of recurrent multilayered GMDH algorithms are described in the books                        

Scientific school edit 
From      to      Ivakhnenko was the editor of the specialized scientific journal  Avtomatika   later  Problems of management and computer science    that played a crucial role in the formation and development of the Ukrainian school of Inductive modelling  Throughout these years the magazine was translated and reprinted in the United States as  Soviet Automatic Control   later  Journal of Automation and Information Sciences   
Alongside constant innovation in his field since       Ivakhnenko maintained an active teaching career  at first as the Assistant Professor at the Department of Theoretical Mechanics  and then at the Control Systems faculty  Since      as Professor of the Department of Technical Cybernetics in Kyiv Polytechnic Institute  he contributed lectures to the University and student body  as well as oversaw the work of many graduate students  In           he was an organiser of the All Union Conferences of Invariance in Kiev  where the development of the invariant control systems theory was restored after prohibition             
His inexhaustible enthusiasm helped more than     young scientists to prepare and successfully defend their Ph D  dissertations under his leadership in the KPI and the Institute of Cybernetics and nearly    of his students defended their post doctoral dissertations  Scientific school of Ivakhnenko was and is a real cradle of highly qualified scientific professionals  Furthermore  his students V M Kuntsevych  V I Kostyuk  V I Ivanenko  V I Vasiliev  A A Pavlov and others had created their own respected scientific schools  Ivakhnenko was a shining example of a scientist  with a keen sense of new and remarkable scientific intuition  Until his last days  he continued to work actively and generously generated original scientific ideas and results
