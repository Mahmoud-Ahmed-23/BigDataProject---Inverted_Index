Early life and education edit 
Huang was born in Taipei  Taiwan  on February                      and moved to the southern city of Tainan as a child             He is the younger of two sons of Huang Hsing tai  a chemical engineer at an oil refinery  and Lo Tsai hsiu  a schoolteacher             They were a middle class Taiwanese family that relocated often             Each day  Jensen s mother randomly selected ten words from the dictionary to teach her sons English             When he was five years old  Huang s family moved to Thailand to support his father s refinery work and remained there for approximately four years                         He attended Ruamrudee International School while in Bangkok             
In the late     s  Hsing tai traveled from Taiwan to New York City to train under an air conditioning company and  after returning home  resolved to send his sons to the United States              At age nine  Jensen  despite not being able to speak English  was sent by his parents to live in the US              He and his older brother moved in      to reside with an uncle in Tacoma  Washington  escaping widespread social unrest in Thailand              Both Huang s aunt and uncle were recent immigrants to Washington state  they accidentally enrolled him and his brother in the Oneida Baptist Institute  a religious reform academy in Kentucky for troubled youth              mistakenly believing it to be a prestigious boarding school              In order to afford the academy s tuition  Jensen s parents sold nearly all their possessions             
When he was ten years old  Huang lived with his brother in the Oneida boys  dormitory              Each student was expected to work every day  and his older brother was assigned to perform manual labor on a nearby tobacco farm              Because he was too young to attend classes at the reform academy  Huang was educated at a separate public school the Oneida Elementary school in Oneida  Kentucky arriving as  an undersized Asian immigrant with long hair and heavily accented English              and was frequently bullied and beaten              In Oneida  Huang cleaned toilets every day  learned to play table tennis      b      joined the swimming team              and appeared in Sports Illustrated at age                 He taught his illiterate roommate  a     year old covered in tattoos and knife scars               how to read in exchange for being taught how to bench press              In       Huang recalled that he remembered his life in Kentucky  more vividly than just about any other              
Two years after Huang arrived in Oneida  his parents moved to the United States and settled in Beaverton  Oregon  where the brothers withdrew from school in Kentucky to live back with them              As a teenager  Huang attended Aloha High School in Aloha  Oregon              where he excelled academically  He skipped two grades  graduated at age sixteen  and became a nationally ranked table tennis player in addition to being a member of its mathematics  computer  and science clubs              Beginning at age                 Huang also got his first job working the graveyard shift             at a local Denny s restaurant as a dishwasher  busboy  and waiter from      to                              
After high school  Huang chose to enroll in Oregon State University due to its low in state tuition              He studied electrical engineering  and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in      at age                 He later recalled   I was the youngest kid in school  in class  and the only student who  looked like a child               Years later  while working as a microchip designer in Silicon Valley  he concurrently pursued graduate night classes at Stanford University  where he earned a master s degree in electrical engineering in                              

AMD and LSI Logic edit 
After graduating from college  Huang was a microchip designer in Silicon Valley              He had interviewed for positions at Texas Instruments  Advanced Micro Devices  AMD   and LSI Logic  ultimately choosing the California based AMD due to already being familiar with the company  He designed AMD microprocessors while simultaneously attending Stanford and raising his two children  However  when he heard of new chip design processes at LSI Logic  Huang left AMD to assume a role as a technical officer at the LSI Corporation  working under a startup company  Sun Microsystems  where he met engineers Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem             
LSI was in contract with Sun Microsystems and had introduced Huang to Malachowsky and Priem  who were working on a new graphics accelerator card  While the three produced the card s manufacturing process  the relationship between Malachowsky and Priem became strained as the two disputed the chip s design  leading to infighting  according to Malachowsky  they  broke every tool that LSI Logic had in their standard portfolio               In       Huang  Malachowsky  and Priem finalized the accelerator  which they called the  GX graphics engine               GX was a widespread financial success  the sales of the graphics engine contributed to Sun Microsystem s revenue increasing from      million in      to      million in       and Huang was promoted to be the director of LSI s CoreWare  a division that manufactured chips for hardware vendors             

Nvidia edit 
Founding        edit 
Huang founded Nvidia Corporation after meeting with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem in a Denny s diner in East San Jose  pictured   As a teenager  Huang was previously an employee at a Denny s restaurant in Oregon 
When business began to slow for Sun Microsystems after       Huang  along with Priem and Malachowsky  each resigned their jobs to pursue a venture together in making graphics chips for PC games              They initially named their new company  NVision  until Huang suggested that the company be named  Nvidia  based on the Latin word invidia  as Priem wanted competitors to turn  green with envy               The three met frequently in      at a Denny s roadside diner in East San Jose to formulate a business plan              Huang chose for them to meet at Denny s due to his prior work experience at the restaurant chain and because it was  quieter than home and had cheap coffee               The three founded the company during one meeting at the Denny s diner at a breakfast booth                         
To formally incorporate the company  Huang found a lawyer  James Gaither of Cooley Godward  who demanded the      in cash in Huang s pockets to capitalize the company   After that meeting  Huang went back to Priem and Malachowsky to ask each of them for      for their respective shares of the company  which meant that Nvidia s initial capital was                    On April          Huang personally signed Nvidia s original articles of incorporation into effect            
Although he left LSI  Huang remained in good standing with the company and was able to secure funding for Nvidia from LSI s CEO  Wilfred Corrigan  who introduced Huang to venture capitalist Don Valentine  Valentine  the leader of Sequoia Capital  chose to invest in Nvidia  as did Sutter Hill Ventures  The funding enabled Nvidia to begin development efforts toward its first chip and to begin paying wages for its employees              By the first day of operation  Huang was made Nvidia s president and CEO              Even though Huang  at age     was younger than Priem and Malachowsky  both Priem and Malachowsky believed that he was prepared to be CEO              According to Priem   we basically deferred to Jensen on day one  and told Huang   you re in charge of running the company all the stuff Chris and I don t know how to do                   c     

President and CEO         edit 
As of       Huang has been Nvidia s chief executive for over three decades  a tenure described by The Wall Street Journal as  almost unheard of in fast moving Silicon Valley               He owns      of Nvidia s stock  which went public in                  He earned US      million as CEO in       ranking him as the   st highest paid U S  CEO by Forbes            Huang meeting with Narendra Modi in     According to Huang  the three co founders in      had  no idea how  to start a company               building Nvidia turned out to have been a million times harder  than they expected  and they probably would not have done it if they had realized up front  the pain and suffering  involved      the challenges  they were  going to endure  the embarrassment and the shame  and the list of all the things that  would  go wrong                For its first graphics accelerator chips  Nvidia focused on rendering quadrilateral primitives  forward texture mapping  instead of the triangle primitives preferred by its competitors              and barely survived long enough to successfully pivot to triangles only because Sega agreed to keep Nvidia alive with a    million investment              By the time the RIVA     was released in August      and saved the company  Nvidia was down to one month of payroll              This resulted in the  unofficial company motto    Our company is thirty days from going out of business               Huang regularly began presentations to Nvidia staff with those words for many years               However  Huang regards the  pain and suffering  of Nvidia s early years as essential to the company s success in later years  because it forced him to become a better leader             
Huang does not keep a fixed office  he roams Nvidia s headquarters and settles temporarily in conference rooms as needed               He prefers to maintain a relatively flat management structure  with around    direct reports as of November                   based upon his view that people reporting directly to him  should be at the top of their game  and  require the least amount of pampering                He does not wear a watch  because as he likes to say   now is the most important time              
Historically  Huang and Nvidia were well known only among the gamers and computer graphics experts who were the original intended markets for Nvidia s graphics processing unit  GPU  products   In       a Fortune profile article acknowledged   If you haven t heard of Nvidia  you can be forgiven               During the AI boom  Huang s net worth rose rapidly along with the value of Nvidia s stock  from US   billion in      to US    billion in May                    During this same timeframe  Huang became more widely known   In March       Mark Zuckerberg wrote on Instagram with a picture of himself and Huang wearing each other s signature jacket   He s like Taylor Swift  but for tech              
In June       Nvidia s market capitalization reached US   trillion for the first time and Huang s net worth grew to US     billion              By then  the news media was using the term  Jensanity  to refer to Huang s celebrity status in Taiwan              and it was compared to the  Linsanity  phenomenon of                   Huang was the center of attention at Computex      in Taipei  even though he was not on the official speaking program              Large crowds of fans and paparazzi followed Huang and his family members around every time they appeared in public during their      visit to Taiwan                         
In January       Huang delivered the keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas              During this keynote  Huang made a number of announcements such as a new gaming chip called the GeForce RTX    series  new chips for both PCs and laptops              an agreement to provide Toyota self driving vehicles with Nvidia s Drive AGX Orin supercomputer and operating system called DriveOS              and the release of Cosmos  a series of foundational AI models designed to support the development of self driving cars  humanoid robots and industrial robots             

Philanthropy edit 
In       Nvidia contributed funds to establish a classroom at the Beijing Haidian Foreign Language Shi Yan School to cater to     elementary and middle school students from regions affected by the      Wenchuan earthquake in China  As a gesture of appreciation for the donation  the students ceremoniously bestowed a red scarf upon Huang  symbolizing their gratitude towards him  In return  Huang gifted kaleidoscopes to the students as a gesture of appreciation during the donation ceremony              In addition  Huang also provided a donation of US    million to his former university  Stanford University  to establish the Jen Hsun Huang School of Engineering Center              The building is the second of four that make up Stanford s Science and Engineering Quad             
In       Huang donated    million to his former school  Oneida Baptist Institute  for the construction of Huang Hall  a modern facility that serves as a dormitory and classroom building for female students             
In       Huang gifted US    million to his alma mater  Oregon State University  as part of a larger US     million philanthropic contribution to establish a cutting edge supercomputing institute on the university campus
