Command and control  abbr  C   is a  set of organizational and technical attributes and processes      that  employs human  physical  and information resources to solve problems and accomplish missions  to achieve the goals of an organization or enterprise  according to  a      definition by military scientists Marius Vassiliou  David S  Alberts  and Jonathan R  Agre                        The term often refers to a military system 
Versions of the United States Army Field Manual     circulated circa      define C  in a military organization as the exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated commanding officer over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of a mission                       
A      NATO definition is that command and control is the exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated individual over assigned resources in the accomplishment of a common goal             An Australian Defence Force definition  similar to that of NATO  emphasises that C  is the system empowering designated personnel to exercise lawful authority and direction over assigned forces for the accomplishment of missions and tasks             The Australian doctrine goes on to state   The use of agreed terminology and definitions is fundamental to any C  system and the development of joint doctrine and procedures  The definitions in the following paragraphs have some agreement internationally  although not every potential ally will use the terms with exactly the same meaning             


Overview edit 
US perspective edit 
The US Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms            defines command and control as   The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission  Also called C   Source  JP               
The edition of the Dictionary  As Amended Through April       elaborates   Command and control functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel  equipment  communications  facilities  and procedures employed by a commander in planning  directing  coordinating  and controlling forces and operations in the accomplishment of the mission              However  this sentence is missing from the  command and control  entry for the edition  As Amended Through    August                   
Commanding officers are assisted in executing these tasks by specialized staff officers and enlisted personnel  These military staff are a group of officers and enlisted personnel that provides a bi directional flow of information between a commanding officer and subordinate military units             
The purpose of a military staff is mainly that of providing accurate  timely information which by category represents information on which command decisions are based  The key application is that of decisions that effectively manage unit resources  While information flow toward the commander is a priority  information that is useful or contingent in nature is communicated to lower staffs and units      citation needed     

Computer security industry edit 
Main article  Command and control  malware 
This term is also in common use within the computer security industry and in the context of cyberwarfare  Here the term refers to the influence an attacker has over a compromised computer system that they control  For example  a valid usage of the term is to say that attackers use  command and control infrastructure  to issue  command and control instructions  to their victims  Advanced analysis of command and control methodologies can be used to identify attackers  associate attacks  and disrupt ongoing malicious activity

Command and control warfare edit 
Command and control warfare encompasses all the military tactics that use communications technology  It can be abbreviated as C W  An older name for these tactics is  signals warfare   derived from the name given to communications by the military  Newer names include information operations and information warfare             
The following techniques are combined 

Cyber operations
with the physical destruction of enemy communications facilities  The objective is to deny information to the enemy and so disrupt its command and control capabilities  At the same time precautions are taken to protect friendly command and control capabilities against retaliation 
In addition to targeting the enemy s command and control  information warfare can be directed to the enemy s politicians and other civilian communications
