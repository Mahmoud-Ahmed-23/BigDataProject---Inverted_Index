IBM Watson is a computer system capable of answering questions posed in natural language             It was developed as a part of IBM s DeepQA project by a research team  led by principal investigator David Ferrucci             Watson was named after IBM s founder and first CEO  industrialist Thomas J  Watson                       
The computer system was initially developed to answer questions on the popular quiz show Jeopardy             and in       the Watson computer system competed on Jeopardy  against champions Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings                        winning the first place prize of US   million            
In February       IBM announced that Watson s first commercial application would be for utilization management decisions in lung cancer treatment  at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  New York City  in conjunction with WellPoint  now Elevance Health             


Description edit 
The high level architecture of IBM s DeepQA used in Watson           
Watson was created as a question answering  QA  computing system that IBM built to apply advanced natural language processing  information retrieval  knowledge representation  automated reasoning  and machine learning technologies to the field of open domain question answering            
IBM stated that Watson uses  more than     different techniques to analyze natural language  identify sources  find and generate hypotheses  find and score evidence  and merge and rank hypotheses              
In recent years  Watson s capabilities have been extended and the way in which Watson works has been changed to take advantage of new deployment models  Watson on IBM Cloud   evolved machine learning capabilities  and optimized hardware available to developers and researchers       citation needed     

Software edit 
Watson uses IBM s DeepQA software and the Apache UIMA  Unstructured Information Management Architecture  framework implementation  The system was written in various languages  including Java  C    and Prolog  and runs on the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server    operating system using the Apache Hadoop framework to provide distributed computing                                     

Hardware edit 
The system is workload optimized  integrating massively parallel POWER  processors and built on IBM s DeepQA technology              which it uses to generate hypotheses  gather massive evidence  and analyze data             Watson employs a cluster of ninety IBM Power     servers  each of which uses a          GHz POWER  eight core processor  with four threads per core  In total  the system uses       POWER  processor threads and    terabytes of RAM             
According to John Rennie  Watson can process     gigabytes  the equivalent of a million books  per second              IBM master inventor and senior consultant Tony Pearson estimated Watson s hardware cost at about three million dollars              Its Linpack performance stands at    TeraFLOPs  which is about half as fast as the cut off line for the Top     Supercomputers list              According to Rennie  all content was stored in Watson s RAM for the Jeopardy game because data stored on hard drives would be too slow to compete with human Jeopardy champions             

Data edit 
The sources of information for Watson include encyclopedias  dictionaries  thesauri  newswire articles and literary works  Watson also used databases  taxonomies and ontologies including DBPedia  WordNet and Yago              The IBM team provided Watson with millions of documents  including dictionaries  encyclopedias and other reference material  that it could use to build its knowledge             

Operation edit 
Watson parses questions into different keywords and sentence fragments in order to find statistically related phrases              Watson s main innovation was not in the creation of a new algorithm for this operation  but rather its ability to quickly execute hundreds of proven language analysis algorithms simultaneously                          The more algorithms that find the same answer independently  the more likely Watson is to be correct  Once Watson has a small number of potential solutions  it is able to check against its database to ascertain whether the solution makes sense or not             

Comparison with human players edit

Watson s basic working principle is to parse keywords in a clue while searching for related terms as responses  This gives Watson some advantages and disadvantages compared with human Jeopardy  players              Watson has deficiencies in understanding the context of the clues  Watson can read  analyze  and learn from natural language  which gives it the ability to make human like decisions              As a result  human players usually generate responses faster than Watson  especially to short clues              Watson s programming prevents it from using the popular tactic of buzzing before it is sure of its response              However  Watson has consistently better reaction time on the buzzer once it has generated a response  and is immune to human players  psychological tactics  such as jumping between categories on every clue                         
In a sequence of    mock games of Jeopardy   human participants were able to use the six to seven seconds that Watson needed to hear the clue and decide whether to signal for responding              During that time  Watson also has to evaluate the response and determine whether it is sufficiently confident in the result to signal              Part of the system used to win the Jeopardy  contest was the electronic circuitry that receives the  ready  signal and then examines whether Watson s confidence level was great enough to activate the buzzer  Given the speed of this circuitry compared to the speed of human reaction times  Watson s reaction time was faster than the human contestants except when the human anticipated  instead of reacted to  the ready signal              After signaling  Watson speaks with an electronic voice and gives the responses in Jeopardy      s question format              Watson s voice was synthesized from recordings that actor Jeff Woodman made for an IBM text to speech program in                  
The Jeopardy  staff used different means to notify Watson and the human players when to buzz              which was critical in many rounds              The humans were notified by a light  which took them tenths of a second to perceive                          Watson was notified by an electronic signal and could activate the buzzer within about eight milliseconds              The humans tried to compensate for the perception delay by anticipating the light              but the variation in the anticipation time was generally too great to fall within Watson s response time              Watson did not attempt to anticipate the notification signal                         

History edit 
Development edit 
Since Deep Blue s victory over Garry Kasparov in chess in       IBM had been on the hunt for a new challenge  In       IBM Research manager Charles Lickel  over dinner with coworkers  noticed that the restaurant they were in had fallen silent  He soon discovered the cause of this evening s hiatus  Ken Jennings  who was then in the middle of his successful    game run on Jeopardy   Nearly the entire restaurant had piled toward the televisions  mid meal  to watch Jeopardy   Intrigued by the quiz show as a possible challenge for IBM  Lickel passed the idea on  and in       IBM Research executive Paul Horn supported Lickel  pushing for someone in his department to take up the challenge of playing Jeopardy  with an IBM system  Though he initially had trouble finding any research staff willing to take on what looked to be a much more complex challenge than the wordless game of chess  eventually David Ferrucci took him up on the offer              In competitions managed by the United States government  Watson s predecessor  a system named Piquant  was usually able to respond correctly to only about     of clues and often required several minutes to respond                                      To compete successfully on Jeopardy   Watson would need to respond in no more than a few seconds  and at that time  the problems posed by the game show were deemed to be impossible to solve             
In initial tests run during      by David Ferrucci  the senior manager of IBM s Semantic Analysis and Integration department  Watson was given     clues from past Jeopardy  programs  While the best real life competitors buzzed in half the time and responded correctly to as many as     of clues  Watson s first pass could get only about     correct  During       the IBM team was given three to five years and a staff of    people to solve the problems              John E  Kelly III succeeded Paul Horn as head of IBM Research in                   InformationWeek described Kelly as  the father of Watson  and credited him for encouraging the system to compete against humans on Jeopardy               By       the developers had advanced Watson such that it could compete with Jeopardy  champions              By February       Watson could beat human Jeopardy  contestants on a regular basis             
During the game  Watson had access to     million pages of structured and unstructured content consuming four terabytes of disk storage             including the full text of the      edition of Wikipedia              but was not connected to the Internet                          For each clue  Watson s three most probable responses were displayed on the television screen  Watson consistently outperformed its human opponents on the game s signaling device  but had trouble in a few categories  notably those having short clues containing only a few words      citation needed     
Although the system is primarily an IBM effort  Watson s development involved faculty and graduate students from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute  Carnegie Mellon University  University of Massachusetts Amherst  the University of Southern California s Information Sciences Institute  the University of Texas at Austin  the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  and the University of Trento             as well as students from New York Medical College              Among the team of IBM programmers who worked on Watson was      Who Wants to Be a Millionaire  top prize winner Ed Toutant  who himself had appeared on Jeopardy  in       winning one game              

Jeopardy  edit 
Preparation edit 
Watson demo at an IBM booth at a trade show
In       IBM representatives communicated with Jeopardy  executive producer Harry Friedman about the possibility of having Watson compete against Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter  two of the most successful contestants on the show  and the program s producers agreed                          Watson s differences with human players had generated conflicts between IBM and Jeopardy  staff during the planning of the competition              IBM repeatedly expressed concerns that the show s writers would exploit Watson s cognitive deficiencies when writing the clues  thereby turning the game into a Turing test  To alleviate that claim  a third party randomly picked the clues from previously written shows that were never broadcast              Jeopardy  staff also showed concerns over Watson s reaction time on the buzzer  Originally Watson signaled electronically  but show staff requested that it press a button physically  as the human contestants would              Even with a robotic  finger  pressing the buzzer  Watson remained faster than its human competitors  Ken Jennings noted   If you re trying to win on the show  the buzzer is all   and that Watson  can knock out a microsecond precise buzz every single time with little or no variation  Human reflexes can t compete with computer circuits in this regard                                       Stephen Baker  a journalist who recorded Watson s development in his book Final Jeopardy  reported that the conflict between IBM and Jeopardy  became so serious in May      that the competition was almost cancelled              As part of the preparation  IBM constructed a mock set in a conference room at one of its technology sites to model the one used on Jeopardy   Human players  including former Jeopardy  contestants  also participated in mock games against Watson with Todd Alan Crain of The Onion playing host              About     test matches were conducted with Watson winning     of the games             
To provide a physical presence in the televised games  Watson was represented by an  avatar  of a globe  inspired by the IBM  smarter planet  symbol  Jennings described the computer s avatar as a  glowing blue ball crisscrossed by  threads  of thought    threads  to be precise               and stated that the number of thought threads in the avatar was an in joke referencing the significance of the number    in Douglas Adams  Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy              Joshua Davis  the artist who designed the avatar for the project  explained to Stephen Baker that there are    triggerable states that Watson was able to use throughout the game to show its confidence in responding to a clue correctly  he had hoped to be able to find forty two  to add another level to the Hitchhiker s Guide reference  but he was unable to pinpoint enough game states             
A practice match was recorded on January           and the official matches were recorded on January           All participants maintained secrecy about the outcome until the match was broadcast in February             

Practice match edit 
In a practice match before the press on January           Watson won a    question round against Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter with a score of        to Jennings s        and Rutter s         though Jennings and Watson were tied before the final        question  None of the three players responded incorrectly to a clue             

First match edit 
The first round was broadcast February           and the second round  on February           The right to choose the first category had been determined by a draw won by Rutter              Watson  represented by a computer monitor display and artificial voice  responded correctly to the second clue and then selected the fourth clue of the first category  a deliberate strategy to find the Daily Double as quickly as possible              Watson s guess at the Daily Double location was correct  At the end of the first round  Watson was tied with Rutter at         Jennings had                    
Watson s performance was characterized by some quirks  In one instance  Watson repeated a reworded version of an incorrect response offered by Jennings   Jennings said  What are the    s   in reference to the     s  Then Watson said  What is     s    Because Watson could not recognize other contestants  responses  it did not know that Jennings had already given the same response  In another instance  Watson was initially given credit for a response of  What is a leg   after Jennings incorrectly responded  What is  he only had one hand   to a clue about George Eyser  the correct response was   What is  he s missing a leg     Because Watson  unlike a human  could not have been responding to Jennings s mistake  it was decided that this response was incorrect  The broadcast version of the episode was edited to omit Trebek s original acceptance of Watson s response              Watson also demonstrated complex wagering strategies on the Daily Doubles  with one bet at        and another at                     Gerald Tesauro  one of the IBM researchers who worked on Watson  explained that Watson s wagers were based on its confidence level for the category and a complex regression model called the Game State Evaluator             
Watson took a commanding lead in Double Jeopardy   correctly responding to both Daily Doubles  Watson responded to the second Daily Double correctly with a     confidence score             
However  during the Final Jeopardy  round  Watson was the only contestant to miss the clue in the category U S  Cities   Its largest airport was named for a World War II hero  its second largest  for a World War II battle    Rutter and Jennings gave the correct response of Chicago  but Watson s response was  What is Toronto       with five question marks appended indicating a lack of confidence                                      Ferrucci offered reasons why Watson would appear to have guessed a Canadian city  categories only weakly suggest the type of response desired  the phrase  U S  city  did not appear in the question  there are cities named Toronto in the U S   and Toronto in Ontario has an American League baseball team              Chris Welty  who also worked on Watson  suggested that it may not have been able to correctly parse the second part of the clue   its second largest  for a World War II battle   which was not a standalone clause despite it following a semicolon  and required context to understand that it was referring to a second largest airport               Eric Nyberg  a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a member of the development team  stated that the error occurred because Watson does not possess the comparative knowledge to discard that potential response as not viable              Although not displayed to the audience as with non Final Jeopardy  questions  Watson s second choice was Chicago  Both Toronto and Chicago were well below Watson s confidence threshold  at     and     respectively  Watson wagered only      on the question             
The game ended with Jennings with         Rutter with          and Watson with                     

Second match edit 
During the introduction  Trebek  a Canadian native  joked that he had learned Toronto was a U S  city  and Watson s error in the first match prompted an IBM engineer to wear a Toronto Blue Jays jacket to the recording of the second match             
In the first round  Jennings was finally able to choose a Daily Double clue              while Watson responded to one Daily Double clue incorrectly for the first time in the Double Jeopardy  Round              After the first round  Watson placed second for the first time in the competition after Rutter and Jennings were briefly successful in increasing their dollar values before Watson could respond                          Nonetheless  the final result ended with a victory for Watson with a score of          besting Jennings who scored         and Rutter who scored                     

Final outcome edit 
The prizes for the competition were    million for first place  Watson            for second place  Jennings   and          for third place  Rutter   As promised  IBM donated      of Watson s winnings to charity  with     of those winnings going to World Vision and     going to World Community Grid              Similarly  Jennings and Rutter donated     of their winnings to their respective charities             

In acknowledgement of IBM and Watson s achievements  Jennings made an additional remark in his Final Jeopardy  response   I for one welcome our new computer overlords   paraphrasing a joke from The Simpsons                          Jennings later wrote an article for Slate  in which he stated  IBM has bragged to the media that Watson s question answering skills are good for more than annoying Alex Trebek  The company sees a future in which fields like medical diagnosis  business analytics  and tech support are automated by question answering software like Watson  Just as factory jobs were eliminated in the   th century by new assembly line robots  Brad and I were the first knowledge industry workers put out of work by the new generation of  thinking  machines   Quiz show contestant  may be the first job made redundant by Watson  but I m sure it won t be the last             
Philosophy edit 
Philosopher John Searle argues that Watson despite impressive capabilities cannot actually think              Drawing on his Chinese room thought experiment  Searle claims that Watson  like other computational machines  is capable only of manipulating symbols  but has no ability to understand the meaning of those symbols  however  Searle s experiment has its detractors             

Match against members of the United States Congress edit 
On February           Watson played an untelevised exhibition match of Jeopardy  against members of the United States House of Representatives  In the first round  Rush D  Holt  Jr   D NJ  a former Jeopardy  contestant   who was challenging the computer with Bill Cassidy  R LA  later Senator from Louisiana   led with Watson in second place  However  combining the scores between all matches  the final score was         for Watson and         for the congressional players combined             
IBM s Christopher Padilla said of the match   The technology behind Watson represents a major advancement in computing  In the data intensive environment of government  this type of technology can help organizations make better decisions and improve how government helps its citizens              

Applications edit 
After the national press attention gained by the      Jeopardy  appearance  IBM sought out partnerships from education to weather and cancer to retail chatbots in order convince business about Watson s alleged capabilities  This ultimately led to the failure of Watson to find a profit making product for the company              
In       the IBM general counsel wrote in The National Law Review arguing that the law profession will become more efficient and better with Watson              After the national attention Jeopardy  afforded them  began an ultimately unsuccessful and expensive project that began when the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center tried to use Watson to help doctors diagnose and treat cancer patients  Ultimately  the division cost    billion to develop but was sold for a quarter of that    billion  in                   By       Watson resulted in IBM losing     of its stock value  costing four times more than what it brought to the company and resulting in mass layoffs             
From      through the late     s  Watson s technology was used to create applications mostly discontinued             to help people make decisions in a variety of areas  among them

and tax preparations             
In       technology reporter at The New York Times for Steve Rohr  explained 

The company s missteps with Watson began with its early emphasis on big and difficult initiatives intended to generate both acclaim and sizable revenue for the company  according to many of the more than a dozen current and former IBM managers and scientists interviewed for this article  Several of those people asked not to be named because they had not been authorized to speak or still had business ties to IBM         Steve Rohr   What Ever Happened to IBM s Watson    The New York Times            
Writing in The Atlantic in       Mac Schwerin argued that IBM s leadership fundamentally did not understand the technology  leading to the hardship and strain caused by the project  saying 

But the suits in charge went after the bigger and more technically challenging game of feeding the machine entirely different types of material  They viewed Watson as a generational meal ticket         Mac Schwerin   America Forgot About IBM Watson  Is ChatGPT Next    The Atlantic            
In the end  IBM s initial vision for Watson as a transformative technology capable of revolutionizing industries did not materialize as anticipated              Watson s capabilities were primarily suited to specific tasks  like natural language processing for trivia games  rather than generalized commercial problem solving              Watson s mismatch between capabilities and IBM s marketing contributed significantly to Watson s commercial struggles and eventual decline  The overstated claims about Watson s abilities also caused public sentiment to turn against the idea of Watson and artificial intelligence             
Between      and       IBM shifted focus to a separate initiative WatsonX  distinctly different from Watson  aiming for narrower  industry targeted technology within IBM s cloud computing and platform based strategies IBM Watsonx                         

Healthcare edit

IBM s Watson was used to analyze medical datasets to provide physicians with guidance on diagnoses and cancer treatment decisions                          When a physician submitted a query to Watson  the system started a multi step process by parsing the input to identify key information  examining patient data to uncover relevant medical and hereditary history  and finally compare various data sources to form and test hypotheses                         
IBM claimed that Watson s could draw from a wide range of sources  including treatment guidelines  electronic medical records  and research materials              Although  company executives would later blame the lack of data on the projects ultimate failure             
Notably  Watson has not been involved in the actual diagnosis process  but rather assists doctors in identifying suitable treatment options for patients who have already been diagnosed             In fact  a study of       challenging patient cases found that Watson s recommendations matched those of human doctors in an impressive     of cases             
IBM  established partnerships with the Cleveland Clinic               the MD Anderson Cancer Center  and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to further its mission in healthcare  In       IBM entered into a research partnership with Nuance Communications and physicians at the University of Maryland and Harvard to develop a commercial product using Watson s clinical decision support capabilities  IBM partnered with WellPoint  now Anthem  in      to utilize Watson in suggesting treatment options to physicians              and in       Watson was deployed in its first commercial application for utilization management decisions in lung cancer treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center             The Cleveland Clinic collaboration aimed to enhance Watson s health expertise and support medical professionals in treating patients more effectively  However  the MD Anderson Cancer Center pilot program  initiated in       ultimately failed to meet its goals and was discontinued after     million in investment                                     
In       IBM launched  IBM Watson for Oncology   a product designed to provide personalized  evidence based cancer care options to physicians and patients              This initiative marked a significant milestone in the adoption of Watson s technology in the healthcare industry  Additionally  IBM partnered with Manipal Hospitals in India to offer Watson s expertise to patients online                          
The company ultimately faced challenges in the healthcare market  with no profit and increased competition              In       IBM announced the sell off of its Watson Health unit to Francisco Partners  marking a significant shift in the company s approach to the healthcare industry                         

IBM Watson Group edit 
On January          IBM announced it was creating a business unit around Watson               IBM Watson Group will have headquarters in New York City s Silicon Alley and will employ       people  IBM has invested    billion to get the division going  Watson Group will develop three new cloud delivered services  Watson Discovery Advisor  Watson Engagement Advisor  and Watson Explorer  Watson Discovery Advisor will focus on research and development projects in pharmaceutical industry  publishing  and biotechnology  Watson Engagement Advisor will focus on self service applications using insights on the basis of natural language questions posed by business users  and Watson Explorer will focus on helping enterprise users uncover and share data driven insights based on federated search more easily               The company is also launching a      million venture fund to spur application development for  cognitive  applications  According to IBM  the cloud delivered enterprise ready Watson has seen its speed increase    times over a       percent improvement in performance and its physical size shrank by    percent from the size of a master bedroom to three stacked pizza boxes               IBM CEO Virginia Rometty said she wants Watson to generate     billion in annual revenue within ten years               In       IBM and MIT established a new joint research venture in artificial intelligence  IBM invested      million to create the MIT IBM Watson AI Lab in partnership with MIT  which brings together researchers in academia and industry to advance AI research  with projects ranging from computer vision and NLP to devising new ways to ensure that AI systems are fair  reliable and secure               In March       IBM s CEO Ginni Rometty proposed  Watson s Law   the  use of and application of business  smart cities  consumer applications and life in general
