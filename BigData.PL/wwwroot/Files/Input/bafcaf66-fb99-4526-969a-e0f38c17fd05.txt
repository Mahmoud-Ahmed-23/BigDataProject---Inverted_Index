							Property prices in Egypt will definitely increase in the coming four months due to growing inflation and price spikes in construction materials  which in turn will force developers to increase the cost of units for sale  Catesby Langer Paget  Head of Savills Egypt  told Daily News Egypt 
 Egypt s real estate  as a sector for investment  has generally performed well in times of crisis   said Langer Paget 
He noted that the number of branded residences has increased globally  not just in Egypt  It is a global trend and we have seen that Egypt has achieved great success with branded residences in Cairo in the past  However  this type of property still represents a small portion of the upcoming residential supply 
He further pointed out   There is demand for residential property across all price points in Egypt as the population increases by   million every year  That is to say  demand increases in every sector every year  Moreover  there is a great demand for commercial and administrative space from investors  both local and those living abroad  particularly in the New Administrative Capital  Additionally  the opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum will give a boost to the property market in West Cairo as well as Sphinx airport  This falls in line with Egypt s efforts in developing and expanding within this region  
Regarding the most promising sectors in the local market  he added   We believe that the logistics and industrial sector is the one that is likely to see the largest growth in the short to medium term as new entrants enter the market to meet the demand for modern space  
Concerning the second home market  he commented that this is a promising sector especially after the COVID    fallout  saying   I think this sector enjoys huge and massive potentials especially in the North Coast and with New Alamein coming up  With new flexible working practices we may even start to see areas of the North Coast and Sokhna operate as first homes  
Lange Paget believes that more mergers and acquisitions will happen in Egypt s real estate market in the coming period  and went on to say   We were expecting something like the Aldar ADQ acquisition of SODIC to happen  Moreover  we feel it is likely that we will start to see the acquisition of small developers by larger ones locally  Accordingly  we project that more acquisitions are coming in the Egyptian real estate market  which in turn will lead to more investment opportunities as new land banks are leveraged  
The government of Egypt has paid a lot of attention to the real estate market  but there is still much to be done to regulate the local market and bring it in line with other real estate markets in the region such as Dubai and Bahrain that already have a fully functioning RERA  Real Estate Regulatory Authority    said Langer Paget 
Historically maintenance of properties has not been a priority in Cairo which is essential to maintaining their value  Recently  as developers focus more on commercial real estate  they have begun to invest more in providing high quality property management for retail and office spaces  In addition  after sale and leasing services are very important to maintain property value  create a vibrant community and best service your buyers 
Regarding challenges in Egypt s real estate sector  Langer Paget commented that the local market needs more regulations between developers and buyers  besides the government 
He would prefer to invest in Egypt s real estate sector because it remains strong and enjoys high demand  He added   Historically prices have risen faster than inflation and performed well even in times of financial uncertainty  I am very positive about real estate in Egypt  
Langer Paget believes that COVID    hasn t affected the retail sector in Egypt as much as others in other countries  everything has gone back to how it was pre pandemic  However  there are other issues affecting the retail sector  currently  such as the difficulties of importing goods and dealing with rapidly increasing prices of fit out costs 
 Egypt s retail market has expanded rapidly in a very short time and is thriving within Egypt  more than any other location in the region  The retail market is headed in the right direction  As a result  demand for retail will continue to grow and well designed and managed schemes will continue to perform well 
He projected that we will see price growth across all sectors  including the retail and office sectors  but that the logistics sector will be the one to see the most growth in Egypt during the coming    months 
 Savills provides any consultancy service related to real estate  Our clients include major Egyptian developers and institutions  besides  major international investors  We provide them with various services ranging from property management  strategic consultancy  project management to marketing consultancy  to name a few  depending on the client s needs  Our client base continues to increase and we don t expect this to slow down anytime soon  he noted 
 We are very excited about COP   which will be held on      November      in Sharm El Sheikh  South Sinai  We are happy that COP   is coming to Egypt this year  Real estate contributes to    percent of carbon emissions globally  a concerning statistic for everyone driving the sustainability agenda in the industry  Climate change has gone from being a fringe issue to a global priority  and we acknowledge our responsibility to do our part and introduce change for good  We are very interested in implementing sustainable practices both within our business and for our clients   he stated   Accordingly  Savills aims to shed light on this and other sustainability challenges faced by the global and regional real estate sector at COP    
Savills Egypt participated in the Race to Zero campaign in       an event hosted at the British Embassy in Cairo  where Savills Egypt pledged its full commitment to optimizing processes to reach net zero carbon emissions by       Langer Paget concluded
