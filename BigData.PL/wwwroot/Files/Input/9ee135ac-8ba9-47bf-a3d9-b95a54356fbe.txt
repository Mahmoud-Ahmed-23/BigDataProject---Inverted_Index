Sora is a text to video model developed by OpenAI  The model generates short video clips based on user prompts  and can also extend existing short videos  Sora was released publicly for ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Pro users in December                            


History edit 
Several other text to video generating models had been created prior to Sora  including Meta s Make A Video  Runway s Gen    and Google s Lumiere  the last of which  as of February           update      is also still in its research phase             OpenAI  the company behind Sora  had released DALL E    the third of its DALL E text to image models  in September                 
The team that developed Sora named it after the Japanese word for sky to signify its  limitless creative potential              On February           OpenAI first previewed Sora by releasing multiple clips of high definition videos that it created  including an SUV driving down a mountain road  an animation of a  short fluffy monster  next to a candle  two people walking through Tokyo in the snow  and fake historical footage of the California gold rush  and stated that it was able to generate videos up to one minute long             The company then shared a technical report  which highlighted the methods used to train the model                        OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also posted a series of tweets  responding to Twitter users  prompts with Sora generated videos of the prompts 
In November       an API key for Sora access was leaked by a group of testers on Hugging Face  who posted a manifesto stating that they were protesting that Sora was used for  art washing   OpenAI revoked all access three hours after the leak was made public  and gave a statement that  hundreds of artists  have shaped the development  and that  participation is voluntary                                    
As of December          OpenAI has made Sora available to the public  for ChatGPT Pro and ChatGPT Plus users  Prior to this  the company had provided limited access to a small  red team   including experts in misinformation and bias  to perform adversarial testing on the model             The company also shared Sora with a small group of creative professionals  including video makers and artists  to seek feedback on its usefulness in creative fields              In February       OpenAI announced plans to integrate Sora into ChatGPT by letting users generate Sora videos from the chatbot             

Capabilities and limitations edit

The technology behind Sora is an adaptation of the technology behind DALL E    According to OpenAI  Sora is a diffusion transformer               a denoising latent diffusion model with one Transformer as the denoiser  A video is generated in latent space by denoising  D  patches   then transformed to standard space by a video decompressor  Re captioning is used to augment training data  by using a video to text model to create detailed captions on videos            
OpenAI trained the model using publicly available videos as well as copyrighted videos licensed for the purpose  but did not reveal the number or the exact source of the videos             Upon its release  OpenAI acknowledged some of Sora s shortcomings  including its struggling to simulate complex physics  to understand causality  and to differentiate left from right              One example shows a group of wolf pups seemingly multiplying and converging  creating a hard to follow scenario              OpenAI also stated that  in adherence to the company s existing safety practices  Sora will restrict text prompts for sexual  violent  hateful  or celebrity imagery  as well as content featuring pre existing intellectual property            
Tim Brooks  a researcher on Sora  stated that the model figured out how to create  D graphics from its dataset alone  while Bill Peebles  also a Sora researcher  said that the model automatically created different video angles without being prompted             According to OpenAI  Sora generated videos are tagged with C PA metadata to indicate that they were AI generated            

Reception edit 
Will Douglas Heaven of the MIT Technology Review called the demonstration videos  impressive   but noted that they must have been cherry picked and may not be representative of Sora s typical output              American academic Oren Etzioni expressed concerns over the technology s ability to create online disinformation for political campaigns             For Wired  Steven Levy similarly wrote that it had the potential to become  a misinformation train wreck  and opined that its preview clips were  impressive  but  not perfect  and that it  show ed  an emergent grasp of cinematic grammar  due to its unprompted shot changes  Levy added    i t will be a very long time  if ever  before text to video threatens actual filmmaking              Lisa Lacy of CNET called its example videos  remarkably realistic   except perhaps when a human face appears close up or when sea creatures are swimming             
Filmmaker Tyler Perry announced he would be putting a planned      million expansion of his Atlanta studio on hold  expressing concern about Sora s potential impact on the film industry
