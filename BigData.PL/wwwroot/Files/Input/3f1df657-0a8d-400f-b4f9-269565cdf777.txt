Formalism for expressing dynamical domains in first order logic
The fluent calculus is a formalism for expressing dynamical domains in first order logic  It is a variant of the situation calculus  the main difference is that situations are considered representations of states  A binary function symbol 
  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  circ  
  
 is used to concatenate the terms that represent facts that hold in a situation  For example  that the box is on the table in the situation 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
      displaystyle s 
  
 is represented by the formula 
  
    
      
          x     
        t
         
        s
         
        o
        n
         
        b
        o
        x
         
        t
        a
        b
        l
        e
         
          x     
        t
      
    
      displaystyle  exists t s on box table  circ t 
  
  The frame problem is solved by asserting that the situation after the execution of an action is identical to the one before but for the conditions changed by the action  For example  the action of moving the box from the table to the floor is formalized as 


  
    
      
        S
        t
        a
        t
        e
         
        D
        o
         
        m
        o
        v
        e
         
        b
        o
        x
         
        t
        a
        b
        l
        e
         
        f
        l
        o
        o
        r
         
         
        s
         
         
          x     
        o
        n
         
        b
        o
        x
         
        t
        a
        b
        l
        e
         
         
        S
        t
        a
        t
        e
         
        s
         
          x     
        o
        n
         
        b
        o
        x
         
        f
        l
        o
        o
        r
         
      
    
      displaystyle State Do move box table floor  s   circ on box table  State s  circ on box floor  
  

This formula states that the state after the move is added the term 
  
    
      
        o
        n
         
        b
        o
        x
         
        f
        l
        o
        o
        r
         
      
    
      displaystyle on box floor  
  
 and removed the term 
  
    
      
        o
        n
         
        b
        o
        x
         
        t
        a
        b
        l
        e
         
      
    
      displaystyle on box table  
  
  Axioms specifying that 
  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  circ  
  
 is commutative and non idempotent are necessary for such axioms to work
