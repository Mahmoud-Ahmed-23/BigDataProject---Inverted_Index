John Rogers Searle   s  rl         born July                      is an American philosopher widely noted for contributions to the philosophy of language  philosophy of mind  and social philosophy  He began teaching at UC Berkeley in      and was Willis S  and Marion Slusser Professor Emeritus of the Philosophy of Mind and Language and Professor of the Graduate School until June       when his status as professor emeritus was revoked because he was found to have violated the university s sexual harassment policies            
As an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin Madison  Searle was secretary of  Students against Joseph McCarthy   He received all his university degrees  BA  MA  and DPhil  from the University of Oxford  where he held his first faculty positions  Later  at UC Berkeley  he became the first tenured professor to join the           Free Speech Movement  In the late     s  Searle challenged the restrictions of Berkeley s      rent stabilization ordinance  Following what came to be known as the California Supreme Court s  Searle Decision  of       Berkeley changed its rent control policy  leading to large rent increases between      and      
In       Searle received the Jean Nicod Prize             in       the National Humanities Medal             and in       the Mind  amp  Brain Prize  In      he was elected to the American Philosophical Society             Searle s early work on speech acts  influenced by J  L  Austin and Ludwig Wittgenstein  helped establish his reputation  His notable concepts include the  Chinese room  argument against  strong  artificial intelligence 


Biography edit 
John Searle speaking at Google      
Searle s father  G W  Searle  an electrical engineer  was employed by AT amp T Corporation  his mother  Hester Beck Searle  was a physician            
Searle began his college education at the University of Wisconsin Madison  In his junior year  he became a Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford  where he obtained all his university degrees  BA  MA  and DPhil                       
Searle was the Willis S  and Marion Slusser Professor Emeritus of the Philosophy of Mind and Language and Professor of the Graduate School at the University of California  Berkeley  even though he retired in       he continued teaching until           citation needed      In June       the emeritus title was revoked            

Politics edit 
While an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin Madison  Searle became the secretary of  Students against Joseph McCarthy               McCarthy at that time served as the junior senator from Wisconsin  In       Searle began teaching at Berkeley  and he was the first tenured professor to join the         Free Speech Movement              In       while serving as chairman of the Academic Freedom Committee of the Academic Senate of the University of California              he supported the university in its dispute with students over the People s Park 
In The Campus War  A Sympathetic Look at the University in Agony                     Searle investigates the causes behind the campus protests of the era  In it he declares   I have been attacked by both the House Un American Activities Committee and   several radical polemicists    Stylistically  the attacks are interestingly similar  Both rely heavily on insinuation and innuendo  and both display a hatred   one might almost say terror   of close analysis and dissection of argument   He asserts that  My wife was threatened that I  and other members of the administration  would be assassinated or violently attacked              
In the late     s  Searle  along with other landlords  petitioned Berkeley s rental board to raise the limits on how much he could charge tenants under the city s      rent stabilization ordinance              The rental board refused to consider Searle s petition and Searle filed suit  charging a violation of due process  In       in what came to be known as the  Searle Decision   the California Supreme Court upheld Searle s argument in part and Berkeley changed its rent control policy  leading to large rent increases between      and       Searle was reported to see the issue as one of fundamental rights  being quoted as saying  The treatment of landlords in Berkeley is comparable to the treatment of blacks in the South    our rights have been massively violated and we are here to correct that injustice               The court described the debate as a  morass of political invective  ad hominem attack  and policy argument              
Shortly after the September    attacks  Searle wrote an article arguing that the attacks were a particular event in a long term struggle against forces that are intractably opposed to the United States  and signaled support for a more aggressive neoconservative interventionist foreign policy  He called for the realization that the United States is in a more or less permanent state of war with these forces  Moreover  a probable course of action would be to deny terrorists the use of foreign territory from which to stage their attacks  Finally  he alluded to the long term nature of the conflict and blamed the attacks on the lack of American resolve to deal forcefully with America s enemies over the past several decades             

Sexual assault allegations edit 
In March       Searle became the subject of sexual assault allegations  The Los Angeles Times reported   A new lawsuit alleges that university officials failed to properly respond to complaints that John Searle     sexually assaulted his     research associate last July and cut her pay when she rejected his advances                           The case brought to light several earlier complaints against Searle  on which Berkeley allegedly had failed to act                         
The lawsuit  filed in a California court on March           alleged sexual harassment  retaliation  wrongful termination and assault and battery and sought damages both from Searle and from the Regents of the University of California as his employers              It also claims that Jennifer Hudin  the director of the John Searle Center for Social Ontology  where the complainant had been employed as an assistant to Searle  has stated that Searle  has had sexual relationships with his students and others in the past in exchange for academic  monetary or other benefits               After news of the lawsuit became public  several previous allegations of sexual harassment and assault by Searle were also revealed             
On June           following campus disciplinary proceedings by Berkeley s Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination  OPHD   University of California President Janet Napolitano approved a recommendation that Searle have his emeritus status revoked  after a determination that he had violated university policies against sexual harassment and retaliation between July and September                 

Awards and recognitions edit 
Searle has five honorary doctorate degrees from four countries and is an honorary visiting professor at Tsing Hua University and at East China Normal University 
In       Searle received the Jean Nicod Prize             in       the National Humanities Medal             and in       the Mind  amp  Brain Prize 

Philosophical work edit 
Speech acts edit 
Searle s early work  which did much to establish his reputation  was on speech acts  He attempted to synthesize ideas from many colleagues   including J L  Austin  the  illocutionary act   from How To Do Things with Words   Ludwig Wittgenstein and G C J  Midgley  the distinction between regulative and constitutive rules    with his own thesis that such acts are constituted by the rules of language  He also drew on the work of Paul Grice  the analysis of meaning as an attempt at being understood   Hare and Stenius  the distinction  concerning meaning  between illocutionary force and propositional content   P F  Strawson  John Rawls and William Alston  who maintained that sentence meaning consists in sets of regulative rules requiring the speaker to perform the illocutionary act indicated by the sentence and that such acts involve the utterance of a sentence which  a  indicates that one performs the act   b  means what one says  and  c  addresses an audience in the vicinity 
In his      book Speech Acts  Searle sets out to combine all these elements to give his account of illocutionary acts  There he provides an analysis of what he considers the prototypical illocutionary act of promising and offers sets of semantical rules intended to represent the linguistic meaning of devices indicating further illocutionary act types  Among concepts presented in the book is the distinction between the  illocutionary force  and the  propositional content  of an utterance  Searle does not precisely define the former as such  but rather introduces several possible illocutionary forces by example  According to Searle  the sentences   

Sam smokes habitually 
Does Sam smoke habitually 
Sam  smoke habitually 
Would that Sam smoked habitually 
    each indicate the same propositional content  Sam smoking habitually  but differ in the illocutionary force indicated  respectively  a statement  a question  a command and an expression of desire              
According to a later account  which Searle presents in Intentionality        and which differs in important ways from the one suggested in Speech Acts  illocutionary acts are characterised by having  conditions of satisfaction   an idea adopted from Strawson s      paper  Meaning and Truth   and a  direction of fit   an idea adopted from Austin and Elizabeth Anscombe  For example  the statement  John bought two candy bars  is satisfied if and only if it is true  i e   John did buy two candy bars  By contrast  the command  John  buy two candy bars   is satisfied if and only if John carries out the action of purchasing two candy bars  Searle refers to the first as having the  word to world  direction of fit  since the words are supposed to change to accurately represent the world  and the second as having the  world to word  direction of fit  since the world is supposed to change to match the words  There is also the double direction of fit  in which the relationship goes both ways  and the null or zero direction of fit  in which it goes neither way because the propositional content is presupposed  as in  I am sorry I ate John s candy bars  
In Foundations of Illocutionary Logic                    with Daniel Vanderveken   Searle prominently uses the notion of the  illocutionary point              
Searle s speech act theory has been challenged by several thinkers in various ways  Collections of articles referring to Searle s account are found in Burkhardt                  and Lepore   van Gulick                  

Intentionality and the background edit 
In Intentionality  An Essay in the Philosophy of Mind         Searle applies the principles of his account s  of illocutionary acts to the investigation of intentionality  which is central to Searle s  Philosophy of Mind    Searle is at pains to emphasize that  intentionality   the capacity of mental states to be about worldly objects  is not to be confused with  intensionality   the referential opacity of contexts that fail tests for  extensionality               
For Searle  intentionality is exclusively mental  being the power of minds to represent or symbolize over  things  properties and states of affairs in the external world              Causal covariance  about ness and the like are not enough  maps  for instance  only have a  derived  intentionality  a mere after image of the real thing 
Searle also introduces a technical term the Background              which  according to him  has been the source of much philosophical discussion   though I have been arguing for this thesis for almost twenty years   Searle writes               many people whose opinions I respect still disagree with me about it    He calls Background the set of abilities  capacities  tendencies  and dispositions that humans have that are not themselves intentional states but that generate appropriate such states on demand 
Thus  when someone is asked to  cut the cake   they know to use a knife and when someone is asked to  cut the grass   they know to use a lawnmower  and not vice versa   even though the request did not mention this  Beginning with the possibility of reversing these two  an endless series of sceptical  anti real or science fiction interpretations could be imagined   I wish to say that there is a radical underdetermination of what is said by the literal meaning     emphasizes Searle              The Background fills the gap  being the capacity always to have a suitable interpretation to hand   I just take a huge metaphysics for granted   he says              Searle sometimes supplements his reference to the Background with the concept of the Network  one s network of other beliefs  desires  and other intentional states necessary for any particular intentional state to make sense 
To give an example  two chess players might be engaged in a bitter struggle at the board  but they share all sorts of Background presuppositions  that they will take turns to move  that no one else will intervene  that they are both playing to the same rules  that the fire alarm will not go off  that the board will not suddenly disintegrate  that their opponent will not magically turn into a grapefruit  and so on indefinitely  As most of these possibilities will not have occurred to either player  Searle thinks the Background is itself unconscious as well as nonintentional              To have a Background is to have a set of brain structures that generate appropriate intentional states  if the fire alarm does go off  say    Those brain structures enable me to activate the system of intentionality and to make it function  but the capacities realized in the brain structures do not themselves consist in intentional states              
It seems to Searle that Hume and Nietzsche were probably the first philosophers to appreciate  respectively  the centrality and radical contingency of the Background   Nietzsche saw  with anxiety  that the Background does not have to be the way it is               Searle also thinks that a Background appears in the ideas of other modern thinkers  as the river bed substratum of Wittgenstein s On Certainty               the work of the later Wittgenstein is in large part about the Background  especially On Certainty               and Pierre Bourdieu s habitus 
In his debate with Jacques Derrida  Searle argued against Derrida s purported view that a statement can be disjoined from the original intentionality of its author  for example when no longer connected to the original author  while still being able to produce meaning  Searle maintained that even if one was to see a written statement with no knowledge of authorship it would still be impossible to escape the question of intentionality  because  a meaningful sentence is just a standing possibility of the  intentional  speech act   For Searle  ascribing intentionality to a statement was a basic requirement for attributing it any meaning at all                         
In      Pierre Jacob described Searle s view as  anti intentionalist              

Consciousness edit 
Building upon his views about intentionality  Searle presents a view concerning consciousness in his book The Rediscovery of the Mind         He argues that  starting with behaviorism  an early but influential scientific view  succeeded by many later accounts that Searle also dismisses  much of modern philosophy has tried to deny the existence of consciousness  with little success  In Intentionality  he parodies several alternative theories of consciousness by replacing their accounts of intentionality with comparable accounts of the hand 

No one would think of saying  for example   Having a hand is just being disposed to certain sorts of behavior such as grasping   manual behaviorism   or  Hands can be defined entirely in terms of their causes and effects   manual functionalism   or  For a system to have a hand is just for it to be in a certain computer state with the right sorts of inputs and outputs   manual Turing machine functionalism   or  Saying that a system has hands is just adopting a certain stance toward it   the manual stance   p       
Searle argues that philosophy has been trapped by a false dichotomy  that  on one hand  the world consists of nothing but objective particles in fields of force  but that yet  on the other hand  consciousness is clearly a subjective first person experience 
Searle says simply that both are true  consciousness is a real subjective experience  caused by the physical processes of the brain   A view which he suggests might be called biological naturalism  

Ontological subjectivity edit 
Searle has argued             that critics like Daniel Dennett              who he claims insist that discussing subjectivity is unscientific because science presupposes objectivity  are making a category error  Perhaps the goal of science is to establish and validate statements which are epistemically objective  i e   whose truth can be discovered and evaluated by any interested party  but are not necessarily ontologically objective 
Searle calls any value judgment epistemically subjective  Thus   McKinley is prettier than Everest  is  epistemically subjective   whereas  McKinley is higher than Everest  is  epistemically objective   In other words  the latter statement is evaluable  in fact  falsifiable  by an understood   background   criterion for mountain height  like  the summit is so many meters above sea level   No such criteria exist for prettiness 
Beyond this distinction  Searle thinks there are certain phenomena  including all conscious experiences  that are ontologically subjective  i e   can only exist as subjective experience  For example  although it might be subjective or objective in the epistemic sense  a doctor s note that a patient suffers from back pain is an epistemically objective claim  it counts as a medical diagnosis only because the existence of back pain is  an objective fact of medical science               The pain itself  however  is ontologically subjective  it is only experienced by the person having it 
Searle goes on to affirm that  where consciousness is concerned  the existence of the appearance is the reality               His view that the epistemic and ontological senses of objective subjective are cleanly separable is crucial to his self proclaimed biological naturalism  because it allows epistemically objective judgments like  That object is a pocket calculator  to pick out agent relative features of objects  and such features are  on his terms  ontologically subjective  unlike  say   That object is made mostly of plastic  

Artificial intelligence edit 
See also  Chinese room and philosophy of artificial intelligence
Biological naturalism implies that if humans want to create a conscious being  they will have to duplicate whatever physical processes the brain goes through to cause consciousness  Searle thereby means to contradict what he calls  Strong AI   defined by the assumption that  the appropriately programmed computer really is a mind  in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states              
In       Searle presented the  Chinese room  argument  which purports to prove the falsity of strong AI              A person is in a room with two slits  and they have a book and some scratch paper  This person does not know any Chinese  Someone outside the room slides some Chinese characters in through the first slit  the person in the room follows the instructions in the book  transcribing the characters as instructed onto the scratch paper  and slides the resulting sheet out by the second slit  To people outside the room  it appears that the room speaks Chinese   they have slid Chinese statements into one slit and got valid responses in English   yet the  room  does not understand a word of Chinese  This suggests  according to Searle  that no computer can ever understand Chinese or English  because  as the thought experiment suggests  being able to  translate  Chinese into English does not entail  understanding  either Chinese or English  all that the person in the thought experiment  and hence a computer  is able to do is to execute certain syntactic manipulations                          Douglas Hofstadter and Daniel Dennett in their book The Mind s I criticize Searle s view of AI  particularly the Chinese room argument             
Stevan Harnad argues that Searle s  Strong AI  is really just another name for functionalism and computationalism  and that these positions are the real targets of his critique              Functionalists argue that consciousness can be defined as a set of informational processes inside the brain  It follows that anything that carries out the same informational processes as a human is also conscious  Thus  if humans wrote a computer program that was conscious  they could run that computer program on  say  a system of ping pong balls and beer cups and the system would be equally conscious  because it was running the same information processes 
Searle argues that this is impossible  contending that consciousness is a physical property  like digestion or fire  No matter how good a simulation of digestion is built on the computer  it will not digest anything  no matter how well it simulates fire  nothing will get burnt  By contrast  informational processes are observer relative  observers pick out certain patterns in the world and consider them information processes  but information processes are not things in the world themselves  Since they do not exist at a physical level  Searle argues  they cannot have causal efficacy and thus cannot cause consciousness  There is no physical law  Searle insists  that can see the equivalence between a personal computer  a series of ping pong balls and beer cans  and a pipe and water system all implementing the same program             

Social reality edit 
Searle extended his inquiries into observer relative phenomena by trying to understand social reality  Searle begins by arguing collective intentionality  e g    we are going for a walk   is a distinct form of intentionality  not simply reducible to individual intentionality  e g    I am going for a walk with him and I think he thinks he is going for a walk with me and he thinks I think I am going for a walk with him and     
In The Construction of Social Reality         Searle addresses the mystery of how social constructs like  baseball  or  money  can exist in a world consisting only of physical particles in fields of force  Adapting an idea by Elizabeth Anscombe in  On Brute Facts   Searle distinguishes between brute facts  like the height of a mountain  and institutional facts  like the score of a baseball game  Aiming at an explanation of social phenomena in terms of Anscombe s notion  he argues that society can be explained in terms of institutional facts  and institutional facts arise out of collective intentionality through constitutive rules with the logical form  X counts as Y in C   Thus  for instance  filling out a ballot counts as a vote in a polling place  getting so many votes counts as a victory in an election  getting a victory counts as being elected president in the presidential race  etc 
Many sociologists  however  do not see Searle s contributions to social theory as very significant  Neil Gross  for example  argues that Searle s views on society are more or less a reconstitution of the sociologist  mile Durkheim s theories of social facts  social institutions  collective representations  and the like  Searle s ideas are thus open to the same criticisms as Durkheim s              Searle responded that Durkheim s work was worse than he had originally believed and  admitting he had not read much of Durkheim s work  said   Because Durkheim s account seemed so impoverished I did not read any further in his work               Steven Lukes  however  responded to Searle s response to Gross and argued point by point against the allegations that Searle makes against Durkheim  essentially upholding Gross s argument that Searle s work bears a great resemblance to Durkheim s  Lukes attributes Searle s miscomprehension of Durkheim s work to the fact that Searle had never read Durkheim             

Searle Lawson debate edit 
Further information  Social ontology
In recent years  Searle s main interlocutor on issues of social ontology has been Tony Lawson  Although their accounts of social reality are similar  there are important differences  Lawson emphasizes the notion of social totality whereas Searle prefers to refer to institutional facts  Furthermore  Searle believes that emergence implies causal reduction whereas Lawson argues that social totalities cannot be completely explained by the causal powers of their components  Searle also places language at the foundation of the construction of social reality  while Lawson believes that community formation necessarily precedes the development of language and  therefore  there must be the possibility for non linguistic social structure formation                                      The debate is ongoing and takes place additionally through regular meetings of the Centre for Social Ontology at the University of California  Berkeley and the Cambridge Social Ontology Group at the University of Cambridge             

Rationality edit 
In Rationality in Action         Searle argues that standard notions of rationality are badly flawed  According to what he calls the Classical Model  rationality is seen as something like a train track  a person moves onto it at one point with their beliefs and desires  and then the rules of rationality compel them all the way to a conclusion  Searle doubts that this picture of rationality holds generally 
Searle briefly critiques one particular set of these rules  those of mathematical decision theory  He points out that its axioms require that anyone who valued a quarter and their life would  at some odds  bet their life for a quarter  Searle insists he would never take such a bet and believes that this stance is perfectly rational 
Most of his attack is directed against the common conception of rationality  which he believes is badly flawed  First  he argues that reason does not cause an individual to do anything  because having sufficient reason wills  but does not force  them to do that thing  Therefore  in any decision situation  people experience a gap between reasons and actions  For example  when a person decides to vote  they may determine that they care most about economic policy and that they prefer candidate Jones s economic policy  but they must also make an effort to actually cast a vote  Similarly  every time a smoker who feels guilty about their action lights a cigarette  they are aware that they are succumbing to their craving  and not merely acting automatically as they do when they exhale  This gap makes people think they have freedom of the will  Searle thinks that whether one really has free will or not is an open question  but considers its absence highly unappealing because it makes the feeling of freedom of will an epiphenomenon  which is highly unlikely from the evolutionary point of view given its biological cost  He also says   All rational activity presupposes free will              

Further information  Fact value distinction
Second  Searle believes that people can rationally do things that do not result from their own desires  It is widely believed that one cannot derive an  ought  from an  is   i e   that facts about how the world is can never tell a person what they should do  Hume s Law   By contrast  insofar as a fact is understood to relate to an institution  marriage  promises  commitments  etc    which is to be understood as a system of constitutive rules  then what one should do can be understood as following from the institutional fact of what one has done  institutional fact  then  can be understood as opposed to the  brute facts  related to Hume s Law  For example  Searle believes that the promise of doing something means that one must do it  because by making the promise one participates in the constitutive rules that arrange the system of promise making itself  a  shouldness  is implicit in the mere factual action of promising  Furthermore  he believes that this provides a desire independent reason for an action   if one orders a drink at a bar  there is an obligation to pay for it even if one has no desire to do so  This argument  which he first made in his paper   How to Derive  Ought  from  Is                       remains highly controversial  but Searle maintained that  the traditional metaphysical distinction between fact and value cannot be captured by the linguistic distinction between  evaluative  and  descriptive  because all such speech act notions are already normative              
Third  Searle argues that much of rational deliberation involves adjusting patterns of desires  which are often inconsistent  to decide between outcomes  not the other way around  While in the Classical Model one would start from viewing a desire to go to Paris as a greater factor than saving money  which would lead to calculating the cheapest way to get there  Searle would argue that people balance the desire of Paris against the desire to save money to determine which one they value more  Hence  he believes that rationality is not a system of rules  but more of an adverb  Certain behaviors are seen as rational  no matter what their source  and a system of rules derives from finding patterns in what is considered rational 

Searle Derrida debate edit 
Main article  Searle Derrida debate
After Jacques Derrida  in his      paper  Signature Event Context   responded to J  L  Austin s theory of the illocutionary act  Searle argued  in his      essay  Reiterating the Differences  A Reply to Derrida   that Derrida s apparent rejection of Austin was unwarranted  Searle later refused to let his      reply be printed along with Derrida s papers in the      collection Limited Inc   in which a new text by Derrida attacked Searle s positions on the topic  In the     s  Searle elaborated on why he did not consider Derrida s approach to be legitimate philosophy
