English is a West Germanic language that originated in early medieval England and has since evolved into a global lingua franca                                    The namesake of the language is the Angles  one of the Germanic peoples that migrated to Britain after its Roman occupiers left  English is the most spoken language in the world  primarily due to the global influences of the former British Empire  succeeded by the Commonwealth of Nations  and the United States             English is the third most spoken native language  after Mandarin Chinese and Spanish             it is also the most widely learned second language in the world  with more second language speakers than native speakers 
English is either the official language or one of the official languages in    sovereign states  such as India  Ireland  and Canada   In the United Kingdom  the United States  Australia  and New Zealand  it is the dominant language for historical reasons without being explicitly defined by law             It is a co official language of the United Nations  the European Union  and many other international and regional organisations  It has also become the de facto lingua franca of diplomacy  science  technology  international trade  logistics  tourism  aviation  entertainment  and the Internet              English accounts for at least     of total native speakers of the Germanic languages  and Ethnologue estimated that there were over          billion speakers worldwide as of          update                 
Old English emerged from a group of West Germanic dialects spoken by the Anglo Saxons  Late Old English borrowed some grammar and core vocabulary from Old Norse  a North Germanic language                                      Then  Middle English borrowed vocabulary extensively from French dialects  which are the source of approximately     of Modern English words  and from Latin  which is the source of an additional                  While Latin and the Romance languages are thus the source for a majority of its lexicon taken as a whole  English grammar and phonology retain a family resemblance with the Germanic languages  and most of its basic everyday vocabulary remains Germanic in origin  English exists on a dialect continuum with Scots  it is next most closely related to Low Saxon and Frisian 


Classification
English is an Indo European language and belongs to the West Germanic group of the Germanic languages              Old English originated from a Germanic tribal and linguistic continuum along the Frisian North Sea coast  whose languages gradually evolved into the Anglic languages in the British Isles  and into the Frisian languages and Low German Low Saxon on the continent              Traditionally  the Frisian languages were thought to be closer to English than other languages in the West Germanic family  but most modern scholars no longer consider this to be a valid characterisation of the relationship              Although both of these languages shared certain sound changes that did not affect other closely related languages around the North Sea at the time  these sound changes were not simultaneous and thus do not reflect a unique phylogenetic relationship                          Instead  it is likely that the three Ingvaeonic languages English  Frisian  and Low German share one common ancestor which acted as a dialect continuum along the North Sea coast  later splitting off into the three languages during the Migration Period  around the  th century              Old English evolved into Middle English  which in turn evolved into Modern English              Particular dialects of Old and Middle English also developed into a number of other Anglic languages  including Scots             and the extinct Fingallian and Yola dialects of Ireland             
Like Icelandic and Faroese  the development of English in the British Isles isolated it from the continental Germanic languages and their influences  and it has since diverged considerably  English is not mutually intelligible with any continental Germanic language  as it differs in vocabulary  syntax  and phonology  However  some of these  such as Dutch and Frisian  do show strong affinities with English  especially with its earlier stages                  page      needed     
Because of a long series of foreign invasions of the British Isles  English was influenced by various languages  especially Old Norse and French dialects  in contrast to Icelandic and Faroese  which remained isolated  These left a profound mark of their own on the language  so that English shows some similarities in vocabulary and grammar with many languages outside its linguistic clades but it is not mutually intelligible with any of those languages either  Some scholars have argued that English can be considered a mixed language or a creole a theory called the Middle English creole hypothesis  Although the great influence of these languages on the vocabulary and grammar of Modern English is widely acknowledged  most specialists in language contact do not consider English to be a true mixed language                         
English is classified as a Germanic language because it shares innovations with other Germanic languages including Dutch  German  and Swedish              These shared innovations show that the languages have descended from a single common ancestor called Proto Germanic  Some shared features of Germanic languages include the division of verbs into strong and weak classes  the use of modal verbs  and the sound changes affecting Proto Indo European consonants  known as Grimm s and Verner s laws  English is classified as an Anglo Frisian language because Frisian and English share other features  such as the palatalisation of consonants that were velar consonants in Proto Germanic  see Phonological history of Old English        Palatalization

The earliest varieties of an English language  collectively known as Old English or  Anglo Saxon   evolved from a group of North Sea Germanic dialects brought to Britain in the  th century  Old English dialects were later influenced by Old Norse speaking Viking invaders and settlers  starting in the  th and  th centuries  Middle English began in the late   th century after the Norman Conquest of England  when a considerable amount of Old French vocabulary was incorporated into English over some three centuries                         
Early Modern English began in the late   th century with the start of the Great Vowel Shift and the Renaissance trend of borrowing further Latin and Greek words and roots  concurrent with the introduction of the printing press to London  This era notably culminated in the King James Bible and the works of William Shakespeare                          The printing press greatly standardised English spelling              which has remained largely unchanged since then  despite a wide variety of later sound shifts in English dialects 
Modern English has spread around the world since the   th century as a consequence of the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States  Through all types of printed and electronic media in these countries  English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science  navigation  and law             Its modern grammar is the result of a gradual change from a dependent marking pattern typical of Indo European with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection and a fairly fixed subject verb object word order              Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses  aspects and moods  as well as passive constructions  interrogatives  and some negation

The opening of Beowulf  an Old English epic poem handwritten in half uncial script between     and       H  t    G rde na ing ar dagum   od cyninga    rym ge frunon      Listen  We of the Spear Danes from days of yore have heard of the glory of the folk kings     
The earliest form of English is called Old English or Anglo Saxon  c                   Old English developed from a set of West Germanic dialects  often grouped as Anglo Frisian or North Sea Germanic  and originally spoken along the coasts of Frisia  Lower Saxony and southern Jutland by Germanic peoples known to the historical record as the Angles  Saxons  and Jutes              From the  th century  the Anglo Saxons settled Britain as the Roman economy and administration collapsed  By the  th century  this Germanic language of the Anglo Saxons became dominant in Britain  replacing the languages of Roman Britain           Common Brittonic  a Celtic language  and British Latin  brought to Britain by the Roman occupation                                      At this time  these dialects generally resisted influence from the then local Brittonic and Latin languages  England and English  originally  nglaland and  nglisc  are both named after the Angles              English may have a small amount of substrate influence from Common Brittonic  and a number of possible Brittonicisms in English have been proposed  but whether most of these supposed Brittonicisms are actually a direct result of Brittonic substrate influence is disputed 
Old English was divided into four dialects  the Anglian dialects  Mercian and Northumbrian  and the Saxon dialects  Kentish and West Saxon               Through the educational reforms of King Alfred in the  th century and the influence of the kingdom of Wessex  the West Saxon dialect became the standard written variety              The epic poem Beowulf is written in West Saxon  and the earliest English poem  C dmon s Hymn  is written in Northumbrian              Modern English developed mainly from Mercian  but the Scots language developed from Northumbrian  A few short inscriptions from the early period of Old English were written using a runic script              By the  th century  a Latin alphabet was adopted  written with half uncial letterforms  It included the runic letters wynn   x  e     x  e   and thorn   x  e     x  e    and the modified Latin letters eth   x  e     x  e    and ash   x  e     x  e                           
Old English is essentially a distinct language from Modern English and is virtually impossible for   st century unstudied English speakers to understand  Its grammar was similar to that of modern German  nouns  adjectives  pronouns  and verbs had many more inflectional endings and forms  and word order was much freer than in Modern English  Modern English has case forms in pronouns  he  him  his  and has a few verb inflections  speak  speaks  speaking  spoke  spoken   but Old English had case endings in nouns as well  and verbs had more person and number endings                                      Its closest relative is Old Frisian  but even some centuries after the Anglo Saxon migration  Old English retained considerable mutual intelligibility with other Germanic varieties  Even in the  th and   th centuries  amidst the Danelaw and other Viking invasions  there is historical evidence that Old Norse and Old English retained considerable mutual intelligibility              although probably the northern dialects of Old English were more similar to Old Norse than the southern dialects  Theoretically  as late as the    s      AD  a commoner from certain  northern  parts of England could hold a conversation with a commoner from certain parts of Scandinavia  Research continues into the details of the myriad tribes in peoples in England and Scandinavia and the mutual contacts between them             
The translation of Matthew      from      shows examples of case endings  nominative plural  accusative plural  genitive singular  and a verb ending  present plural

Influence of Old Norse
From the  th to the   th centuries  Old English gradually transformed through language contact with Old Norse in some regions  The waves of Norse  Viking  colonisation of northern parts of the British Isles in the  th and  th centuries put Old English into intense contact with Old Norse  a North Germanic language  Norse influence was strongest in the north eastern varieties of Old English spoken in the Danelaw area around York  which was the centre of Norse colonisation  today these features are still particularly present in Scots and Northern English  The centre of Norsified English was in the Midlands around Lindsey  After          CE  when Lindsey was incorporated into the Anglo Saxon polity  English spread extensively throughout the region 
An element of Norse influence that continues in all English varieties today is the third person pronoun group beginning with th   they  them  their  which replaced the Anglo Saxon pronouns with h   hie  him  hera               Other core Norse loanwords include  give    get    sky    skirt    egg   and  cake   typically displacing a native Anglo Saxon equivalent  Old Norse in this era retained considerable mutual intelligibility with some dialects of Old English  particularly northern ones

Middle English is often arbitrarily defined as beginning with the conquest of England by William the Conqueror in       but it developed further in the period from      to                  
With the Norman conquest of England in       the now Norsified Old English language was subject to another wave of intense contact  this time with Old French  in particular Old Norman French  influencing it as a superstrate  The Norman French spoken by the elite in England eventually developed into the Anglo Norman language              Because Norman was spoken primarily by the elites and nobles  while the lower classes continued speaking English  the main influence of Norman was the introduction of a wide range of loanwords related to politics  legislation and prestigious social domains                  example needed      Middle English also greatly simplified the inflectional system  probably in order to reconcile Old Norse and Old English  which were inflectionally different but morphologically similar  The distinction between nominative and accusative cases was lost except in personal pronouns  the instrumental case was dropped  and the use of the genitive case was limited to indicating possession  The inflectional system regularised many irregular inflectional forms              and gradually simplified the system of agreement  making word order less flexible             
The transition from Old to Middle English can be placed during the writing of the Ormulum              The oldest Middle English texts were written by the Augustinian canon Orrm  and highlight the blending of both Old English and Anglo Norman elements in English for the first time 
In Wycliff e Bible of the     s  the verse Matthew      was written  Foxis han dennes  and briddis of heuene han nestis              Here the plural suffix  n on the verb have is still retained  but none of the case endings on the nouns are present  By the   th century Middle English was fully developed  integrating both Norse and French features  it continued to be spoken until the transition to early Modern English around       Middle English literature includes Geoffrey Chaucer s The Canterbury Tales  and Thomas Malory s Le Morte d Arthur  In the Middle English period  the use of regional dialects in writing proliferated  and dialect traits were even used for effect by authors such as Chaucer             

Early Modern English

Graphic representation of the Great Vowel Shift showing how the pronunciation of the long vowels gradually shifted with the high vowels i  and u  breaking into diphthongs and the lower vowels each shifting their pronunciation up one level
The next period in the history of English was Early Modern English              Early Modern English was characterised by the Great Vowel Shift              inflectional simplification  and linguistic standardisation 
The Great Vowel Shift affected the stressed long vowels of Middle English  It was a chain shift  meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent shift in the vowel system  Mid and open vowels were raised  and close vowels were broken into diphthongs  For example  the word bite was originally pronounced as the word beet is today  and the second vowel in the word about was pronounced as the word boot is today  The Great Vowel Shift explains many irregularities in spelling since English retains many spellings from Middle English  and it also explains why English vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages                         
English began to rise in prestige  relative to Norman French  during the reign of Henry V  Around       the Court of Chancery in Westminster began using English in its official documents  and a new standard form of Middle English  known as Chancery Standard  developed from the dialects of London and the East Midlands  In       William Caxton introduced the printing press to England and began publishing the first printed books in London  expanding the influence of this form of English              Literature from the Early Modern period includes the works of William Shakespeare and the translation of the Bible commissioned by King James I  Even after the vowel shift the language still sounded different from Modern English  for example  the consonant clusters  kn  n sw  in knight  gnat  and sword were still pronounced  Many of the grammatical features that a modern reader of Shakespeare might find quaint or archaic represent the distinct characteristics of Early Modern English             
In the      King James Version of the Bible  written in Early Modern English  Matthew      says   The Foxes haue holes and the birds of the ayre haue nests               This exemplifies the loss of case and its effects on sentence structure  replacement with subject verb object word order  and the use of of instead of the non possessive genitive   and the introduction of loanwords from French  ayre  and word replacements  bird originally meaning  nestling  had replaced OE fugol              

Spread of Modern English
By the late   th century  the British Empire had spread English through its colonies and geopolitical dominance  Commerce  science and technology  diplomacy  art  and formal education all contributed to English becoming the first truly global language  English also facilitated worldwide international communication                         English was adopted in parts of North America  parts of Africa  Oceania  and many other regions  When they obtained political independence  some of the newly independent states that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political and other difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others                                      In the   th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the United States and its status as a superpower following the Second World War has  along with worldwide broadcasting in English by the BBC             and other broadcasters  caused the language to spread across the planet much faster                          In the   st century  English is more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been             
As Modern English developed  explicit norms for standard usage were published  and spread through official media such as public education and state sponsored publications  In       Samuel Johnson published his A Dictionary of the English Language  which introduced standard spellings of words and usage norms  In       Noah Webster published the American Dictionary of the English language to try to establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent of the British standard  Within Britain  non standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised  leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes             
In modern English  the loss of grammatical case is almost complete  it is now only found in pronouns  such as he and him  she and her  who and whom   and SVO word order is mostly fixed              Some changes  such as the use of do support  have become universalised   Earlier English did not use the word do as a general auxiliary as Modern English does  at first it was only used in question constructions  and even then was not obligatory              Now  do support with the verb have is becoming increasingly standardised   The use of progressive forms in  ing  appears to be spreading to new constructions  and forms such as had been being built are becoming more common  Regularisation of irregular forms also slowly continues  e g  dreamed instead of dreamt   and analytical alternatives to inflectional forms are becoming more common  e g  more polite instead of politer   British English is also undergoing change under the influence of American English  fuelled by the strong presence of American English in the media and the prestige associated with the United States as a world power

The countries where English is spoken can be grouped into different categories according to how English is used in each country  The  inner circle              countries with many native speakers of English share an international standard of written English and jointly influence speech norms for English around the world  English does not belong to just one country  and it does not belong solely to descendants of English settlers  English is an official language of countries populated by few descendants of native speakers of English  It has also become by far the most important language of international communication when people who share no native language meet anywhere in the world 

Three circles of English speaking countries

Braj Kachru s Three Circles of English
The Indian linguist Braj Kachru distinguished countries where English is spoken with a three circles model             

 Inner circle  countries have large communities of native speakers of English 
 Outer circle  countries have small communities of native speakers of English but widespread use of English as a second language in education or broadcasting or for local official purposes  and
 Expanding circle  countries are countries where many people learn English as a foreign language 
Kachru based his model on the history of how English spread in different countries  how users acquire English  and the range of uses English has in each country  The three circles change membership over time             
Countries with large communities of native speakers of English  the inner circle  include Britain  the United States  Australia  Canada  Ireland  and New Zealand  where the majority speaks English  and South Africa  where a significant minority speaks English  The countries with the most native English speakers are  in descending order  the United States  at least          million               the United Kingdom          million                                       Canada          million               Australia  at least         million               South Africa           million               Ireland           million   and New Zealand           million               In these countries  children of native speakers learn English from their parents  and local people who speak other languages and new immigrants learn English to communicate in their neighbourhoods and workplaces              The inner circle countries provide the base from which English spreads to other countries in the world             
Estimates of the numbers of second language and foreign language English speakers vary greatly from          million to more than        billion  depending on how proficiency is defined             Linguist David Crystal estimates that non native speakers now outnumber native speakers by a ratio of   to                In Kachru s three circles model  the  outer circle  countries are countries such as the Philippines              Jamaica              India  Pakistan  Singapore              Malaysia and Nigeria                         with a much smaller proportion of native speakers of English but much use of English as a second language for education  government  or domestic business  and its routine use for school instruction and official interactions with the government             
Those countries have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from an English based creole to a more standard version of English  They have many more speakers of English who acquire English as they grow up through day to day use and listening to broadcasting  especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction  Varieties of English learned by non native speakers born to English speaking parents may be influenced  especially in their grammar  by the other languages spoken by those learners              Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native speakers of English in the inner circle countries              and they may show grammatical and phonological differences from inner circle varieties as well  The standard English of the inner circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of English in the outer circle countries             
In the three circles model  countries such as Poland  China  Brazil  Germany  Japan  Indonesia  Egypt  and other countries where English is taught as a foreign language  make up the  expanding circle               The distinctions between English as a first language  as a second language  and as a foreign language are often debatable and may change in particular countries over time              For example  in the Netherlands and some other countries of Europe  knowledge of English as a second language is nearly universal  with over    percent of the population able to use it              and thus English is routinely used to communicate with foreigners and often in higher education  In these countries  although English is not used for government business  its widespread use puts them at the boundary between the  outer circle  and  expanding circle   English is unusual among world languages in how many of its users are not native speakers but speakers of English as a second or foreign language             
Many users of English in the expanding circle use it to communicate with other people from the expanding circle  so that interaction with native speakers of English plays no part in their decision to use the language              Non native varieties of English are widely used for international communication  and speakers of one such variety often encounter features of other varieties              Very often today a conversation in English anywhere in the world may include no native speakers of English at all  even while including speakers from several different countries  This is particularly true of the shared vocabulary of mathematics and the sciences             

Pluricentric English
English is a pluricentric language  which means that no one national authority sets the standard for use of the language                                                      Spoken English  including English used in broadcasting  generally follows national pronunciation standards that are established by custom rather than by regulation  International broadcasters are usually identifiable as coming from one country rather than another through their accents               but newsreader scripts are also composed largely in international standard written English  The norms of standard written English are maintained purely by the consensus of educated English speakers around the world  without any oversight by any government or international organisation              
American listeners readily understand most British broadcasting  and British listeners readily understand most American broadcasting  Most English speakers around the world can understand radio programmes  television programmes  and films from many parts of the English speaking world               Both standard and non standard varieties of English can include both formal or informal styles  distinguished by word choice and syntax and use both technical and non technical registers              
The settlement history of the English speaking inner circle countries outside Britain helped level dialect distinctions and produce koineised forms of English in South Africa  Australia  and New Zealand               The majority of immigrants to the United States without British ancestry rapidly adopted English after arrival  Now the majority of the United States population are monolingual English speakers                          

Australia has no official languages at the federal or state level              
In Canada  English and French share an official status at the federal level                            English has official or co official status in six provinces and three territories  while three provinces have none and Quebec s only official language is French              
English is the official second language of Ireland  while Irish is the first              
While New Zealand is majority English speaking  its two official languages are M ori              and New Zealand Sign Language              
The United Kingdom does not have an official language  In Wales and Northern Ireland  English is co official alongside Welsh              and Irish              respectively  Neither Scotland nor England have an official language 
In the United States  English was designated the official language of the country by Executive Order       in                    English has additional official or co official status at the state level in    states  as well as all five territories               Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have no official language

English has ceased to be an  English language  in the sense of belonging only to people who are ethnically English                            Use of English is growing country by country internally and for international communication  Most people learn English for practical rather than ideological reasons               Many speakers of English in Africa have become part of an  Afro Saxon  language community that unites Africans from different countries              
As decolonisation proceeded throughout the British Empire in the     s and     s  former colonies often did not reject English but rather continued to use it as independent countries setting their own language policies                                       For example  the view of the English language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress  and English continues to be an official language of India               English is also widely used in media and literature  and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK               However  English is rarely spoken as a first language  numbering only around a couple hundred thousand people  and less than    of the population speak fluent English in India                            David Crystal claimed in      that  combining native and non native speakers  India now has more people who speak or understand English than any other country in the world               but the number of English speakers in India is uncertain  with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India              
Modern English  sometimes described as the first global lingua franca                           is also regarded as the first world language                            English is the world s most widely used language in newspaper publishing  book publishing  international telecommunications  scientific publishing  international trade  mass entertainment  and diplomacy               English is  by international treaty  the basis for the required controlled natural languages              Seaspeak and Airspeak  used as international languages of seafaring              and aviation               English used to have parity with French and German in scientific research  but now it dominates that field               It achieved parity with French as a language of diplomacy at the Treaty of Versailles negotiations in                    By the time of the foundation of the United Nations at the end of World War II  English had become pre eminent              and is now the main worldwide language of diplomacy and international relations               It is one of six official languages of the United Nations               Many other worldwide international organisations  including the International Olympic Committee  specify English as a working language or official language of the organisation 
Many regional international organisations such as the European Free Trade Association  Association of Southeast Asian Nations  ASEAN               and Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation  APEC  set English as their organisation s sole working language even though most members are not countries with a majority of native English speakers  While the European Union  EU  allows member states to designate any of the national languages as an official language of the Union  in practice English is the main working language of EU organisations              
Although in most countries English is not an official language  it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign language                          In the countries of the EU  English is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty five member states where it is not an official language  that is  the countries other than Ireland and Malta   In a      official Eurobarometer poll  conducted when the UK was still a member of the EU      percent of the EU respondents outside the countries where English is an official language said they could speak English well enough to have a conversation in that language  The next most commonly mentioned foreign language  French  which is the most widely known foreign language in the UK and Ireland   could be used in conversation by    percent of respondents              
A working knowledge of English has become a requirement in a number of occupations and professions such as medicine              and computing  English has become so important in scientific publishing that more than    percent of all scientific journal articles indexed by Chemical Abstracts in      were written in English  as were    percent of all articles in natural science publications by      and    percent of articles in humanities publications by                   
International communities such as international business people may use English as an auxiliary language  with an emphasis on vocabulary suitable for their domain of interest  This has led some scholars to develop the study of English as an auxiliary language  The trademarked Globish uses a relatively small subset of English vocabulary  about      words  designed to represent the highest use in international business English  in combination with the standard English grammar               Other examples include Simple English 
The increased use of the English language globally has had an effect on other languages  leading to some English words being assimilated into the vocabularies of other languages  This influence of English has led to concerns about language death               and to claims of linguistic imperialism               and has provoked resistance to the spread of English  however the number of speakers continues to increase because many people around the world think that English provides them with opportunities for better employment and improved lives              
Though some mention a possibility of divergence of English dialects into mutually unintelligible languages  most think a more likely outcome is that English will continue to function as a koineised language  in which the standard form unifies speakers from around the world               English is used as the language for wider communication in countries around the world               Thus English has grown in worldwide use much more than any constructed language proposed as an international auxiliary language  including Esperanto                           

Phonology
Main article  English phonology
The phonetics and phonology of the English language differ from one dialect to another  usually without interfering with mutual communication  Phonological variation affects the inventory of phonemes  i e  speech sounds that distinguish meaning   and phonetic variation consists in differences in pronunciation of the phonemes               This overview mainly describes the standard pronunciations of the United Kingdom and the United States  Received Pronunciation  RP  and General American  GA    See        Dialects  accents and varieties  below

The pronunciation of vowels varies a great deal between dialects and is one of the most detectable aspects of a speaker s accent  The table below lists the vowel phonemes in Received Pronunciation  RP  and General American  GA   with examples of words in which they occur from lexical sets compiled by linguists  The vowels are represented with symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet  those given for RP are standard in British dictionaries and other publications              
In RP  vowel length is phonemic  long vowels are marked with a triangular colon   x  e     x  e   in the table above  such as the vowel of need  ni d  as opposed to bid  b d   In GA  vowel length is non distinctive 
In both RP and GA  vowels are phonetically shortened before fortis consonants in the same syllable  like  t t  f   but not before lenis consonants like  d d  v  or in open syllables  thus  the vowels of rich  r t    neat  nit   and safe  se  f  are noticeably shorter than the vowels of ridge  r  d    need  ni d   and save  se   v   and the vowel of light  la  t  is shorter than that of lie  la      Because lenis consonants are frequently voiceless at the end of a syllable  vowel length is an important cue as to whether the following consonant is lenis or fortis              
The vowel     only occurs in unstressed syllables and is more open in quality in stem final positions                            Some dialects do not contrast     and     in unstressed positions  such that rabbit and abbot rhyme and Lenin and Lennon are homophonous  a dialectal feature called the weak vowel merger               GA   r  and   r  are realised as an r coloured vowel      as in further   f      phonemically   f r  r    which in RP is realised as   f       phonemically   f                    

Phonotactics
An English syllable includes a syllable nucleus consisting of a vowel sound  Syllable onset and coda  start and end  are optional  A syllable can start with up to three consonant sounds  as in sprint  spr nt   and end with up to five  as in  for some dialects  angsts  a ksts   This gives an English syllable the following structure   CCC V CCCCC   where C represents a consonant and V a vowel  the word strengths  str  k s  is thus close to the most complex syllable possible in English  The consonants that may appear together in onsets or codas are restricted  as is the order in which they may appear  Onsets can only have four types of consonant clusters  a stop and approximant  as in play  a voiceless fricative and approximant  as in fly or sly  s and a voiceless stop  as in stay  and s  a voiceless stop  and an approximant  as in string               Clusters of nasal and stop are only allowed in codas  Clusters of obstruents always agree in voicing  and clusters of sibilants and of plosives with the same point of articulation are prohibited  Several consonants have limited distributions   h  can only occur in syllable initial position  and     only in syllable final position              

Stress  rhythm and intonation
See also  Stress and vowel reduction in English  Intonation  linguistics         English  and English Prosody
Stress plays an important role in English  Certain syllables are stressed  while others are unstressed  Stress is a combination of duration  intensity  vowel quality  and sometimes changes in pitch  Stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables  and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently reduced while vowels in stressed syllables are not               Some words  primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as can  have weak and strong forms depending on whether they occur in stressed or non stressed position within a sentence 
Stress in English is phonemic  and some pairs of words are distinguished by stress  For instance  the word contract is stressed on the first syllable    k ntr kt  KON trakt  when used as a noun  but on the last syllable   k n tr kt  k n TRAKT  for most meanings  for example   reduce in size   when used as a verb                                         Here stress is connected to vowel reduction  in the noun  contract  the first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel      but in the verb  contract  the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to      Stress is also used to distinguish between words and phrases  so that a compound word receives a single stress unit  but the corresponding phrase has two  e g  a burnout    b  rna t   versus to burn out    b  rn  a t    and a hotdog    h td     versus a hot dog    h t  d                  
In terms of rhythm  English is generally described as a stress timed language  meaning that the amount of time between stressed syllables tends to be equal               Stressed syllables are pronounced longer  but unstressed syllables  syllables between stresses  are shortened  Vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened as well  and vowel shortening causes changes in vowel quality  vowel reduction

Varieties of English vary the most in pronunciation of vowels  The best known national varieties used as standards for education in non English speaking countries are British  BrE  and American  AmE   Countries such as Canada  Australia  Ireland  New Zealand and South Africa have their own standard varieties which are less often used as standards for education internationally  Some differences between the various dialects are shown in the table  Varieties of Standard English and their features               
English has undergone many historical sound changes  some of them affecting all varieties  and others affecting only a few  Most standard varieties are affected by the Great Vowel Shift  which changed the pronunciation of long vowels  but a few dialects have slightly different results  In North America  a number of chain shifts such as the Northern Cities Vowel Shift and Canadian Shift have produced very different vowel landscapes in some regional accents              
Some dialects have fewer or more consonant phonemes and phones than the standard varieties  Some conservative varieties like Scottish English have a voiceless             sound in whine that contrasts with the voiced  w  in wine  but most other dialects pronounce both words with voiced  w   a dialect feature called wine whine merger  The voiceless velar fricative sound  x  is found in Scottish English  which distinguishes loch  l x  from lock  l k   Accents like Cockney with  h dropping  lack the glottal fricative  h   and dialects with th stopping and th fronting like African American Vernacular and Estuary English do not have the dental fricatives         but replace them with dental or alveolar stops  t  d  or labiodental fricatives  f  v                             Other changes affecting the phonology of local varieties are processes such as yod dropping  yod coalescence  and reduction of consonant clusters                   page      needed     
General American and Received Pronunciation vary in their pronunciation of historical  r  after a vowel at the end of a syllable  in the syllable coda   GA is a rhotic dialect  meaning that it pronounces  r  at the end of a syllable  but RP is non rhotic  meaning that it loses  r  in that position  English dialects are classified as rhotic or non rhotic depending on whether they elide  r  like RP or keep it like GA              
There is complex dialectal variation in words with the open front and open back vowels              These four vowels are only distinguished in RP  Australia  New Zealand and South Africa  In GA  these vowels merge to three                       and in Canadian English  they merge to two                     In addition  the words that have each vowel vary by dialect  The table  Dialects and open vowels  shows this variation with lexical sets in which these sounds occur 

Grammar
Main article  English grammar
As is typical of an Indo European language  English follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment  Unlike other Indo European languages  English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favour of analytic constructions  Only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class  English distinguishes at least seven major word classes  verbs  nouns  adjectives  adverbs  determiners  including articles   prepositions  and conjunctions  Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns  and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators  and add the class of interjections               English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs  such as have and do  expressing the categories of mood and aspect  Questions are marked by do support  wh movement  fronting of question words beginning with wh   and word order inversion with some verbs              
Some traits typical of Germanic languages persist in English  such as the distinction between irregularly inflected strong stems inflected through ablaut  i e  changing the vowel of the stem  as in the pairs speak            spoke and foot            feet  and weak stems inflected through affixation  such as love            loved  hand            hands                Vestiges of the case and gender system are found in the pronoun system  he            him  who            whom  and in the inflection of the copula verb to be              
The seven word classes are exemplified in this sample sentence

English nouns are only inflected for number and possession  New nouns can be formed through derivation or compounding  They are semantically divided into proper nouns  names  and common nouns  Common nouns are in turn divided into concrete and abstract nouns  and grammatically into count nouns and mass nouns              
Most count nouns are inflected for plural number through the use of the plural suffix  s  but a few nouns have irregular plural forms  Mass nouns can only be pluralised through the use of a count noun classifier  e g  one loaf of bread  two loaves of bread              
Regular plural formation 

Singular  cat  dog
Plural  cats  dogs
Irregular plural formation 

Singular  man  woman  foot  fish  ox  knife  mouse
Plural  men  women  feet  fish  oxen  knives  mice
Possession can be expressed either by the possessive enclitic  s  also traditionally called a genitive suffix   or by the preposition of  Historically the  s possessive has been used for animate nouns  whereas the of possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns  Today this distinction is less clear  and many speakers use  s also with inanimates  Orthographically the possessive  s is separated from a singular noun with an apostrophe  If the noun is plural formed with  s the apostrophe follows the  s              
Possessive constructions 

With  s  The woman s husband s child
With of  The child of the husband of the woman
Nouns can form noun phrases  NPs  where they are the syntactic head of the words that depend on them such as determiners  quantifiers  conjunctions or adjectives               Noun phrases can be short  such as the man  composed only of a determiner and a noun  They can also include modifiers such as adjectives  e g  red  tall  all  and specifiers such as determiners  e g  the  that   But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP  using conjunctions such as and  or prepositions such as with  e g  the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles  this NP uses conjunctions  prepositions  specifiers  and modifiers   Regardless of length  an NP functions as a syntactic unit               For example  the possessive enclitic can  in cases which do not lead to ambiguity  follow the entire noun phrase  as in The President of India s wife  where the enclitic follows India and not President 
The class of determiners is used to specify the noun they precede in terms of definiteness  where the marks a definite noun and a or an an indefinite one  A definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor  whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known  Quantifiers  which include one  many  some and all  are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number  The noun must agree with the number of the determiner  e g  one man  sg   but all men  pl    Determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase              

Adjectives
Main article  English adjectives
English adjectives are words such as good  big  interesting  and Canadian that most typically modify nouns  denoting characteristics of their referents  e g   a red car   As modifiers  they come before the nouns they modify and after determiners               English adjectives also function as predicative complements  e g   the child is happy  
In Modern English  adjectives are not inflected so as to agree in form with the noun they modify  as in most other Indo European languages  For example  in the phrases the slender boy  and many slender girls  the adjective slender does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun 
Some adjectives are inflected for degree of comparison  with the positive degree unmarked  the suffix  er marking the comparative  and  est marking the superlative  a small boy  the boy is smaller than the girl  that boy is the smallest  Some adjectives have irregular suppletive comparative and superlative forms  such as good  better  and best  Other adjectives have comparatives formed by periphrastic constructions  with the adverb more marking the comparative  and most marking the superlative  happier or more happy  the happiest or most happy               There is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison  and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common at the expense of the inflected form              

Determiners
Main article  English determiners
English determiners are words such as the  each  many  some  and which  occurring most typically in noun phrases before the head nouns and any modifiers and marking the noun phrase as definite or indefinite               They often agree with the noun in number  They do not typically inflect for degree of comparison 

Pronouns  case  and person
Main article  English pronouns
English pronouns conserve many traits of case and gender inflection  The personal pronouns retain a difference between subjective and objective case in most persons  I me  he him  she her  we us  they them  as well as an animateness distinction in the third person singular  distinguishing it from the three sets of animate third person singular pronouns  and an optional gender distinction in the animate third person singular  distinguishing between she her  feminine   they them  epicene   and he him  masculine                              The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case  and the objective case is used in the sense both of the previous accusative case  for a patient  or direct object of a transitive verb   and of the Old English dative case  for a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb                             The subjective is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause  otherwise the objective is used               While grammarians such as Henry Sweet              and Otto Jespersen              noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system  some contemporary grammars  for example Huddleston  amp  Pullum         retain traditional labels for the cases  calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively 
Possessive pronouns exist in dependent and independent forms  the dependent form functions as a determiner specifying a noun  as in my chair   while the independent form can stand alone as if it were a noun  e g  the chair is mine                The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address  the old second person singular familiar pronoun thou acquired a pejorative or inferior tinge of meaning and was abandoned  
Both the second and third persons share pronouns between the plural and singular 

Plural and singular are always identical  you  your  yours  in the second person  except in the reflexive form  yourself yourselves  in most dialects  Some dialects have introduced innovative second person plural pronouns  such as y all  found in Southern American English and African American  Vernacular  English   youse  found in Australian English   or ye  in Hiberno English  
In the third person  the they them series of pronouns  they  them  their  theirs  themselves  are used in both plural and singular  and are the only pronouns available for the plural  In the singular  the they them series  sometimes with the addition of the singular specific reflexive form themself  serve as a gender neutral set of pronouns  These pronouns are becoming more accepted  especially as part of the LGBTQ culture

Pronouns are used to refer to entities deictically or anaphorically  A deictic pronoun points to some person or object by identifying it relative to the speech situation for example  the pronoun I identifies the speaker  and the pronoun you  the addressee  Anaphoric pronouns such as that refer back to an entity already mentioned or assumed by the speaker to be known by the audience  for example in the sentence I already told you that  The reflexive pronouns are used when the oblique argument is identical to the subject of a phrase  e g   he sent it to himself  or  she braced herself for impact                

Prepositions
Main article  English prepositions
Prepositional phrases  PP  are phrases composed of a preposition and one or more nouns  e g  with the dog  for my friend  to school  in England               Prepositions have a wide range of uses in English  They are used to describe movement  place  and other relations between different entities  but they also have many syntactic uses such as introducing complement clauses and oblique arguments of verbs               For example  in the phrase I gave it to him  the preposition to marks the recipient  or Indirect Object of the verb to give  Traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed the case of the noun they preceded  for example causing the pronouns to use the objective rather than subjective form   with her    to me    for us   But some contemporary grammars no longer consider government of case to be the defining feature of the class of prepositions  rather defining prepositions as words that can function as the heads of prepositional phrases              

Verbs and verb phrases
Main article  English verbs
English verbs are inflected for tense and aspect and marked for agreement with present tense third person singular subject  Only the copula verb to be is still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects               Auxiliary verbs such as have and be are paired with verbs in the infinitive  past  or progressive forms  They form complex tenses  aspects  and moods  Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in that they can be followed by the negation  and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence                           
Most verbs have six inflectional forms  The primary forms are a plain present  a third person singular present  and a preterite  past  form  The secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive  a gerund participle and a past participle               The copula verb to be is the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation  and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject  The first person present tense form is am  the third person singular form is is  and the form are is used in the second person singular and all three plurals  The only verb past participle is been and its gerund participle is being

Tense  aspect and mood
English has two primary tenses  past  preterite  and non past  The preterite is inflected by using the preterite form of the verb  which for the regular verbs includes the suffix  ed  and for the strong verbs either the suffix  t or a change in the stem vowel  The non past form is unmarked except in the third person singular  which takes the suffix  s              




Present
Preterite


First person

I run
I ran


Second person

You run
You ran


Third person

John runs
John ran

English does not have future verb forms               The future tense is expressed periphrastically with one of the auxiliary verbs will or shall               Many varieties also use a near future constructed with the phrasal verb be going to   going to future                




Future


First person

I will run


Second person

You will run


Third person

John will run

Further aspectual distinctions are shown by auxiliary verbs  primarily have and be  which show the contrast between a perfect and non perfect past tense  I have run vs  I was running   and compound tenses such as preterite perfect  I had been running  and present perfect  I have been running               
For the expression of mood  English uses a number of modal auxiliaries  such as can  may  will  shall and the past tense forms could  might  would  should  There are also subjunctive and imperative moods  both based on the plain form of the verb  i e  without the third person singular  s   for use in subordinate clauses  e g  subjunctive  It is important that he run every day  imperative Run                
An infinitive form  that uses the plain form of the verb and the preposition to  is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause  Finite verbal clauses are those that are formed around a verb in the present or preterite form  In clauses with auxiliary verbs  they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause               For example  he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive  or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave  where the main verb is see  which is in a preterite form  and leave is in the infinitive 

Phrasal verbs
English also makes frequent use of constructions traditionally called phrasal verbs  verb phrases that are made up of a verb root and a preposition or particle that follows the verb  The phrase then functions as a single predicate  In terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb  but in writing it is written as a separate word  Examples of phrasal verbs are to get up  to ask out  to back up  to give up  to get together  to hang out  to put up with  etc  The phrasal verb frequently has a highly idiomatic meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement  e g  lay off meaning terminate someone s employment                In spite of the idiomatic meaning  some grammarians  including Huddleston  amp  Pullum             do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term  phrasal verb   Instead  they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement  i e  he woke up in the morning and he ran up in the mountains are syntactically equivalent 

Adverbs
Main article  English adverbs
The function of adverbs is to modify the action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about the manner in which it occurs               Many adverbs are derived from adjectives by appending the suffix  ly  For example  in the phrase the woman walked quickly  the adverb quickly is derived in this way from the adjective quick  Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms  such as good  which has the adverbial form well 

Syntax
In the English sentence The cat sat on the mat  the subject is the cat  a noun phrase   the verb is sat  and on the mat is a prepositional phrase composed of a noun phrase the mat  headed by the preposition on 
Modern English syntax language is moderately analytic               It has developed features such as modal verbs and word order as resources for conveying meaning  Auxiliary verbs mark constructions such as questions  negative polarity  the passive voice and progressive aspect 

Basic constituent order
English word order has moved from the Germanic verb second  V   word order to being almost exclusively subject verb object  SVO                The combination of SVO order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the centre of the sentence  such as he had hoped to try to open it 
In most sentences  English only marks grammatical relations through word order               The subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it  The example below demonstrates how the grammatical roles of each constituent are marked only by the position relative to the verb 



The dog
bites
the man


S
V
O


The man
bites
the dog


S
V
O

An exception is found in sentences where one of the constituents is a pronoun  in which case it is doubly marked  both by word order and by case inflection  where the subject pronoun precedes the verb and takes the subjective case form  and the object pronoun follows the verb and takes the objective case form               The example below demonstrates this double marking in a sentence where both object and subject are represented with a third person singular masculine pronoun 



He
hit
him


S
V
O

Indirect objects  IO  of ditransitive verbs can be placed either as the first object in a double object construction  S V IO O   such as I gave Jane the book or in a prepositional phrase  such as I gave the book to Jane              

Clause syntax
Main article  English clause syntax
In English a sentence may be composed of one or more clauses  that may  in turn  be composed of one or more phrases  e g  Noun Phrases  Verb Phrases  and Prepositional Phrases   A clause is built around a verb and includes its constituents  such as any NPs and PPs  Within a sentence  there is always at least one main clause  or matrix clause  whereas other clauses are subordinate to a main clause  Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause  For example  in the phrase I think  that  you are lying  the main clause is headed by the verb think  the subject is I  but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause  that  you are lying  The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause  but it is often omitted               Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause  For example  in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today  the relative clause that you received today specifies the meaning of the word letter  the object of the main clause  Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who  whose  whom  and which as well as by that  which can also be omitted                In contrast to many other Germanic languages there are no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses              

Auxiliary verb constructions
Main articles  Do support  English auxiliary verbs  and Subject auxiliary inversion
English syntax relies on auxiliary verbs for many functions including the expression of tense  aspect  and mood  Auxiliary verbs form main clauses  and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb  For example  in the sentence the dog did not find its bone  the clause find its bone is the complement of the negated verb did not  Subject auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions  including focus  negation  and interrogative constructions 
The verb do can be used as an auxiliary even in simple declarative sentences  where it usually serves to add emphasis  as in  I did shut the fridge   However  in the negated and inverted clauses referred to above  it is used because the rules of English syntax permit these constructions only when an auxiliary is present  Modern English does not allow the addition of the negating adverb not to an ordinary finite lexical verb  as in  I know not it can only be added to an auxiliary  or copular  verb  hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required  the auxiliary do is used  to produce a form like I do not  don t  know  The same applies in clauses requiring inversion  including most questions inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb  so it is not possible to say  Know you him   grammatical rules require Do you know him              
Negation is done with the adverb not  which precedes the main verb and follows an auxiliary verb  A contracted form of not  n t can be used as an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb to be  Just as with questions  many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do support  thus in Modern English I don t know him is the correct answer to the question Do you know him   but not  I know him not  although this construction may be found in older English              
Passive constructions also use auxiliary verbs  A passive construction rephrases an active construction in such a way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase  and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase  They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb to be or to get  although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with get  For example  putting the sentence she sees him into the passive becomes he is seen  by her   or he gets seen  by her               

Questions
Both yes no questions and wh questions in English are mostly formed using subject auxiliary inversion  Am I going tomorrow   Where can we eat    which may require do support  Do you like her   Where did he go    In most cases  interrogative words  wh words  e g  what  who  where  when  why  how  appear in a fronted position  For example  in the question What did you see   the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence   When the wh word is the subject or forms part of the subject  no inversion occurs  Who saw the cat    Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the questions theme  e g  To whose house did you go last night   The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case  with the variant whom serving as the objective case form  although this form may be going out of use in many contexts              

Discourse level syntax
While English is a subject prominent language  at the discourse level it tends to use a topic comment structure  where the known information  topic  precedes the new information  comment   Because of the strict SVO syntax  the topic of a sentence generally has to be the grammatical subject of the sentence  In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence  it is often promoted to subject position through syntactic means  One way of doing this is through a passive construction  the girl was stung by the bee  Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there  e g  it was the girl that the bee stung  there was a girl who was stung by a bee               Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs  e g   it is raining  or in existential clauses  there are many cars on the street   Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects  English is able to maintain both a topic comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax 
Focus constructions emphasise a particular piece of new or salient information within a sentence  generally through allocating the main sentence level stress on the focal constituent  For example  the girl was stung by a bee  emphasising it was a bee and not  for example  a wasp that stung her   or The girl was stung by a bee  contrasting with another possibility  for example that it was the boy                Topic and focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation  either preposing or postposing the item to be focused on relative to the main clause  For example  That girl over there  she was stung by a bee  emphasises the girl by preposition  but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition  she was stung by a bee  that girl over there  where reference to the girl is established as an afterthought              
Cohesion between sentences is achieved through the use of deictic pronouns as anaphora  e g  that is exactly what I mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors  or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event                Discourse markers such as oh  so  or well  also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion  Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences  Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said  for example  no way is that true   the idiomatic marker no way  expressing disbelief   or boy  I m hungry  the marker boy expressing emphasis   While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English  they are also used in written and formal registers              

Vocabulary
It is generally stated that English has around         words  or         if obsolete words are counted  this estimate is based on the last full edition of the Oxford English Dictionary from                    Over half of these words are nouns  a quarter adjectives  and a seventh verbs  There is one count that puts the English vocabulary at about        million words but that count presumably includes words such as Latin species names  scientific terminology  botanical terms  prefixed and suffixed words  jargon  foreign words of extremely limited English use  and technical acronyms              
Due to its status as an international language  English adopts foreign words quickly and borrows vocabulary from many other sources  Early studies of English vocabulary by lexicographers  the scholars who formally study vocabulary  compile dictionaries  or both  were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good quality linguistic corpora               collections of actual written texts and spoken passages  Many statements published before the end of the   th century about the growth of English vocabulary over time  the dates of first use of various words in English  and the sources of English vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analyses of linguistic corpus data become available                           

Word formation processes
English forms new words from existing words or roots in its vocabulary through a variety of processes  One of the most productive processes in English is conversion               using a word with a different grammatical role  for example using a noun as a verb or a verb as a noun  Another productive word formation process is nominal compounding                            producing compound words such as babysitter or ice cream or homesick               A process more common in Old English than in Modern English  but still productive in Modern English  is the use of derivational suffixes   hood   ness   ing   ility  to derive new words from existing words  especially those of Germanic origin  or stems  especially for words of Latin or Greek origin  
Formation of new words  called neologisms  based on Greek and or Latin roots  for example television or optometry  is a highly productive process in English and in most modern European languages  so much so that it is often difficult to determine in which language a neologism originated  For this reason  American lexicographer Philip Gove attributed many such words to the  international scientific vocabulary   ISV  when compiling Webster s Third New International Dictionary         Another active word formation process in English is the creation of acronyms               words formed by pronouncing abbreviations of longer phrases as single words  e g  NATO  laser  scuba

English  besides forming new words from existing words and their roots  also borrows words from other languages  This borrowing is commonplace in many world languages  but English has been especially open to borrowing of foreign words throughout the last            years               Nevertheless  most of the core vocabulary and the most common words in English are still West Germanic                            The English words first learned by children as they learn to speak are mainly Germanic words from Old English               It is not possible to speak or write English without Germanic words  but it is possible to write or speak many sentences in English without foreign loanwords              
But one of the consequences of long language contact between French and English in all stages of their development is that the vocabulary of English has a very high percentage of  Latinate  words  derived from French  especially  and also from other Romance languages and Latin   French words from various periods of the development of French now make up one third of the vocabulary of English               Linguist Anthony Lacoudre estimated that over        English words are of French origin and may be understood without orthographical change by French speakers               Words of Old Norse origin have entered the English language primarily from the contact between Old Norse and Old English during colonisation of eastern and northern England  Many of these words are part of English core vocabulary  such as egg and knife              
English has also borrowed many words directly from Latin  the ancestor of the Romance languages  during all stages of its development                            Many of these words had earlier been borrowed into Latin from Greek  Latin or Greek are still highly productive sources of stems used to form vocabulary of subjects learned in higher education such as the sciences  philosophy  and mathematics               English continues to gain new loanwords and calques   loan translations   from languages all over the world  and words from languages other than the ancestral Anglo Saxon language make up about     of the vocabulary of English              
English has formal and informal speech registers  informal registers  including child directed speech  tend to be made up predominantly of words of Anglo Saxon origin  while the percentage of vocabulary that is of Latinate origin is higher in legal  scientific  and academic texts

English has had a strong influence on the vocabulary of other languages                            The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language  the role of English as a world lingua franca  and the large number of books and films that are translated from English into other languages               That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies  Among varieties of English  it is especially American English that influences other languages               Some languages  such as Chinese  write words borrowed from English mostly as calques  while others  such as Japanese  readily take in English loanwords written in sound indicating script               Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe              

Orthography

Since the ninth century  English has been written in a Latin alphabet  also called Roman alphabet   Earlier Old English texts in Anglo Saxon runes are only short inscriptions  The great majority of literary works in Old English that survive to today are written in the Roman alphabet              The modern English alphabet contains    letters of the Latin script  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m  n  o  p  q  r  s  t  u  v  w  x  y  z  which also have capital forms  A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M  N  O  P  Q  R  S  T  U  V  W  X  Y  Z  
The spelling system  or orthography  of English is multi layered and complex  with elements of French  Latin  and Greek spelling on top of the native Germanic system               Further complications have arisen through sound changes with which the orthography has not kept pace              Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms  English has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation  and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess from knowing how a word is pronounced               There are also systematic spelling differences between British and American English  These situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in English              
Although letters and speech sounds do not have a one to one correspondence in standard English spelling  spelling rules that take into account syllable structure  phonetic changes in derived words  and word accent are reliable for most English words               Moreover  standard English spelling shows etymological relationships between related words that would be obscured by a closer correspondence between pronunciation and spelling for example  the words photograph  photography  and photographic               or the words electricity and electrical  While few scholars agree with Chomsky and Halle        that conventional English orthography is  near optimal                there is a rationale for current English spelling patterns               The standard orthography of English is the most widely used writing system in the world               Standard English spelling is based on a graphomorphemic segmentation of words into written clues of what meaningful units make up each word              
Readers of English can generally rely on the correspondence between spelling and pronunciation to be fairly regular for letters or digraphs used to spell consonant sounds  The letters b  d  f  h  j  k  l  m  n  p  r  s  t  v  w  y  z represent  respectively  the phonemes  b  d  f  h  d   k  l  m  n  p  r  s  t  v  w  j  z   The letters c and g normally represent  k  and      but there is also a soft c pronounced  s   and a soft g pronounced  d    The differences in the pronunciations of the letters c and g are often signalled by the following letters in standard English spelling  Digraphs used to represent phonemes and phoneme sequences include ch for  t    sh for      th for     or      ng for      qu for  kw   and ph for  f  in Greek derived words  The single letter x is generally pronounced as  z  in word initial position and as  ks  otherwise  There are exceptions to these generalisations  often the result of loanwords being spelled according to the spelling patterns of their languages of origin              or residues of proposals by scholars in the early period of Modern English to follow the spelling patterns of Latin for English words of Germanic origin              
For the vowel sounds of the English language  however  correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are more irregular  There are many more vowel phonemes in English than there are single vowel letters  a  e  i  o  u  y  and very rarely w   As a result  some  long vowels  are often indicated by combinations of letters  like the oa in boat  the ow in how  and the ay in stay   or the historically based silent e  as in note and cake               
The consequence of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read and write can be challenging in English  It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages  including Italian  Spanish  and German               Nonetheless  there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound symbol regularities that occur in the standard English spellings of commonly used words               Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English                            Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English              
English writing also includes a system of punctuation marks that is similar to those used in most alphabetic languages around the world  The purpose of punctuation is to mark meaningful grammatical relationships in sentences to aid readers in understanding a text and to indicate features important for reading a text aloud              

Dialects  accents and varieties
Main articles  List of dialects of English  World Englishes  and Regional accents of English
Dialectologists identify many English dialects  which usually refer to regional varieties that differ from each other in terms of patterns of grammar  vocabulary  and pronunciation  The pronunciation of particular areas distinguishes dialects as separate regional accents  The major native dialects of English are often divided by linguists into the two extremely general categories of British English  BrE  and North American English  NAE                There also exists a third common major grouping of English varieties  Southern Hemisphere English  the most prominent being Australian and New Zealand English

The fact that English has been spoken in England for            years explains why England has a great wealth of regional dialects               Within the United Kingdom  Received Pronunciation  RP   an educated accent associated originally with the South East of England  has been traditionally used as a broadcast standard and is considered the most prestigious of British accents  The spread of RP  also known as BBC English  through the media has caused many traditional dialects of rural England to recede  as youths adopt the traits of the prestige variety instead of traits from local dialects  At the time of the         Survey of English Dialects  grammar and vocabulary differed across the country  but a process of lexical attrition has led most of this variation to disappear              
Nonetheless  this attrition has mostly affected dialectal variation in grammar and vocabulary  In fact  only    of the English population actually speak RP  the remainder speaking in regional accents and dialects with varying degrees of RP influence               There is also variability within RP  particularly along class lines between Upper and Middle class RP speakers and between native RP speakers and speakers who adopt RP later in life               Within Britain  there is also considerable variation along lines of social class  some traits  though exceedingly common  are nonetheless considered  non standard  and associated with lower class speakers and identities  An example of this is h dropping  which was historically a feature of lower class London English  particularly Cockney  and can now be heard in the local accents of most parts of England  However  it remains largely absent in broadcasting and among the upper crust of British society              
English in England can be divided into four major dialect regions  South East English  South West English  also known as West Country English   Midlands English and Northern English  Within each of these regions  several local dialects exist  within the Northern region  there is a division between the Yorkshire dialects  the Geordie dialect  spoken around Newcastle  in Northumbria  and the Lancashire dialects  which include the urban subdialects of Manchester  Mancunian  and Liverpool  Scouse   Having been the centre of Danish occupation during the Viking invasions of England  Northern English dialects  particularly the Yorkshire dialect  retain Norse features not found in other English varieties              
Since the   th century  South East England varieties have centred on London  which has been the centre from which dialectal innovations have spread to other dialects  In London  the Cockney dialect was traditionally used by the lower classes  and it was long a socially stigmatised variety  The spread of Cockney features across the South East led the media to talk of Estuary English as a new dialect  but the notion was criticised by many linguists on the grounds that London had been influencing neighbouring regions throughout history                                         Traits that have spread from London in recent decades include the use of intrusive R  drawing is pronounced drawring   dr  r      t glottalisation  Potter is pronounced with a glottal stop as Po er   p      and th fronting  or the pronunciation of th  as  f   thanks pronounced fanks  or  v   bother pronounced bover               
Scots is today considered a separate language from English  but it has its origins in early Northern Middle English              and developed and changed during its history with influence from other sources  particularly Scottish Gaelic and Old Norse  Scots itself has a number of regional dialects  In addition to Scots  Scottish English comprises the varieties of Standard English spoken in Scotland  most varieties are Northern English accents  with some influence from Scots              
In Ireland  various forms of English have been spoken since the Norman invasions of the   th century  In County Wexford and in the area surrounding Dublin  two extinct dialects known as Forth and Bargy and Fingallian developed as offshoots from Early Middle English and were spoken until the   th century  Modern Irish English  however  has its roots in English colonisation in the   th century  Today Irish English is divided into Ulster English  the Northern Ireland dialect with strong influence from Scots  and various dialects of the Republic of Ireland  Like Scottish and most North American accents  almost all Irish accents preserve the rhoticity which has been lost in the dialects influenced by RP

Due to the relatively strong degree of mixing  mutual accommodation  and koin ization that occurred during the colonial period  North American English has traditionally been perceived as relatively homogeneous  at least in comparison with British dialects  However  modern scholars have strongly opposed this notion  arguing that North American English shows a great deal of phonetic  lexical  and geographic variability  This becomes all the more apparent considering social  ethnolinguistic  and regional varieties such as African American English  Chicano English  Cajun English  or Newfoundland English               American accent variation is increasing at the regional level and decreasing at the very local level               though most Americans still speak within a phonological continuum of similar accents               known collectively as General American English  GA   with differences hardly noticed even among Americans themselves  including Midland and Western American English                                         In most American and Canadian English dialects  rhoticity  or r fullness  is dominant  with non rhoticity  or r dropping  being associated with lower prestige and social class  especially since the end of World War II  This contrasts with the situation in England  where non rhoticity has become the standard              
Separate from General American English are American dialects with clearly distinct sound systems that have developed over time  including Southern American English  the English of the coastal Northeastern United States including New York City English and Eastern New England English and African American Vernacular English  all of these  aside from certain subdialects of the American South  were historically non rhotic 
Canadian English varieties  except for those of the Atlantic provinces and perhaps Quebec  are generally considered to fall under the General American English continuum  although they often show raising of the vowels  a   and  a   before voiceless consonants and have distinct norms for writing and pronunciation as well               Atlantic Canadian English  notably distinct from Standard Canadian English               comprises Maritime English  or Maritimer English  and Newfoundland English  It was mostly influenced by British and Irish English  Irish and Scottish Gaelic  and some Acadian French               Regions such as Miramichi and Cape Breton Island have a wide variety of phrases and words not spoken outside of their respective regions 
In Southern American English  the most populous American  accent group  outside of General American English               rhoticity now strongly prevails  replacing the region s historical non rhotic prestige                                         Southern accents are colloquially described as a  drawl  or  twang                being recognised most readily by the Southern Vowel Shift initiated by glide deleting in the  a   vowel  e g  pronouncing spy almost like spa   the  Southern breaking  of several front pure vowels into a gliding vowel or even two syllables  e g  pronouncing the word  press  almost like  pray us                 the pin pen merger  and other distinctive phonological  grammatical  and lexical features  many of which are actually recent developments of the   th century or later              
Spoken primarily by working  and middle class African Americans  African American Vernacular English  AAVE  is also largely non rhotic and likely originated among enslaved Africans and African Americans influenced primarily by the non rhotic  non standard older Southern dialects  A minority of linguists               contrarily  propose that AAVE mostly traces back to African languages spoken by the slaves who had to develop a pidgin or Creole English to communicate with slaves of other ethnic and linguistic origins               AAVE s important commonalities with Southern accents suggest it developed into a highly coherent and homogeneous variety in the   th or early   th century  AAVE is commonly stigmatised in North America as a form of  broken  or  uneducated  English  as are white Southern accents  but linguists today recognise both as fully developed varieties of English with their own norms shared by large speech communities

The first significant exposure of the Philippines to the English language occurred in      when the British occupied Manila during the Seven Years  War  but this was a brief episode that had no lasting influence  English later became more important and widespread during American rule between      and      and remains an official language of the Philippines  Today  the use of English is ubiquitous in the Philippines  being found on street signs and marquees  in government documents and forms  in courtrooms  in the media and entertainment industries  in the business sector  and in various other aspects of daily life               One particularly prominent form of English usage in the country is found in everyday speech  most Filipinos from Manila use or  at the very least  have been exposed to Taglish  a form of code switching between Tagalog and English               A similar code switching method is used by urban native speakers of Bisayan languages under the name of Bislish

English is spoken widely in southern Africa and is an official or co official language in several of the region s countries  In South Africa  English has been spoken since       co existing with Afrikaans and various African languages such as the Khoe and Bantu languages  Today  about nine percent of the South African population speaks South African English  SAE  as a first language  SAE is a non rhotic variety that tends to follow RP as a norm  It is one of the few non rhotic English varieties that lack intrusive R  The second language varieties of South Africa differ based on the native languages of their speakers               Most phonological differences from RP are in the vowels               Consonant differences include the tendency to pronounce  p  t  t    k  without aspiration  e g  pin pronounced  p n  rather than as  p  n  as in most other varieties   while r is often pronounced as a flap     instead of as the more common fricative              
Nigerian English is a variety of English spoken in Nigeria               It has traditionally been based on British English  but in recent years  because of influence from the United States  some words of American English origin have made it into Nigerian English  Additionally  some new words and collocations have emerged from the variety out of a need to express concepts specific to the culture of the nation  e g  senior wife   Over          million Nigerians speak English              
Several varieties of English are also spoken in the Caribbean islands that were colonial possessions of Britain  including Jamaica  the Leeward and Windward Islands and Trinidad and Tobago  Barbados  the Cayman Islands and Belize  Each of these areas is home both to a local variety of English and a local English based creole  combining English and African languages  The most prominent varieties are Jamaican English and Jamaican Creole  In Central America  English based creoles are spoken on the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Panama               Locals are often fluent in both the local English variety and the local creole languages  and code switching between them is frequent  Indeed  a way to conceptualise the relationship between such creole and standard varieties is to view them as a spectrum of language registers in which the most creole like forms serve as the  basilect  and the most RP like forms serve as the  acrolect   the most formal register              
Most Caribbean varieties are based on British English and consequently  most are non rhotic  except for formal styles of Jamaican English which are often rhotic  Jamaican English differs from RP in its vowel inventory  which has a distinction between long and short vowels rather than tense and lax vowels as in Standard English  The diphthongs  ei  and  ou  are monophthongs  e   and  o   or even the reverse diphthongs  ie  and  uo   e g  bay and boat pronounced  b e   and  b o t    Often word final consonant clusters are simplified so that  child  is pronounced  t  ail  and  wind   win                                         
As a historical legacy  Indian English tends to take RP as its ideal  and how well this ideal is realised in an individual s speech reflects class distinctions among Indian English speakers  Indian English accents are marked by the pronunciation of phonemes such as  t  and  d   often pronounced with retroflex articulation as     and      and the replacement of     and     with dentals  t   and  d    Sometimes Indian English speakers may also use spelling based pronunciations where the silent   x  e  h  x  e   found in words such as ghost is pronounced as an Indian voiced aspirated stop

Non native English speakers may pronounce words differently due to having not fully mastered English pronunciation  This can happen either because they apply the speech rules of their mother tongue to English   interference   or through implementing strategies similar to those used in first language acquisition               They may create innovative pronunciations for English sounds  not found in the speaker s first language

  Romaine       p           Other changes such as the spread and regularisation of do support began in the thirteenth century and were more or less complete in the nineteenth  Although do coexisted with the simple verb forms in negative statements from the early ninth century  obligatoriness was not complete until the nineteenth  The increasing use of do periphrasis coincides with the fixing of SVO word order  Not surprisingly  do is first widely used in interrogatives  where the word order is disrupted  and then later spread to negatives
