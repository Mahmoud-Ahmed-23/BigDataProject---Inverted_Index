Machine learning in bioinformatics is the application of machine learning algorithms to bioinformatics             including genomics  proteomics  microarrays  systems biology  evolution  and text mining                       
Prior to the emergence of machine learning  bioinformatics algorithms had to be programmed by hand  for problems such as protein structure prediction  this proved difficult             Machine learning techniques such as deep learning can learn features of data sets rather than requiring the programmer to define them individually  The algorithm can further learn how to combine low level features into more abstract features  and so on  This multi layered approach allows such systems to make sophisticated predictions when appropriately trained  These methods contrast with other computational biology approaches which  while exploiting existing datasets  do not allow the data to be interpreted and analyzed in unanticipated ways  


Tasks edit 
Machine learning algorithms in bioinformatics can be used for prediction  classification  and feature selection  Methods to achieve this task are varied and span many disciplines  most well known among them are machine learning and statistics  Classification and prediction tasks aim at building models that describe and distinguish classes or concepts for future prediction  The differences between them are the following 

Classification recognition outputs a categorical class  while prediction outputs a numerical valued feature 
The type of algorithm  or process used to build the predictive models from data using analogies  rules  neural networks  probabilities  and or statistics 
Due to the exponential growth of information technologies and applicable models  including artificial intelligence and data mining  in addition to the access ever more comprehensive data sets  new and better information analysis techniques have been created  based on their ability to learn  Such models allow reach beyond description and provide insights in the form of testable models 

Approaches edit 
Artificial neural networks edit 
Artificial neural networks in bioinformatics have been used for            

Comparing and aligning RNA  protein  and DNA sequences 
Identification of promoters and finding genes from sequences related to DNA 
Interpreting the expression gene and micro array data 
Identifying the network  regulatory  of genes 
Learning evolutionary relationships by constructing phylogenetic trees 
Classifying and predicting protein structure 
Molecular design and docking
Feature engineering edit 
The way that features  often vectors in a many dimensional space  are extracted from the domain data is an important component of learning systems             In genomics  a typical representation of a sequence is a vector of k mers frequencies  which is a vector of dimension 
  
    
      
        
           
          
            k
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle    k  
  
 whose entries count the appearance of each subsequence of length 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
      displaystyle k 
  
 in a given sequence  Since for a value as small as 
  
    
      
        k
         
          
      
    
      displaystyle k    
  
 the dimensionality of these vectors is huge  e g  in this case the dimension is 
  
    
      
        
           
          
              
          
        
          x     
          
          xd  
        
            
          
             
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle        approx    times        
  
   techniques such as principal component analysis are used to project the data to a lower dimensional space  thus selecting a smaller set of features from the sequences                       

Classification edit 
In this type of machine learning task  the output is a discrete variable  One example of this type of task in bioinformatics is labeling new genomic data  such as genomes of unculturable bacteria  based on a model of already labeled data            

Hidden Markov models edit 
Hidden Markov models  HMMs  are a class of statistical models for sequential data  often related to systems evolving over time   An HMM is composed of two mathematical objects  an observed state dependent process 
  
    
      
        
          X
          
             
          
        
         
        
          X
          
             
          
        
         
          x     
         
        
          X
          
            M
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle X     X      ldots  X  M  
  
  and an unobserved  hidden  state process 
  
    
      
        
          S
          
             
          
        
         
        
          S
          
             
          
        
         
          x     
         
        
          S
          
            T
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle S     S      ldots  S  T  
  
  In an HMM  the state process is not directly observed   it is a  hidden   or  latent   variable   but observations are made of a state dependent process  or observation process  that is driven by the underlying state process  and which can thus be regarded as a noisy measurement of the system states of interest              HMMs can be formulated in continuous time                        
HMMs can be used to profile and convert a multiple sequence alignment into a position specific scoring system suitable for searching databases for homologous sequences remotely              Additionally  ecological phenomena can be described by HMMs             

Convolutional neural networks edit 
Convolutional neural networks  CNN  are a class of deep neural network whose architecture is based on shared weights of convolution kernels or filters that slide along input features  providing translation equivariant responses known as feature maps                          CNNs take advantage of the hierarchical pattern in data and assemble patterns of increasing complexity using smaller and simpler patterns discovered via their filters             
Convolutional networks were inspired by biological processes                                                 in that the connectivity pattern between neurons resembles the organization of the animal visual cortex  Individual cortical neurons respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the visual field known as the receptive field  The receptive fields of different neurons partially overlap such that they cover the entire visual field 
CNN uses relatively little pre processing compared to other image classification algorithms  This means that the network learns to optimize the filters  or kernels  through automated learning  whereas in traditional algorithms these filters are hand engineered  This reduced reliance on prior knowledge of the analyst and on human intervention in manual feature extraction makes CNNs a desirable model             
A phylogenetic convolutional neural network  Ph CNN  is a convolutional neural network architecture proposed by Fioranti et al  in      to classify metagenomics data              In this approach  phylogenetic data is endowed with patristic distance  the sum of the lengths of all branches connecting two operational taxonomic units  OTU   to select k neighborhoods for each OTU  and each OTU and its neighbors are processed with convolutional filters 

Self supervised learning edit 
Unlike supervised methods  self supervised learning methods learn representations without relying on annotated data  That is well suited for genomics  where high throughput sequencing techniques can create potentially large amounts of unlabeled data  Some examples of self supervised learning methods applied on genomics include DNABERT and Self GenomeNet                         

Random forest edit 
Some bioinformatic applications     which       of Random Forest
Random forests  RF  classify by constructing an ensemble of decision trees  and outputting the average prediction of the individual trees              This is a modification of bootstrap aggregating  which aggregates a large collection of decision trees  and can be used for classification or regression                         
As random forests give an internal estimate of generalization error  cross validation is unnecessary  In addition  they produce proximities  which can be used to impute missing values  and which enable novel data visualizations             
Computationally  random forests are appealing because they naturally handle both regression and  multiclass  classification  are relatively fast to train and to predict  depend only on one or two tuning parameters  have a built in estimate of the generalization error  can be used directly for high dimensional problems  and can easily be implemented in parallel  Statistically  random forests are appealing for additional features  such as measures of variable importance  differential class weighting  missing value imputation  visualization  outlier detection  and unsupervised learning             

Clustering edit 
Clustering   the partitioning of a data set into disjoint subsets  so that the data in each subset are as close as possible to each other and as distant as possible from data in any other subset  according to some defined distance or similarity function   is a common technique for statistical data analysis 
Clustering is central to much data driven bioinformatics research and serves as a powerful computational method whereby means of hierarchical  centroid based  distribution based  density based  and self organizing maps classification  has long been studied and used in classical machine learning settings  Particularly  clustering helps to analyze unstructured and high dimensional data in the form of sequences  expressions  texts  images  and so on  Clustering is also used to gain insights into biological processes at the genomic level  e g  gene functions  cellular processes  subtypes of cells  gene regulation  and metabolic processes             

Clustering algorithms used in bioinformatics edit 
Data clustering algorithms can be hierarchical or partitional  Hierarchical algorithms find successive clusters using previously established clusters  whereas partitional algorithms determine all clusters at once  Hierarchical algorithms can be agglomerative  bottom up  or divisive  top down  
Agglomerative algorithms begin with each element as a separate cluster and merge them in successively larger clusters  Divisive algorithms begin with the whole set and proceed to divide it into successively smaller clusters  Hierarchical clustering is calculated using metrics on Euclidean spaces  the most commonly used is the Euclidean distance computed by finding the square of the difference between each variable  adding all the squares  and finding the square root of the said sum  An example of a hierarchical clustering algorithm is BIRCH  which is particularly good on bioinformatics for its nearly linear time complexity given generally large datasets              Partitioning algorithms are based on specifying an initial number of groups  and iteratively reallocating objects among groups to convergence  This algorithm typically determines all clusters at once  Most applications adopt one of two popular heuristic methods  k means algorithm or k medoids  Other algorithms do not require an initial number of groups  such as affinity propagation  In a genomic setting this algorithm has been used both to cluster biosynthetic gene clusters in gene cluster families GCF  and to cluster said GCFs             

Workflow edit 
Typically  a workflow for applying machine learning to biological data goes through four steps             

Recording  including capture and storage  In this step  different information sources may be merged into a single set 
Preprocessing  including cleaning and restructuring into a ready to analyze form  In this step  uncorrected data are eliminated or corrected  while missing data maybe imputed and relevant variables chosen 
Analysis  evaluating data using either supervised or unsupervised algorithms  The algorithm is typically trained on a subset of data  optimizing parameters  and evaluated on a separate test subset 
Visualization and interpretation  where knowledge is represented effectively using different methods to assess the significance and importance of the findings 
Data errors edit 
Duplicate data is a significant issue in bioinformatics  Publicly available data may be of uncertain quality             
Errors during experimentation             
Erroneous interpretation             
Typing mistakes             
Non standardized methods   D structure in PDB from multiple sources  X ray diffraction  theoretical modeling  nuclear magnetic resonance  etc   are used in experiments             
Applications edit 
In general  a machine learning system can usually be trained to recognize elements of a certain class given sufficient samples              For example  machine learning methods can be trained to identify specific visual features such as splice sites             
Support vector machines have been extensively used in cancer genomic studies              In addition  deep learning has been incorporated into bioinformatic algorithms  Deep learning applications have been used for regulatory genomics and cellular imaging              Other applications include medical image classification  genomic sequence analysis  as well as protein structure classification and prediction              Deep learning has been applied to regulatory genomics  variant calling and pathogenicity scores              Natural language processing and text mining have helped to understand phenomena including protein protein interaction  gene disease relation as well as predicting biomolecule structures and functions             

Precision personalized medicine edit 
Natural language processing algorithms personalized medicine for patients who suffer genetic diseases  by combining the extraction of clinical information and genomic data available from the patients  Institutes such as Health funded Pharmacogenomics Research Network focus on finding breast cancer treatments             
Precision medicine considers individual genomic variability  enabled by large scale biological databases  Machine learning can be applied to perform the matching function between  groups of patients  and specific treatment modalities             
Computational techniques are used to solve other problems  such as efficient primer design for PCR  biological image analysis and back translation of proteins  which is  given the degeneration of the genetic code  a complex combinatorial problem             

Genomics edit 
The growth of GenBank  a genomic sequence database provided by the National center for Biotechnology Information  NCBI 
While genomic sequence data has historically been sparse due to the technical difficulty of sequencing a piece of DNA  the number of available sequences is growing  On average  the number of bases available in the GenBank public repository has doubled every    months since                    However  while raw data was becoming increasingly available and accessible  As of          update       biological interpretation of this data was occurring at a much slower pace              This made for an increasing need for developing computational genomics tools  including machine learning systems  that can automatically determine the location of protein encoding genes within a given DNA sequence  i e  gene prediction              
Gene prediction is commonly performed through both extrinsic searches and intrinsic searches              For the extrinsic search  the input DNA sequence is run through a large database of sequences whose genes have been previously discovered and their locations annotated and identifying the target sequence s genes by determining which strings of bases within the sequence are homologous to known gene sequences  However  not all the genes in a given input sequence can be identified through homology alone  due to limits in the size of the database of known and annotated gene sequences  Therefore  an intrinsic search is needed where a gene prediction program attempts to identify the remaining genes from the DNA sequence alone             
Machine learning has also been used for the problem of multiple sequence alignment which involves aligning many DNA or amino acid sequences in order to determine regions of similarity that could indicate a shared evolutionary history             It can also be used to detect and visualize genome rearrangements             

Proteomics edit 
A protein s amino acid sequence annotated with the protein secondary structure  Each amino acid is labeled as either an alpha helix  a beta sheet  or a coil 
Proteins  strings of amino acids  gain much of their function from protein folding  where they conform into a three dimensional structure  including the primary structure  the secondary structure  alpha helices and beta sheets   the tertiary structure  and the quaternary structure 
Protein secondary structure prediction is a main focus of this subfield as tertiary and quaternary structures are determined based on the secondary structure             Solving the true structure of a protein is expensive and time intensive  furthering the need for systems that can accurately predict the structure of a protein by analyzing the amino acid sequence directly                        Prior to machine learning  researchers needed to conduct this prediction manually  This trend began in      when Pauling and Corey released their work on predicting the hydrogen bond configurations of a protein from a polypeptide chain              Automatic feature learning reaches an accuracy of                                Recent approaches have utilized deep learning techniques for state of the art secondary structure predictions  For example  DeepCNF  deep convolutional neural fields  achieved an accuracy of approximately     when tasked to classify the amino acids of a protein sequence into one of three structural classes  helix  sheet  or coil               The theoretical limit for three state protein secondary structure is                    In       AlphaFold  an artificial intelligence  AI  program developed by DeepMind  placed first in the overall rankings of the   th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction  CASP   It was particularly successful at predicting the most accurate structures for targets rated as most difficult by the competition organizers  where no existing template structures were available from proteins with partially similar sequences  AlphaFold          repeated this placement in the CASP   competition and achieved a level of accuracy much higher than any other entry                                     
Machine learning has also been applied to proteomics problems such as protein side chain prediction  protein loop modeling  and protein contact map prediction            

Metagenomics edit 
Metagenomics is the study of microbial communities from environmental DNA samples              Currently  limitations and challenges predominate in the implementation of machine learning tools due to the amount of data in environmental samples              Supercomputers and web servers have made access to these tools easier              The high dimensionality of microbiome datasets is a major challenge in studying the microbiome  this significantly limits the power of current approaches for identifying true differences and increases the chance of false discoveries                  better      source      needed     
Despite their importance  machine learning tools related to metagenomics have focused on the study of gut microbiota and the relationship with digestive diseases  such as inflammatory bowel disease  IBD   Clostridioides difficile infection  CDI   colorectal cancer and diabetes  seeking better diagnosis and treatments              Many algorithms were developed to classify microbial communities according to the health condition of the host  regardless of the type of sequence data  e g    S rRNA or whole genome sequencing  WGS   using methods such as least absolute shrinkage and selection operator classifier  random forest  supervised classification model  and gradient boosted tree model  Neural networks  such as recurrent neural networks  RNN   convolutional neural networks  CNN   and Hopfield neural networks have been added              For example  in       Fioravanti et al  developed an algorithm called Ph CNN to classify data samples from healthy patients and patients with IBD symptoms  to distinguish healthy and sick patients  by using phylogenetic trees and convolutional neural networks             
In addition  random forest  RF  methods and implemented importance measures help in the identification of microbiome species that can be used to distinguish diseased and non diseased samples  However  the performance of a decision tree and the diversity of decision trees in the ensemble significantly influence the performance of RF algorithms  The generalization error for RF measures how accurate the individual classifiers are and their interdependence  Therefore  the high dimensionality problems of microbiome datasets pose challenges  Effective approaches require many possible variable combinations  which exponentially increases the computational burden as the number of features increases             
For microbiome analysis in      Dang  amp  Kishino             developed a novel analysis pipeline  The core of the pipeline is an RF classifier coupled with forwarding variable selection  RF FVS   which selects a minimum size core set of microbial species or functional signatures that maximize the predictive classifier performance  The framework combines 

identifying a few significant features by a massively parallel forward variable selection procedure
mapping the selected species on a phylogenetic tree  and
predicting functional profiles by functional gene enrichment analysis from metagenomic   S rRNA data 
They demonstrated performance by analyzing two published datasets from large scale case control studies 

  S rRNA gene amplicon data for C  difficile infection  CDI  and
shotgun metagenomics data for human colorectal cancer  CRC  
The proposed approach improved the accuracy from     to        for CDI and from        to        for CRC 
The use of machine learning in environmental samples has been less explored  maybe because of data complexity  especially from WGS  Some works show that it is possible to apply these tools in environmental samples  In      Dhungel et al               designed an R package called MegaR  This package allows working with   S rRNA and whole metagenomic sequences to make taxonomic profiles and classification models by machine learning models  MegaR includes a comfortable visualization environment to improve the user experience  Machine learning in environmental metagenomics can help to answer questions related to the interactions between microbial communities and ecosystems  e g  the work of Xun et al   in                  where the use of different machine learning methods offered insights on the relationship among the soil  microbiome biodiversity  and ecosystem stability 

Microarrays edit 
Microarrays  a type of lab on a chip  are used for automatically collecting data about large amounts of biological material  Machine learning can aid in analysis  and has been applied to expression pattern identification  classification  and genetic network induction            

A DNA microarray analysis of Burkitt s lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma  DLBCL   which differences in gene expression patterns
This technology is especially useful for monitoring gene expression  aiding in diagnosing cancer by examining which genes are expressed              One of the main tasks is identifying which genes are expressed based on the collected data             In addition  due to the huge number of genes on which data is collected by the microarray  winnowing the large amount of irrelevant data to the task of expressed gene identification is challenging  Machine learning presents a potential solution as various classification methods can be used to perform this identification  The most commonly used methods are radial basis function networks  deep learning  Bayesian classification  decision trees  and random forest             

Systems biology edit 
Systems biology focuses on the study of emergent behaviors from complex interactions of simple biological components in a system  Such components can include DNA  RNA  proteins  and metabolites             
Machine learning has been used to aid in modeling these interactions in domains such as genetic networks  signal transduction networks  and metabolic pathways             Probabilistic graphical models  a machine learning technique for determining the relationship between different variables  are one of the most commonly used methods for modeling genetic networks             In addition  machine learning has been applied to systems biology problems such as identifying transcription factor binding sites using Markov chain optimization             Genetic algorithms  machine learning techniques which are based on the natural process of evolution  have been used to model genetic networks and regulatory structures            
Other systems biology applications of machine learning include the task of enzyme function prediction  high throughput microarray data analysis  analysis of genome wide association studies to better understand markers of disease  protein function prediction             

Evolution edit 
This domain  particularly phylogenetic tree reconstruction  uses the features of machine learning techniques  Phylogenetic trees are schematic representations of the evolution of organisms  Initially  they were constructed using features such as morphological and metabolic features  Later  due to the availability of genome sequences  the construction of the phylogenetic tree algorithm used the concept based on genome comparison  With the help of optimization techniques  a comparison was done by means of multiple sequence alignment             

Stroke diagnosis edit 
Machine learning methods for the analysis of neuroimaging data are used to help diagnose stroke  Historically multiple approaches to this problem involved neural networks                         
Multiple approaches to detect strokes used machine learning  As proposed by Mirtskhulava              feed forward networks were tested to detect strokes using neural imaging  As proposed by Titano              D CNN techniques were tested in supervised classification to screen head CT images for acute neurologic events  Three dimensional CNN and SVM methods are often used             

Text mining edit 
The increase in biological publications increased the difficulty in searching and compiling relevant available information on a given topic  This task is known as knowledge extraction  It is necessary for biological data collection which can then in turn be fed into machine learning algorithms to generate new biological knowledge                         Machine learning can be used for this knowledge extraction task using techniques such as natural language processing to extract the useful information from human generated reports in a database  Text Nailing  an alternative approach to machine learning  capable of extracting features from clinical narrative notes was introduced in      
This technique has been applied to the search for novel drug targets  as this task requires the examination of information stored in biological databases and journals              Annotations of proteins in protein databases often do not reflect the complete known set of knowledge of each protein  so additional information must be extracted from biomedical literature  Machine learning has been applied to the automatic annotation of gene and protein function  determination of the protein subcellular localization  DNA expression array analysis  large scale protein interaction analysis  and molecule interaction analysis             
Another application of text mining is the detection and visualization of distinct DNA regions given sufficient reference data             

Clustering and abundance profiling of biosynthetic gene clusters edit 
Microbial communities are complex assembles of diverse microorganisms              where symbiont partners constantly produce diverse metabolites derived from the primary and secondary  specialized  metabolism  from which metabolism plays an important role in microbial interaction              Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data are an important source for deciphering communications signals 
Molecular mechanisms produce specialized metabolites in various ways  Biosynthetic Gene Clusters  BGCs  attract attention  since several metabolites are clinically valuable  anti microbial  anti fungal  anti parasitic  anti tumor and immunosuppressive agents produced by the modular action of multi enzymatic  multi domains gene clusters  such as Nonribosomal peptide synthetases  NRPSs  and polyketide synthases  PKSs               Diverse studies                                                                                                 show that grouping BGCs that share homologous core genes into gene cluster families  GCFs  can yield useful insights into the chemical diversity of the analyzed strains  and can support linking BGCs to their secondary metabolites                          GCFs have been used as functional markers in human health studies                         and to study the ability of soil to suppress fungal pathogens              Given their direct relationship to catalytic enzymes  and compounds produced from their encoded pathways  BGCs GCFs can serve as a proxy to explore the chemical space of microbial secondary metabolism  Cataloging GCFs in sequenced microbial genomes yields an overview of the existing chemical diversity and offers insights into future priorities                          Tools such as BiG SLiCE and BIG MAP             have emerged with the sole purpose of unveiling the importance of BGCs in natural environments 

Decodification of RiPPs chemical structures edit 
The increase of experimentally characterized ribosomally synthesized and post translationally modified peptides  RiPPs   together with the availability of information on their sequence and chemical structure  selected from databases such as BAGEL  BACTIBASE  MIBIG  and THIOBASE  provide the opportunity to develop machine learning tools to decode the chemical structure and classify them 
In       researchers at the National Institute of Immunology of New Delhi  India  developed RiPPMiner             software  a bioinformatics resource for decoding RiPP chemical structures by genome mining  The RiPPMiner web server consists of a query interface and the RiPPDB database  RiPPMiner defines    subclasses of RiPPs  predicting the cleavage site of the leader peptide and the final cross link of the RiPP chemical structure 

Mass spectral similarity scoring edit 
Many tandem mass spectrometry  MS MS  based metabolomics studies  such as library matching and molecular networking  use spectral similarity as a proxy for structural similarity  Spec vec             algorithm provides a new way of spectral similarity score  based on Word Vec  Spec Vec learns fragmental relationships within a large set of spectral data  in order to assess spectral similarities between molecules and to classify unknown molecules through these comparisons 
For systemic annotation  some metabolomics studies rely on fitting measured fragmentation mass spectra to library spectra or contrasting spectra via network analysis  Scoring functions are used to determine the similarity between pairs of fragment spectra as part of these processes  So far  no research has suggested scores that are significantly different from the commonly utilized cosine based similarity             

Databases edit 
An important part of bioinformatics is the management of big datasets  known as databases of reference  Databases exist for each type of biological data  for example for biosynthetic gene clusters and metagenomes 

General databases by bioinformatics edit 
National Center for Biotechnology Information edit 
The National Center for Biotechnology Information  NCBI              provides a large suite of online resources for biological information and data  including the GenBank nucleic acid sequence database and the PubMed database of citations and abstracts for published life science journals  Augmenting many of the Web applications are custom implementations of the BLAST program optimized to search specialized data sets  Resources include PubMed Data Management  RefSeq Functional Elements  genome data download  variation services API  Magic BLAST  QuickBLASTp  and Identical Protein Groups  All of these resources can be accessed through NCBI             

Bioinformatics analysis for biosynthetic gene clusters edit 
antiSMASH edit 
antiSMASH allows the rapid genome wide identification  annotation and analysis of secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters in bacterial and fungal genomes  It integrates and cross links with a large number of in silico secondary metabolite analysis tools             

gutSMASH edit 
gutSMASH is a tool that systematically evaluates bacterial metabolic potential by predicting both known and novel anaerobic metabolic gene clusters  MGCs  from the gut microbiome 

MIBiG edit 
MIBiG              the minimum information about a biosynthetic gene cluster specification  provides a standard for annotations and metadata on biosynthetic gene clusters and their molecular products  MIBiG is a Genomic Standards Consortium project that builds on the minimum information about any sequence  MIxS  framework             
MIBiG facilitates the standardized deposition and retrieval of biosynthetic gene cluster data as well as the development of comprehensive comparative analysis tools  It empowers next generation research on the biosynthesis  chemistry and ecology of broad classes of societally relevant bioactive secondary metabolites  guided by robust experimental evidence and rich metadata components             

SILVA edit 
SILVA             is an interdisciplinary project among biologists and computers scientists assembling a complete database of RNA ribosomal  rRNA  sequences of genes  both small    S    S  SSU  and large    S    S  LSU  subunits  which belong to the bacteria  archaea and eukarya domains  These data are freely available for academic and commercial use             

Greengenes edit 
Greengenes             is a full length   S rRNA gene database that provides chimera screening  standard alignment and a curated taxonomy based on de novo tree inference                          Overview  

          RNA sequences from        organisms contributed to RNAcentral 
The shortest sequence has       nucleotides  the longest       
The average length is       nucleotides 
Database version       
Open Tree of Life Taxonomy edit 
Open Tree of Life Taxonomy  OTT              aims to build a complete  dynamic  and digitally available Tree of Life by synthesizing published phylogenetic trees along with taxonomic data  Phylogenetic trees have been classified  aligned  and merged  Taxonomies have been used to fill in sparse regions and gaps left by phylogenies  OTT is a base that has been little used for sequencing analyzes of the   S region  however  it has a greater number of sequences classified taxonomically down to the genus level compared to SILVA and Greengenes  However  in terms of classification at the edge level  it contains a lesser amount of information            

Ribosomal Database Project edit 
Ribosomal Database Project  RDP              is a database that provides RNA ribosomal  rRNA  sequences of small subunits of domain bacterial and archaeal    S   and fungal rRNA sequences of large subunits    S
