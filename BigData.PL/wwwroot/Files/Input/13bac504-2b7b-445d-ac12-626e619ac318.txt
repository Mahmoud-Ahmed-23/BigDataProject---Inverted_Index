Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial IntelligenceDate                DurationEight weeksVenueDartmouth College  Hanover  New HampshireOrganised byJohn McCarthy  Marvin Minsky  Nathaniel Rochester  and Claude ShannonParticipantsJohn McCarthy  Marvin Minsky  Nathaniel Rochester  Claude Shannon  and others
The Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence was a      summer workshop widely considered                                  to be the founding event of artificial intelligence as a field             The workshop has been referred to as  the Constitutional Convention of AI              The project s four organizers  those being Claude Shannon  John McCarthy  Nathaniel Rochester and Marvin Minsky  are considered some of the founding fathers of AI                       
The project lasted approximately six to eight weeks and was essentially an extended brainstorming session  Eleven mathematicians and scientists originally planned to attend  not all of them attended  but more than ten others came for short times 


Background edit 
In the early     s  there were various names for the field of  thinking machines   cybernetics  automata theory  and complex information processing             The variety of names suggests the variety of conceptual orientations 
In       John McCarthy  then a young Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Dartmouth College  decided to organize a group to clarify and develop ideas about thinking machines  He picked the name  Artificial Intelligence  for the new field  He chose the name partly for its neutrality  avoiding a focus on narrow automata theory  and avoiding cybernetics which was heavily focused on analog feedback  as well as him potentially having to accept the assertive Norbert Wiener as guru or having to argue with him            
In early       McCarthy approached the Rockefeller Foundation to request funding for a summer seminar at Dartmouth for about    participants  In June  he and Claude Shannon  a founder of information theory then at Bell Labs  met with Robert Morison  Director of Biological and Medical Research to discuss the idea and possible funding  though Morison was unsure whether money would be made available for such a visionary project             
On September          the project was formally proposed by McCarthy  Marvin Minsky  Nathaniel Rochester and Claude Shannon  The proposal is credited with introducing the term  artificial intelligence  
The Proposal states             

We propose that a   month     man study of artificial intelligence be carried out during the summer of      at Dartmouth College in Hanover  New Hampshire  The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it  An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language  form abstractions and concepts  solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans  and improve themselves  We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer 
The proposal goes on to discuss computers  natural language processing  neural networks  theory of computation  abstraction and creativity  these areas within the field of artificial intelligence are considered still relevant to the work of the field              
On May           McCarthy notified Robert Morison of the planned    attendees 
For the full period 

   Dr  Marvin Minsky
   Dr  Julian Bigelow
   Professor D M  Mackay
   Mr  Ray Solomonoff
   Mr  John Holland
   Dr  John McCarthy
For four weeks 

   Dr  Claude Shannon
   Mr  Nathaniel Rochester
   Mr  Oliver Selfridge
For the first two weeks 

    Dr  Allen Newell
    Professor Herbert Simon
He noted   we will concentrate on a problem of devising a way of programming a calculator to form concepts and to form generalizations  This of course is subject to change when the group gets together             
The actual participants came at different times  mostly for much shorter times  Trenchard More replaced Rochester for three weeks and MacKay and Holland did not attend but the project was set to begin  
Around June           the earliest participants  perhaps only Ray Solomonoff  maybe with Tom Etter  arrived at the Dartmouth campus in Hanover  N H   to join John McCarthy who already had an apartment there  Solomonoff and Minsky stayed at Professors  apartments  but most would stay at the Hanover Inn 

Dates edit 
The Dartmouth Workshop is said to have run for six weeks in the summer of                   Ray Solomonoff s notes written during the Workshop  however  say it ran for roughly eight weeks  from about June    to August                 Solomonoff s Dartmouth notes start on June     June    mentions Minsky  June    mentions Hanover  N H   July   mentions Tom Etter  On August     Solomonoff gave a final talk             

Participants edit 
Initially  McCarthy lost his list of attendees  Instead  after the workshop  McCarthy sent Solomonoff a preliminary list of participants and visitors plus those interested in the subject  There were    people listed             
Solomonoff  however  made a complete list in his notes of the summer project

Shannon attended Solomonoff s talk on July    and Bigelow gave a talk on August     Solomonoff doesn t mention Bernard Widrow  but apparently he visited  along with W A  Clark and B G  Farley             Trenchard mentions R  Culver and Solomonoff mentions Bill Shutz  Herb Gelernter didn t attend  but was influenced later by what Rochester learned              
In an article in IEEE Spectrum  Grace Solomonoff additionally identifies Peter Milner on a photo taken by Nathaniel Rochester in front of Dartmouth Hall             
Ray Solomonoff  Marvin Minsky  and John McCarthy were the only three who stayed for the full time  Trenchard took attendance during two weeks of his three week visit  From three to about eight people would attend the daily sessions             

Event and aftermath edit 
They had the entire top floor of the Dartmouth Math Department to themselves  and most weekdays they would meet at the main math classroom where someone might lead a discussion focusing on his ideas  or more frequently  a general discussion would be held 
It was not a directed group research project  discussions covered many topics  but several directions are considered to have been initiated or encouraged by the Workshop  the rise of symbolic methods   systems focused on limited domains  early expert systems   and deductive systems versus inductive systems  One participant  Arthur Samuel  said   It was very interesting  very stimulating  very exciting              
Ray Solomonoff kept notes giving his impression of the talks and the ideas from various discussions
