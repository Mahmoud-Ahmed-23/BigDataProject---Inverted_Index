Type of epistemological problem
For the contemporary music organization  see Other Minds  organization  

The problem of other minds is a philosophical problem traditionally stated as the following epistemological question   Given that I can only observe the behavior of others  how can I know that others have minds              The problem is that knowledge of other minds is always indirect  The problem of other minds does not negatively impact social interactions due to people having a  theory of mind    the ability to spontaneously infer the mental states of others   supported by innate mirror neurons             a theory of mind mechanism             or a tacit theory              There has also been an increase in evidence that behavior results from cognition which in turn requires consciousness and the brain 
It is a problem of the philosophical idea known as solipsism  the notion that for any person only one s own mind is known to exist  The problem of other minds maintains that no matter how sophisticated someone s behavior is  that does not reasonably guarantee that someone has the presence of thought occurring within them as when oneself engages in behavior             Phenomenology studies the subjective experience of human life resulting from consciousness  The specific subject within phenomenology studying other minds is intersubjectivity 
In       Karl Popper suggested that a test for the other minds problem is whether one would seriously argue with the other person or machine              This  I think  would solve the problem of  other minds     In arguing with other people  a thing which we have learnt from other people   for example about other minds  we cannot but attribute to them intentions  and this means mental states  We do not argue with a thermometer  
Philosophers such as Christian List have argued that there exists a connection between the problem of other minds and Benj Hellie s vertiginous question  i e  why people exist as themselves and not as someone else  List argues that there exists a  quadrilemma  for metaphysical consciousness theories where at least one of the following must be false   first person realism    non solipsism    non fragmentation   and  one world              List proposes a philosophical model he calls the  many worlds theory of consciousness  in order to reconcile the subjective nature of consciousness without lapsing into solipsism             Caspar Hare has argued for similar ideas with the concept of egocentric presentism  in which other persons can be conscious  but their experiences are simply not present in the way one s own current experience is                         A related concept is perspectival realism  in which things within perceptual awareness have a defining intrinsic property that exists absolutely and not relative to anything
