Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players in which the aim is to fence off more territory than the opponent  The game was invented in China more than       years ago and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played to the present day                                                         A      survey by the International Go Federation s    member nations found that there are over    million people worldwide who know how to play Go  and over    million current players  the majority of whom live in East Asia            
The playing pieces are called stones  One player uses the white stones and the other black stones  The players take turns placing their stones on the vacant intersections  points  on the board  Once placed  stones may not be moved  but captured stones are immediately removed from the board  A single stone  or connected group of stones  is captured when surrounded by the opponent s stones on all orthogonally adjacent points             The game proceeds until neither player wishes to make another move 
When a game concludes  the winner is determined by counting each player s surrounded territory along with captured stones and komi  points added to the score of the player with the white stones as compensation for playing second              Games may also end by resignation            
The standard Go board has a       grid of lines  containing     points  Beginners often play on smaller     or       boards              and archaeological evidence shows that the game was played in earlier centuries on a board with a       grid  Boards with a       grid had become standard  however  by the time the game reached Korea in the  th century CE and Japan in the  th century CE             
Go was considered one of the four essential arts of the cultured aristocratic Chinese scholars in antiquity  The earliest written reference to the game is generally recognized as the historical annal Zuo Zhuan                          c         th century BCE              
Despite its relatively simple rules  Go is extremely complex  Compared to chess  Go has both a larger board with more scope for play and longer games and  on average  many more alternatives to consider per move  The number of legal board positions in Go has been calculated to be approximately                            a      which is far greater than the number of atoms in the observable universe  which is estimated to be on the order of

Names of the game edit 
The name Go is a short form of the Japanese word igo           which derives from earlier wigo       in turn from Middle Chinese   i gi      Mandarin  w iq   lit         encirclement board game       or  board game of surrounding    In English  the name Go when used for the game is often capitalized to differentiate it from the common word go              In events sponsored by the Ing Chang ki Foundation  it is spelled goe             
The Korean name baduk      is a native derived term  most likely originally consisting of    Yale  p th   cultivated field          Yale  tw lk   stone   presumed dialectal variant of Seoul     tw lh   stone    Less plausible etymologies include a derivation of Badukdok  referring to the playing pieces of the game  or a derivation from Chinese p izi       meaning  to arrange pieces              

Overview edit 
The first     moves of a Go game animated   Click on the board to restart the animation in a larger window  
Go is an adversarial game between two players with the objective of capturing territory  That is  occupying and surrounding a larger total empty area of the board with one s stones than the opponent              As the game progresses  the players place stones on the board creating stone  formations  and enclosing spaces  Once placed  stones are never moved on the board  but when  captured  are removed from the board  Stones are linked together into a formation by being adjacent along the black lines  not on diagonals  of which there are none   Contests between opposing formations are often extremely complex and may result in the expansion  reduction  or wholesale capture and loss of formations and their enclosed empty spaces  called  eyes    Another essential component of the game is control of the sente  that is  controlling the offense  so that one s opponent is forced into defensive moves   this usually changes several times during play 

The illustration  A  displays the four  liberties   adjacent empty points  of a single black stone  Illustrations  B    C   and  D  show White reducing those liberties progressively by one  In  D   when Black has only one liberty left  that stone is under attack and about to be captured and eliminated  a state called atari               White may capture that stone  remove it from the board  with a play on its last liberty  at D    
Initially the board is bare  and players alternate turns to place one stone per turn  As the game proceeds  players try to link their stones together into  living  formations  meaning that they are permanently safe from capture   as well as threaten to capture their opponent s stones and formations  Stones have both offensive and defensive characteristics  depending on the situation 
An essential concept is that a formation of stones must have  or be capable of making  at least two enclosed open points known as eyes to preserve itself from being captured  A formation having at least two eyes cannot be captured  even after it is surrounded by the opponent on the outside              because each eye constitutes a liberty that must be filled by the opponent as the final step in capture  A formation having two or more eyes is said to be unconditionally alive              so it can evade capture indefinitely  and a group that cannot form two eyes is said to be dead and can be captured 
The general strategy is to place stones to fence off territory  attack the opponent s weak groups  trying to kill them so they will be removed   and always stay mindful of the life status of one s own groups                          The liberties of groups are countable  Situations where mutually opposing groups must capture each other or die are called capturing races  or semeai              In a capturing race  the group with more liberties will ultimately be able to capture the opponent s stones                              b      Capturing races and the elements of life or death are the primary challenges of Go 
In the end game players may pass rather than place a stone if they think there are no further opportunities for profitable play              The game ends when both players pass             or when one player resigns  In general  to score the game  each player counts the number of unoccupied points surrounded by their stones and then subtracts the number of stones that were captured by the opponent  The player with the greater score  after adjusting for handicapping called komi  wins the game 
In the opening stages of the game  players typically establish groups of stones  or bases  near the corners and around the sides of the board  usually starting on the third or fourth line in from the board edge rather than at the very edge of the board  The edges and corners make it easier to develop groups which have better options for life  self viability for a group of stones that prevents capture  and establish formations for potential territory              Players usually start near the corners because establishing territory is easier with the aid of two edges of the board              Established corner opening sequences are called joseki and are often studied independently              However  in the mid game  stone groups must also reach in towards the large central area of the board to capture more territory 
Dame are points that lie in between the boundary walls of black and white  and as such are considered to be of no value to either side  Seki are mutually alive pairs of white and black groups where neither has two eyes 
Ko  Chinese and Japanese     is a potentially indefinitely repeated stone capture position  The rules do not allow a board position to be repeated  Therefore  any move which would restore the previous board position would not be allowed  and the next player would be forced to play somewhere else  If the play requires a strategic response by the first player  further changing the board  then the second player could  retake the ko   and the first player would be in the same situation of needing to change the board before trying to take the ko back  And so on              Some of these ko fights may be important and decide the life of a large group  while others may be worth just one or two points  Some ko fights are referred to as picnic kos when only one side has a lot to lose              In Japanese  it is called a hanami ko             
Playing with others usually requires a knowledge of each player s strength  indicated by the player s rank  increasing from         kyu to        kyu  then        dan to        dan  then        dan pro to        dan pro   A difference in rank may be compensated by a handicap Black is allowed to place two or more stones on the board to compensate for White s greater strength                          There are different rulesets  Korean  Japanese  Chinese  AGA  etc    which are almost entirely equivalent  except for certain special case positions and the method of scoring at the end

Main article  Go terms
Basic strategic aspects include the following 

Connection  Keeping one s own stones connected means that fewer groups need to make living shape  and one has fewer groups to defend 
Cut  Keeping opposing stones disconnected means that the opponent needs to defend and make living shape for more groups 
Stay alive  The simplest way to stay alive is to establish a foothold in the corner or along one of the sides  At a minimum  a group must have two eyes  separate open points  to be alive             An opponent cannot fill in either eye  as any such move is suicidal and prohibited in the rules 
Mutual life  seki  is better than dying  A situation in which neither player can play on a particular point without then allowing the other player to play at another point to capture  The most common example is that of adjacent groups that share their last few liberties if either player plays in the shared liberties  they can reduce their own group to a single liberty  putting themselves in atari   allowing their opponent to capture it on the next move 
Death  A group that lacks living shape is eventually removed from the board as captured 
Invasion  Set up a new living group inside an area where the opponent has greater influence  means one reduces the opponent s score in proportion to the area one occupies 
Reduction  Placing a stone far enough into the opponent s area of influence to reduce the amount of territory they eventually get  but not so far that it can be cut off from friendly stones outside 
Sente  A play that forces one s opponent to respond  gote   A player who can regularly play sente has the initiative and can control the flow of the game 
Sacrifice  Allowing a group to die in order to carry out a play  or plan  in a more important area 
The strategy involved can become very abstract and complex  High level players spend years improving their understanding of strategy  and a novice may play many hundreds of games against opponents before being able to win regularly 

Strategy edit 
Main article  Go strategy and tactics
Strategy deals with global influence  the interaction between distant stones  keeping the whole board in mind during local fights  and other issues that involve the overall game  It is therefore possible to allow a tactical loss when it confers a strategic advantage      citation needed     
Novices often start by randomly placing stones on the board  as if it were a game of chance  An understanding of how stones connect for greater power develops  and then a few basic common opening sequences may be understood  Learning the ways of life and death helps in a fundamental way to develop one s strategic understanding of weak groups      c      A player who both plays aggressively and can handle adversity is said to display kiai  or fighting spirit  in the game 

Opening strategy edit 
Main article  Go opening
In the opening of the game  players usually play and gain territory in the corners of the board first  as the presence of two edges makes it easier for them to surround territory and establish the eyes they need              From a secure position in a corner  it is possible to lay claim to more territory by extending along the side of the board              The opening is the most theoretically difficult part of the game and takes a large proportion of professional players  thinking time                          The first stone played at a corner of the board is generally placed on the third or fourth line from the edge  Players tend to play on or near the     star point during the opening  Playing nearer to the edge does not produce enough territory to be efficient  and playing further from the edge does not safely secure the territory             
In the opening  players often play established sequences called joseki  which are locally balanced exchanges              however  the joseki chosen should also produce a satisfactory result on a global scale  It is generally advisable to keep a balance between territory and influence  Which of these gets precedence is often a matter of individual taste 

Middlegame and endgame edit 
The middle phase of the game is the most combative  and usually lasts for more than     moves  During the middlegame  the players invade each other s territories  and attack formations that lack the necessary two eyes for viability  Such groups may be saved or sacrificed for something more significant on the board              It is possible that one player may succeed in capturing a large weak group of the opponent s  which often proves decisive and ends the game by a resignation  However  matters may be more complex yet  with major trade offs  apparently dead groups reviving  and skillful play to attack in such a way as to construct territories rather than kill             
The end of the middlegame and transition to the endgame is marked by a few features  Near the end of a game  play becomes divided into localized fights that do not affect each other              with the exception of ko fights  where previously  the central area of the board related to all parts of it  No large weak groups are still in serious danger  Moves can reasonably be attributed some definite value  such as    points or fewer  rather than simply being necessary to compete  Both players set limited objectives in their plans  in making or destroying territory  capturing or saving stones  These changing aspects of the game usually occur at much the same time  for strong players  In brief  the middlegame switches into the endgame when the concepts of strategy and influence need reassessment in terms of concrete final results on the board 

Rules edit 
Main article  Rules of Go
Aside from the order of play  alternating moves  Black moves first or takes a handicap  and scoring rules  there are essentially only two rules in Go 

Liberty rule states that every stone remaining on the board must have at least one open point  a liberty  directly orthogonally adjacent  up  down  left  or right   or must be part of a connected group that has at least one such open point  liberty  next to it  Stones or groups of stones which lose their last liberty are removed from the board 
Repetition Rule  the ko rule  states that a stone on the board must never immediately repeat a previous position of a captured stone  thus only a move elsewhere on the board is permitted that turn  Since without this rule such a pattern of the two players repeating their prior moves  capturing stones in same places  could continue indefinitely  this rule prevents a stalemate 
Almost all other information about how the game is played is heuristic  meaning it is learned information about how the patterns of the stones on the board function  rather than a rule  Other rules are specialized  as they come about through different rulesets  but the above two rules cover almost all of any played game 
Although there are some minor differences between rulesets used in different countries              most notably in Chinese and Japanese scoring rules              these differences do not greatly affect the tactics and strategy of the game 
Except where noted  the basic rules presented here are valid independent of the scoring rules used  The scoring rules are explained separately  Go terms for which there is no ready English equivalent are commonly called by their Japanese names 

Basic rules edit 
One black chain and two white chains  with their liberties marked with dots  Liberties are shared among all stones of a chain and can be counted  Here the black group has   liberties  while the two white chains have   liberties each 
The two players  Black and White  take turns placing stones of their color on the intersections of the board  one stone at a time  The usual board size is a       grid  but for beginners or for playing quick games              the smaller board sizes of                   and     are also popular             
The board is empty to begin with              Black plays first unless given a handicap of two or more stones  in which case White plays first  The players may choose any unoccupied intersection to play on except for those forbidden by the ko and suicide rules  see below   Once played  a stone can never be moved and can be taken off the board only if it is captured              A player may pass their turn  declining to place a stone  though this is usually only done at the end of the game when both players believe nothing more can be accomplished with further play  When both players pass consecutively  the game ends             and is then scored 

Liberties and capture edit 
The Black stone group has only one liberty  at point A   so it is very vulnerable to capture  If Black plays at A  the chain would then have   liberties  and so is much safer  However  if White plays at A first  the Black chain loses its last liberty  and thus it is captured and immediately removed from the board  leaving White s stones as shown to the right 
Vertically and horizontally adjacent stones of the same color form a chain  also called a string or group               forming a discrete unit that cannot then be divided              Only stones connected to one another by the lines on the board create a chain  stones that are diagonally adjacent are not connected  Chains may be expanded by placing additional stones on adjacent intersections  and they can be connected together by placing a stone on an intersection that is adjacent to two or more chains of the same color             
A vacant point adjacent to a stone  along one of the grid lines of the board  is called a liberty for that stone                          Stones in a chain share their liberties              A chain of stones must have at least one liberty to remain on the board  When a chain is surrounded by opposing stones so that it has no liberties  it is captured and removed from the board             


Ko rule edit 
Main article  Ko fight




























































An example of a situation in which the ko rule applies




Players are not allowed to make a move that returns the game to the immediately prior position  This rule  called the ko rule  prevents unending repetition  a stalemate               As shown in the example pictured  White had a stone where the red circle was  and Black has just captured it by playing a stone at    so the White stone has been removed   However  it is readily apparent that now Black s stone at   is immediately threatened by the three surrounding White stones  If White were allowed to play again on the red circle  it would return the situation to the original one  but the ko rule forbids that kind of endless repetition  Thus  White is forced to move elsewhere  or pass  If White wants to recapture Black s stone at    White must attack Black somewhere else on the board so forcefully that Black moves elsewhere to counter that  giving White that chance  If White s forcing move is successful  it is termed  gaining the sente   if Black responds elsewhere on the board  then White can retake Black s stone at    and the ko continues  but this time Black must move elsewhere  A repetition of such exchanges is called a ko fight              To stop the potential for ko fights  two stones of the same color would need to be added to the group  making either a group of   Black or   White stones 
While the various rulesets agree on the ko rule prohibiting returning the board to an immediately previous position  they deal in different ways with the relatively uncommon situation in which a player might recreate a past position that is further removed  See Rules of Go        Repetition for further information 

Suicide edit 
Under normal rules  White cannot play at A because that point has no liberties  Under the Ing             and New Zealand rules              White may play A  a suicide stone that kills itself and the two neighboring white stones  leaving an empty three space eye  Black naturally answers by playing at A  creating two eyes to live 
A player may not place a stone such that it or its group immediately has no liberties unless doing so immediately deprives an enemy group of its final liberty  In the second case  the enemy group is captured  leaving the new stone with at least one liberty  so the new stone can be placed              This rule is responsible for the all important difference between one and two eyes  if a group with only one eye is fully surrounded on the outside  it can be killed with a stone placed in its single eye   An eye is an empty point or group of points surrounded by a group of stones  
The Ing and New Zealand rules do not have this rule              and there a player might destroy one of its own groups  commit suicide   This play would only be useful in limited sets of situations involving a small interior space or planning              In the example at right  it may be useful as a ko threat 

Komi edit 
Main article  Komi  Go 
Because Black has the advantage of playing the first move  the idea of awarding White some compensation came into being during the   th century  This is called komi  which gives white a     point compensation under Japanese rules      point under Korean rules  and      stones  or     point under Chinese rules  number of points varies by rule set               Under handicap play  White receives only a     point komi  to break a possible tie  jigo  

Scoring rules edit 
A simplified game at its end  Black s territory  A     C  and prisoners  D  is counted and compared to White s territory  B  only  no prisoners   In this example  both Black and White attempted to invade and live  C and D groups  to reduce the other s total territory  Only Black s invading group  C  was successful in living  as White s group  D  was killed with a black stone at  E   The points in the middle  F  are dame  meaning they belong to neither player 
Two general types of scoring procedures are used  and players determine which to use before play  Both procedures almost always give the same winner 

Area scoring procedure  including Chinese   counts the number of points a player s stones occupy and surround  It is associated with contemporary Chinese play and was probably established there during the Ming dynasty in the   th or   th century              Beginner friendly  but takes longer to count  A player s score is the number of stones that the player has on the board  plus the number of empty intersections surrounded by that player s stones  If there is disagreement about which stones are dead  then under area scoring rules  the players simply resume play to resolve the matter  The score is computed using the position after the next time the players pass consecutively 
Territory scoring procedure  including Japanese and Korean   counts the number of empty points a player s stones surround  together with the number of stones the player captured  In the course of the game  each player retains the stones they capture  termed prisoners  Any dead stones removed at the end of the game become prisoners  The score is the number of empty points enclosed by a player s stones  plus the number of prisoners captured by that player      d      Under territory scoring there can be an extra penalty for playing inside ones  territory  so if there is a disagreement extra play to resolve it would  in tournament settings  happen on a separate board  where the player claiming a group is dead would play first  and would demonstrate how to capture those stones  For further information  see Rules of Go 
Both procedures are counted after both players have passed consecutively  the stones that are still on the board but unable to avoid capture  called dead stones  are removed  Given that the number of stones a player has on the board is directly related to the number of prisoners their opponent has taken  the resulting net score  that is  the difference between Black s and White s scores is identical under both rulesets  unless the players have passed different numbers of times during the course of the game   Thus  the net result given by the two scoring systems rarely differs by more than a point             

Life and death edit 
See also  Life and death
While not actually mentioned in the rules of Go  at least in simpler rule sets  such as those of New Zealand and the U S    the concept of a living group of stones is necessary for a practical understanding of the game             

















































































































































































Examples of eyes  marked   The black groups at the top of the board are alive  as they have at least two eyes  The black groups at the bottom are dead as they only have one eye  The point marked a is a false eye  thus the black group with false eye a can be killed by white in two turns 




When a group of stones is mostly surrounded and has no options to connect with friendly stones elsewhere  the status of the group is either alive  dead or unsettled  A group of stones is said to be alive if it cannot be captured  even if the opponent is allowed to move first  Conversely  a group of stones is said to be dead if it cannot avoid capture  even if the owner of the group is allowed the first move  Otherwise  the group is said to be unsettled  the defending player can make it alive or the opponent can kill it  depending on who gets to play first             
An eye is an empty point or group of points surrounded by a group of stones  If the eye is surrounded by Black stones  White cannot play there unless such a play would take Black s last liberty and capture the Black stones   Such a move is forbidden according to the suicide rule in most rule sets  but even if not forbidden  such a move would be a useless suicide of a White stone  
If a Black group has two eyes  White can never capture it because White cannot remove both liberties simultaneously  If Black has only one eye  White can capture the Black group by playing in the single eye  removing Black s last liberty  Such a move is not suicide because the Black stones are removed first  In the  Examples of eyes  diagram  all the circled points are eyes  The two black groups in the upper corners are alive  as both have at least two eyes  The groups in the lower corners are dead  as both have only one eye  The group in the lower left may seem to have two eyes  but the surrounded empty point marked a is not actually an eye  White can play there and take a black stone  Such a point is often called a false eye             

Seki  mutual life  edit 
Example of seki  mutual life   Neither Black nor White can play on the marked points without reducing their own liberties for those groups to one  self atari  
There is an exception to the requirement that a group must have two eyes to be alive  a situation called seki  or mutual life   Where different colored groups are adjacent and share liberties  the situation may reach a position when neither player wants to move first because doing so would allow the opponent to capture  in such situations therefore both players  stones remain on the board  in seki   Neither player receives any points for those groups  but at least those groups themselves remain living  as opposed to being captured      e     
Seki can occur in many ways  The simplest are 

each player has a group without eyes and they share two liberties  and
each player has a group with one eye and they share one more liberty 
In the  Example of seki  mutual life   diagram  the two circled points are liberties shared by both a black and a white group  Both of these interior groups are at risk  and neither player wants to play on a circled point  because doing so would allow the opponent to capture their group on the next move  The outer groups in this example  both black and white  are alive  Seki can result from an attempt by one player to invade and kill a nearly settled group of the other player             

Tactics edit 
Main article  Go strategy and tactics
Tactics deal with immediate fighting between stones  capturing and saving stones  life  death and other issues localized to a specific part of the board  Larger issues which encompass the territory of the entire board and planning stone group connections are referred to as Strategy and are covered in the Strategy section above 

Capturing tactics edit 
There are several tactical constructs aimed at capturing stones              These are among the first things a player learns after understanding the rules  Recognizing the possibility that stones can be captured using these techniques is an important step forward 

















































































































































































A ladder  Black cannot escape unless the ladder connects to black stones further down the board that will intercept with the ladder or if one of white s pieces has only one liberty 




The most basic technique is the ladder              This is also sometimes called a  running attack   since it unfolds as one player trying to outrun the other s attack  To capture stones in a ladder  a player uses a constant series of capture threats  atari   giving the opponent only one place to place his stone to keep his group alive  This forces the opponent to move into a zigzag pattern  surrounding the ladder on the outside  as shown in the adjacent diagram to keep the attack coming  Unless the pattern runs into friendly stones along the way  the stones in the ladder cannot avoid capture  However  if the ladder can run into other black stones  thus saving them  then experienced players recognize the futility of continuing the attack  These stones can also be saved if a suitably strong threat can be forced elsewhere on the board  so that two Black stones can be placed here to save the group 

















































































































































































A net  The chain of three marked Black stones cannot escape in any direction  since each Black stone attempting to extend the chain outward  on the red circles  can be easily blocked by one White stone 




Another technique to capture stones is the so called net              also known by its Japanese name  geta  This refers to a move that loosely surrounds some stones  preventing their escape in all directions  An example is given in the adjacent diagram  It is often better to capture stones in a net than in a ladder  because a net does not depend on the condition that there are no opposing stones in the way  nor does it allow the opponent to play a strategic ladder breaker  However  the ladder only requires one turn to kill all the opponent s stones  whereas a net requires more turns to do the same 

















































































































































































A snapback  Although Black can capture the white stone by playing at the circled point  the resulting shape for Black has only one liberty  at     thus White can then capture the three black stones by playing at   again  snapback  




A third technique to capture stones is the snapback              In a snapback  one player allows a single stone to be captured  then immediately plays on the point formerly occupied by that stone  by so doing  the player captures a larger group of their opponent s stones  in effect snapping back at those stones  An example can be seen on the right  As with the ladder  an experienced player does not play out such a sequence  recognizing the futility of capturing only to be captured back immediately 

Reading ahead edit 
One of the most important skills required for strong tactical play is the ability to read ahead              Reading ahead includes considering available moves to play  the possible responses to each move  and the subsequent possibilities after each of those responses  Some of the strongest players of the game can read up to    moves ahead even in complicated positions             
As explained in the scoring rules  some stone formations can never be captured and are said to be alive  while other stones may be in a position where they cannot avoid being captured and are said to be dead  Much of the practice material available to players of the game comes in the form of life and death problems  also known as tsumego              In such problems  players are challenged to find the vital move sequence that kills a group of the opponent or saves a group of their own  Tsumego are considered an excellent way to train a player s ability at reading ahead              and are available for all skill levels  some posing a challenge even to top players 

Ko fighting edit 
A simplified ko fight on a     board  The ko is at the point marked with a square Black has  taken the ko  first  The ko fight determines the life of the A and B groups only one survives and the other is captured  White may play C as a ko threat  and Black properly answers at D  White can then take the ko by playing at the square marked point  capturing the one black stone   E is a possible ko threat for Black 
In situations when the Ko rule applies  a ko fight may occur              If the player who is prohibited from capture is of the opinion that the capture is important because it prevents a large group of stones from being captured for instance  the player may play a ko threat              This is a move elsewhere on the board that threatens to make a large profit if the opponent does not respond  If the opponent does respond to the ko threat  the situation on the board has changed  and the prohibition on capturing the ko no longer applies  Thus the player who made the ko threat may now recapture the ko  Their opponent is then in the same situation and can either play a ko threat as well or concede the ko by simply playing elsewhere  If a player concedes the ko  either because they do not think it important or because there are no moves left that could function as a ko threat  they have lost the ko  and their opponent may connect the ko 
Instead of responding to a ko threat  a player may also choose to ignore the threat and connect the ko              They thereby win the ko  but at a cost  The choice of when to respond to a threat and when to ignore it is a subtle one  which requires a player to consider many factors  including how much is gained by connecting  how much is lost by not responding  how many possible ko threats both players have remaining  what the optimal order of playing them is  and what the size points lost or gained of each of the remaining threats is             
Frequently  the winner of the ko fight does not connect the ko but instead captures one of the chains that constituted their opponent s side of the ko              In some cases  this leads to another ko fight at a neighboring location

Origin in China edit 
The earliest written reference to the game is generally recognized as the historical annal Zuo Zhuan                          c         th century BCE               referring to a historical event of          BCE  It is also mentioned in Book XVII of the Analects of Confucius             and in two books written by Mencius                          c         rd century BCE               In all of these works  the game is referred to as y       Today  in China  it is known as weiqi  simplified Chinese          traditional Chinese          pinyin      w iq    Wade Giles      wei ch i   lit         encirclement board game  
Go was originally played on a       line grid  but a       grid became standard by the time of the Tang dynasty          CE               Legends trace the origin of the game to the mythical Chinese emperor Yao            BCE   who was said to have had his counselor Shun design it for his unruly son  Danzhu  to favorably influence him                          Other theories suggest that the game was derived from Chinese tribal warlords and generals  who used pieces of stone to map out attacking positions                         
In China  Go had an important status among elites and was associated with ideas of self cultivation  wisdom  and gentlemanly ideals                                   It was considered one of the four cultivated arts of the Chinese scholar gentleman  along with calligraphy  painting and playing the musical instrument guqin              In ancient times the rules of Go were passed on verbally  rather than being written down

Spread to Korea and Japan edit 
Go was introduced to Korea sometime between the  th and  th centuries CE  and was popular among the higher classes  In Korea  the game is called baduk  Korean                and a variant of the game called Sunjang baduk was developed by the   th century  Sunjang baduk became the main variant played in Korea until the end of the   th century  when the current version was reintroduced from Japan                         
The game reached Japan in the  th century CE where it is called go     or igo       It became popular at the Japanese imperial court in the  th century              and among the general public by the   th century              The game was further formalized in the   th century  In       Tokugawa Ieyasu re established Japan s unified national government  In the same year  he assigned the then best player in Japan  a Buddhist monk named Nikkai  n  Kan  Yosaburo         to the post of Godokoro  Minister of Go              
Nikkai took the name Hon inb  Sansa and founded the Hon inb  Go school              Several competing schools were founded soon after              These officially recognized and subsidized Go schools greatly developed the level of play and introduced the dan kyu style system of ranking players              Players from the four schools  Hon inb   Yasui  Inoue and Hayashi  competed in the annual castle games  played in the presence of the sh gun

Internationalization edit 
Despite its widespread popularity in East Asia  Go has been slow to spread to the rest of the world  Although there are some mentions of the game in western literature from the   th century forward  Go did not start to become popular in the West until the end of the   th century  when German scientist Oskar Korschelt wrote a treatise on the game              By the early   th century  Go had spread throughout the German and Austro Hungarian empires  In       Edward Lasker learned the game while in Berlin  When he moved to New York  Lasker founded the New York Go Club together with  amongst others  Arthur Smith  who had learned of the game in Japan while touring the East and had published the book The Game of Go in                   Lasker s book Go and Go moku        helped spread the game throughout the U S               and in       the American Go Association was formed  Two years later  in       the German Go Association was founded 
World War II put a stop to most Go activity  since it was a popular game in Japan  but after the war  Go continued to spread              For most of the   th century  the Japan Go Association  Nihon Ki in  played a leading role in spreading Go outside East Asia by publishing the English language magazine Go Review in the     s  establishing Go centers in the U S   Europe and South America  and often sending professional teachers on tour to Western nations              Internationally  the game had been commonly known since the start of the twentieth century by its shortened Japanese name  and terms for common Go concepts are derived from their Japanese pronunciation 
In       NASA astronaut Daniel Barry and Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata became the first people to play Go in space  They used a special Go set  which was named Go Space  designed by Wai Cheung Willson Chow  Both astronauts were awarded honorary dan ranks by the Nihon Ki in              
As of December               update       the International Go Federation has    member countries  with    member countries outside East Asia               Chinese cultural centres across the world are promoting Go  and cooperating with local Go associations  for example the seminars held by the Chinese cultural centre in Tel Aviv  Israel  together with the Israeli Go association

In Go  rank indicates a player s skill in the game  Traditionally  ranks are measured using kyu and dan grades               a system also adopted by many martial arts  More recently  mathematical rating systems similar to the Elo rating system have been introduced               Such rating systems often provide a mechanism for converting a rating to a kyu or dan grade               Kyu grades  abbreviated k  are considered student grades and decrease as playing level increases  meaning  st kyu is the strongest available kyu grade  Dan grades  abbreviated d  are considered master grades  and increase from  st dan to  th dan  First dan equals a black belt in eastern martial arts using this system  The difference among each amateur rank is one handicap stone  For example  if a  k plays a game with a  k  the  k would need a handicap of four stones to even the odds  Top level amateur players sometimes defeat professionals in tournament play               Professional players have professional dan ranks  abbreviated p   These ranks are separate from amateur ranks

Tournament and match rules edit 
See also  Go competitions
Tournament and match rules deal with factors that may influence the game but are not part of the actual rules of play  Such rules may differ between events  Rules that influence the game include  the setting of compensation points  komi   handicap  and time control parameters  Rules that do not generally influence the game are the tournament system  pairing strategies  and placement criteria 
Common tournament systems used in Go include the McMahon system               Swiss system  league systems and the knockout system  Tournaments may combine multiple systems  many professional Go tournaments use a combination of the league and knockout systems              
Tournament rules may also set the following 

compensation points  called komi  which compensate the second player for the first move advantage of their opponent  tournaments commonly use a compensation in the range of     points               generally including a half point to prevent draws 
handicap stones placed on the board before alternate play  allowing players of different strengths to play competitively  see Go handicap for more information   and
superko  Although the basic ko rule described above covers more than     of all cycles occurring in games               there are some complex situations triple ko  eternal life      f      etc  that are not covered by it but would allow the game to cycle indefinitely  To prevent this  the ko rule is sometimes extended to forbid the repetition of any previous position  This extension is called superko              
Time control edit 
See also  Time control and Byoyomi
A game of Go may be timed using a game clock  Formal time controls were introduced into the professional game during the     s and were controversial               Adjournments and sealed moves began to be regulated in the     s  Go tournaments use a number of different time control systems  All common systems envisage a single main period of time for each player for the game  but they vary on the protocols for continuation  in overtime  after a player has finished that time allowance      g      The most widely used time control system is the so called byoyomi     h      system  The top professional Go matches have timekeepers so that the players do not have to press their own clocks 
Two widely used variants of the byoyomi system are              

Standard byoyomi  After the main time is depleted  a player has a certain number of time periods  typically around thirty seconds   After each move  the number of full time periods that the player took  often zero  is subtracted  For example  if a player has three thirty second time periods and takes thirty or more  but less than sixty  seconds to make a move  they lose one time period  With            seconds  they lose two time periods  and so on  If  however  they take less than thirty seconds  the timer simply resets without subtracting any periods  Using up the last period means that the player has lost on time 
Canadian byoyomi  After using all of their main time  a player must make a certain number of moves within a certain period of time  such as twenty moves within five minutes                   i      If the time period expires without the required number of stones having been played  then the player has lost on time      j     
Notation and recording games edit 
Main article  Go game record
Go games are recorded with a simple coordinate system  This is comparable to algebraic chess notation  except that Go stones do not move and thus require only one coordinate per turn  Coordinate systems include purely numerical      point   hybrid  K    and purely alphabetical               The Smart Game Format uses alphabetical coordinates internally  but most editors represent the board with hybrid coordinates as this reduces confusion 
Alternatively  the game record can also be noted by writing the successive moves on a diagram  where odd numbers mean black stones  even numbers mean white stones  or conversely when playing with a handicap   and a notation like         in the margin means that the   th stone was played at the same location as the   nd one  which had been captured in the meantime 
The Japanese word kifu is sometimes used to refer to a game record

A Go professional is a professional player of the game of Go  There are six areas with professional go associations  these are  China  Chinese Weiqi Association   Japan  Nihon Ki in  Kansai Ki in   South Korea  Korea Baduk Association   Taiwan  Taiwan Chi Yuan Culture Foundation   the United States  AGA Professional System  and Europe  European Professional System  
Although the game was developed in China  the establishment of the Four Go houses by Tokugawa Ieyasu at the start of the   th century shifted the focus of the Go world to Japan  State sponsorship  allowing players to dedicate themselves full time to study of the game  and fierce competition between individual houses resulted in a significant increase in the level of play  During this period  the best player of his generation was given the prestigious title Meijin  master  and the post of Godokoro  minister of Go   Of special note are the players who were dubbed Kisei  Go Sage   The only three players to receive this honor were D saku  J wa and Sh saku  all of the house Hon inb               

 Hon inb  Sh sai  left   last head of house Hon inb   plays against then up and coming Go Seigen in the game of the century  
After the end of the Tokugawa shogunate and the Meiji Restoration period  the Go houses slowly disappeared  and in       the Nihon Ki in  Japanese Go Association  was formed  Top players from this period often played newspaper sponsored matches of      games               Of special note are the  Chinese born  player Go Seigen  Chinese  Wu Qingyuan   who scored     in these matches and beat down most of his opponents to inferior handicaps               and Minoru Kitani  who dominated matches in the early     s               These two players are also recognized for their groundbreaking work on new opening theory  Shinfuseki               

For much of the   th century  Go continued to be dominated by players trained in Japan  Notable names included Eio Sakata  Rin Kaiho  born in Taiwan   Masao Kato  Koichi Kobayashi and Cho Chikun  born Cho Ch i hun  from South Korea                Top Chinese and Korean talents often moved to Japan  because the level of play there was high and funding was more lavish  One of the first Korean players to do so was Cho Namchul  who studied in the Kitani Dojo            After his return to Korea  the Hanguk Kiwon  Korea Baduk Association  was formed and caused the level of play in South Korea to rise significantly in the second half of the   th century               In China  the game declined during the Cultural Revolution             but quickly recovered in the last quarter of the   th century  bringing Chinese players  such as Nie Weiping and Ma Xiaochun  on par with their Japanese and South Korean counterparts               The Chinese Weiqi Association  today part of the China Qiyuan  was established in       and professional dan grades started being issued in                    Western professional Go began in      with the American Go Association s Professional System               In       the European Go Federation followed suit and started their professional system               South Korean player Lee Chang ho plays against Russian player Alexandre Dinerchtein  seven time European Champion and one of the few non East Asian players to reach professional status 
With the advent of major international titles from      onward  it became possible to compare the level of players from different countries more accurately  Cho Hunhyun of South Korea won the first edition of the Quadrennial Ing Cup in       His disciple Lee Chang ho was the dominant player in international Go competitions for more than a decade spanning much of     s and early     s  he is also credited with groundbreaking works on the endgame  Cho  Lee and other South Korean players such as Seo Bong soo  Yoo Changhyuk and Lee Sedol between them won the majority of international titles in this period               Several Chinese players also rose to the top in international Go from     s  most notably Ma Xiaochun  Chang Hao  Gu Li and Ke Jie  As of          update       Japan lags behind in the international Go scene 
Historically  more men than women have played Go  Special tournaments for women exist  but until recently  men and women did not compete together at the highest levels  however  the creation of new  open tournaments and the rise of strong female players  most notably Rui Naiwei  have in recent years highlighted the strength and competitiveness of emerging female players              
The level in other countries has traditionally been much lower  except for some players who had preparatory professional training in East Asia      k      Knowledge of the game has been scant elsewhere up until the   th century  A famous player of the     s was Edward Lasker      l      It was not until the     s that more than a few Western players took up the game as other than a passing interest  In       Manfred Wimmer became the first Westerner to receive a professional player s certificate from an East Asian professional Go association               In       American Michael Redmond became the first Western player to achieve a   dan rank 

Equipment edit 
Main article  Go equipment
Go portrayed as part of East Asian culture   The goblet in the middle is from the Nihon Ki in  
It is possible to play Go with a simple paper board and coins  plastic tokens  or white beans and coffee beans for the stones  or even by drawing the stones on the board and erasing them when captured  More popular midrange equipment includes cardstock  a laminated particle board  or wood boards with stones of plastic or glass  More expensive traditional materials are still used by many players  The most expensive Go sets have black stones carved from slate and white stones carved from translucent white shells  traditionally Meretrix lamarckii   played on boards carved in a single piece from the trunk of a tree 

Traditional equipment edit

Boards edit 
The Go board  generally referred to by its Japanese name goban     typically measures between    and         cm     and         in  in length  from one player s side to the other  and    to         cm               to                   in  in width  Chinese boards are slightly larger  as a traditional Chinese Go stone is slightly larger to match  The board is not square  there is a       ratio in length to width  because with a perfectly square board  from the player s viewing angle the perspective creates a foreshortening of the board  The added length compensates for this               There are two main types of boards  a table board similar in most respects to other gameboards like that used for chess  and a floor board  which is its own free standing table and at which the players sit 
The traditional Japanese goban is between    and         cm      and          in  thick and has legs  it sits on the floor  see picture                It is preferably made from the rare golden tinged Kaya tree  Torreya nucifera   with the very best made from Kaya trees up to          years old  More recently  the related California Torreya  Torreya californica  has been prized for its light color and pale rings as well as its reduced expense and more readily available stock  The natural resources of Japan have been unable to keep up with the enormous demand for the slow growing Kaya trees  both T  nucifera and T  californica take many hundreds of years to grow to the necessary size  and they are now extremely rare  raising the price of such equipment tremendously               As Kaya trees are a protected species in Japan  they cannot be harvested until they have died  Thus  an old growth  floor standing Kaya goban can easily cost in excess of         with the highest quality examples costing more than                      
Other  less expensive woods often used to make quality table boards in both Chinese and Japanese dimensions include Hiba  Thujopsis dolabrata   Katsura  Cercidiphyllum japonicum   Kauri  Agathis   and Shin Kaya  various varieties of spruce  commonly from Alaska  Siberia and China s Yunnan Province                So called Shin Kaya is a potentially confusing merchant s term  shin means  new   and thus shin kaya is best translated  faux kaya   because the woods so described are biologically unrelated to Kaya              

Stones edit 
A full set of Go stones  goishi  usually contains     black stones and     white ones  a       grid has     points  so there are enough stones to cover the board  and Black gets the extra odd stone because that player goes first  However it may happen  especially in beginners  games  that many back and forth captures empty the bowls before the end of the game  in that case an exchange of prisoners allows the game to continue 
Traditional Japanese stones are double convex  and made of clamshell  white  and slate  black                The classic slate is nachiguro stone mined in Wakayama Prefecture and the clamshell from the Hamaguri clam  Meretrix lusoria  or the Korean hard clam  however  due to a scarcity in the Japanese supply of these clams  the stones are most often made of shells harvested from Mexico               Historically  the most prized stones were made of jade  often given to the reigning emperor as a gift              
In China  the game is traditionally played with single convex stones              made of a composite called Yunzi  The material comes from Yunnan Province and is made by sintering a proprietary and trade secret mixture of mineral compounds derived from the local stone  This process dates to the Tang dynasty and  after the knowledge was lost in the     s during the Chinese Civil War  was rediscovered in the     s by the now state run Yunzi company  The material is praised for its colors  its pleasing sound as compared to glass or to synthetics such as melamine  and its lower cost as opposed to other materials such as slate shell  The term yunzi can also refer to a single convex stone made of any material  however  most English language Go suppliers specify Yunzi as a material and single convex as a shape to avoid confusion  as stones made of Yunzi are also available in double convex while synthetic stones can be either shape 
Traditional stones are made so that black stones are slightly larger in diameter than white  this is to compensate for the optical illusion created by contrasting colors that would make equal sized white stones appear larger on the board than black stones                   m     

An example of single convex stones and Go Seigen bowls  These particular stones are made of Yunzi material  and the bowls of jujube wood 
Bowls edit 
The bowls for the stones are shaped like a flattened sphere with a level underside               The lid is loose fitting and upturned before play to receive stones captured during the game  Chinese bowls are slightly larger  and a little more rounded  a style known generally as Go Seigen  Japanese Kitani bowls tend to have a shape closer to that of the bowl of a snifter glass  such as for brandy  The bowls are usually made of turned wood  Mulberry is the traditional material for Japanese bowls  but is very expensive  wood from the Chinese jujube date tree  which has a lighter color  it is often stained  and slightly more visible grain pattern  is a common substitute for rosewood  and traditional for Go Seigen style bowls  Other traditional materials used for making Chinese bowls include lacquered wood  ceramics  stone and woven straw or rattan  The names of the bowl shapes  Go Seigen and Kitani  were introduced in the last quarter of the   th century by the professional player Janice Kim as homage to two   th century professional Go players by the same names  of Chinese and Japanese nationality  respectively  who are referred to as the  Fathers of modern Go               

Playing technique and etiquette edit 
Go players demonstrating the traditional technique of holding a stone
The traditional way to place a Go stone is to first take one from the bowl  gripping it between the index and middle fingers  with the middle finger on top  and then placing it directly on the desired intersection               One can also place a stone on the board and then slide it into position under appropriate circumstances  where it does not move any other stones   It is considered respectful towards White for Black to place the first stone of the game in the upper right hand corner                Because of symmetry  this has no effect on the game s outcome  
It is considered poor manners to run one s fingers through one s bowl of unplayed stones  as the sound  however soothing to the player doing this  can be disturbing to one s opponent  Similarly  clacking a stone against another stone  the board  or the table or floor is also discouraged  However  it is permissible to emphasize select moves by striking the board more firmly than normal  thus producing a sharp clack  Additionally  hovering one s arm over the board  usually when deciding where to play  is also considered rude as it obstructs the opponent s view of the board 
Manners and etiquette are extensively discussed in  The Classic of WeiQi in Thirteen Chapters   a Song dynasty manual to the game  Apart from the points above it also points to the need to remain calm and honorable  in maintaining posture  and knowing the key specialised terms  such as titles of common formations  Generally speaking  much attention is paid to the etiquette of playing  as much as to winning or actual game technique 

Computers and Go edit

Software players edit 
Go long posed a daunting challenge to computer programmers  putting forward  difficult decision making tasks  an intractable search space  and an optimal solution so complex it appears infeasible to directly approximate using a policy or value function                Prior to                    the best Go programs only managed to reach amateur dan level               On smaller     and   x   boards  computer programs fared better  and were able to compare to professional players  Many in the field of artificial intelligence consider Go to require more elements that mimic human thought than chess              

A finished beginner s game on a       board
The reasons why computer programs had not played Go at the professional dan level prior to      include              

The number of spaces on the board is much larger  over five times the number of spaces on a chess board     vs       On most turns there are many more possible moves in Go than in chess  Throughout most of the game  the number of legal moves stays at around         per turn  and rarely falls below      in chess  the average number of moves is                   Because an exhaustive computer program for Go must calculate and compare every possible legal move in each ply  player turn   its ability to calculate the best plays is sharply reduced when there are a large number of possible moves  Most computer game algorithms  such as those for chess  compute several moves in advance  Given an average of     available moves through most of the game  for a computer to calculate its next move by exhaustively anticipating the next four moves of each possible play  two of its own and two of its opponent s   it would have to consider more than     billion            possible combinations  To exhaustively calculate the next eight moves  would require computing     quintillion             possible combinations  As of March               update       the most powerful supercomputer in the world  NUDT s  Tianhe     can sustain       petaflops               At this rate  even given an exceedingly low estimate of    operations required to assess the value of one play of a stone  Tianhe   would require four hours to assess all possible combinations of the next eight moves in order to make a single play 
The placement of a single stone in the initial phase can affect the play of the game a hundred or more moves later  A computer would have to predict this influence  and it would be unworkable to attempt to exhaustively analyze the next hundred moves 
In capture based games  such as chess   a position can often be evaluated relatively easily  such as by calculating who has a material advantage or more active pieces      n      In Go  there is often no easy way to evaluate a position               However a   kyu human can evaluate a position at a glance  to see which player has more territory  and even beginners can estimate the score within    points  given time to count it  The number of stones on the board  material advantage  is only a weak indicator of the strength of a position  and a territorial advantage  more empty points surrounded  for one player might be compensated by the opponent s strong positions and influence all over the board  Normally a   dan can easily judge most of these positions 
It was not until August      that a computer won a game against a professional level player at a handicap of   stones  the greatest handicap normally given to a weaker opponent  It was the Mogo program  which scored this first victory in an exhibition game played during the US Go Congress                            By       a win at the professional level of play was accomplished with a four stone advantage                            In October       Google DeepMind s program AlphaGo beat Fan Hui  the European Go champion and a   dan  out of   dan possible  professional  five times out of five with no handicap on a full size       board               AlphaGo used a fundamentally different paradigm than earlier Go programs  it included very little direct instruction  and mostly used deep learning where AlphaGo played itself in hundreds of millions of games such that it could measure positions more intuitively  In March       Google next challenged Lee Sedol  a   dan considered the top player in the world in the early   st century               to a five game match  Leading up to the game  Lee Sedol and other top professionals were confident that he would win               however  AlphaGo defeated Lee in four of the five games                            After having already lost the series by the third game  Lee won the fourth game  describing his win as  invaluable                In May       AlphaGo beat Ke Jie  who at the time continuously held the world No    ranking for two years                            winning each game in a three game match during the Future of Go Summit                            In October       DeepMind announced a significantly stronger version called AlphaGo Zero which beat the previous version by     games to                
In February       Kellin Pelrine  an amateur American Go player  won    out of    games against a top ranked AI system in a significant victory over artificial intelligence  Pelrine took advantage of a previously unknown flaw in the Go computer program  which had been identified by another computer  He exploited this weakness by slowly encircling the opponent s stones and distracting the AI with moves in other parts of the board                                        

Software assistance edit 
Main article  Go software
A     game with graphical aids  Colors and markings show evaluations by the computer assistant 
An abundance of software is available to support players of the game  This includes programs that can be used to view or edit game records and diagrams  programs that allow the user to search for patterns in the games of strong players  and programs that allow users to play against each other over the Internet 
Some web servers     citation needed      provide graphical aids like maps  to aid learning during play  These graphical aids may suggest possible next moves  indicate areas of influence  highlight vital stones under attack and mark stones in atari or about to be captured 
There are several file formats used to store game records  the most popular of which is SGF  short for Smart Game Format  Programs used for editing game records allow the user to record not only the moves  but also variations  commentary and further information on the game      o     
Electronic databases can be used to study life and death situations  joseki  fuseki and games by a particular player  Programs are available that give players pattern searching options  which allow players to research positions by searching for high level games in which similar situations occur  Such software generally lists common follow up moves that have been played by professionals and gives statistics on win loss ratio in opening situations 
Internet based Go servers allow access to competition with players all over the world  for real time and turn based games      p      Such servers also allow easy access to professional teaching  with both teaching games and interactive game review being possible      q     

In popular culture edit 
Minamoto no Yoshiie by Tsukioka Yoshitoshi        This popular woodblock print depicts the ancient legend of a husband who suspected his wife was having an affair with the samurai Minamoto no Yoshiie  To prevent his visits  the husband surrounded his house with brambles and placed a Go board on the balcony  hoping he would stumble over it  Instead  the samurai deftly cut the board as he leaped over the balcony railing  avoiding both obstacles 
Apart from technical literature and study material  Go and its strategies have been the subject of several works of fiction  such as The Master of Go by Nobel Prize in Literature winning author Yasunari Kawabata     r      and The Girl Who Played Go        by Shan Sa  Other books have used Go as a theme or minor plot device  For example  the      novel Shibumi by Trevanian centers around the game and uses Go metaphors                            Go features prominently in the Chung Kuo series of novels by David Wingrove  being the favourite game of the main villain              
The manga series Hikaru no Go and its anime adaptation  first released in Japan in      and      respectively  had a large impact in popularizing Go among young players  both in Japan and as translations were released abroad                           
Similarly  Go has been used as a subject or plot device in film  such as Pi      A Beautiful Mind  Tron  Legacy  Knives Out  and The Go Master  a biopic of Go professional Go Seigen                    s           s T ky  ni kita bakari or Tokyo Newcomer portrays a Chinese foreigner Go player moving to Tokyo               In King Hu s wuxia film The Valiant Ones  the characters are color coded as Go stones  black or other dark shades for the Chinese  white for the Japanese invaders   Go boards and stones are used by the characters to keep track of soldiers prior to battle  and the battles themselves are structured like a game of Go              
Go has also been featured as a plot device in a number of television series  Examples include Starz s science fiction thriller Counterpart  which is rich in references  the opening itself featuring developments on a Go board   and includes Go matches  accurately played  relevant to the plot               Also  in      Netflix released the historical fictional Korean series Captivating the King 
The corporation and brand Atari was named after the Go term  Atari              
Hedge fund manager Mark Spitznagel used Go as his main investing metaphor in his investing book The Dao of Capital               The Way of Go    Ancient Strategy Secrets for Success in Business and Life by Troy Anderson applies Go strategy to business               GO  An Asian Paradigm for Business Strategy              by Miura Yasuyuki  a manager with Japan Airlines               uses Go to describe the thinking and behavior of business men 

Psychological perspectives edit 
A      review of literature by Fernand Gobet  de Voogt and Jean Retschitzki showed that relatively little scientific research had been carried out on the psychology of Go  compared with other traditional board games such as chess               Computer Go research has shown that given the large search tree  knowledge and pattern recognition are more important in Go than in other strategy games  such as chess               A study of the effects of age on Go playing              has shown that mental decline is milder with strong players than with weaker players  According to the review of Gobet and colleagues  the pattern of brain activity observed with techniques such as PET and fMRI does not show large differences between Go and chess  On the other hand  a study by Xiangchuan Chen et al               showed greater activation in the right hemisphere among Go players than among chess players  but the research was inconclusive because strong players from Go were hired while very weak chess players were hired in the original study               There is some evidence to suggest a correlation between playing board games and reduced risk of Alzheimer s disease and dementia              
Arthur Mary  a French researcher in clinical psychopathology  reports on his psychotherapeutic approaches using the game of Go with patients in private practice and in a psychiatric ward               Drawing on neuroscience research and employing a psychoanalytic  Lacanian  and phenomenological approach  he demonstrates how drives are expressed on the goban               He offers some suggestions to therapists for defining ways of playing go that lead to therapeutic effects              

Analyses of the game edit 
See also  Go and mathematics
In formal game theory terms  Go is a non chance  combinatorial game with perfect information  Informally that means there are no dice used  and decisions or moves create discrete outcome vectors rather than probability distributions   the underlying math is combinatorial  and all moves  via single vertex analysis  are visible to both players  unlike some card games where some information is hidden   Perfect information also implies sequence players can theoretically know about all past moves 
Other game theoretical taxonomy elements include the facts

Go is bounded by a finite number of moves and every game must end with a victor or a tie  although ties are very rare  
the strategy is associative because every strategy is a function of board position 
the format is non cooperative  that is  it s not a team sport  
positions are extensible  and so can be represented by board position trees 
the game is zero sum because player choices do not increase resources available  the rewards in the game are fixed and if one player wins  the other loses  and the utility function is restricted  in the sense of win lose  
however  ratings  monetary rewards  national and personal pride and other factors can extend utility functions  but generally not to the extent of removing the win lose restriction  although Affine transformations can theoretically add non zero and complex utility aspects even to two player games              
In the endgame  it can often happen that the state of the board consists of several subpositions that do not interact with the others  The whole board position can then be considered as a mathematical sum  or composition  of the individual subpositions               It is this property of Go endgames that led John Horton Conway to the discovery of surreal numbers              
In combinatorial game theory terms  Go is a zero sum  perfect information  partisan  deterministic strategy game  putting it in the same class as chess  draughts  checkers   and Reversi  Othello  
The game emphasizes the importance of balance on multiple levels  to secure an area of the board  it is good to play moves close together  however  to cover the largest area  one needs to spread out  perhaps leaving weaknesses that can be exploited  Playing too low  close to the edge  secures insufficient territory and influence  yet playing too high  far from the edge  allows the opponent to invade  Decisions in one part of the board may be influenced by an apparently unrelated situation in a distant part of the board  for example  ladders can be broken by stones at an arbitrary distance away   Plays made early in the game can shape the nature of conflict a hundred moves later 
The game complexity of Go is such that describing even elementary strategy fills many introductory books  In fact  numerical estimates show that the number of possible games of Go far exceeds the number of atoms in the observable universe      t     
Go also contributed to the development of combinatorial game theory  with Go infinitesimals              being a specific example of its use in Go  

Comparisons to other games edit 
Go begins with an empty board  It is focused on building from the ground up  nothing to something  with multiple  simultaneous battles leading to a point based win  Chess is tactical rather than strategic  as the predetermined strategy is to trap one individual piece  the king   This comparison has also been applied to military and political history  with Scott Boorman s book The Protracted Game        and  more recently  Robert Greene s book The    Laws of Power        exploring the strategy of the Chinese Communist Party in the Chinese Civil War through the lens of Go                           
A similar comparison has been drawn among Go  chess and backgammon  perhaps the three oldest games that enjoy worldwide popularity               Backgammon is a  man vs  fate  contest  with chance playing a strong role in determining the outcome  Chess  with rows of soldiers marching forward to capture each other  embodies the conflict of  man vs  man   Because the handicap system tells Go players where they stand relative to other players  an honestly ranked player can expect to lose about half of their games  therefore  Go can be seen as embodying the quest for self improvement   man vs  self

Notes edit 


  Game complexity can be difficult to estimate  The number of legal positions  state space complexity  for chess has been estimated at anywhere between      and       in      the number of legal positions for   x   Go was calculated by Tromp and Farneback at              Alternately  a measure of all the alternatives to be considered at each stage of the game  game tree complexity  can be estimated with bd  where b is the game s breadth  number of legal moves per position  and d is its depth  number of moves or plies per game   For chess and Go the comparison is very rough                   or                            

  Eyes and other complications may need to be considered when counting liberties

  Whether or not a group is weak or strong refers to the ease with which it can be killed or made to live  See this article by Benjamin Teuber  amateur   dan  for some views on how important this is felt to be 

  Exceptionally  in Japanese and Korean rules  empty points  even those surrounded by stones of a single color  may count as neutral territory if some of them are alive by seki  See the section below on seki 

  In game theoretical terms  seki positions are an example of a Nash equilibrium 

  A full explanation of the eternal life position can be found on Sensei s Library  it also appears in the official text for Japanese Rules  see translation 

  Roughly  one has the time to play the game and then a little time to finish it off  Time wasting tactics are possible in Go  so that sudden death systems  in which time runs out at a predetermined point however many plays are in the game  are relatively unpopular  in the West  

  Literally in Japanese by yomi means  reading of seconds  

  Typically  players stop the clock  and the player in overtime sets his her clock for the desired interval  counts out the required number of stones and sets the remaining stones out of reach  so as not to become confused  If twenty moves are made in time  the timer is reset to five minutes again 

  In other words  Canadian byoyomi is essentially a standard chess style time control  based on N moves in a time period T  imposed after a main period is used up  It is possible to decrease T  or increase N  as each overtime period expires  but systems with constant T and N  for example    plays in        minutes  are widely used 

  Kaku Takagawa toured Europe around       and reported  Go Review  a general standard of amateur   dan  This is a good amateur level but no more than might be found in ordinary East Asian clubs  Published current European ratings would suggest around     players stronger than that  with very few European   dans 

  European Go has been documented by Franco Pratesi  Eurogo  Florence       in three volumes  up to                  and      and later 

  See Overshoot in Western typography for similar subtle adjustment to create a uniform appearance 

  While chess position evaluation is simpler than Go position evaluation  it is still more complicated than simply calculating material advantage or piece activity  pawn structure and king safety matter  as do the possibilities in further play  The complexity of the algorithm differs per engine

  It has been said that the number of board positions is at most       about        since each position can be white  black  or vacant  Ignoring  illegal  suicide moves  there are at least      games  about        since every permutation of the     points corresponds to a game  See Go and mathematics for more details  which includes much larger estimates This estimate  however  is inexact for two reasons  first  both contestants usually agree to end the game long before every point has been played  second  after a capture it may happen that an already played point is played again  even repetitively so in the case of a k  battle
