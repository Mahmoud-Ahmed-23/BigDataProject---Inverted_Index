Hilary Whitehall Putnam    p tn m   July            March           was an American philosopher  mathematician  computer scientist  and figure in analytic philosophy in the second half of the   th century  He contributed to the studies of philosophy of mind  philosophy of language  philosophy of mathematics  and philosophy of science             Outside philosophy  Putnam contributed to mathematics and computer science  Together with Martin Davis he developed the Davis Putnam algorithm for the Boolean satisfiability problem            and he helped demonstrate the unsolvability of Hilbert s tenth problem            
Putnam applied equal scrutiny to his own philosophical positions as to those of others  subjecting each position to rigorous analysis until he exposed its flaws             As a result  he acquired a reputation for frequently changing his positions             In philosophy of mind  Putnam argued against the type identity of mental and physical states based on his hypothesis of the multiple realizability of the mental  and for the concept of functionalism  an influential theory regarding the mind body problem                         Putnam also originated the computational theory of mind              In philosophy of language  along with Saul Kripke and others  he developed the causal theory of reference  and formulated an original theory of meaning  introducing the notion of semantic externalism based on a thought experiment called Twin Earth             
In philosophy of mathematics  Putnam and W  V  O  Quine developed the Quine Putnam indispensability argument  an argument for the reality of mathematical entities              later espousing the view that mathematics is not purely logical  but  quasi empirical               In epistemology  Putnam criticized the  brain in a vat  thought experiment  which appears to provide a powerful argument for epistemological skepticism  by challenging its coherence              In metaphysics  he originally espoused a position called metaphysical realism  but eventually became one of its most outspoken critics  first adopting a view he called  internal realism               which he later abandoned  Despite these changes of view  throughout his career Putnam remained committed to scientific realism  roughly the view that mature scientific theories are approximately true descriptions of ways things are             
In his later work  Putnam became increasingly interested in American pragmatism  Jewish philosophy  and ethics  engaging with a wider array of philosophical traditions  He also displayed an interest in metaphilosophy  seeking to  renew philosophy  from what he identified as narrow and inflated concerns              He was at times a politically controversial figure  especially for his involvement with the Progressive Labor Party in the late     s and early     s             


Life edit 
Hilary Whitehall Putnam was born on July           in Chicago  Illinois              His father  Samuel Putnam  was a scholar of Romance languages  columnist  and translator who wrote for the Daily Worker  a publication of the American Communist Party  from      to                   Because of his father s commitment to communism  Putnam had a secular upbringing  although his mother  Riva  was Jewish             In early       six months after Hilary s birth  the family moved to France  where Samuel was under contract to translate the surviving works of Fran ois Rabelais                          In a      autobiographical essay  Putnam said that his first childhood memories were from his life in France  and his first language was French             
Putnam completed the first two years of his primary education in France before he and his parents returned to the U S  in       settling in Philadelphia              There  he attended Central High School  where he met Noam Chomsky  who was a year behind him                                  The two remained friends and often intellectual opponents for the rest of Putnam s life              Putnam studied philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania  receiving his B A  degree and becoming a member of the Philomathean Society  the country s oldest continually existing collegiate literary society                         He did graduate work in philosophy at Harvard University            and later at UCLA s philosophy department  where he received his Ph D  in      for his dissertation  The Meaning of the Concept of Probability in Application to Finite Sequences                         Putnam s dissertation supervisor Hans Reichenbach was a leading figure in logical positivism  the dominant school of philosophy of the day  one of Putnam s most consistent positions was his rejection of logical positivism as self defeating              Over the course of his life  Putnam was his own philosophical adversary  changing his positions on philosophical questions and critiquing his previous views             
After obtaining his PhD  Putnam taught at Northwestern University            Princeton University            and MIT            For the rest of his career  Putnam taught at Harvard s philosophy department  becoming Cogan University Professor  In       he married fellow philosopher Ruth Anna Putnam  born Ruth Anna Jacobs   who took a teaching position in philosophy at Wellesley College                                      Rebelling against the antisemitism they experienced during their youth  the Putnams decided to establish a traditional Jewish home for their children              Since they had no experience with the rituals of Judaism  they sought out invitations to other Jewish homes for Seder  They began to study Jewish rituals and Hebrew  became more interested in Judaism  self identified as Jews  and actively practiced Judaism  In       Hilary celebrated a belated bar mitzvah service  Ruth Anna s bat mitzvah was celebrated four years later             
In the     s and early     s  Putnam was an active supporter of the American Civil Rights Movement and he was also an active opponent of the Vietnam War              In       he organized one of MIT s first faculty and student anti war committees                          After moving to Harvard in       he organized campus protests and began teaching courses on Marxism  Putnam became an official faculty advisor to the Students for a Democratic Society and in      a member of the Progressive Labor Party  PLP                           He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in                   After       his political activities centered on the PLP              The Harvard administration considered these activities disruptive and attempted to censure Putnam                          Putnam permanently severed his relationship with the PLP in                   In       at a meeting of former draft resistance activists at Boston s Arlington Street Church  he called his involvement with the PLP a mistake  He said he had been impressed at first with the PLP s commitment to alliance building and its willingness to attempt to organize from within the armed forces             
In       Putnam was elected president of the American Philosophical Association  The next year  he was selected as Walter Beverly Pearson Professor of Mathematical Logic in recognition of his contributions to the philosophy of logic and mathematics  While breaking with his radical past  Putnam never abandoned his belief that academics have a particular social and ethical responsibility toward society  He continued to be forthright and progressive in his political views  as expressed in the articles  How Not to Solve Ethical Problems         and  Education for Democracy                     
Putnam was a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy  He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in                   He retired from teaching in June       becoming Cogan University Professor Emeritus  but as of      continued to give a seminar almost yearly at Tel Aviv University  He also held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the University of Amsterdam in                   His corpus includes five volumes of collected works  seven books  and more than     articles  Putnam s renewed interest in Judaism inspired him to publish several books and essays on the topic              With his wife  he co authored several essays and a book on the late   th century American pragmatist movement             
For his contributions in philosophy and logic  Putnam was awarded the Rolf Schock Prize in                  and the Nicholas Rescher Prize for Systematic Philosophy in                   Putnam died at his home in Arlington  Massachusetts  on March                       At the time of his death  Putnam was Cogan University Professor Emeritus at Harvard University 

Philosophy of mind edit 
Multiple realizability edit 
An illustration of multiple realizability  M stands for mental and P stands for physical  It can be seen that more than one P can instantiate one M  but not vice versa  Causal relations between states are represented by the arrows  M  goes to M   etc   
Putnam s best known work concerns philosophy of mind  His most noted original contributions to that field came in several key papers published in the late     s that set out the hypothesis of multiple realizability              In these papers  Putnam argues that  contrary to the famous claim of the type identity theory  pain may correspond to utterly different physical states of the nervous system in different organisms even if they all experience the same mental state of  being in pain               Putnam cited examples from the animal kingdom to illustrate his thesis  He asked whether it was likely that the brain structures of diverse types of animals realize pain  or other mental states  the same way  If they do not share the same brain structures  they cannot share the same mental states and properties  in which case mental states must be realized by different physical states in different species  Putnam then took his argument a step further  asking about such things as the nervous systems of alien beings  artificially intelligent robots and other silicon based life forms  These hypothetical entities  he contended  should not be considered incapable of experiencing pain just because they lack human neurochemistry  Putnam concluded that type identity theorists had been making an  ambitious  and  highly implausible  conjecture that could be disproved by one example of multiple realizability  This is sometimes called the  likelihood argument   as it focuses on the claim that multiple realizability is more likely than type identity theory                                               
Putnam also formulated an a priori argument in favor of multiple realizability based on what he called  functional isomorphism   He defined the concept in these terms   Two systems are functionally isomorphic if  there is a correspondence between the states of one and the states of the other that preserves functional relations    In the case of computers  two machines are functionally isomorphic if and only if the sequential relations among states in the first exactly mirror the sequential relations among states in the other  Therefore  a computer made of silicon chips and one made of cogs and wheels can be functionally isomorphic but constitutionally diverse  Functional isomorphism implies multiple realizability                                               
Putnam  Jerry Fodor  and others argued that along with being an effective argument against type identity theories  multiple realizability implies that any low level explanation of higher level mental phenomena is insufficiently abstract and general  Functionalism  which identifies mental kinds with functional kinds that are characterized exclusively in terms of causes and effects  abstracts from the level of microphysics  and therefore seemed to be a better explanation of the relation between mind and body  In fact  there are many functional kinds  including mousetraps and eyes  that are multiply realized at the physical level                                                                                               
Multiple realizability has been criticized on the grounds that  if it were true  research and experimentation in the neurosciences would be impossible              According to William Bechtel and Jennifer Mundale  to be able to conduct such research in the neurosciences  universal consistencies must either exist or be assumed to exist in brain structures  It is the similarity  or homology  of brain structures that allows us to generalize across species              If multiple realizability were an empirical fact  results from experiments conducted on one species of animal  or one organism  would not be meaningful when generalized to explain the behavior of another species  or organism of the same species               Jaegwon Kim  David Lewis  Robert Richardson and Patricia Churchland have also criticized metaphysical realism                                                 

Machine state functionalism edit 
Putnam himself put forth the first formulation of such a functionalist theory  This formulation  now called  machine state functionalism   was inspired by analogies Putnam and others made between the mind and Turing machines              The point for functionalism is the nature of the states of the Turing machine  Each state can be defined in terms of its relations to the other states and to the inputs and outputs  and the details of how it accomplishes what it accomplishes and of its material constitution are completely irrelevant  According to machine state functionalism  the nature of a mental state is just like the nature of a Turing machine state  Just as  state one  simply is the state in which  given a particular input  such and such happens  so being in pain is the state which disposes one to cry  ouch   become distracted  wonder what the cause is  and so forth             

Rejection of functionalism edit 
Ian Hacking called Representation and Reality        a book that  will mostly be read as Putnam s denunciation of his former philosophical psychology  to which he gave the name  functionalism                Writing in No s  Barbara Hannon described  the inventor of functionalism  as arguing  against his own former computationalist views              
Putnam s change of mind was primarily due to the difficulties computational theories have in explaining certain intuitions with respect to the externalism of mental content              This is illustrated by his Twin Earth thought experiment             
In      Putnam also developed a separate argument against functionalism based on Fodor s generalized version of multiple realizability  Asserting that functionalism is really a watered down identity theory in which mental kinds are identified with functional kinds  he argued that mental kinds may be multiply realizable over functional kinds  The argument for functionalism is that the same mental state could be implemented by the different states of a universal Turing machine                  non primary source needed                             
Despite Putnam s rejection of functionalism  it has continued to flourish and been developed into numerous versions by Fodor  David Marr  Daniel Dennett  and David Lewis  among others              Functionalism helped lay the foundations for modern cognitive science             and was the dominant theory of mind in philosophy in the last part of the   th century             
By      Putnam accepted a modification of functionalism called  liberal functionalism   The view holds that  what matters for consciousness and for mental properties generally is the right sort of functional capacities and not the particular matter that subserves those capacities               The specification of these capacities may refer to what goes on outside the organism s  brain   may include intentional idioms  and need not describe a capacity to compute something or other             
Putnam himself formulated one of the main arguments against functionalism  the Twin Earth thought experiment  though there have been additional criticisms  John Searle s Chinese room argument        is a direct attack on the claim that thought can be represented as a set of functions  It is designed to show that it is possible to mimic intelligent action with a purely functional system  without any interpretation or understanding  Searle describes a situation in which a person who speaks only English is locked in a room with Chinese symbols in baskets and a rule book in English for moving the symbols around  People outside the room instruct the person inside to follow the rule book for sending certain symbols out of the room when given certain symbols  The people outside the room speak Chinese and are communicating with the person inside via the Chinese symbols  According to Searle  it would be absurd to claim that the English speaker inside  knows  Chinese based on these syntactic processes alone  This argument attempts to show that systems that operate merely on syntactic processes cannot realize any semantics  meaning  or intentionality  aboutness   Searle thus attacks the idea that thought can be equated with following a set of syntactic rules and concludes that functionalism is an inadequate theory of the mind              Ned Block has advanced several other arguments against functionalism             

Philosophy of language edit 
Semantic externalism edit 
One of Putnam s contributions to philosophy of language is his semantic externalism  the claim that terms  meanings are determined by factors outside the mind  encapsulated in his slogan that  meaning just ain t in the head   His views on meaning  first laid out in Meaning and Reference         then in The Meaning of  Meaning          use his  Twin Earth  thought experiment to defend this thesis                         
Twin Earth shows this  according to Putnam  since on Twin Earth everything is identical to Earth  except that its lakes  rivers and oceans are filled with XYZ rather than H O  Consequently  when an earthling  Fredrick  uses the Earth English word  water   it has a different meaning from the Twin Earth English word  water  when used by his physically identical twin  Frodrick  on Twin Earth  Since Fredrick and Frodrick are physically indistinguishable when they utter their respective words  and since their words have different meanings  meaning cannot be determined solely by what is in their heads              This led Putnam to adopt a version of semantic externalism with regard to meaning and mental content                          The philosopher of mind and language Donald Davidson  despite his many differences of opinion with Putnam  wrote that semantic externalism constituted an  anti subjectivist revolution  in philosophers  way of seeing the world  Since Descartes s time  philosophers had been concerned with proving knowledge from the basis of subjective experience  Thanks to Putnam  Saul Kripke  Tyler Burge and others  Davidson said  philosophy could now take the objective realm for granted and start questioning the alleged  truths  of subjective experience             

Theory of meaning edit 
Along with Kripke  Keith Donnellan  and others  Putnam contributed to what is known as the causal theory of reference             In particular  he maintained in The Meaning of  Meaning  that the objects referred to by natural kind terms such as  tiger    water   and  tree  are the principal elements of the meaning of such terms  There is a linguistic division of labor  analogous to Adam Smith s economic division of labor  according to which such terms have their references fixed by the  experts  in the particular field of science to which the terms belong  So  for example  the reference of the term  lion  is fixed by the community of zoologists  the reference of the term  elm tree  is fixed by the community of botanists  and chemists fix the reference of the term  table salt  as sodium chloride  These referents are considered rigid designators in the Kripkean sense and are disseminated outward to the linguistic community                                              
Putnam specifies a finite sequence of elements  a vector  for the description of the meaning of every term in the language  Such a vector consists of four components 

the object to which the term refers  e g   the object individuated by the chemical formula H O 
a set of typical descriptions of the term  referred to as  the stereotype   e g    transparent    colorless   and  hydrating  
the semantic indicators that place the object into a general category  e g    natural kind  and  liquid  
the syntactic indicators  e g    concrete noun  and  mass noun  
Such a  meaning vector  provides a description of the reference and use of an expression within a particular linguistic community  It provides the conditions for its correct usage and makes it possible to judge whether a single speaker attributes the appropriate meaning to it or whether its use has changed enough to cause a difference in its meaning  According to Putnam  it is legitimate to speak of a change in the meaning of an expression only if the reference of the term  and not its stereotype  has changed                                        But since no possible algorithm can determine which aspect the stereotype or the reference has changed in a particular case  it is necessary to consider the usage of other expressions of the language                  non primary source needed      Since there is no limit to the number of such expressions to be considered  Putnam embraced a form of semantic holism             
Despite the many changes in his other positions  Putnam consistently adhered to semantic holism  Michael Dummett  Jerry Fodor  Ernest Lepore  and others have identified problems with this position  In the first place  they suggest that  if semantic holism is true  it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression in the language  Given the limits of our cognitive abilities  we will never be able to master the whole of the English  or any other  language  even based on the  false  assumption that languages are static and immutable entities  Thus  if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression  language learning is simply impossible  Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same expression  and therefore how any communication is possible between them  Given a sentence P  since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part  P means one thing to Fred and something else to Mary  Moreover  if P derives its meaning from its relations with all the sentences of a language  as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence  the totality of relations changes  and therefore also the meaning of P  As this is a common phenomenon  the result is that P has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person  Consequently  if one accepts the truth of a sentence and then rejects it later on  the meaning of what one rejected and what one accepted are completely different and therefore one cannot change opinions with regard to the same sentences                  page      needed                      page      needed                      page      needed     

Philosophy of mathematics edit 
In the philosophy of mathematics  Putnam has utilized indispensability arguments to argue for a realist interpretation of mathematics  In his      book Philosophy of Logic  he presented what has since been called the locus classicus of the Quine Putnam indispensability argument              The argument  which he attributed to Willard Van Orman Quine  is presented in the book as  quantification over mathematical entities is indispensable for science  both formal and physical  therefore we should accept such quantification  but this commits us to accepting the existence of the mathematical entities in question               According to Charles Parsons  Putnam  very likely  endorsed this version of the argument in his early work  but later came to deny some of the views present in it                                   
In       Putnam formulated his own indispensability argument based on the no miracles argument in the philosophy of science  saying   I believe that the positive argument for realism  in science  has an analogue in the case of mathematical realism  Here too  I believe  realism is the only philosophy that doesn t make the success of the science a miracle               According to Putnam  Quine s version of the argument was an argument for the existence of abstract mathematical objects  while Putnam s own argument was simply for a realist interpretation of mathematics  which he believed could be provided by a  mathematics as modal logic  interpretation that need not imply the existence of abstract objects                                     
Putnam also held the view that mathematics  like physics and other empirical sciences  uses both strict logical proofs and  quasi empirical  methods                                    For example  Fermat s Last Theorem states that for no integer 
  
    
      
        n
         gt 
         
      
    
      displaystyle n gt   
  
 are there positive integer values of x  y  and z such that 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
         
        
          y
          
            n
          
        
         
        
          z
          
            n
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle x  n  y  n  z  n  
  
  Before Andrew Wiles proved this for all

 in                   it had been proved for many values of n  These proofs inspired further research in the area  and formed a quasi empirical consensus for the theorem  Even though such knowledge is more conjectural than a strictly proved theorem  it was still used in developing other mathematical ideas             
The Quine Putnam indispensability argument has been extremely influential in the philosophy of mathematics  inspiring continued debate and development of the argument in contemporary philosophy of mathematics  According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  many in the field consider it the best argument for mathematical realism              Prominent counterarguments come from Hartry Field  who argues that mathematics is not indispensable to science  and Penelope Maddy and Elliott Sober  who dispute whether we are committed to mathematical realism even if it is indispensable to science             

Mathematics and computer science edit 
Putnam has contributed to scientific fields not directly related to his work in philosophy             As a mathematician  he contributed to the resolution of Hilbert s tenth problem in mathematics  This problem  now known as Matiyasevich s theorem or the MRDP theorem  was settled by Yuri Matiyasevich in       with a proof that relied heavily on previous research by Putnam  Julia Robinson and Martin Davis             
In computability theory  Putnam investigated the structure of the ramified analytical hierarchy  its connection with the constructible hierarchy and its Turing degrees  He showed that there are many levels of the constructible hierarchy that add no subsets of the integers              Later  with his student George Boolos  he showed that the first such  non index  is the ordinal

In computer science  Putnam is known for the Davis Putnam algorithm for the Boolean satisfiability problem  SAT   developed with Martin Davis in                  The algorithm finds whether there is a set of true or false values that satisfies a given Boolean expression so that the entire expression becomes true  In       they further refined the algorithm with the help of George Logemann and Donald W  Loveland  It became known as the DPLL algorithm  It is efficient and still forms the basis of most complete SAT solvers            

Epistemology edit 
A  brain in a vat  Putnam uses this thought experiment to argue that skeptical scenarios are impossible 
In epistemology  Putnam is known for his argument against skeptical scenarios based on the  brain in a vat  thought experiment  a modernized version of Descartes s evil demon hypothesis   The argument is that one cannot coherently suspect that one is a disembodied  brain in a vat  placed there by some  mad scientist                          
This follows from the causal theory of reference  Words always refer to the kinds of things they were coined to refer to  the kinds of things their user  or the user s ancestors  experienced  So  if some person  Mary  is a  brain in a vat   whose every experience is received through wiring and other gadgetry created by the mad scientist  then Mary s idea of a brain does not refer to a real brain  since she and her linguistic community have never encountered such a thing  To her a brain is actually an image fed to her through the wiring  Nor does her idea of a vat refer to a real vat  So if  as a brain in a vat  she says   I m a brain in a vat   she is actually saying   I m a brain image in a vat image   which is incoherent  On the other hand  if she is not a brain in a vat  then saying that she is a brain in a vat is still incoherent  because she actually means the opposite  This is a form of epistemological externalism  knowledge or justification depends on factors outside the mind and is not solely determined internally                         
Putnam has clarified that his real target in this argument was never skepticism  but metaphysical realism  which he thought implied such skeptical scenarios were possible                          Since realism of this kind assumes the existence of a gap between how one conceives the world and the way the world really is  skeptical scenarios such as this one  or Descartes s evil demon  present a formidable challenge  By arguing that such a scenario is impossible  Putnam attempts to show that this notion of a gap between one s concept of the world and the way it is is absurd  One cannot have a  God s eye  view of reality  One is limited to one s conceptual schemes  and metaphysical realism is therefore false                         
Putnam s brain in a vat argument has been criticized              Crispin Wright argues that Putnam s formulation of the brain in a vat scenario is too narrow to refute global skepticism  The possibility that one is a recently disembodied brain in a vat is not undermined by semantic externalism  If a person has lived their entire life outside the vat speaking the English language and interacting normally with the outside world before  envatment  by a mad scientist  when they wake up inside the vat  their words and thoughts  e g    tree  and  grass   will still refer to the objects or events in the external world they had referred to before envatment             

Metaphilosophy and ontology edit 
In the late     s and the     s  stimulated by results from mathematical logic and by some of Quine s ideas  Putnam abandoned his long standing defense of metaphysical realism the view that the categories and structures of the external world are both causally and ontologically independent of the conceptualizations of the human mind and adopted a rather different view  which he called  internal realism  or  pragmatic realism                                                             Internal realism is the view that  although the world may be causally independent of the human mind  the world s structure its division into kinds  individuals and categories is a function of the human mind  and hence the world is not ontologically independent  The general idea is influenced by Immanuel Kant s idea of the dependence of our knowledge of the world on the categories of thought             
According to Putnam  the problem with metaphysical realism is that it fails to explain the possibility of reference and truth              According to the metaphysical realist  our concepts and categories refer because they match up in some mysterious manner with the categories  kinds and individuals inherent in the external world  But how is it possible that the world  carves up  into certain structures and categories  the mind carves up the world into its own categories and structures  and the two carvings perfectly coincide  The answer must be that the world does not come pre structured but that the human mind and its conceptual schemes impose structure on it              In Reason  Truth  and History  Putnam identified truth with what he termed  idealized rational acceptability   The theory is that a belief is true if it would be accepted by anyone under ideal epistemic conditions                                                
Nelson Goodman formulated a similar notion in Fact  Fiction and Forecast          We have come to think of the actual as one among many possible worlds  We need to repaint that picture  All possible worlds lie within the actual one   Goodman wrote              Putnam rejected this form of social constructivism  but retained the idea that there can be many correct descriptions of reality  None of these descriptions can be scientifically proven to be the  one  true  description of the world  He thus accepted  conceptual relativity  the view that it may be a matter of choice or convention  e g   whether mereological sums exist  or whether spacetime points are individuals or mere limits                  non primary source needed     
Curtis Brown has criticized Putnam s internal realism as a disguised form of subjective idealism  in which case it is subject to the traditional arguments against that position  In particular  it falls into the trap of solipsism  That is  if existence depends on experience  as subjective idealism maintains  and if one s consciousness ceased to exist  then the rest of the universe would also cease to exist              In his reply to Simon Blackburn in the volume Reading Putnam  Putnam renounced internal realism             because it assumed a  cognitive interface  model of the relation between the mind and the world  Under the increasing influence of William James and the pragmatists  he adopted a direct realist view of this relation                                                              Although he abandoned internal realism  Putnam still resisted the idea that any given thing or system of things can be described in exactly one complete and correct way  He came to accept metaphysical realism in a broader sense  rejecting all forms of verificationism and all talk of our  making  the world             
In the philosophy of perception  Putnam came to endorse direct realism  according to which perceptual experiences directly present one with the external world  He once further held that there are no mental representations  sense data  or other intermediaries between the mind and the world              By       however  he rejected this commitment in favor of  transactionalism   a view that accepts both that perceptual experiences are world involving transactions  and that these transactions are functionally describable  provided that worldly items and intentional states may be referred to in the specification of the function   Such transactions can further involve qualia                         

Quantum mechanics edit 
During his career  Putnam espoused various positions on the interpretation of quantum mechanics              In the     s and     s  he contributed to the quantum logic tradition  holding that the way to resolve quantum theory s apparent paradoxes is to modify the logical rules by which propositions  truth values are deduced                          Putnam s first foray into this topic was  A Philosopher Looks at Quantum Mechanics  in       followed by his      essay  Is Logic Empirical    He advanced different versions of quantum logic over the years               and eventually turned away from it in the     s  due to critiques by Nancy Cartwright  Michael Redhead  and others                                        In       he wrote that he rejected the many worlds interpretation because he could see no way for it to yield meaningful probabilities               He found both de Broglie Bohm theory and the spontaneous collapse theory of Ghirardi  Rimini  and Weber to be promising  yet also dissatisfying  since it was not clear that either could be made fully consistent with special relativity s symmetry requirements             

Neopragmatism and Wittgenstein edit 
In the mid     s  Putnam became increasingly disillusioned with what he perceived as modern analytic philosophy s  scientism  and focus on metaphysics over ethics and everyday concerns                                         He also became convinced by his readings of James and John Dewey that there is no fact value dichotomy  that is  normative  e g   ethical and aesthetic  judgments often have a factual basis  while scientific judgments have a normative element                                                For a time  under Ludwig Wittgenstein s influence  Putnam adopted a pluralist view of philosophy itself and came to view most philosophical problems as no more than conceptual or linguistic confusions philosophers created by using ordinary language out of context                  non primary source needed      A book of articles on pragmatism by Ruth Anna Putnam and Hilary Putnam  Pragmatism as a Way of Life  The Lasting Legacy of William James and John Dewey  edited by David Macarthur  was published in                   
Many of Putnam s last works addressed the concerns of ordinary people  particularly social problems               For example  he wrote about the nature of democracy  social justice and religion  He also discussed J rgen Habermas s ideas  and wrote articles influenced by continental philosophy
