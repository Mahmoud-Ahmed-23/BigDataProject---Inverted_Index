A I  Artificial Intelligence  or simply A I   is a      American science fiction drama film directed by Steven Spielberg  The screenplay by Spielberg and screen story by Ian Watson are loosely based on the      short story  Supertoys Last All Summer Long  by Brian Aldiss  Set in a futuristic society  the film stars Haley Joel Osment as David  a childlike android uniquely programmed with the ability to love  Jude Law  Frances O Connor  Brendan Gleeson and William Hurt star in supporting roles 
Development of A I  originally began after producer and director Stanley Kubrick acquired the rights to Aldiss s story in the early     s  Kubrick hired a series of writers  including Aldiss  Bob Shaw  Ian Watson and Sara Maitland  until the mid     s  The film languished in development hell for years  partly because Kubrick felt that computer generated imagery was not advanced enough to create the David character  which he believed no child actor would convincingly portray  In       Kubrick handed A I  to Spielberg  but the film did not gain momentum until Kubrick died in       Spielberg remained close to Watson s treatment for the screenplay and dedicated the film to Kubrick 
A I  Artificial Intelligence was released on June           by Warner Bros  Pictures in North America  It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed        million against a budget of         million  It was also nominated for Best Visual Effects and Best Original Score  for John Williams  at the   th Academy Awards  In a      BBC poll of     critics around the world  A I  Artificial Intelligence was voted the eighty third greatest film since       It has since been called one of Spielberg s best works and one of the greatest films of the   st century  and of all time                                                        


Plot edit 
In the   nd century  rising sea levels from global warming have wiped out coastal cities and altered the world s climate  With the human population in decline  advanced nations have created humanoid robots called mechas to fulfill various roles in society 
In Madison  New Jersey  David  an    year old prototype mecha child capable of experiencing love  is given to Henry Swinton and his wife Monica  whose son Martin is in suspended animation after contracting a rare disease  Initially uncomfortable with David  Monica eventually warms to him and activates his imprinting protocol  Wanting her to love him in return  he befriends Teddy  Martin s old robotic teddy bear 
After Martin is unexpectedly cured of his disease and brought home  he jealously goads David into cutting off a piece of Monica s hair  That night  David enters his adoptive parents  room  but as Monica turns over  the scissors accidentally poke her in the eye  While Henry attends to her wounds  Teddy picks up the lock of hair from the floor and places it in his pocket  During a pool party  one of Martin s friends pokes David with a knife  triggering his self protection programming  David grabs Martin  causing both of them to fall into the pool  While Martin is rescued  David is accused of endangering others 
Henry convinces Monica to return David to his creators for destruction  En route  she instead spares David by abandoning him in the woods full of scrap metal and obsolete mechas  Now accompanied solely by Teddy  David recalls The Adventures of Pinocchio and decides to find the Blue Fairy to become human  which he believes will regain Monica s love 
David and Teddy are captured by the  Flesh Fair   a traveling circus like event at which obsolete mechas are destroyed in front of jeering crowds  About to be destroyed himself  David pleads for his life  and the audience revolts and allows David to escape with Gigolo Joe  a prostitute mecha on the run after being framed for murder  David  Teddy and Joe go to the decadent resort town of Rouge City  where  Dr  Know   a holographic answer engine  directs them to the top of Rockefeller Center in the flooded ruins of New York City and provides fairy tale information that David interprets as suggesting that a Blue Fairy can help him 
Above the ruins of New York  David meets Professor Hobby  his creator  who tells him that their meeting demonstrates David s ability to love and desire  David finds copies of himself  including female variants called  Darlene   ready to be shipped  Disheartened by his lost sense of individuality  David attempts suicide by falling from a skyscraper into the ocean  While underwater  David notices a figure resembling the Blue Fairy before Joe rescues him in an amphibious aircraft  Before David can explain  authorities capture Joe with an electromagnet  David and Teddy take control of the aircraft to see the Blue Fairy  which turns out to be a statue from an attraction on Coney Island  The two become trapped when the Wonder Wheel falls on their vehicle  Believing that the Blue Fairy is real  David repeatedly asks the statue to turn him into a real boy until his power source is depleted 
Two thousand years later  humanity is extinct and Manhattan is buried under glacial ice  Mechas have evolved into an advanced form  and a group known as the Specialists  interested in humanity  find and resurrect David and Teddy  They reconstruct the Swinton family home from David s memories before explaining  via an interactive version of the Blue Fairy  that he cannot become human  However  they recreate Monica through genetic material from the strand of hair that Teddy kept  This version of Monica can live for only one day and cannot be revived  David spends his happiest day with Monica  and as she falls asleep in the evening  Monica tells David that she has always loved him  David lies down next to her and closes his eyes

Production edit 
Development edit 
Stanley Kubrick began development on an adaptation of  Super Toys Last All Summer Long  in the late     s  hiring the story s author  Brian Aldiss  to write a film treatment  In       Kubrick asked Steven Spielberg to direct the film  with Kubrick producing              Warner Bros  agreed to co finance A I  and cover distribution duties              The film labored in development hell  and Aldiss was fired by Kubrick over creative differences in                   Bob Shaw briefly served as writer  leaving after six weeks due to Kubrick s demanding work schedule  and Ian Watson was hired as the new writer in March       Aldiss later remarked   Not only did the bastard fire me  he hired my enemy  Watson  instead   Kubrick handed Watson Carlo Collodi s The Adventures of Pinocchio for inspiration  calling A I   a picaresque robot version of Pinocchio                                      
Three weeks later  Watson gave Kubrick his first story treatment  and concluded his work on A I  in May      with another treatment of    pages  Gigolo Joe was originally conceived as a G I  mecha  but Watson suggested changing him to a male prostitute  Kubrick joked   I guess we lost the kiddie market               Meanwhile  Kubrick dropped A I  to work on a film adaptation of Wartime Lies  feeling computer animation was not advanced enough to create the David character  After the release of Spielberg s Jurassic Park  with its innovative CGI  it was announced in November      that production of A I  would begin in                   Dennis Muren and Ned Gorman  who worked on Jurassic Park  became visual effects supervisors              but Kubrick was displeased with their previsualization  and with the expense of hiring Industrial Light  amp  Magic  ILM  and Stan Winston Studio             



 Stanley  Kubrick  showed Steven  Spielberg      drawings which he had  and the script and the story  everything  Stanley said   Look  why don t you direct it and I ll produce it   Steven was almost in shock  


  Producer Jan Harlan  on Spielberg s first meeting with Kubrick about A I             

Kubrick asked Sara Maitland to give the film mythic resonance  She recalls  He never referred to the film as  A I    he always called it  Pinocchio    Kubrick s version ended the same way Spielberg s does  with advanced mechas reviving Monica  but only for a day             

Pre production edit 
In early       the film was in pre production with Christopher  Fangorn  Baker as concept artist and Sara Maitland assisting on the story  which gave it  a feminist fairy tale focus               Maitland said that Kubrick never referred to the film as A I   but as Pinocchio              Chris Cunningham became the new visual effects supervisor  Some of his unproduced work for A I  can be seen on the DVD The Work of Director Chris Cunningham             
Aside from considering computer animation  Kubrick also had Joseph Mazzello do a screen test for the lead role              Cunningham helped assemble a series of  little robot type humans  for the David character   We tried to construct a little boy with a movable rubber face to see whether we could make it look appealing   producer Jan Harlan reflected   But it was a total failure  it looked awful   Hans Moravec was brought in as a technical consultant              Meanwhile  Kubrick and Harlan thought that A I  would be closer to Steven Spielberg s sensibilities as director                          Kubrick handed the position to Spielberg in       but Spielberg chose to direct other projects and convinced Kubrick to remain as director                          The film was put on hold due to Kubrick s commitment to Eyes Wide Shut                    
After Kubrick s death in March       Harlan and Christiane Kubrick approached Spielberg to take over the director s position                          By November       Spielberg was writing the screenplay based on Watson s    page story treatment  It was his first solo screenplay credit since Close Encounters of the Third Kind                     Pre production was briefly halted during February      because Spielberg pondered directing other projects  which were Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone  Minority Report and Memoirs of a Geisha                          The following month  Spielberg announced that A I  would be his next project  with Minority Report as a follow up              When he decided to fast track A I   Spielberg brought back Chris Baker as concept artist              Ian Watson reported that the final script was very faithful to Kubrick s vision  even the ending  which is often attributed to Spielberg  saying   The final    minutes are pretty close to what I wrote for Stanley  and what Stanley wanted  faithfully filmed by Spielberg without added schmaltz              

Filming and visual effects edit 
The original start date was July                       but filming was delayed until August              Aside from a couple of weeks of shooting on location in Oxbow Regional Park in Oregon  A I  was shot entirely using sound stages at Warner Bros  Studios and the Spruce Goose Dome in Long Beach  California             
Spielberg copied Kubrick s obsessively secretive approach to filmmaking by refusing to give the complete script to cast and crew  banning press from the set  and making actors sign confidentiality agreements  For instance  Jack Angel  who voiced Teddy  recorded his lines entirely out of context  only receiving direction to sound like Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh  except  very wise and old and stoic   However  Spielberg asked Angel to be on the set every day to make line alterations wherever he felt necessary              Social robotics expert Cynthia Breazeal served as technical consultant during production                          Costume designer Bob Ringwood studied pedestrians on the Las Vegas Strip for his influence on the Rouge City extras             
Visual effects  such as removing the visible rods controlling Teddy and removing Haley Joel Osment s breath  were provided in houses by PDI DreamWorks             

Casting edit 
Julianne Moore and Gwyneth Paltrow were considered for the role of Monica Swinton before Frances O Connor was cast  Jerry Seinfeld was originally considered to voice and play the Comedian Robot before Chris Rock was cast             

Allusions edit 
A  O  Scott notes Spielberg s homages to Kubrick   sly references to A Clockwork Orange  The Shining and predominantly       A Space Odyssey  as well as Collodi s Pinocchio              The lines Dr  Know quotes are from W  B  Yeats s  The Stolen Child  


Come away  O human child 
To the waters and the wild
With a faery  hand in hand 
For the world s more full of weeping
than you can understand             

        W  B  Yeats  The Stolen Child

Critical response edit 
On Rotten Tomatoes  A I  Artificial Intelligence holds an approval rating of     based on reviews from     critics  with an average rating of          The website s critical consensus reads   A curious  not always seamless  amalgamation of Kubrick s chilly bleakness and Spielberg s warm hearted optimism  A I  is  in a word  fascinating               On Metacritic  it has a weighted average score of    out of     based on reviews from    critics  which indicates  generally favorable reviews               Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of  C   on a scale of A  to F             
Producer Jan Harlan stated that Kubrick  would have applauded  the final film  while Kubrick s widow Christiane also enjoyed A I              Brian Aldiss admired the film as well   I thought what an inventive  intriguing  ingenious  involving film this was  There are flaws in it and I suppose I might have a personal quibble but it s so long since I wrote it   Of the film s ending  he wondered how it might have been had Kubrick directed the film   That is one of the  ifs  of film history at least the ending indicates Spielberg adding some sugar to Kubrick s wine  The actual ending is overly sympathetic and moreover rather overtly engineered by a plot device that does not really bear credence  But it s a brilliant piece of film and of course it s a phenomenon because it contains the energies and talents of two brilliant filmmakers              
A  O  Scott writes   Mr  Spielberg seems to be attempting the improbable feat of melding Kubrick s chilly  analytical style with his own warmer  needier sensibility  He tells the story slowly and films it with lucid  mesmerizing objectivity  creating a mood as layered  dissonant and strange as John Williams s unusually restrained  modernist score   He concludes   The very end somehow fuses the cathartic comfort of infantile wish fulfillment    the dream that the first perfect love whose loss we experience as the fall from Eden might be restored    with a feeling almost too terrible to acknowledge or to name  Refusing to cuddle us or lull us into easy sleep  Mr  Spielberg locates the unspoken moral of all our fairy tales  To be real is to be mortal  to be human is to love  to dream and to perish              
Richard Corliss of Time magazine heavily praised Spielberg s direction  as well as the cast and visual effects             
Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film three stars out of a possible four  saying that it is  wonderful and maddening               Ebert later gave the film a full four stars and added it to his  Great Movies  canon in                  
Leonard Maltin  on the other hand  gives the film two stars out of four in his Movie Guide  writing    The  intriguing story draws us in  thanks in part to Osment s exceptional performance  but takes several wrong turns  ultimately  it just doesn t work  Spielberg rewrote the adaptation Stanley Kubrick commissioned of the Brian Aldiss short story Super Toys Last All Summer Long   the  result is a curious and uncomfortable hybrid of Kubrick and Spielberg sensibilities   However  Maltin called John Williams s music score  striking  
Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader compared A I  to Solaris         and praised both  Kubrick for proposing that Spielberg direct the project and Spielberg for doing his utmost to respect Kubrick s intentions while making it a profoundly personal work               In       he described A I  as  a very great and deeply misunderstood film   noting that Andrew Sarris  Stan Brakhage and James Naremore  more or less  agreed with this assessment             
Film critic Armond White of the New York Press praised the film  noting that  each part of David s journey through carnal and sexual universes into the final eschatological devastation becomes as profoundly philosophical and contemplative as anything by cinema s most thoughtful  speculative artists        Borzage  Ozu  Demy  Tarkovsky              
Filmmaker Billy Wilder hailed A I  as  the most underrated film of the past few years               When British filmmaker Ken Russell saw the film  he wept during the ending             
Screenwriter Ian Watson has speculated   Worldwide  A I  was very successful  and the  th highest earner of the year  but it didn t do quite so well in America  because the film  so I m told  was too poetical and intellectual in general for American tastes  Plus  quite a few critics in America misunderstood the film  thinking for instance that the Giacometti style beings in the final    minutes were aliens  whereas they were robots of the future who had evolved themselves from the robots in the earlier part of the film  and also thinking that the final    minutes were a sentimental addition by Spielberg  whereas those scenes were exactly what I wrote for Stanley and exactly what he wanted  filmed faithfully by Spielberg                   note       
Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave a largely negative review   A I  exhibits all its creators  bad traits and none of the good  So we end up with the structureless  meandering  slow motion endlessness of Kubrick combined with the fuzzy  cuddly mindlessness of Spielberg   Dubbing it Spielberg s  first boring movie   LaSalle also believed that the robots at the end of the film were aliens  and compared Gigolo Joe to the  useless  Jar Jar Binks  yet praised Robin Williams for his portrayal of a futuristic Albert Einstein                  failed verification     
Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine gave a mixed review  concluding   Spielberg cannot live up to Kubrick s darker side of the future   but still put the film on his top ten list that year             
David Denby in The New Yorker criticized A I  for not adhering closely to his concept of the Pinocchio character 
Spielberg responded to some of the criticisms of the film  stating that many of the  so called sentimental  elements of A I   including the ending  were in fact Kubrick s  and the darker elements were his own              However  Sara Maitland  who worked on the project with Kubrick in the     s  said that Kubrick never started production on A I  because he had a hard time making the ending work             
James Berardinelli found the film  consistently involving  with moments of near brilliance  but far from a masterpiece  In fact  as the long awaited  collaboration  of Kubrick and Spielberg  it ranks as something of a disappointment   Of the film s highly debated finale  he claimed   There is no doubt that the concluding    minutes are all Spielberg  the outstanding question is where Kubrick s vision left off and Spielberg s began              
John Simon of the National Review described A I   as an uneasy mix of trauma and treacle              
In       Spielberg told film critic Joe Leydon   People pretend to think they know Stanley Kubrick  and think they know me  when most of them don t know either of us    And what s really funny about that is  all the parts of A I  that people assume were Stanley s were mine  And all the parts of A I  that people accuse me of sweetening and softening and sentimentalizing were all Stanley s  The teddy bear was Stanley s  The whole last    minutes of the movie was completely Stanley s  The whole first        minutes of the film all the stuff in the house was word for word  from Stanley s screenplay  This was Stanley s vision    Eighty percent of the critics got it all mixed up  But I could see why  Because  obviously  I ve done a lot of movies where people have cried and have been sentimental  And I ve been accused of sentimentalizing hard core material  But in fact it was Stanley who did the sweetest parts of A I   not me  I m the guy who did the dark center of the movie  with the Flesh Fair and everything else  That s why he wanted me to make the movie in the first place  He said   This is much closer to your sensibilities than my own                Spielberg said   While there was divisiveness when A I  came out  I felt that I had achieved Stanley s wishes  or goals              
On re watching the film many years after its release  BBC film critic Mark Kermode apologized to Spielberg in a January      interview for  getting it wrong  on the film when he first viewed it in       He came to believe that the film is Spielberg s  enduring masterpiece              
In March       The New York Times listed A I  as among  The Movies We ve Loved Since
