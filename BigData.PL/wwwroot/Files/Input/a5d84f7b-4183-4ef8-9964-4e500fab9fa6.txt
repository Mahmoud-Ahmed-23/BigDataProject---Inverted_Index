Deepfake pornography  or simply fake pornography  is a type of synthetic pornography that is created via altering already existing photographs or video by applying deepfake technology to the images of the participants  The use of deepfake pornography has sparked controversy because it involves the making and sharing of realistic videos featuring non consenting individuals  typically female celebrities  and is sometimes used for revenge porn  Efforts are being made to combat these ethical concerns through legislation and technology based solutions 


History edit 
The term  deepfake  was coined in      on a Reddit forum where users shared altered pornographic videos created using machine learning algorithms  It is a combination of the word  deep learning   which refers to the program used to create the videos  and  fake  meaning the videos are not real            
Deepfake pornography was originally created on a small individual scale using a combination of machine learning algorithms  computer vision techniques  and AI software  The process began by gathering a large amount of source material  including both images and videos  of a person s face  and then using a deep learning model to train a Generative Adversarial Network to create a fake video that convincingly swaps the face of the source material onto the body of a pornographic performer  However  the production process has significantly evolved since       with the advent of several public apps that have largely automated the process            
Deepfake pornography is sometimes confused with fake nude photography  but the two are mostly different   Fake nude photography typically uses non sexual images and merely makes it appear that the people in them are nude   

Notable cases edit 
Deepfake technology has been used to create non consensual and pornographic images and videos of famous women  One of the earliest examples occurred in      when a deepfake pornographic video of Gal Gadot was created by a Reddit user and quickly spread online  Since then  there have been numerous instances of similar deepfake content targeting other female celebrities  such as Emma Watson  Natalie Portman  and Scarlett Johansson             Johansson spoke publicly on the issue in December       condemning the practice but also refusing legal action because she views the harassment as inevitable            

Rana Ayyub edit 
In       Rana Ayyub  an Indian investigative journalist  was the target of an online hate campaign stemming from her condemnation of the Indian government  specifically her speaking out against the rape of an eight year old Kashmiri girl  Ayyub was bombarded with rape and death threats  and had doctored pornographic video of her circulated online             In a Huffington Post article  Ayyub discussed the long lasting psychological and social effects this experience has had on her  She explained that she continued to struggle with her mental health and how the images and videos continued to resurface whenever she took a high profile case            

Atrioc controversy edit 
In       Twitch streamer Atrioc stirred controversy when he accidentally revealed deepfake pornographic material featuring female Twitch streamers while on live  The influencer has since admitted to paying for AI generated porn  and apologized to the women and his fans                       

Taylor Swift edit 
Main article  Taylor Swift deepfake pornography controversy
In January       AI generated sexually explicit images of American singer Taylor Swift were posted on X  formerly Twitter   and spread to other platforms such as Facebook  Reddit and Instagram                                     One tweet with the images was viewed over    million times before being removed                          A report from     Media found that the images appeared to have originated from a Telegram group  whose members used tools such as Microsoft Designer to generate the images  using misspellings and keyword hacks to work around Designer s content filters                          After the material was posted  Swift s fans posted concert footage and images to bury the deepfake images  and reported the accounts posting the deepfakes              Searches for Swift s name were temporarily disabled on X  returning an error message instead              Graphika  a disinformation research firm  traced the creation of the images back to a  chan community                         
A source close to Swift told the Daily Mail that she would be considering legal action  saying   Whether or not legal action will be taken is being decided  but there is one thing that is clear  These fake AI generated images are abusive  offensive  exploitative  and done without Taylor s consent and or knowledge                          
The controversy drew condemnation from White House Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre              Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella              the Rape  Abuse  amp  Incest National Network              and SAG AFTRA              Several US politicians called for federal legislation against deepfake pornography              Later in the month  US senators Dick Durbin  Lindsey Graham  Amy Klobuchar and Josh Hawley introduced a bipartisan bill that would allow victims to sue individuals who produced or possessed  digital forgeries  with intent to distribute  or those who received the material knowing it was made non consensually             

     Telegram deepfake scandal edit 
It emerged in South Korea in August       that many teachers and female students were victims of deepfake images created by users who utilized AI technology  Journalist Ko Narin of The Hankyoreh uncovered the deepfake images through Telegram chats                                      On Telegram  group chats were created specifically for image based sexual abuse of women  including middle and high school students  teachers  and even family members  Women with photos on social media platforms like KakaoTalk  Instagram  and Facebook are often targeted as well  Perpetrators use AI bots to generate fake images  which are then sold or widely shared  along with the victims  social media accounts  phone numbers  and KakaoTalk usernames  One Telegram group reportedly drew around         members  according to a Guardian report 
Investigations revealed numerous chat groups on Telegram where users  mainly teenagers  create and share explicit deepfake images of classmates and teachers  The issue came in the wake of a troubling history of digital sex crimes  notably the notorious Nth Room case in       The Korean Teachers Union estimated that more than     schools had been affected by these incidents  Activists called for a  national emergency  declaration to address the problem              South Korean police reported over     deepfake sex crime cases by the end of September       a stark rise from just     cases in       with most victims and offenders being teenagers             
On September           people gathered at Marronnier Park in northeastern Seoul to demand stronger legal action against deepfake crimes targeting women              On September     following widespread outrage over the Telegram scandal  South Korean lawmakers passed a bill criminalizing the possession or viewing of sexually explicit deepfake images and videos  imposing penalties that include prison terms and fines  Under the new law  those caught buying  saving  or watching such material could face up to three years in prison or fines up to    million won            At the time the bill was proposed  creating sexually explicit deepfakes for distribution carried a maximum penalty of five years  but the new legislation would increase this to seven years  regardless of intent             
By October       it was estimated that  nudify  deep fake bots on Telegram were up to four million monthly users                         

Ethical considerations edit 
Deepfake child pornography edit 
Deepfake technology has made the creation of child pornography  faster and easier than it has ever been  Deepfakes can be used to produce new child pornography from already existing material or creating pornography from children who have not been subjected to sexual abuse  Deepfake child pornography can  however  have real and direct implications on children including defamation  grooming  extortion  and bullying             

Differences from generative AI pornography edit 
Main article  Generative AI pornography
While both deepfake pornography and generative AI pornography utilize synthetic media  they differ in approach and ethical implications              Generative AI pornography is created entirely through algorithms  producing hyper realistic content unlinked to real individuals                          In contrast  Deepfake pornography alters existing footage of real individuals  often without consent  by superimposing faces or modifying scenes                          Hany Farid  a digital image analysis expert  has emphasized these distinctions             

Consent edit 
Most deepfake pornography is made using the faces of people who did not consent to their image being used in such a sexual way  In       Sensity  an identify verification company  has found that      of deepfakes are sexually explicit and feature women who didn t consent to the creation of the content              

Combatting deepfake pornography edit 
Technical approach edit 
Deepfake detection has become an increasingly important area of research in recent years as the spread of fake videos and images has become more prevalent  One promising approach to detecting deepfakes is through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks  CNNs   which have shown high accuracy in distinguishing between real and fake images  One CNN based algorithm that has been developed specifically for deepfake detection is DeepRhythm  which has demonstrated an impressive accuracy score of       i e  successful at detecting deepfake images     of the time   This algorithm utilizes a pre trained CNN to extract features from facial regions of interest and then applies a novel attention mechanism to identify discrepancies between the original and manipulated images  While the development of more sophisticated deepfake technology presents ongoing challenges to detection efforts  the high accuracy of algorithms like DeepRhythm offers a promising tool for identifying and mitigating the spread of harmful deepfakes            
Aside from detection models  there are also video authenticating tools available to the public  In       Deepware launched the first publicly available detection tool which allowed users to easily scan and detect deepfake videos  Similarly  in      Microsoft released a free and user friendly video authenticator  Users upload a suspected video or input a link  and receive a confidence score to assess the level of manipulation in a deepfake 

Legal approach edit 
As of           update      there is a lack of legislation that specifically addresses deepfake pornography  Instead  the harm caused by its creation and distribution is being addressed by the courts through existing criminal and civil laws             
Victims of deepfake pornography often have claims for revenge porn  tort claims  and harassment              The legal consequences for revenge porn vary from state to state and country to country                           For instance  in Canada  the penalty for publishing non consensual intimate images is up to   years in prison              whereas in Malta it is a fine of up to                    
The  Deepfake Accountability Act  was introduced to the United States Congress in      but died in                   It aimed to make the production and distribution of digitally altered visual media that was not disclosed to be such  a criminal offense  The title specifies that making any sexual  non consensual altered media with the intent of humiliating or otherwise harming the participants  may be fined  imprisoned for up to   years or both              A newer version of bill was introduced in      which would have required any  advanced technological false personation records  to contain a watermark and an audiovisual disclosure to identify and explain any altered audio and visual elements  The bill also includes that failure to disclose this information with intent to harass or humiliate a person with an  advanced technological false personation record  containing sexual content  shall be fined under this title  imprisoned for not more than   years  or both   However this bill has since died in                  
In the United Kingdom  the Law Commission for England and Wales recommended reform to criminalise sharing of deepfake pornography in                   In       the government announced amendments to the Online Safety Bill to that end  The Online Safety Act      amends the Sexual Offences Act      to criminalise sharing intimate images that shows or  appears to show  another  thus including deepfake images  without consent              In       the Government announced that an offence criminalising the production of deepfake pornographic images would be included in the Criminal Justice Bill of                               The Bill did not pass before Parliament was dissolved before the general election 
In South Korea  the creation  distribution  or possession of deepfake pornography is classified as a sex crime  with a mandatory prison sentence between three to seven years as part of the country s Special Act on Sexual Violence Crimes             

Controlling the distribution edit 
While the legal landscape remains undeveloped  victims of deepfake pornography have several tools available to contain and remove content  including securing removal through a court order  intellectual property tools like the DMCA takedown  reporting for terms and conditions violations of the hosting platform  and removal by reporting the content to search engines             
Several major online platforms have taken steps to ban deepfake pornography  As of           update      gfycat  reddit  Twitter  Discord  and Pornhub have all prohibited the uploading and sharing of deepfake pornographic content on their platforms                          In September of that same year  Google also added  involuntary synthetic pornographic imagery  to its ban list  allowing individuals to request the removal of such content from search results
