A chatbot  originally chatterbot             is a software application or web interface designed to have textual or spoken conversations                                   Modern chatbots are typically online and use generative artificial intelligence systems that are capable of maintaining a conversation with a user in natural language and simulating the way a human would behave as a conversational partner  Such chatbots often use deep learning and natural language processing  but simpler chatbots have existed for decades 
Although chatbots have existed since the late     s  the field gained widespread attention in the early     s due to the popularity of OpenAI s ChatGPT                        followed by alternatives such as Microsoft s Copilot  DeepSeek and Google s Gemini             Such examples reflect the recent practice of basing such products upon broad foundational large language models  such as GPT   or the Gemini language model  that get fine tuned so as to target specific tasks or applications  i e   simulating human conversation  in the case of chatbots   Chatbots can also be designed or customized to further target even more specific situations and or particular subject matter domains            
A major area where chatbots have long been used is in customer service and support  with various sorts of virtual assistants             Companies spanning a wide range of industries have begun using the latest generative artificial intelligence technologies to power more advanced developments in such areas            


History edit 
Turing test edit 
In       Alan Turing s famous article  Computing Machinery and Intelligence  was published              which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence  This criterion depends on the ability of a computer program to impersonate a human in a real time written conversation with a human judge to the extent that the judge is unable to distinguish reliably on the basis of the conversational content alone between the program and a real human 

Eliza edit 
The notoriety of Turing s proposed test stimulated great interest in Joseph Weizenbaum s program ELIZA  published in       which seemed to be able to fool users into believing that they were conversing with a real human  However Weizenbaum himself did not claim that ELIZA was genuinely intelligent  and the introduction to his paper presented it more as a debunking exercise In artificial intelligence  machines are made to behave in wondrous ways  often sufficient to dazzle even the most experienced observer  But once a particular program is unmasked  once its inner workings are explained  its magic crumbles away  it stands revealed as a mere collection of procedures  The observer says to himself  I could have written that   With that thought  he moves the program in question from the shelf marked  intelligent   to that reserved for curios  The object of this paper is to cause just such a re evaluation of the program about to be  explained   Few programs ever needed it more             ELIZA s key method of operation involves the recognition of clue words or phrases in the input  and the output of the corresponding pre prepared or pre programmed responses that can move the conversation forward in an apparently meaningful way  e g  by responding to any input that contains the word  MOTHER  with  TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY                Thus an illusion of understanding is generated  even though the processing involved has been merely superficial  ELIZA showed that such an illusion is surprisingly easy to generate because human judges are ready to give the benefit of the doubt when conversational responses are capable of being interpreted as  intelligent  
Interface designers have come to appreciate that humans  readiness to interpret computer output as genuinely conversational even when it is actually based on rather simple pattern matching can be exploited for useful purposes  Most people prefer to engage with programs that are human like  and this gives chatbot style techniques a potentially useful role in interactive systems that need to elicit information from users  as long as that information is relatively straightforward and falls into predictable categories  Thus  for example  online help systems can usefully employ chatbot techniques to identify the area of help that users require  potentially providing a  friendlier  interface than a more formal search or menu system  This sort of usage holds the prospect of moving chatbot technology from Weizenbaum s  shelf     reserved for curios  to that marked  genuinely useful computational methods  

Early chatbots edit 
Among the most notable early chatbots are ELIZA        and PARRY                                                         More recent notable programs include A L I C E   Jabberwacky and D U D E  Agence Nationale de la Recherche and CNRS        While ELIZA and PARRY were used exclusively to simulate typed conversation  many chatbots now include other functional features  such as games and web searching abilities  In       a book called The Policeman s Beard is Half Constructed was published  allegedly written by the chatbot Racter  though the program as released would not have been capable of doing so              
From                  to some time after                   the CYRUS project led by Janet Kolodner constructed a chatbot simulating Cyrus Vance    th United States Secretary of State   It used case based reasoning  and updated its database daily by parsing wire news from United Press International  The program was unable to process the news items subsequent to the surprise resignation of Cyrus Vance in April       and the team constructed another chatbot simulating his successor  Edmund Muskie                         
One pertinent field of AI research is natural language processing  Usually  weak AI fields employ specialized software or programming languages created specifically for the narrow function required  For example  A L I C E  uses a markup language called AIML             which is specific to its function as a conversational agent  and has since been adopted by various other developers of  so called  Alicebots  Nevertheless  A L I C E  is still purely based on pattern matching techniques without any reasoning capabilities  the same technique ELIZA was using back in       This is not strong AI  which would require sapience and logical reasoning abilities 
Jabberwacky learns new responses and context based on real time user interactions  rather than being driven from a static database  Some more recent chatbots also combine real time learning with evolutionary algorithms that optimize their ability to communicate based on each conversation held 
Chatbot competitions focus on the Turing test or more specific goals  Two such annual contests are the Loebner Prize and The Chatterbox Challenge  the latter has been offline since       however  materials can still be found from web archives              
DBpedia created a chatbot during the GSoC of                   It can communicate through Facebook Messenger 

Modern chatbots based on large language models edit 
Modern chatbots like ChatGPT are often based on large language models called generative pre trained transformers  GPT   They are based on a deep learning architecture called the transformer  which contains artificial neural networks  They learn how to generate text by being trained on a large text corpus  which provides a solid foundation for the model to perform well on downstream tasks with limited amounts of task specific data  Despite criticism of its accuracy and tendency to  hallucinate  that is  to confidently output false information and even cite non existent sources ChatGPT has gained attention for its detailed responses and historical knowledge  Another example is BioGPT  developed by Microsoft  which focuses on answering biomedical questions                          In November       Amazon announced a new chatbot  called Q  for people to use at work

Messaging apps edit 
Many companies  chatbots run on messaging apps or simply via SMS  They are used for B C customer service  sales and marketing             
In       Facebook Messenger allowed developers to place chatbots on their platform  There were        bots created for Messenger in the first six months  rising to         by September                  
Since September       this has also been as part of a pilot program on WhatsApp  Airlines KLM and Aerom xico both announced their participation in the testing                                                  both airlines had previously launched customer services on the Facebook Messenger platform  
The bots usually appear as one of the user s contacts  but can sometimes act as participants in a group chat 
Many banks  insurers  media companies  e commerce companies  airlines  hotel chains  retailers  health care providers  government entities  and restaurant chains have used chatbots to answer simple questions  increase customer engagement              for promotion  and to offer additional ways to order from them              Chatbots are also used in market research to collect short survey responses             
A      study showed    of companies used chatbots              In a      study      of businesses said they intended to have one by                  

As part of company apps and websites edit 
Previous generations of chatbots were present on company websites  e g  Ask Jenn from Alaska Airlines which debuted in                  or Expedia s virtual customer service agent which launched in                               The newer generation of chatbots includes IBM Watson powered  Rocky   introduced in February      by the New York City based e commerce company Rare Carat to provide information to prospective diamond buyers                         

Chatbot sequences edit 
Used by marketers to script sequences of messages  very similar to an autoresponder sequence  Such sequences can be triggered by user opt in or the use of keywords within user interactions  After a trigger occurs a sequence of messages is delivered until the next anticipated user response  Each user response is used in the decision tree to help the chatbot navigate the response sequences to deliver the correct response message 

Company internal platforms edit 
Companies have used chatbots for customer support  human resources  or in Internet of Things  IoT  projects  Overstock com  for one  has reportedly launched a chatbot named Mila to attempt to automate certain processes when customer service employees request sick leave              Other large companies such as Lloyds Banking Group  Royal Bank of Scotland  Renault and Citro n are now using chatbots instead of call centres with humans to provide a first point of contact      citation needed      In large companies  like in hospitals and aviation organizations  chatbots are also used to share information within organizations  and to assist and replace service desks      citation needed     

Customer service edit 
Chatbots have been proposed as a replacement for customer service departments              
Deep learning techniques can be incorporated into chatbot applications to allow them to map conversations between users and customer service agents  especially in social media             
In       Gartner predicted that by           of all customer service interactions globally will be handled completely by AI               A study by Juniper Research in      estimates retail sales resulting from chatbot based interactions will reach      billion by                  
In       Russia based Tochka Bank launched a chatbot on Facebook for a range of financial services  including a possibility of making payments              In July       Barclays Africa also launched a Facebook chatbot             
In       US based National Eating Disorders Association replaced its human helpline staff with a chatbot but had to take it offline after users reported receiving harmful advice from it                                     

Healthcare edit 
See also  Artificial intelligence in healthcareChatbots are also appearing in the healthcare industry                          A study suggested that physicians in the United States believed that chatbots would be most beneficial for scheduling doctor appointments  locating health clinics  or providing medication information             
ChatGPT is able to answer user queries related to health promotion and disease prevention such as screening and vaccination              WhatsApp has teamed up with the World Health Organization  WHO  to make a chatbot service that answers users  questions on COVID                
In       the Government of India launched a chatbot called MyGov Corona Helpdesk              that worked through WhatsApp and helped people access information about the Coronavirus  COVID     pandemic                         
Certain patient groups are still reluctant to use chatbots  A mixed methods      study showed that people are still hesitant to use chatbots for their healthcare due to poor understanding of the technological complexity  the lack of empathy  and concerns about cyber security  The analysis showed that while    had heard of a health chatbot and    had experience of using it      perceived themselves as likely to use one within    months  The majority of participants would use a health chatbot for seeking general health information        booking a medical appointment        and looking for local health services        However  a health chatbot was perceived as less suitable for seeking results of medical tests and seeking specialist advice such as sexual health             
The analysis of attitudinal variables showed that most participants reported their preference for discussing their health with doctors       and having access to reliable and accurate health information        While     were curious about new technologies that could improve their health      reported only seeking a doctor when experiencing a health problem and     thought that a chatbot was a good idea      reported dislike about talking to computers      felt it would be strange to discuss health matters with a chatbot and about half were unsure if they could trust the advice given by a chatbot  Therefore  perceived trustworthiness  individual attitudes towards bots  and dislike for talking to computers are the main barriers to health chatbots                         

Politics edit 
See also  Government by algorithm        AI politicians
In New Zealand  the chatbot SAM   short for Semantic Analysis Machine               has been developed by Nick Gerritsen of Touchtech              It is designed to share its political thoughts  for example on topics such as climate change  healthcare and education  etc  It talks to people through Facebook Messenger                                                 
In       the chatbot  Leader Lars  or  Leder Lars  was nominated for The Synthetic Party to run in the Danish parliamentary election              and was built by the artist collective Computer Lars              Leader Lars differed from earlier virtual politicians by leading a political party and by not pretending to be an objective candidate              This chatbot engaged in critical discussions on politics with users from around the world             
In India  the state government has launched a chatbot for its Aaple Sarkar platform              which provides conversational access to information regarding public services managed                         

Toys edit 
Chatbots have also been incorporated into devices not primarily meant for computing  such as toys             
Hello Barbie is an Internet connected version of the doll that uses a chatbot provided by the company ToyTalk              which previously used the chatbot for a range of smartphone based characters for children              These characters  behaviors are constrained by a set of rules that in effect emulate a particular character and produce a storyline             
The My Friend Cayla doll was marketed as a line of    inch          cm  dolls which uses speech recognition technology in conjunction with an Android or iOS mobile app to recognize the child s speech and have a conversation  Like the Hello Barbie doll  it attracted controversy due to vulnerabilities with the doll s Bluetooth stack and its use of data collected from the child s speech 
IBM s Watson computer has been used as the basis for chatbot based educational toys for companies such as CogniToys              intended to interact with children for educational purposes             

Malicious use edit 
Malicious chatbots are frequently used to fill chat rooms with spam and advertisements by mimicking human behavior and conversations or to entice people into revealing personal information  such as bank account numbers  They were commonly found on Yahoo  Messenger  Windows Live Messenger  AOL Instant Messenger and other instant messaging protocols  There has also been a published report of a chatbot used in a fake personal ad on a dating service s website             
Tay  an AI chatbot designed to learn from previous interaction  caused major controversy due to it being targeted by internet trolls on Twitter  Soon after its launch  the bot was exploited  and with its  repeat after me  capability  it started releasing racist  sexist  and controversial responses to Twitter users              This suggests that although the bot learned effectively from experience  adequate protection was not put in place to prevent misuse             
If a text sending algorithm can pass itself off as a human instead of a chatbot  its message would be more credible  Therefore  human seeming chatbots with well crafted online identities could start scattering fake news that seems plausible  for instance making false claims during an election  With enough chatbots  it might be even possible to achieve artificial social proof                         

Data security edit 
Data security is one of the major concerns of chatbot technologies  Security threats and system vulnerabilities are weaknesses that are often exploited by malicious users  Storage of user data and past communication  that is highly valuable for training and development of chatbots  can also give rise to security threats              Chatbots operating on third party networks may be subject to various security issues if owners of the third party applications have policies regarding user data that differ from those of the chatbot              Security threats can be reduced or prevented by incorporating protective mechanisms  User authentication  chat End to end encryption  and self destructing messages are some effective solutions to resist potential security threats             

Mental health edit 
Chatbots have shown to be an emerging technology used in the field of mental health  Its usage may encourage the users to seek advice on matters of mental health as a means to avoid the stigmatization that may come from sharing such matters with other people               This is because chatbots can give a sense of privacy and anonymity when sharing sensitive information  as well as providing a space that allows for the user to be free of judgment               An example of this can be seen in a study which found that with social media and AI chatbots both being possible outlets to express mental health online  users were more willing to share their darker and more depressive       emotions to the chatbot              
Findings prove that chatbots have great potential in scenarios in which it is difficult for users to reach out to family or friends for support               It has been noted that it demonstrates the ability to give young people  various types of social support such as appraisal  informational  emotional  and instrumental support               Studies have found that chatbots are able to assist users in managing things such as depression and anxiety               Some examples of chatbots that serve this function are  Woebot  Wysa  Vivibot  and Tess               
Evidence indicates that when mental health chatbots interact with users  they tend to follow certain conversation flows              These being guided conversation  semi guided conversation  and open ended conversation              The most popular  guided conversation   only allows the users to communicate with the chatbot with predefined responses from the chatbot  It does not allow any form of open input from the users               It has also been noted in a study looking at the methods employed by various mental health chatbots  that most of them employed a form of cognitive behavior therapy with the user             
Research has identified that there are potential barriers to entry that come with the usage of chatbots for mental health              There exist ongoing privacy concerns with sharing user s personal data in chat logs with chatbots              In addition to that  there exists a lack of willingness from those in lower socioeconomic statuses to adopt interactions with chatbots as a meaningful way to improve upon mental health              Though chatbots may be capable of detecting simple human emotions in interactions with users  they are incapable of replicating the level of empathy that human therapists do              Due to the nature of chatbots being language learning models trained on numerous datasets  the issue of Algorithmic Bias exists              Chatbots with built in biases from their training can have them brought out against individuals of certain backgrounds and may result incorrect information being conveyed             
There is a lack of research about how exactly these interactions help with a user s real life              Additionally  there are concerns regarding the safety of users when interacting with such chatbots              When improvements and advancements are made to such technologies  how that may affect humans is not a priority              It is possible that this can lead to  unintended negative consequences  such as biases  inadequate and failed responses  and privacy issues              
A risk that may come about because of the usage of chatbots to deal with mental health is increased isolation  as well as a lack of support in times of crisis              Another notable risk is a general lack of a strong understanding of mental health               Studies have indicated that mental health oriented chatbots have been prone to recommending users medical solutions and to rely upon themselves heavily             

Limitations of chatbots edit 
This section needs expansion  You can help by adding to it    December      
Chatbots have difficulty managing non linear conversations that must go back and forth on a topic with a user             
Large language models are more versatile  but require a large amount of conversational data to train  These modeles generate new responses word by word based on user input  are usually trained on a large dataset of natural language phrases             They sometimes provide plausible sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers  They can make up names  dates  historical events  and even simple math problems              When large language models produce coherent sounding but inaccurate or fabricated content  this is referred to as  hallucinations   When humans use and apply chatbot content contaminated with hallucinations  this results in  botshit               Given the increasing adoption and use of chatbots for generating content  there are concerns that this technology will significantly reduce the cost it takes humans to generate misinformation             

Impact on jobs edit 
Chatbots and technology in general used to automate repetitive tasks  But advanced chatbots like ChatGPT are also targeting high paying  creative  and knowledge based jobs  raising concerns about workforce disruption and quality trade offs in favor of cost cutting             
Chatbots are increasingly used by small and medium enterprises  to handle customer interactions efficiently  reducing reliance on large call centers and lowering operational costs             
Prompt engineering  the task of designing and refining prompts  inputs  leading to desired AI generated responses has quickly gained significant demand with the advent of large language models              although the viability of this job is questioned due to new techniques for automating prompt engineering             

Impact on the environment edit

Generative AI uses a high amount of electric power  Due to reliance on fossil fuels in its generation  this increases air pollution  water pollution  and greenhouse gas emissions  In       a question to ChatGPT consumed on average    times as much energy as a Google search              Data centres in general  and those used for AI tasks specifically  consume significant amounts of water for cooling
