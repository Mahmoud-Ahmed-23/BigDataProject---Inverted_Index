In mathematics  the term linear is used in two distinct senses for two different properties 

linearity of a function  or mapping  
linearity of a polynomial 
An example of a linear function is the function defined by 
  
    
      
        f
         
        x
         
         
         
        a
        x
         
        b
        x
         
      
    
      displaystyle f x   ax bx  
  
 that maps the real line to a line in the Euclidean plane R  that passes through the origin  An example of a linear polynomial in the variables 
  
    
      
        X
         
      
    
      displaystyle X  
  
 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
      displaystyle Y 
  
 and 
  
    
      
        Z
      
    
      displaystyle Z 
  
 is 
  
    
      
        a
        X
         
        b
        Y
         
        c
        Z
         
        d
         
      
    
      displaystyle aX bY cZ d  
  
 
Linearity of a mapping is closely related to proportionality  Examples in physics include the linear relationship of voltage and current in an electrical conductor  Ohm s law   and the relationship of mass and weight  By contrast  more complicated relationships  such as between velocity and kinetic energy  are nonlinear 
Generalized for functions in more than one dimension  linearity means the property of a function of being compatible with addition and scaling  also known as the superposition principle 
Linearity of a polynomial means that its degree is less than two  The use of the term for polynomials stems from the fact that the graph of a polynomial in one variable is a straight line  In the term  linear equation   the word refers to the linearity of the polynomials involved 
Because a function such as 
  
    
      
        f
         
        x
         
         
        a
        x
         
        b
      
    
      displaystyle f x  ax b 
  
 is defined by a linear polynomial in its argument  it is sometimes also referred to as being a  linear function   and the relationship between the argument and the function value may be referred to as a  linear relationship   This is potentially confusing  but usually the intended meaning will be clear from the context 
The word linear comes from Latin linearis   pertaining to or resembling a line  


In mathematics edit 
Linear maps edit 
In mathematics  a linear map or linear function f x  is a function that satisfies the two properties            

Additivity  f x   y    f x    f y  
Homogeneity of degree    f  x      f x  for all   
These properties are known as the superposition principle  In this definition  x is not necessarily a real number  but can in general be an element of any vector space  A more special definition of linear function  not coinciding with the definition of linear map  is used in elementary mathematics  see below  
Additivity alone implies homogeneity for rational    since 
  
    
      
        f
         
        x
         
        x
         
         
        f
         
        x
         
         
        f
         
        x
         
      
    
      displaystyle f x x  f x  f x  
  
 implies

 for any natural number n by mathematical induction  and then

      displaystyle nf x  f nx  f m  tfrac  n  m  x  mf   tfrac  n  m  x  
  
 implies 
  
    
      
        f
         
        
          
            
              n
              m

  The density of the rational numbers in the reals implies that any additive continuous function is homogeneous for any real number    and is therefore linear 
The concept of linearity can be extended to linear operators  Important examples of linear operators include the derivative considered as a differential operator  and other operators constructed from it  such as del and the Laplacian  When a differential equation can be expressed in linear form  it can generally be solved by breaking the equation up into smaller pieces  solving each of those pieces  and summing the solutions 

Linear polynomials edit 
Main articles  Linear equation and Linear algebra
In a different usage to the above definition  a polynomial of degree   is said to be linear  because the graph of a function of that form is a straight line             
Over the reals  a simple example of a linear equation is given by 


  
    
      
        y
         
        m
        x
         
        b
          xa  
      
    
      displaystyle y mx b   
  

where m is often called the slope or gradient  and b the y intercept  which gives the point of intersection between the graph of the function and the y axis 
Note that this usage of the term linear is not the same as in the section above  because linear polynomials over the real numbers do not in general satisfy either additivity or homogeneity  In fact  they do so if and only if the constant term   b in the example   equals    If b      the function is called an affine function  see in greater generality affine transformation  
Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerned with systems of linear equations

A Boolean function is linear if one of the following holds for the function s truth table 

In every row in which the truth value of the function is T  there are an odd number of Ts assigned to the arguments  and in every row in which the function is F there is an even number of Ts assigned to arguments  Specifically  f F  F       F    F  and these functions correspond to linear maps over the Boolean vector space 
In every row in which the value of the function is T  there is an even number of Ts assigned to the arguments of the function  and in every row in which the truth value of the function is F  there are an odd number of Ts assigned to arguments  In this case  f F  F       F    T 
Another way to express this is that each variable always makes a difference in the truth value of the operation or it never makes a difference 
Negation  Logical biconditional  exclusive or  tautology  and contradiction are linear functions 

Physics edit 
Main article  Superposition principle
In physics  linearity is a property of the differential equations governing many systems  for instance  the Maxwell equations or the diffusion equation            
Linearity of a homogenous differential equation means that if two functions f and g are solutions of the equation  then any linear combination af   bg is  too 
In instrumentation  linearity means that a given change in an input variable gives the same change in the output of the measurement apparatus  this is highly desirable in scientific work  In general  instruments are close to linear over a certain range  and most useful within that range  In contrast  human senses are highly nonlinear  for instance  the brain completely ignores incoming light unless it exceeds a certain absolute threshold number of photons 
Linear motion traces a straight line trajectory 

Electronics edit 
In electronics  the linear operating region of a device  for example a transistor  is where an output dependent variable  such as the transistor collector current  is directly proportional to an input dependent variable  such as the base current   This ensures that an analog output is an accurate representation of an input  typically with higher amplitude  amplified   A typical example of linear equipment is a high fidelity audio amplifier  which must amplify a signal without changing its waveform  Others are linear filters  and linear amplifiers in general 
In most scientific and technological  as distinct from mathematical  applications  something may be described as linear if the characteristic is approximately but not exactly a straight line  and linearity may be valid only within a certain operating region for example  a high fidelity amplifier may distort a small signal  but sufficiently little to be acceptable  acceptable but imperfect linearity   and may distort very badly if the input exceeds a certain value            

Integral linearity edit 
Main article  Integral linearity
For an electronic device  or other physical device  that converts a quantity to another quantity  Bertram S  Kolts writes                       

There are three basic definitions for integral linearity in common use  independent linearity  zero based linearity  and terminal  or end point  linearity  In each case  linearity defines how well the device s actual performance across a specified operating range approximates a straight line  Linearity is usually measured in terms of a deviation  or non linearity  from an ideal straight line and it is typically expressed in terms of percent of full scale  or in ppm  parts per million  of full scale  Typically  the straight line is obtained by performing a least squares fit of the data  The three definitions vary in the manner in which the straight line is positioned relative to the actual device s performance  Also  all three of these definitions ignore any gain  or offset errors that may be present in the actual device s performance characteristics
