       Release all of the Hostages now  not later  and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered  or it is OVER for you         Trump wrote  He added         I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job  not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don       t do as I say         Trump also urged Hamas leadership to leave Gaza and told the people of Gaza that        a beautiful Future awaits  but not if you hold Hostages  If you do  you are DEAD

Trump       s ultimatum coincided with reactions to an Arab backed Egyptian plan to rebuild Gaza 
Hamas announced its support on Tuesday for the Arab backed Egyptian plan to rebuild the Gaza Strip  urging measures to ensure its success  In a statement  Hamas said   We welcome the Arab Summit s plan to rebuild Gaza and call for all necessary steps to guarantee its success  We also appreciate Egypt s efforts in preparing for an international conference on reconstruction  
However  Israel and the United States dismissed the plan  The Israeli government reaffirmed its support for Trump s proposal  which calls for relocating Palestinians to Jordan and Egypt an idea Arab nations have firmly rejected  Israel criticised the summit s reliance on the Palestinian Authority and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees  UNRWA   accusing them of corruption and ties to terrorism  Additionally  Israel denounced the Cairo Summit s final statement  arguing that it failed to account for  the realities on the ground following October     Israeli officials urged regional leaders to  move beyond outdated policies and work toward lasting stability and security  
The White House also opposed the Arab plan for Gaza reconstruction  A spokesperson from the US National Security Council stated   The published Arab plan does not address the current situation  Gaza is uninhabitable  and its residents cannot live with dignity in an area filled with unexploded ordnance and rubble   The spokesperson added   President Donald Trump remains committed to his vision of rebuilding Gaza free of Hamas   and expressed hopes for further discussions to promote stability and peace in the region 
The final statement of the Arab Summit condemned the Israeli government s decision to halt the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip and to close the crossings used for relief work  It emphasized that these Israeli measures violate the ceasefire agreement in Gaza and international humanitarian law  The statement reaffirmed the rejection of Israel s use of blockade and starvation of civilians as a means to achieve political objectives  It stressed the need for Israel to adhere to relevant resolutions of international legitimacy and reiterated the Arab countries  rejection of attempts to alter the demographic composition of the Palestinian territories 
Arab leaders reaffirmed their strategic choice to pursue a just and comprehensive peace that respects all rights of the Palestinian people  particularly their right to freedom and an independent sovereign state on their land based on the two state solution  as well as the right of return for Palestinian refugees  This approach aims to ensure security for all peoples and countries in the region  including Israel
