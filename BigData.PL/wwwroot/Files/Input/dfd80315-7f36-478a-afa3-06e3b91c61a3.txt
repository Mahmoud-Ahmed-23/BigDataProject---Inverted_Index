							The American University in Cairo       s  AUC  Office of Student Development and Writing program held its two day annual undergraduate research conference  Celebrating its third   year  AUC faculty members chose    students to present their work before their peers in Oriental Hall  ending last Thursday    
       A few years ago  there only used to be a research conference for AUC faculty and graduate students  I thought why not establish one for undergraduates   said Amani El Shimi  co founder of the undergraduate research conference 
Students from all majors were encouraged to submit research proposals  statements and a final essay on topics they chose that represented initiatives integral to the Middle East 
AUC Political Science senior Rana Hassanien took the stage early Wednesday morning with her essay on the need to reform international schools in Cairo  
Based on her experience as a high school student in Egypt       s top rated private international school  Cairo American Collage  CAC   Hassanien declared that        as an Egyptian graduating from an international school in Cairo  I lack the Arabic skills needed for me to interact effectively in Egypt       s employment force  Because my English has become so fluent  I       m more likely to work abroad  but what if I want to stay at home  
Her essay included the recommendation that        perhaps Egyptian students attending international schools should be traded the requirement of learning two years of Middle East history instead of US history  instead of having to take a foreign language  let us take Arabic   Hassanein said 
After a conference intermission late Thursday afternoon  Rola Ayman presented her essay on female sexual harassment in Cairo  telling AUC faculty and students that        the mass sexual harassment of women in downtown Cairo by scores of young men must stop   
Ayman       s research paper encouraged her and a team of friends to design billboards that read in Arabic         Don       t put yourself in such a position   referring to men in Cairo who        find it manly to sexually harass women   They expect Cairo to be flooded with their message loaded billboards by early fall this year 
Graduating senior Joseph Mbombo came from The Democratic Republic of Congo  DRC  to study political science at AUC  In a presentation attended by over    students  Mbombo spoke about the weak relationship financial aid donors have with countries such as Egypt and the DRC  Through his research  Mbombo discovered how little foreign donors target civil society organizations in developing nations  a place where the poor can voice their opinions  
       If foreign donors were really concerned about spreading democracy  this is where they       d be putting their money  not in the military   he said  
Although El Shimi found the low student turn out frustrating  she also took into consideration the pressure students face during the end of the semester         Still this is a great opportunity for students and I hope to see the undergraduate research conference become just as popular as the Model UN    El Shimi  along with co founder of the AUC undergraduate research conference  Diana Blevins  hopes to establish a center for undergraduate research in AUC       s new campus next year  
       In the future  this center would be able to provide awards for our students  or grants that would allow them to present abroad  Such exposure can prepare them to deal with the world of academia more seriously   said El Shimi 
       Last year  a student from Bryn Mawr College received a grant from her college to present her research at AUC  this year we accepted a student from Sadat Academy   El Shimi hopes such exchange will continue to prosper and attract more attention to AUC       s Writing Program initiative      
Blevins told The Daily Star Egypt         This conference means a lot of good for AUC  For one thing  it is a platform for undergraduate students seeking to complete a Ph D  
AUC marketing junior Sarah El Guindi also presented at this year       s conference         I think creating an undergraduate research conference was a great idea  it gave me the chance to use my research skills to talk about a serious issue in Egypt  that is cancer awareness   she said 
El Guindi is pleased to have AUC Press publish her article in this year       s undergraduate research journal         It       s nice being this young and getting work published  More importantly  we       re being active students  a role AUC students should take more seriously
