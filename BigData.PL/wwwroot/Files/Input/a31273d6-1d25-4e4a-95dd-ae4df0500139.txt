IBM originated with several technological innovations developed and commercialized in the late   th century  Julius E  Pitrap patented the computing scale in                   Alexander Dey invented the dial recorder                     Herman Hollerith patented the Electric Tabulating Machine                     and Willard Bundy invented a time clock to record workers  arrival and departure times on a paper tape                     On June           their four companies were amalgamated in New York State by Charles Ranlett Flint forming a fifth company  the Computing Tabulating Recording Company  CTR  based in Endicott  New York                         The five companies had       employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton  New York  Dayton  Ohio  Detroit  Michigan  Washington  D C   and Toronto  Canada             
Collectively  the companies manufactured a wide array of machinery for sale and lease  ranging from commercial scales and industrial time recorders  meat and cheese slicers  to tabulators and punched cards  Thomas J  Watson  Sr   fired from the National Cash Register Company by John Henry Patterson  called on Flint and  in       was offered a position at CTR              Watson joined CTR as general manager and then     months later  was made President when antitrust cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved              Having learned Patterson s pioneering business practices  Watson proceeded to put the stamp of NCR onto CTR s companies                                    He implemented sales conventions   generous sales incentives  a focus on customer service  an insistence on well groomed  dark suited salesmen and had an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker                           His favorite slogan   THINK   became a mantra for each company s employees              During Watson s first four years  revenues reached         million            million today  and the company s operations expanded to Europe  South America  Asia and Australia              Watson never liked the clumsy hyphenated name  Computing Tabulating Recording Company  and chose to replace it with the more expansive title  International Business Machines  which had previously been used as the name of CTR s Canadian Division              the name was changed on February                       By       most of the subsidiaries had been merged into one company  IBM
