Artificial intelligence is a recurrent theme in science fiction  whether utopian  emphasising the potential benefits  or dystopian  emphasising the dangers 
The notion of machines with human like intelligence dates back at least to Samuel Butler s      novel Erewhon  Since then  many science fiction stories have presented different effects of creating such intelligence  often involving rebellions by robots  Among the best known of these are Stanley Kubrick s            A Space Odyssey with its murderous onboard computer HAL       contrasting with the more benign R  D  in George Lucas s      Star Wars and the eponymous robot in Pixar s      WALL E 
Scientists and engineers have noted the implausibility of many science fiction scenarios  but have mentioned fictional robots many times in artificial intelligence research articles  most often in a utopian context 


Background edit 
A didrachm coin depicting the winged Talos  an automaton or artificial being in ancient Greek myth  c      BC
The notion of advanced robots with human like intelligence dates back at least to Samuel Butler s      novel Erewhon                        This drew on an earlier        article of his  Darwin among the Machines  where he raised the question of the evolution of consciousness among self replicating machines that might supplant humans as the dominant species                        Similar ideas were also discussed by others around the same time as Butler  including George Eliot in a chapter of her final published work Impressions of Theophrastus Such                    The creature in Mary Shelley s      Frankenstein has also been considered an artificial being  for instance by the science fiction author Brian Aldiss             Beings with at least some appearance of intelligence were imagined  too  in classical antiquity                                  

Utopian and dystopian visions edit 
Artificial intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines  in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals            
It is a recurrent theme in science fiction  scholars have divided it into utopian  emphasising the potential benefits  and dystopian  emphasising the dangers                                    

Utopian edit 
Brent Spiner portrayed the benevolent AI Data in Star Trek  The Next Generation 
Optimistic visions of the future of artificial intelligence are possible in science fiction              Benign AI characters include Robbie the Robot  first seen in Forbidden Planet on       Data in Star Trek  The Next Generation from      to       and Pixar s WALL E in                               Iain Banks s Culture series of novels portrays a utopian  post scarcity space society of humanoids  aliens  and advanced beings with artificial intelligence living in socialist habitats across the Milky Way                          Researchers at the University of Cambridge have identified four major themes in utopian scenarios featuring AI  immortality  or indefinite lifespans  ease  or freedom from the need to work  gratification  or pleasure and entertainment provided by machines  and dominance  the power to protect oneself or rule over others             
Alexander Wiegel contrasts the role of AI in       A Space Odyssey and in Duncan Jones s      film Moon  Whereas in       Wiegel argues  the public felt  technology paranoia  and the AI computer HAL was portrayed as a  cold hearted killer   by      the public were far more familiar with AI  and the film s GERTY is  the quiet savior  who enables the protagonists to succeed  and who sacrifices itself for their safety             

Dystopian edit 
Further information  Apocalyptic and post apocalyptic fiction
Advanced artificial general intelligence is often depicted as humanoid robots   androids   in art and fiction                         
The researcher Duncan Lucas writes  in       that humans are worried about the technology they are constructing  and that as machines started to approach intellect and thought  that concern becomes acute  He calls the early   th century dystopian view of AI in fiction the  animated automaton   naming as examples the      film Frankenstein  the      Metropolis  and the      play R U R              A later   th century approach he names  heuristic hardware   giving as instances      a Space Odyssey  Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  and I  Robot              Lucas considers also the films that illustrate the effect of the personal computer on science fiction from      onwards with the blurring of the boundary between the real and the virtual  in what he calls the  cyborg effect   He cites as examples Neuromancer  The Matrix  The Diamond Age  and Terminator              Isabella Hermann suggests that  science fictional AI as humanoid robots or conscious machines distracts from current risks of AI in the real world and may rather be interpreted as a reflection of societal issues beyond technology              
The film director Ridley Scott has focused on AI throughout his career  and it plays an important part in his films Prometheus  Blade Runner  and the Alien franchise             

Frankenstein complex edit 
A common portrayal of AI in science fiction  and one of the oldest  is the Frankenstein complex  a term coined by Asimov  where a robot turns on its creator              For instance  in the      film Ex Machina  the intelligent entity Ava turns on its creator  as well as on its potential rescuer             

AI rebellion edit 
See also  AI takeover and AI takeover in popular culture
Robots revolt in Karel  apek s      science fiction play R U R 
Among the many possible dystopian scenarios involving artificial intelligence  robots may usurp control over civilization from humans  forcing them into submission  hiding  or extinction              In tales of AI rebellion  the worst of all scenarios happens  as the intelligent entities created by humanity become self aware  reject human authority and attempt to destroy mankind  Possibly the first novel to address this theme  The Wreck of the World         by  William Grove   pseudonym of Reginald Colebrooke Reade   takes place in      and features sentient machines that revolt against the human race              Another of the earliest examples is in the      play R U R  by Karel  apek  a race of self replicating robot slaves revolt against their human masters                          another early instance is in the      film Master of the World  where the War Robot kills its own inventor             

HAL      is the lethal onboard computer of       A Space Odyssey 
Many science fiction rebellion stories followed  one of the best known being Stanley Kubrick s      film       A Space Odyssey  in which the artificially intelligent onboard computer HAL      lethally malfunctions on a space mission and kills the entire crew except the spaceship s commander  who manages to deactivate it             
In his      Hugo Award winning short story  I Have No Mouth  and I Must Scream  Harlan Ellison presents the possibility that a sentient computer  named Allied Mastercomputer or  AM  in the story  will be as unhappy and dissatisfied with its boring  endless existence as its human creators would have been    AM  becomes enraged enough to take it out on the few humans left  whom he sees as directly responsible for his own boredom  anger and unhappiness             
Alternatively  as in William Gibson s      cyberpunk novel Neuromancer  the intelligent beings may simply not care about humans             

AI controlled societies edit 
The motive behind the AI revolution is often more than the simple quest for power or a superiority complex  Robots may revolt to become the  guardian  of humanity  Alternatively  humanity may intentionally relinquish some control  fearful of its own destructive nature  An early example is Jack Williamson s      novel The Humanoids  in which a race of humanoid robots  in the name of their Prime Directive    to serve and obey and guard men from harm    essentially assume control of every aspect of human life  No humans may engage in any behavior that might endanger them  and every human action is scrutinized carefully  Humans who resist the Prime Directive are taken away and lobotomized  so they may be happy under the new mechanoids  rule              Though still under human authority  Isaac Asimov s Zeroth Law of the Three Laws of Robotics similarly implied a benevolent guidance by robots              
In the   st century  science fiction has explored government by algorithm  in which the power of AI may be indirect and decentralised             

Human dominance edit 
In other scenarios  humanity is able to keep control over the Earth  whether by banning AI  by designing robots to be submissive  as in Asimov s works   or by having humans merge with robots  The science fiction novelist Frank Herbert explored the idea of a time when mankind might ban artificial intelligence  and in some interpretations  even all forms of computing technology including integrated circuits  entirely  His Dune series mentions a rebellion called the Butlerian Jihad  in which mankind defeats the smart machines and imposes a death penalty for recreating them  quoting from the fictional Orange Catholic Bible   Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind   In the Dune novels published after his death  Hunters of Dune  Sandworms of Dune   a renegade AI overmind returns to eradicate mankind as vengeance for the Butlerian Jihad             
In some stories  humanity remains in authority over robots  Often the robots are programmed specifically to remain in service to society  as in Isaac Asimov s Three Laws of Robotics              In the Alien films  not only is the control system of the Nostromo spaceship somewhat intelligent  the crew call it  Mother    but there are also androids in the society  which are called  synthetics  or  artificial persons   that are such perfect imitations of humans that they are not discriminated against                          TARS and CASE from Interstellar similarly demonstrate simulated human emotions and humour while continuing to acknowledge their expendability             

Simulated reality edit 
Main article  Simulation hypothesis
Simulated reality has become a common theme in science fiction  as seen in the      film The Matrix  which depicts a world where artificially intelligent robots enslave humanity within a simulation which is set in the contemporary world             

Reception edit 
Implausibility edit 
Engineers and scientists have taken an interest in the way AI is presented in fiction  In films like the      Ex Machina or      Chappie  a single isolated genius becomes the first to successfully build an artificial general intelligence  scientists in the real world deem this to be unlikely  In Chappie  Transcendence  and Tron  human minds are capable of being uploaded into artificial or virtual bodies  usually no reasonable explanation is offered as to how this difficult task can be achieved  In the I  Robot and Bicentennial Man films  robots that are programmed to serve humans spontaneously generate new goals on their own  without a plausible explanation of how this took place              Analysing Ian McDonald s      River of Gods  Krzysztof Solarewicz identifies the ways that it depicts AIs  including  independence and unexpectedness  political awkwardness  openness to the alien and the occidental value of authenticity               Another important perspective to take is that fiction s  non rational elements in the discourse  the emotive  the mythic  or even the quasi theological  are more than simply distortions or distractions from what might otherwise be a sober and rational public debate about the future of A I   Fiction can dissuade readers about future advances  causing pessimism that we see today surrounding the subject of AI             

Types of mention edit 
Some fictional robots such as R  D  have been seen as utopian  making them popular with engineers and others              In       All Nippon Airways unveiled this Boeing       in R  D  livery 
The robotics researcher Omar Mubin and colleagues have analysed the engineering mentions of the top    fictional robots  based on those in the Carnegie Mellon University hall of fame  and the IMDb list  WALL E had    mentions  followed by HAL      with         a      Star Wars s R  D  with     and Data with     the Terminator  T      received only    Of the total of     engineering mentions     were utopian     neutral  and    dystopian  HAL      and Skynet received both utopian and dystopian mentions  for instance  HAL      is seen as dystopian in one paper  because its designers failed to prioritize its goals properly               but as utopian in another where a real system s  conversational chat bot interface  lacks  a HAL      level of intelligence and there is ambiguity in how the computer interprets what the human is trying to convey               Utopian mentions  often of WALL E  were associated with the goal of improving communication to readers  and to a lesser extent with inspiration to authors  WALL E was mentioned more often than any other robot for emotions  followed by HAL        voice speech  followed by HAL      and R  D    for physical gestures  and for personality  Skynet was the robot most often mentioned for intelligence  followed by HAL      and Data              Mubin and colleagues believed that scientists and engineers avoided dystopian mentions of robots  possibly out of  a reluctance driven by trepidation or simply a lack of awareness              

Portrayals of AI creators edit 
Scholars have noted that fictional creators of AI are overwhelmingly male  in the     most influential films featuring AI from      to       only   of     AI creators portrayed      were female              Such creators are portrayed as lone geniuses  eg  Tony Stark in the Iron Man Marvel Cinematic Universe films   associated with the military  eg  Colossus  The Forbin Project  and large corporations  eg  I  Robot   or making human like AI to replace a lost loved one or serve as the ideal lover  e g   The Stepford Wives

Notes edit 


  Mubin and colleagues noted that the orthography of robot names caused them difficulties  thus HAL      was also written HAL  HAL      and HAL       and similarly for other robots  so they believed their search was likely incomplete
