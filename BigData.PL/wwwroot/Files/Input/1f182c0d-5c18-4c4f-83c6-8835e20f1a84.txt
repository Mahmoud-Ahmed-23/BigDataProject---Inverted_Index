Intensive animal farming  industrial livestock production  and macro farms             also known as factory farming              is a type of intensive agriculture  specifically an approach to mass animal husbandry designed to maximize production while minimizing costs             To achieve this  agribusinesses keep livestock such as cattle  poultry  and fish at high stocking densities  at large scale  and using modern machinery  biotechnology  pharmaceutics  and international trade                                                         The main products of this industry are meat  milk and eggs for human consumption            
While intensive animal farming can produce large amounts of meat at low cost with reduced human labor              it is controversial as it raises several ethical concerns              including animal welfare issues  confinement  mutilations  stress induced aggression  breeding complications                           harm to the environment and wildlife  greenhouse gases  deforestation  eutrophication               public health risks  zoonotic diseases  pandemic risks  antibiotic resistance               and worker exploitation  particularly of undocumented workers             


History edit 
Further information  History of agriculture
Intensive animal farming is a relatively recent development in the history of agriculture  utilizing scientific discoveries and technological advances to enable changes in agricultural methods that increase production  Innovations from the late   th century generally parallel developments in mass production in other industries in the latter part of the Industrial Revolution  The discovery of vitamins and their role in animal nutrition  in the first two decades of the   th century  led to vitamin supplements  which allowed chickens to be raised indoors              The discovery of antibiotics and vaccines facilitated raising livestock in larger numbers by reducing disease  Chemicals developed for use in World War II gave rise to synthetic pesticides  Developments in shipping networks and technology have made long distance distribution of agricultural produce feasible 
Agricultural production across the world doubled four times between      and            to            to            to       and      to       to feed a global population of one billion human beings in      and     billion in                                        During the same period  the number of people involved in farming dropped as the process became more automated  In the     s     percent of the American population worked in agriculture compared to     percent in       in       each farm worker supplied    consumers  whereas in       each worker supplied    consumers                                  
The era of factory farming in Britain began in      when a new Agriculture Act granted subsidies to farmers to encourage greater output by introducing new technology  in order to reduce Britain s reliance on imported meat  The United Nations writes that  intensification of animal production was seen as a way of providing food security               In       the United States  United Kingdom and other industrialized nations  commenced factory farming of beef and dairy cattle and domestic pigs             As a result  farming became concentrated on fewer larger farms  For example  in       there were one million pig farms in America  as of       there were                                           In           of American pigs were raised on farms selling  gt       pigs per year  as of      this grew to                    From its American and West European heartland  intensive animal farming became globalized in the later years of the   th century and is still expanding and replacing traditional practices of stock rearing in an increasing number of countries             In      intensive animal farming accounted for     of world meat production and by       this had risen to                

Process edit 
The aim is to produce large quantities of meat  eggs  or milk at the lowest possible cost  Food is supplied in place  Methods employed to maintain health and improve production may include the use of disinfectants  antimicrobial agents  anthelmintics  hormones and vaccines  protein  mineral and vitamin supplements  frequent health inspections  biosecurity  and climate controlled facilities  Physical restraints  for example  fences or creeps  are used to control movement or actions regarded as undesirable  Breeding programs are used to produce animals more suited to the confined conditions and able to provide a consistent food product             
Industrial production was estimated to account for    percent of the sum of global production of these meats and    percent of total egg production              In the US  according to its National Pork Producers Council     million of its    million pigs slaughtered each year are reared in industrial settings                                  
The major concentration of the industry occurs at the slaughter and meat processing phase  with only four companies slaughtering and processing    percent of cows     percent of sheep     percent of pigs and    percent of chickens      citation needed       This concentration at the slaughter phase may be in large part due to regulatory barriers that may make it financially difficult for small slaughter plants to be built  maintained or remain in business  Factory farming may be no more beneficial to livestock producers than traditional farming because it appears to contribute to overproduction that drives down prices  Through  forward contracts  and  marketing agreements   meatpackers are able to set the price of livestock long before they are ready for production              These strategies often cause farmers to lose money  as half of all U S  family farming operations did in                  
Many of the nation s livestock producers would like to market livestock directly to consumers but with limited USDA inspected slaughter facilities  livestock grown locally can not typically be slaughtered and processed locally             
Small farmers are often absorbed into factory farm operations  acting as contract growers for the industrial facilities  In the case of poultry contract growers  farmers are required to make costly investments in construction of sheds to house the birds  buy required feed and drugs   often settling for slim profit margins  or even losses 
Research has shown that many immigrant workers in concentrated animal farming operations  CAFOs  in the United States receive little to no job specific training or safety and health information regarding the hazards associated with these jobs              Workers with limited English proficiency are significantly less likely to receive any work related training  since it is often only provided in English  As a result  many workers do not perceive their jobs as dangerous  This causes inconsistent personal protective equipment  PPE  use  and can lead to workplace accidents and injuries  Immigrant workers are also less likely to report any workplace hazards and injuries 

Types edit 
Intensive farms hold large numbers of animals  typically cows  pigs  turkeys  geese              or chickens  often indoors  typically at high densities 
Intensive production of livestock and poultry is widespread in developed nations  For            the United Nations  Food and Agriculture Organization  FAO  estimates of industrial production as a percentage of global production were   percent for beef and veal      percent for sheep and goat meat     percent for pork  and    percent for poultry meat 

Chickens edit 
Further information  Poultry farming
Hens in Brazil
The major milestone in   th century poultry production was the discovery of vitamin D              which made it possible to keep chickens in confinement year round  Before this  chickens did not thrive during the winter  due to lack of sunlight   and egg production  incubation  and meat production in the off season were all very difficult  making poultry a seasonal and expensive proposition  Year round production lowered costs  especially for broilers             
At the same time  egg production was increased by scientific breeding  After a few false starts   such as the Maine Experiment Station s failure at improving egg production  success was shown by Professor Dryden at the Oregon Experiment Station             
Improvements in production and quality were accompanied by lower labor requirements  In the     s through the early     s        hens provided a full time job for a farm family in America  In the late     s  egg prices had fallen so dramatically that farmers typically tripled the number of hens they kept  putting three hens into what had been a single bird cage or converting their floor confinement houses from a single deck of roosts to triple decker roosts  Not long after this  prices fell still further and large numbers of egg farmers left the business  This fall in profitability was accompanied by a general fall in prices to the consumer  allowing poultry and eggs to lose their status as luxury foods 
Robert Plamondon             reports that the last family chicken farm in his part of Oregon  Rex Farms  had        layers and survived into the     s  However  the standard laying house of the current operators is around         hens 
The vertical integration of the egg and poultry industries was a late development  occurring after all the major technological changes had been in place for years  including the development of modern broiler rearing techniques  the adoption of the Cornish Cross broiler  the use of laying cages  etc   
By the late     s  poultry production had changed dramatically  Large farms and packing plants could grow birds by the tens of thousands  Chickens could be sent to slaughterhouses for butchering and processing into prepackaged commercial products to be frozen or shipped fresh to markets or wholesalers  Meat type chickens currently grow to market weight in six to seven weeks  whereas only fifty years ago it took three times as long              This is due to genetic selection and nutritional modifications  but not the use of growth hormones  which are illegal for use in poultry in the US             and many other countries  and have no effect   Once a meat consumed only occasionally  the common availability and lower cost has made chicken a common meat product within developed nations  Growing concerns over the cholesterol content of red meat in the     s and     s further resulted in increased consumption of chicken 
Today  eggs are produced on large egg ranches on which environmental parameters are well controlled  Chickens are exposed to artificial light cycles to stimulate egg production year round  In addition  forced molting is commonly practiced in the US  in which manipulation of light and food access triggers molting  in order to increase egg size and production  Forced molting is controversial  and is prohibited in the EU             
On average  a chicken lays one egg a day  but not on every day of the year  This varies with the breed and time of year  In       average egg production was    eggs per hen per year  In       it was well over      In the United States  laying hens are butchered after their second egg laying season  In Europe  they are generally butchered after a single season  The laying period begins when the hen is about       weeks old  depending on breed and season   Males of the egg type breeds have little commercial value at any age  and all those not used for breeding  roughly fifty percent of all egg type chickens  are killed soon after hatching  The old hens also have little commercial value  Thus  the main sources of poultry meat     years ago  spring chickens and stewing hens  have both been entirely supplanted by meat type broiler chickens 

Pigs edit 
Main article  Intensive pig farming
Pigs confined to a barn in an intensive system  Midwestern United States
In America  intensive piggeries  or hog lots  are a type of concentrated animal feeding operation  CAFO   specialized for the raising of domestic pigs up to slaughter weight  In this system  grower pigs are housed indoors in group housing or straw lined sheds  whilst pregnant sows are confined in sow stalls  gestation crates  and give birth in farrowing crates      citation needed     
The use of sow stalls has resulted in lower production costs and concomitant animal welfare concerns  Many of the world s largest producers of pigs  such as U S  and Canada  use sow stalls  but some nations  such as the UK  and U S  states  such as Florida and Arizona  have banned them             
Intensive piggeries are generally large warehouse like buildings  Indoor pig systems allow the pig s condition to be monitored  ensuring minimum fatalities and increased productivity  Buildings are ventilated and their temperature regulated  Most domestic pig varieties are susceptible to heat stress  and all pigs lack sweat glands and cannot cool themselves  Pigs have a limited tolerance to high temperatures and heat stress can lead to death  Maintaining a more specific temperature within the pig tolerance range also maximizes growth and growth to feed ratio  In an intensive operation pigs will lack access to a wallow  mud   which is their natural cooling mechanism  Intensive piggeries control temperature through ventilation or drip water systems  dropping water to cool the system              
Pigs are naturally omnivorous and are generally fed a combination of grains and protein sources  soybeans  or meat and bone meal   Larger intensive pig farms may be surrounded by farmland where feed grain crops are grown  Alternatively  piggeries are reliant on the grains industry  Pig feed may be bought packaged or mixed on site  The intensive piggery system  where pigs are confined in individual stalls  allows each pig to be allotted a portion of feed  The individual feeding system also facilitates individual medication of pigs through feed  This has more significance to intensive farming methods  as the close proximity to other animals enables diseases to spread more rapidly  To prevent disease spreading and encourage growth  drug programs such as antibiotics  vitamins  hormones and other supplements are pre emptively administered             
Indoor systems  especially stalls and pens  i e   dry   not straw lined systems  allow for the easy collection of waste  In an indoor intensive pig farm  manure can be managed through a lagoon system or other waste management system  However  odor remains a problem which is difficult to manage             
The way animals are housed in intensive systems varies  Breeding sows spend the bulk of their time in sow stalls during pregnancy or farrowing crates  with their litters  until to be sent for the market 
Piglets often receive range of treatments including castration  tail docking to reduce tail biting  teeth clipped  to reduce injuring their mother s nipples  gum disease and prevent later tusk growth  and their ears notched to assist identification  Treatments are usually made without pain killers  Weak runts may be slain shortly after birth             
Piglets also may be weaned and removed from the sows at between two and five weeks old             and placed in sheds  However  grower pigs   which comprise the bulk of the herd   are usually housed in alternative indoor housing  such as batch pens  During pregnancy  the use of a stall may be preferred as it facilitates feed management and growth control  It also prevents pig aggression  e g  tail biting  ear biting  vulva biting  food stealing   Group pens generally require higher stockmanship skills  Such pens will usually not contain straw or other material  Alternatively  a straw lined shed may house a larger group  i e  not batched  in age groups 

Cattle edit 
Beef cattle on a feedlot in the Texas Panhandle  Such confinement creates more work for the farmer but allows the animals to grow rapidly 
Cattle are domesticated ungulates  a member of the family Bovidae  in the subfamily Bovinae  and descended from the aurochs  Bos primigenius               They are raised as livestock for their flesh  called beef and veal   dairy products  milk   leather and as draught animals  As of           it is estimated that there are         billion head of cattle in the world                         

Diagram of feedlot system  This can be contrasted with more traditional grazing systems 
The most common interactions with cattle involve daily feeding  cleaning and milking  Many routine husbandry practices involve ear tagging  dehorning  loading  medical operations  vaccinations and hoof care  as well as training and sorting for agricultural shows and sales             
Once cattle obtain an entry level weight  about     pounds           kg   they are transferred from the range to a feedlot to be fed a specialized animal feed which consists of corn byproducts  derived from ethanol production   barley  and other grains as well as alfalfa and cottonseed meal  The feed also contains premixes composed of microingredients such as vitamins  minerals  chemical preservatives  antibiotics  fermentation products  and other essential ingredients that are purchased from premix companies  usually in sacked form  for blending into commercial rations  Because of the availability of these products  farmers using their own grain can formulate their own rations and be assured the animals are getting the recommended levels of minerals and vitamins 
There are many potential impacts on human health due to the modern cattle industrial agriculture system  There are concerns surrounding the antibiotics and growth hormones used  increased E  coli contamination  higher saturated fat contents in the meat because of the feed  and also environmental concerns             
As of       in the U S          producers participate in raising beef  The beef industry is segmented with the bulk of the producers participating in raising beef calves  Beef calves are generally raised in small herds  with over     of the herds having less than     head of cattle  Fewer producers participate in the finishing phase which often occurs in a feedlot  but nonetheless there are        feedlots in the United States             

Aquaculture edit 
Main article  Integrated multi trophic aquaculture
Blue mussels cultivated in proximity to Atlantic salmon in the Bay of Fundy  Canada
Integrated multi trophic aquaculture  IMTA   also called integrated aquaculture              is a practice in which the by products  wastes  from one species are recycled to become inputs  fertilizers  food  for another  making aquaculture intensive  Fed aquaculture  e g  fish and shrimp  is combined with inorganic extractive  e g  seaweed  and organic extractive  e g  shellfish  aquaculture to create balanced systems for environmental sustainability  biomitigation   economic stability  product diversification and risk reduction  and social acceptability  better management practices              
The system is multi trophic as it makes use of species from different trophic or nutritional level  unlike traditional aquaculture             
Ideally  the biological and chemical processes in such a system should balance  This is achieved through the appropriate selection and proportions of different species providing different ecosystem functions  The co cultured species should not just be biofilters  but harvestable crops of commercial value              A working IMTA system should result in greater production for the overall system  based on mutual benefits to the co cultured species and improved ecosystem health  even if the individual production of some of the species is lower compared to what could be reached in monoculture practices over a short term period             

Regulation edit 
Main article  Animal law
In various jurisdictions  intensive animal production of some kinds is subject to regulation for environmental protection  In the United States  a Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation  CAFO  that discharges or proposes to discharge waste requires a permit and implementation of a plan for management of manure nutrients  contaminants  wastewater  etc   as applicable  to meet requirements pursuant to the federal Clean Water Act                          Some data on regulatory compliance and enforcement are available  In       the US Environmental Protection Agency published   year and   year data on environmental performance of    industries  with data for the livestock industry being derived mostly from inspections of CAFOs  The data pertain to inspections and enforcement mostly under the Clean Water Act  but also under the Clean Air Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act  Of the    industries  livestock production was among the top seven for environmental performance over the   year period  and was one of the top two in the final year of that period  where good environmental performance is indicated by a low ratio of enforcement orders to inspections  The five year and final year ratios of enforcement inspections for the livestock industry were      and       respectively  Also in the final year  the livestock industry was one of the two leaders among the    industries in terms of having the lowest percentage of facilities with violations              In Canada  intensive livestock operations are subject to provincial regulation  with definitions of regulated entities varying among provinces  Examples include Intensive Livestock Operations  Saskatchewan   Confined Feeding Operations  Alberta   Feedlots  British Columbia   High density Permanent Outdoor Confinement Areas  Ontario  and Feedlots or Parcs d Engraissement  Manitoba   In Canada  intensive animal production  like other agricultural sectors  is also subject to various other federal and provincial requirements 
In the United States  farmed animals are excluded by half of all state animal cruelty laws including the federal Animal Welfare Act  The    hour law  enacted in      and amended in      states that when animals are being transported for slaughter  the vehicle must stop every    hours and the animals must be let out for exercise  food  and water  The United States Department of Agriculture claims that the law does not apply to birds  The Humane Slaughter Act is similarly limited  Originally passed in       the Act requires that livestock be stunned into unconsciousness prior to slaughter  This Act also excludes birds  who make up more than    percent of the animals slaughtered for food  as well as rabbits and fish  Individual states all have their own animal cruelty statutes  however many states have right to farm laws that serve as a provision to exempt standard agricultural practices                         
In the United States there is an attempt to regulate farms in the most realistic way possible  The easiest way to effectively regulate the most animals with a limited number of resources and time is to regulate the large farms  In New York State many Animal Feeding Operations are not considered CAFOs since they have less than     cows  These farms are not regulated to the level that CAFOs are  Which may lead to unchecked pollution and nutrient leaching  The EPA website illustrates the scale of this problem by saying in New York State s Bay watershed there are     animal feeding operations and only                of them are State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System  SPDES              permitted CAFOs 
In Ohio animal welfare organizations reached a negotiated settlement with farm organizations while in California  Proposition    Standards for Confining Farm Animals  an initiated law was approved by voters in                   Regulations have been enacted in other states and plans are underway for referendum and lobbying campaigns in other states             
An action plan was proposed by the USDA in February       called the Utilization of Manure and Other Agricultural and Industrial Byproducts  This program s goal is to protect the environment and human and animal health by using manure in a safe and effective manner  In order for this to happen  several actions need to be taken and these four components include             

Improving the Usability of Manure Nutrients through More Effective Animal Nutrition and Management            
Maximizing the Value of Manure through Improved Collection  Storage  and Treatment Options            
Utilizing Manure in Integrated Farming Systems to Improve Profitability and Protect Soil  Water  and Air Quality            
Using Manure and Other Agricultural Byproducts as a Renewable Energy Source            
In      Australia s largest supermarket chain  Coles  announced that as of January          they will stop selling company branded pork and eggs from animals kept in factory farms  The nation s other dominant supermarket chain  Woolworths  has already begun phasing out factory farmed animal products  All of Woolworth s house brand eggs are now cage free  and by mid      all of their pork will come from farmers who operate stall free farms             
In June       the European Commission announced the plan of a ban on cages for a number of animals  including egg laying hens  female breeding pigs  calves raised for veal  rabbits  ducks  and geese  by                  

Animal welfare edit 
This section needs to be updated  Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information    August      
In the UK  the Farm Animal Welfare Council was set up by the government to act as an independent advisor on animal welfare in      and expresses its policy as five freedoms  from hunger and thirst  from discomfort  from pain  injury or disease  to express normal behavior  from fear and distress             
There are differences around the world as to which practices are accepted and there continue to be changes in regulations with animal welfare being a strong driver for increased regulation  For example  the EU is bringing in further regulation to set maximum stocking densities for meat chickens by            needs update      where the UK Animal Welfare Minister commented   The welfare of meat chickens is a major concern to people throughout the European Union  This agreement sends a strong message to the rest of the world that we care about animal welfare              
Factory farming is greatly debated throughout Australia  with many people disagreeing with the methods and ways in which the animals in factory farms are treated  Animals are often under stress from being kept in confined spaces and will attack each other  In an effort to prevent injury leading to infection  their beaks  tails and teeth are removed              Many piglets will die of shock after having their teeth and tails removed  because painkilling medicines are not used in these operations  Factory farms are a popular way to gain space  with animals such as chickens being kept in spaces smaller than an A  page             
For example  in the UK  debeaking of chickens is deprecated  but it is recognized that it is a method of last resort  seen as better than allowing vicious fighting and ultimately cannibalism      citation needed      Between    and    percent             of six million breeding sows in the U S  are confined during pregnancy  and for most of their adult lives  in   by        ft       by           m  gestation crates                         According to pork producers and many veterinarians  sows will fight if housed in pens  The largest pork producer in the U S  said in January      that it will phase out gestation crates by                  They are being phased out in the European Union  with a ban effective in      after the fourth week of pregnancy      needs update                   With the evolution of factory farming  there has been a growing awareness of the issues amongst the wider public  not least due to the efforts of animal rights and welfare campaigners              As a result  gestation crates  one of the more contentious practices  are the subject of laws in the U S               Europe             and around the world to phase out their use as a result of pressure to adopt less confined practices 
Death rates for sows have been increasing in the US from prolapse  which has been attributed to intensive breeding practices  Sows produce on average    piglets a year             
In the United States alone  over    million chickens          pigs and         cattle die during transport to slaughterhouses annually  and some         pigs are incapable of walking upon arrival  This is often due to being exposed to extreme temperatures and trauma             

Demonstrations edit 
From      to      each year between        and        people gathered under the theme We are fed up  in Berlin to protest against industrial livestock production                                     

Human health impact edit 
According to the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC   farms on which animals are intensively reared can cause adverse health reactions in farm workers  Workers may develop acute and chronic lung disease  musculoskeletal injuries  and may catch infections that transmit from animals to human beings  such as tuberculosis              
Pesticides are used to control organisms which are considered harmful             and they save farmers money by preventing product losses to pests              In the US  about a quarter of pesticides used are used in houses  yards  parks  golf courses  and swimming pools             and about     are used in agriculture              However  pesticides can make their way into consumers  bodies which can cause health problems              One source of this is bioaccumulation in animals raised on factory farms                                     
 Studies have discovered an increase in respiratory  neurobehavioral  and mental illnesses among the residents of communities next to factory farms              
The CDC writes that chemical  bacterial  and viral compounds from animal waste may travel in the soil and water  Residents near such farms report problems such as unpleasant smell  flies and adverse health effects             
The CDC has identified a number of pollutants associated with the discharge of animal waste into rivers and lakes  and into the air  Antibiotic use in livestock may create antibiotic resistant pathogens  parasites  bacteria  and viruses may be spread  ammonia  nitrogen  and phosphorus can reduce oxygen in surface waters and contaminate drinking water  pesticides and hormones may cause hormone related changes in fish  animal feed and feathers may stunt the growth of desirable plants in surface waters and provide nutrients to disease causing micro organisms  trace elements such as arsenic and copper  which are harmful to human health  may contaminate surface waters             
Zoonotic diseases such as coronavirus disease       COVID      which caused the COVID    pandemic  are increasingly linked to environmental changes associated with intensive animal farming              The disruption of pristine forests driven by logging  mining  road building through remote places  rapid urbanisation and population growth is bringing people into closer contact with animal species they may never have been near before  According to Kate Jones  chair of ecology and biodiversity at University College London  the resulting transmission of disease from wildlife to humans is now  a hidden cost of human economic development              
Intensive farming may make the evolution and spread of harmful diseases easier  Many communicable animal diseases spread rapidly through densely spaced populations of animals and crowding makes genetic reassortment more likely  However  small family farms are more likely to introduce bird diseases and more frequent association with people into the mix  as happened in the      flu pandemic             
In the European Union  growth hormones are banned on the basis that there is no way of determining a safe level  The UK has stated that in the event of the EU raising the ban at some future date  to comply with a precautionary approach  it would only consider the introduction of specific hormones  proven on a case by case basis              In       the EU banned feeding animals antibiotics that were found to be valuable for human health  Furthermore  in      the EU banned all drugs for livestock that were used for growth promotion purposes  As a result of these bans  the levels of antibiotic resistance in animal products and within the human population showed a decrease                         
The international trade in animal products increases the risk of global transmission of virulent diseases such as swine fever              BSE  foot and mouth and bird flu 
In the United States  the use of antibiotics in livestock is still prevalent              The FDA reports that    percent of all antibiotics sold in      were administered to livestock animals  and that many of these antibiotics are identical or closely related to drugs used for treating illnesses in humans  Consequently  many of these drugs are losing their effectiveness on humans  and the total healthcare costs associated with drug resistant bacterial infections in the United States are between       billion and     billion annually             
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus  MRSA  has been identified in pigs and humans raising concerns about the role of pigs as reservoirs of MRSA for human infection  One study found that     of pig farmers in the United States and Canada in      harbored MRSA              A second study revealed that     of Dutch pig farms had pigs with MRSA and     of animals at slaughter carried the bug were all of the infections were resistant to tetracycline and many were resistant to other antimicrobials              A more recent study found that MRSA ST    isolates were less susceptible to tiamulin  an antimicrobial used in agriculture  than other MRSA or methicillin susceptible S  aureus               Cases of MRSA have increased in livestock animals  CC    is a new clone of MRSA that has emerged in animals and is found in intensively reared production animals  primarily pigs  but also cattle and poultry   where it can be transmitted to humans  Although dangerous to humans  CC    is often asymptomatic in food producing animals              
A      nationwide study reported nearly half of the meat and poultry sold in U S  grocery stores      percent   was contaminated with S  aureus  and more than half of those bacteria      percent   were resistant to at least three classes of antibiotics               Although Staph should be killed with proper cooking  it may still pose a risk to consumers through improper food handling and cross contamination in the kitchen  The senior author of the study said   The fact that drug resistant S  aureus was so prevalent  and likely came from the food animals themselves  is troubling  and demands attention to how antibiotics are used in food animal production today               
In April       lawmakers in the Mexican state of Veracruz accused large scale hog and poultry operations of being breeding grounds of a pandemic swine flu  although they did not present scientific evidence to support their claim  A swine flu which have quickly killed more than     infected persons in that area  appears to have begun in the vicinity of a Smithfield subsidiary pig CAFO  concentrated animal feeding operation               

Environmental impact edit 
Main articles  Environmental impact of meat production and Cattle        Environmental impact
Intensive factory farming has grown to become the biggest threat to the global environment through the loss of ecosystem services and global warming               It is a major driver to global environmental degradation and biodiversity loss               The process in which feed needs to be grown for animal use only is often grown using intensive methods  which involve a significant amount of fertiliser and pesticides  This sometimes results in the pollution of water  soil and air by agrochemicals and manure waste  and use of limited resources such as water and energy at unsustainable rates              
Industrial production of pigs and poultry is an important source of greenhouse gas emissions and is predicted to become more so  On intensive pig farms  the animals are generally kept on concrete with slats or grates for the manure to drain through  The manure is usually stored in slurry form  slurry is a liquid mixture of urine and feces   During storage on the farm  slurry emits methane and when manure is spread on fields it emits nitrous oxide and causes nitrogen pollution of land and water  Poultry manure from factory farms emits high levels of nitrous oxide and ammonia              
Large quantities and concentrations of waste are produced               Air quality and groundwater are at risk when animal waste is improperly recycled              
Environmental impacts of factory farming include              

Deforestation for animal feed production
Unsustainable pressure on land for production of high protein high energy animal feed
Pesticide  herbicide  and fertilizer manufacture and use for feed production
Unsustainable use of water for feed crops  including groundwater extraction
Pollution of soil  water and air by nitrogen and phosphorus from fertiliser used for feed crops and from manure
Land degradation  reduced fertility  soil compaction  increased salinity  desertification 
Loss of biodiversity due to eutrophication  acidification  pesticides and herbicides
Worldwide reduction of genetic diversity of livestock and loss of traditional breeds
Species extinctions due to livestock related habitat destruction  especially feed cropping 
Insect farming is a potential alternative to traditional livestock that causes less environmental damage  However  it remains less resource efficient than direct plant consumption  as insects necessarily consume more food than they produce  Additionally  farmed insects are often used to feed livestock  rather than humans directly
