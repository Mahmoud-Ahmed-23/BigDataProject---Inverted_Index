The Palisades Nuclear Generating Station is a moth balled nuclear power plant located on Lake Michigan  in Van Buren County s Covert Township  Michigan  on a     acre           ha  site   miles           km  south of South Haven  Michigan  USA  Palisades was operated by the Nuclear Management Company and owned by CMS Energy prior to the sale to Entergy on April          
Its single Combustion Engineering pressurized water reactor weighs     tons and has steel walls             inches           mm  thick  The containment building is     feet          m  in diameter and     feet          m  tall  including the dome  Its concrete walls are             feet           m  thick with a           inch thick           mm  steel liner plate  The dome roof is   feet            m  thick  Access is via a personnel lock measuring        feet        inches            m  by        feet        inches            m   The Westinghouse Electric Company turbine generator can produce         kilowatts of electricity 
Built between      and       Palisades was approved to operate at full power in                 
On July           it was announced that the plant would be sold to Entergy  On April           the plant was sold to Entergy for      million             The plant s original licensee was due to expire on March           An application for    year extension was filed in      with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  It was granted on January           Therefore  the plant was then scheduled for decommissioning by                 
Entergy had made a decision to close the plant in October       A decision by the Michigan Public Service Commission  MPSC  influenced the company s decision  Consumers Energy attempted to buy its way out of a power purchase agreement it has with Entergy and the plant  The MPSC did not approve Consumer Energy s full request of      million  so Entergy decided to keep the plant open three years longer than planned             On April           just weeks before the facility was scheduled to close  Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer requested federal funding to keep the facility open            
Entergy closed the Palisades plant in May                             and its sale to Holtec International was completed in June                   However  in September       Holtec applied for funds from the Civil Nuclear Credit to reopen the plant              This request was denied in November                   In December       Holtec announced that it will reapply for funds from the Civil Nuclear Credit in order to restart Palisades              Other efforts have been made to  repower  the plant              On September           Holtec and Wolverine Power Cooperative announced that they had reached a power purchase agreement to restart the plant once the re opening is approved              As of August       Holtec has secured      million in state funding to restart the plant              The Department of Energy is also ready to offer a      billion loan to assist in restarting operations              If operations resume  planned for late                   the plant would be the first nuclear power plant to restart operations in the country

Spent fuel storage edit 
Spent fuel is stored outdoors in       foot tall           m  storage casks  each containing         tons and resting on a concrete pad  This was intended to be a temporary solution until the spent fuel repository at Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository opened 

Parts replacement edit 
Two steam generators were replaced in       This involved cutting a    by    foot opening through the     foot thick           m  reinforced concrete wall  The removed units are stored in a large concrete building on plant property             

Surrounding population edit 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants  a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of    miles          km   concerned primarily with exposure to  and inhalation of  airborne radioactive contamination  and an ingestion pathway zone of about    miles          km   concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity             
The      U S  population within    miles          km  of Palisades was         a decrease of     percent in a decade  according to an analysis of U S  Census data for msnbc com  The      U S  population within    miles          km  was            an increase of     percent since       Cities within    miles include South Bend  IN     miles to city center  and Kalamazoo  MI             

Seismic risk edit 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission s estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Palisades was   in          according to an NRC study published in August                              

Visiting edit 
View from Van Buren State Park
Like all U S  nuclear power plants since September           public access to Palisades is prohibited  However  Palisades can be glimpsed from the neighboring Van Buren State Park 

Decommissioning edit 
Originally planned to operate through May           concerns over a faulty control rod drive seal prompted operators to remove the plant from service on May                
Once all fuel is removed from the reactor core  Holtec will buy the plant from Entergy and begin a three year process of moving all fuel to dry cask storage   Then a ten year pause to allow the decommissioning trust fund balance to grow followed by a   year long dismantling process  with an estimated completion date of                  
The cost of decommissioning will be covered by a      million trust fund  paid for by Consumers Energy customers             

Intention to restart operations edit 
In January       the federal government was poised to offer Holtec International a      billion federal loan to restart the Palisades nuclear plant              The loan was reported at the time to potentially start as soon as February                   The conditional agreement was announced on March                 If successful  Palisades would become the first U S  nuclear reactor to restart after its fuel has been removed and its license revised to prohibit further operation                          The plan for a restart by Holtec International  based in Jupiter  Florida  got a boost after Wolverine Power Cooperative  a local power company  agreed to buy as much as     of the plant s output starting as soon as late       though additional hurdles  including sign off from federal nuclear regulators  remain              Holtec acquired the     megawatt power plant in      after Entergy Corp  closed it due to financial reasons 

Small modular reactor plans edit 
In December       Holtec International announced that it intended to build the first two of its SMR     small modular reactors at Palisades by mid
