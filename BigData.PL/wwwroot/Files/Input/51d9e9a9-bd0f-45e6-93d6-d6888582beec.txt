							Commercial and administrative projects have witnessed growth during the last period  contrary to the slowdown of residential real estate sector  The project accounted for the highest percentage of sales in       since most companies tended to diversify their products to stimulate sales 
Real estate developers expected that the commercial and administrative sector will continue its growth trend during the coming period  Especially that developers aim to continue developing new commercial  administrative and medical projects  
The West and East Cairo regions had the highest percentage of companies investing in the commercial sector during the past year  followed by the New Administrative Capital  NAC  
According to NextMove exhibitors  companies participating in the exhibition will showcase their best commercial and administrative projects  mostly offering them for the first time 
The administrative and commercial projects in the NAC have the highest demand  compared to the rest of the new cities during the recent period  in light of the relative decline in housing demand 
Co Owner of Royal for Real Estate Investment Karim Shaalan said that there is a great demand on administrative and commercial projects in east Cairo 
Shaalan noted that commercial and administrative units are attractive for customers who are willing to buy units for investment purposes because they have a high investment return  
CEO of Brickzey Property Management Ahmed Selim said that the valuation of such commercial and administrative projects is high whether by banks or by other financial entities  raising the listed company       s shares in stock market  
Selim added that some real estate developers tend to invest in administrative and commercial projects to compensate for part of their losses in residential projects  especially with the increase in construction costs after the increase in raw materials  prices 
Selim explained that the large investment return for administrative and commercial projects attracted real estate developers especially in the provinces  adding that governorates are in an urgent need for such projects 
He noted that the saturation of the New Cairo area by commercial  administrative  and medical projects encouraged investors to move to the NAC as a promising market and witness growth in the volume of investments compared to new cities 
He pointed out that the selling prices in service projects range from EGP        to EGP        per square metre for the administrative and medical units and from EGP        to EGP         for commercial units 
Country Head Egypt at commercial property services company Jones Lang LaSalle  JLL   Ayman Sami said that buying commercial and administrative units for investment purpose has increased during the past period to offset the sales of housing units that have absorbed investment demand in previous years 
Sami added that the Egyptian market is witnessing the implementation of commercial malls under the management of large companies  whether regional or international  which is a magnet for global brands that seek to increase sales 
He further noted that the increase in demand raises leasing prices  which is accepted by tenants because of their shops in malls increase their sales
