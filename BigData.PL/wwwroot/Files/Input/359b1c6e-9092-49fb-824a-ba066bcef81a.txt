Political disturbances in Egypt affected investment in a number of sectors  particularly the real estate sector  which has suffered from a lack of liquidity and capital flow  Developers have begun to search for greater liquidity  either through joint ventures and partnerships or merging with other companies in order to increase companies  capital 
Taha Abdel Latif  Chairman of the Board of Directors for Cordoba for Real Estate Investment  stressed the importance of establishing strong real estate development partnerships and achieving co operation in order to overcome the challenges and lack of stability in prices currently rocking the real estate market 
He said that his company is currently studying the possibility of approaching several Egyptian and Arab companies to purchase land in Libya and Iraq for low cost housing projects  Abdel Latif noted that partnerships are one of the most important factors for success for many global real estate companies  but that the domestic market does not apply the principle to the required extent due to the lack of separation between capital and company administrations  particularly among small and medium sized enterprises 
The prevailing culture among Egyptian companies  Abdel Latif added  makes it difficult for them to give up decision making power to those who have more experience  noting that his company is an exception  He said that his company is prepared to merge with large companies to benefit from their experience  particularly in the field of marketing real estate in foreign markets as well as the domestic one 
Mamdouh Al Toukhy  Director of Upper Egypt Contracting  however  predicted an increase in the number of partnerships and mergers between developers and contractors during the coming period 
He said that his company is currently looking in possible partnerships with large Egyptian contracting companies to build new commercial and residential projects 
He pointed out that negotiations are currently taking place with real estate development companies for projects in a number of new cities 
Tarek Shokry  a real estate development official with an investment company  said that mergers between large companies and small companies must proceed with caution because of the ability of the former to gradually take control of the latter  He said that such a process would increase the monopolistic power of the largest companies 
He added  however  that partnerships between large and small companies are natural  particularly because many small companies do not have the necessary experience to succeed in the real estate sector  According to Shokry  partnerships between companies have succeeded when both companies understand each other s needs well and when neither company is so large that it can dominate the other 
Mohamed El Gendy  Chairman of the Board for El Nasr Building and Construction Company  welcomed the idea of a partnership with a company with more experience in real estate development and marketing  He noted that his company owns a number of residential areas and has the necessary liquidity for its building projects  but that the company lacks experiencing in marketing its properties 
Gendy explained that his company recently signed a partnership deal with the United Bank to create a        square metre housing project on land owned by the bank in El Mahalla El Kubra  The project will require investments of EGP     million 
He hinted that the Egyptian market is in need of partnerships between strong companies and companies that have experienced difficulties  in order to strengthen the latter  He did not predict success for a partnership between weak companies 
Gendy also said that partnerships between large and small companies give the latter an opportunity to compete for large construction and development projects  Contracts for large projects are usually out of reach for small and medium sized companies 
Anas Lasheen  Director of Amaer  said that the primary obstacle facing weak companies is the difficulty in appraising old capital  For such companies  financing from banks  not partnerships or joint ventures  is the best way to find a way out of their difficult economic situation 
Lasheen pointed out that partnerships are a better option for companies than mergers and acquisitions because it allows companies to benefit from cooperation instead of integrating into the structure of a new company 
He said that his company is studying expanding housing construction in the Egyptian market starting next year  but that the plan will depend on demand
