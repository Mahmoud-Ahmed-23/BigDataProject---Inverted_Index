Advanced driver assistance systems  ADAS  are technologies that assist drivers with the safe operation of a vehicle  Through a human machine interface  ADAS increase car and road safety  ADAS use automated technology  such as sensors and cameras  to detect nearby obstacles or driver errors  and respond accordingly  ADAS can enable various levels of autonomous driving 
As most road crashes occur due to human error             ADAS are developed to automate  adapt  and enhance vehicle technology for safety and better driving  ADAS are proven to reduce road fatalities by minimizing human error             Safety features are designed to avoid crashes and collisions by offering technologies that alert the driver to problems  implementing safeguards  and taking control of the vehicle if necessary  ADAS may provide adaptive cruise control  assist in avoiding collisions  alert drivers to possible obstacles  warn of lane departure  assist in lane centering  incorporate satellite navigation  provide traffic warnings  provide navigational assistance through smartphones  automate lighting  or provide other features             According to the national crash database in the US  Forward Collision Prevention systems have the potential to reduce crashes by      Similarly  Lane Keeping Assistance is shown to offer a reduction potential of      while Blind Zone Detection could decrease crash incidents by               
According to a      research report from Canalys  approximately    percent of new vehicles sold in the United States  Europe  Japan  and China had ADAS  The firm also predicted that fifty percent of all automobiles on the road by the year      would be ADAS enabled            


Terminology edit 
Some groups advocate standardization of the name  such as Forward Collision Warning and Automatic Emergency Braking rather than Forward Collision Alert or Smart City Brake Support            
Such standardization is promoted by AAA  Consumer Reports  J D  Power  National Safety Council  PAVE  and SAE International            

Concept  history and development edit 
ADAS were first being used in the     s with the adoption of the anti lock braking system             Early ADAS include electronic stability control  anti lock brakes  blind spot information systems  lane departure warning  adaptive cruise control  and traction control  These systems can be affected by mechanical alignment adjustments or damage from a collision  This has led many manufacturers to require automatic resets for these systems after a mechanical alignment is performed      citation needed     

Technical concepts edit 
The reliance on data that describes the outside environment of the vehicle  compared to internal data  differentiates ADAS from driver assistance systems  DAS              ADAS rely on inputs from multiple data sources  including automotive imaging  LiDAR  radar  image processing  computer vision  and in car networking  Additional inputs are possible from other sources separate from the primary vehicle platform  including other vehicles  vehicle to vehicle or V V communication  and infrastructure  vehicle to infrastructure or V I communication                   Modern cars have ADAS integrated into their electronics  manufacturers can add these new features during the design process or after production via over the air  OTA  updates 
ADAS are considered real time systems since they react quickly to multiple inputs and prioritize the incoming information to prevent crashes              The systems use preemptive priority scheduling to organize which task needs to be done first              The incorrect assignment of these priorities is what can cause more harm than good             

ADAS levels edit 
See also  Self driving car        Levels of driving automation
ADAS are categorized into different levels based on the amount of automation  and the scale provided by The Society of Automotive Engineers  SAE              ADAS can be divided into six levels  In level    ADAS cannot control the car and can only provide information for the driver to interpret on their own             Some ADAS that are considered level   are  parking sensors  surround view  traffic sign recognition  lane departure warning  night vision  blind spot information system  rear cross traffic alert  and forward collision warning             Level   and   are very similar in that they both have the driver do most of the decision making  The difference is level   can take control over one functionality and level   can take control over multiple to aid the driver             ADAS that are considered level   are  adaptive cruise control  emergency brake assist  automatic emergency brake assist  lane keeping  and lane centering             ADAS that are considered level   are  highway assist  autonomous obstacle avoidance  and autonomous parking             From level   to    the amount of control the vehicle has increases  level   being where the vehicle is fully autonomous  Some of these systems have not yet been fully embedded in commercial vehicles  For instance  highway chauffeur is a Level   system  and automated valet parking is a level   system  both of which are not in full commercial use in                  The levels can be roughly understood as Level     no automation  Level     hands on shared control  Level     hands off  Level     eyes off  Level     mind off  and Level     steering wheel optional             

Feature examples edit 
This list is not a comprehensive list of all of the ADAS  Instead  it provides information on critical examples of ADAS             that have progressed and become more commonly available since                              

Alerts and warnings
Blind spot monitor involves cameras that monitor the driver s blind spots and notify the driver if any obstacles come close to the vehicle              Blind spots are defined as the areas behind or at the side of the vehicle that the driver cannot see from the driver s seat              Blind spot monitoring systems typically work in conjunction with emergency braking systems to act accordingly if any obstacles come into the vehicle s path  A rear cross traffic alert  RCTA  typically works in conjunction with the blind spot monitoring system  warning the driver of approaching cross traffic when reversing out of a parking spot             
Driver drowsiness detection aims to prevent collisions due to driver fatigue              The vehicle obtains information  such as facial patterns  steering movement  driving habits  turn signal use  and driving velocity  to determine if the driver s activities correspond with drowsy driving              If drowsy driving is suspected  the vehicle will typically sound off a loud alert and may vibrate the driver s seat              Infrared LEDs for driver monitoring system illumination
Driver monitoring system is designed to monitor the alertness of the driver              These systems use biological and performance measures to assess the driver s alertness and ability to conduct safe driving practices              Currently  these systems use infrared sensors and cameras to monitor the driver s attentiveness through eye tracking              If the vehicle detects a possible obstacle  it will notify the driver and if no action is taken  the vehicle may react to the obstacle 
Electric vehicle warning sounds notify pedestrians and cyclists that a hybrid or plug in electric vehicle is nearby  typically delivered through a noise  such as a beep or horn              This technology was developed in response to the U S  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ruling that issued    percent of quiet vehicles must have a device implemented into their systems that sound off when the vehicle travels at speeds less than         km h            mph  by September                  
Forward collision warning  FCW  monitor the speed of the vehicle and the vehicle in front of it  and the open distance around the vehicle              FCW systems will send an alert to the driver of a possible impending collision if gets too close to the vehicle in front of it                    These systems do not take control of the vehicle  as currently  FCW systems only send an alert signal to the driver in the form of an audio alert  visual pop up display  or other warning alert             
Intelligent speed adaptation or intelligent speed advice  ISA  assists drivers with compliance to the speed limit  They take in information of the vehicle s position and notify the driver when they are  not enforcing the speed limit              Some ISA systems allow the vehicle to adjust its speed to adhere to the relative speed limit              Other ISA systems only warn the driver when they are going over the speed limit and leave it up to the driver to enforce the speed limit or not             
Intersection assistants use two radar sensors in the front bumper and sides of the car to monitor if there are any oncoming cars at intersections  highway exits  or car parks              This system alerts the driver of any upcoming traffic from the vehicle s sides and can enact the vehicle s emergency braking system to prevent the collision             
Lane departure warning system  LDW  alerts the driver when they partially merge into a lane without using their turn signals              An LDW system uses cameras to monitor lane markings to determine if the driver unintentionally begins to drift              This system does not take control of the vehicle to help sway the car back into the safety zone but instead sends an audio or visual alert to the driver             
Parking sensors can scan the vehicle s surroundings for objects when the driver initiates parking              Audio warnings can notify the driver of the distance between the vehicle and its surrounding objects              Typically  the faster the audio warnings are issued  the closer the vehicle is getting to the object              These sensors may not detect objects closer to the ground  such as parking stops  which is why parking sensors typically work alongside backup cameras to assist the driver when reversing into a parking spot             TPMS low pressure warning icon
Tire pressure monitoring determine when the tire pressure is outside the normal inflation pressure range              The driver can monitor the tire pressure and is notified when there is a sudden drop through a pictogram display  gauge  or low pressure warning signal             
Vibrating seat warnings alert the driver of danger  GM s Cadillacs have offered vibrating seat warnings since the      Cadillac ATS  If the driver begins drifting out of the traveling lane of a highway  the seat vibrates in the direction of the drift  warning the driver of danger  The safety alert seat also provides a vibrating pulse on both sides of the seat when a frontal threat is detected             
Wrong way driving warning issue alerts to drivers when it is detected that they are on the wrong side of the road              Vehicles with this system enacted can use sensors and cameras to identify the direction of oncoming traffic flow              In conjunction with lane detection services  this system can also notify drivers when they partially merge into the wrong side of the road             
Crash mitigation edit 
Pedestrian protection systems are designed to minimize the number of crashes or injuries that occur between a vehicle and a pedestrian              This system uses cameras and sensors to determine when the front of a vehicle strikes a pedestrian              When the collision occurs  the vehicle s bonnet lifts to provide a cushion between the vehicle s hard engine components and the pedestrian              This helps minimize the possibility of a severe head injury when the pedestrian s head comes into contact with the vehicle             
Driving task assistance edit 
Adaptive cruise control  ACC  can maintain a chosen velocity and distance between a vehicle and the vehicle ahead  ACC can automatically brake or accelerate with concern to the distance between the vehicle and the vehicle ahead              ACC systems with stop and go features can come to a complete stop and accelerate back to the specified speed              This system still requires an alert driver to take in their surroundings  as it only controls speed and the distance between you and the car in front of you              Symbol for ABS
Anti lock braking system  ABS  restore traction to a car s tires by regulating the brake pressure when the vehicle begins to skid              Alongside helping drivers in emergencies  such as when their car starts to skid on ice  ABS systems can also assist drivers who may lose control of their vehicle              With the growing popularity in the     s  ABS systems have become standard in vehicles              Automatic parking  demonstrated by hands off driver
Automatic parking fully takes over control of parking functions  including steering  braking  and acceleration  to assist drivers in parking              Depending on the relative cars and obstacles  the vehicle positions itself safely into the available parking spot              Currently  the driver must still be aware of the vehicle s surroundings and be willing to take control of it if necessary 
Collision avoidance system  pre crash system  uses small radar detectors  typically placed near the front of the car  to determine the car s vicinity to nearby obstacles and notify the driver of potential car crash situations              These systems can account for any sudden changes to the car s environment that may cause a collision              Systems can respond to a possible collision situation with multiple actions  such as sounding an alarm  tensing up passengers  seat belts  closing a sunroof  and raising reclined seats             
Crosswind stabilization helps prevent a vehicle from overturning when strong winds hit its side by analyzing       the vehicle s yaw rate  steering angle  lateral acceleration  and velocity sensors              This system distributes the wheel load in relation to the velocity and direction of the crosswind             
Cruise control can maintain a specific speed pre determined by the driver              The car will maintain the speed the driver sets until the driver hits the brake pedal  clutch pedal  or disengages the system              Specific cruise control systems can accelerate or decelerate  but require the driver to click a button and notify the car of the goal speed              ESC control light
Electronic stability control  ESC  can reduce the speed of the car and activate individual brakes to prevent understeer and oversteer              Understeer occurs when the car s front wheels do not have enough traction to make the car turn and oversteer occurs when the car turns more than intended  causing the car to spin out              In conjunction with other car safety technologies  such as anti lock braking and traction control  the ESC can safely help drivers maintain control of the car in unforeseen situations             
Emergency driver assistant facilitates emergency counteract measures if the driver falls asleep or does not perform any driving action after a defined length of time              After a specified period of time  if the driver has not interacted with the accelerator  brake  or steering wheel  the car will send audio  visual  and physical signals to the driver              If the driver does not wake up after these signals  the system will stop  safely position the vehicle away from oncoming traffic  and turn on the hazard warning lights             
Hill descent control helps drivers maintain a safe speed when driving down a hill or other decline              These systems are typically enacted if the vehicle moves faster than    to         mph when driving down  When a change in grade is sensed  hill descent control automates the driver s speed to descend down the steep grade safely              This system works by pulsing the braking system and controlling each wheel independently to maintain traction down the descent             
Hill start assist also known as hill start control or hill holder  helps prevent a vehicle from rolling backward down a hill when starting again from a stopped position              This feature holds the brake for you while you transition between the brake pedal and the gas pedal              For manual cars  this feature holds the brake for you while you transition between the brake pedal  the clutch  and the gas pedal             
Lane centering assists the driver in keeping the vehicle centered in a lane              A lane centering system may autonomously take over the steering when it determines the driver is at risk of deterring from the lane              This system uses cameras to monitor lane markings to stay within a safe distance between both sides of the lane             
Lane change assistance helps the driver through a safe completion of a lane change by using sensors to scan the vehicle s surroundings and monitor the driver s blind spots              When a driver intends to make a lane change  the vehicle will notify the driver through an audio or visual alert when a vehicle is approaching from behind or is in the vehicle s blind spot              The visual alert may appear in the dashboard  heads up display  or the exterior rear view mirrors              Several kind of lane change assistance might exist  for instance UNECE regulation    considers             
 ACSF  Automatically commanded steering function  of Category C        a function which is initiated activated by the driver and which can perform a single lateral manoeuvre  e g  lane change  when commanded by the driver 
 ACSF of Category D        a function which is initiated activated by the driver and which can indicate the possibility of a single lateral manoeuvre  e g  lane change  but performs that function only following a confirmation by the driver 
 ACSF of Category E        a function which is initiated activated by the driver and which can continuously determine the possibility of a manoeuvre  e g  lane change  and complete these manoeuvres for extended periods without further driver command confirmation 
Rain sensors detect water and automatically trigger electrical actions  such as the raising of open windows and the closing of open convertible tops              A rain sensor can also take in the frequency of rain droplets to automatically trigger windshield wipers with an accurate speed for the corresponding rainfall             
Traction control system  TCS  helps prevent traction loss in vehicles and prevent vehicle turnover on sharp curves and turns              By limiting tire slip  or when the force on a tire exceeds the tire s traction  this limits power delivery and helps the driver accelerate the car without losing control              These systems use the same wheel speed sensors as the antilock braking systems              Individual wheel braking systems are deployed through TCS to control when one tire spins faster than the others

			Backup camera displayed in digital instrument panel
		

Automotive head up display  auto HUD  safely displays essential system information to a driver at a vantage point that does not require the driver to look down or away from the road              Currently  the majority of the auto HUD systems on the market display system information on a windshield using LCDs             
Automotive navigation system use digital mapping tools  such as the global positioning system  GPS  and traffic message channel  TMC   to provide drivers with up to date traffic and navigation information              Through an embedded receiver  an automotive navigation system can send and receive data signals transmitted from satellites regarding the current position of the vehicle in relation to its surroundings             
Automotive night vision systems enable the vehicle to detect obstacles  including pedestrians  in a nighttime setting or heavy weather situation when the driver has low visibility  These systems can various technologies  including infrared sensors  GPS  Lidar  and Radar  to detect pedestrians and non human obstacles             
Backup camera provides real time video information regarding the location of your vehicle and its surroundings              This camera offers driver s aid when backing up by providing a viewpoint that is typically a blind spot in traditional cars              When the driver puts the car in reverse  the camera automatically turns on             
Glare free high beam use Light Emitting Diodes  more commonly known as LEDs  to cut two or more cars from the light distribution              This allows oncoming vehicles coming in the opposite direction not to be affected by the light of the       high beams  In       the VW Touareg introduced the first glare free high beam headlamp system  which used a mechanical shutter to cut light from hitting specific traffic participants             
Omniview technology improves a driver s visibility by offering a     degree viewing system              This system can accurately provide  D peripheral images of the car s surroundings through video display outputted to the driver              Currently  commercial systems can only provide  D images of the driver s surroundings  Omniview technology uses the input of four cameras and a bird s eye technology to provide a composite  D model of the surroundings             
Traffic sign recognition  TSR  systems can recognize common traffic signs  such as a  stop  sign or a  turn ahead  sign  through image processing techniques              This system takes into account the sign s shape  such as hexagons and rectangles  and the color to classify what the sign is communicating to the driver              Since most systems currently use camera based technology  a wide variety of factors can make the system less accurate  These include poor lighting conditions  extreme weather conditions  and partial obstruction of the sign             
Vehicular communication systems come in three forms  vehicle to vehicle  V V   vehicle to infrastructure  V I   and vehicle to everything  V X   V V systems allow vehicles to exchange information with each other about their current position and upcoming hazards              V I systems occur when the vehicle exchanges information with nearby infrastructure elements  such as street signs              V X systems occur when the vehicle monitors its environment and takes in information about possible obstacles or pedestrians in its path             
 Hands off systems edit 
Ford and General Motors provide  hands off  eyes on  systems such as Blue Cruise and Super Cruise in North America  These systems allow drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel while the system is engaged  However  drivers must keep their eyes on the road and be ready to take immediate action at all times

Crash statistics edit 
On June           the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA   the branch of the United States Department of Transportation responsible for federal motor vehicle regulations  issued Standing General Order          SGO                            which required manufacturers of ADAS  Levels   or    and Automated Driving Systems  ADS   Levels   through    to promptly report crashes that occurred when driver assistance or automation systems were in use              SGO              subsequently was amended on August                      Under the amended SGO               a crash involving ADS or Level   ADAS is reportable to the NHTSA if it meets the following criteria                                     

it happened on a publicly accessible road in the United States
the Levels     ADS or Level   ADAS was engaged at any time within    seconds before the start of the crash through the conclusion of the crash
A severe crash is one that results in one or more of the following                                  

transport to a hospital for medical treatment or a fatality  regardless of whether that person was an occupant of the vehicle equipped with the ADS or L  ADAS
a vehicle tow away or an air bag deployment  regardless of whether that is the vehicle equipped with the ADS or L  ADAS
involves a vulnerable road user  anyone who is not an occupant of a motor vehicle with more than three wheels  typically pedestrians  wheelchair users  motorcyclists  or bicyclists   regardless of that vulnerable road user s influence on the cause of the crash
The incident report to the NHTSA must be made according to the following schedule                                            

Severe crashes must be reported within one calendar day after the manufacturer receives notice the crash has occurred  In addition  an updated crash incident report must be made within ten calendar days after the manufacturer receives notice the crash has occurred 
Otherwise  non severe crashes involving ADS  excluding L  ADAS  must be reported on the fifteenth day of the month following the calendar month in which the manufacturer receives notice the crash has occurred 
SGO              is in effect for three years  starting on June                                           After gathering data for almost a year  July         through May            the NHTSA released the initial set of data in June      and stated they plan to update the data on a monthly basis              The data are subject to several caveats and limitations  for instance  manufacturers are not required to report the number of vehicles that have been built and equipped with ADS ADAS  the number of vehicles operating with ADS ADAS  or the total distance traveled with ADS ADAS active  which would be helpful to normalize the incident report data             
According to the initial data covering July      to May           ADS  Levels      from    different manufacturers were involved in     crashes  led by Waymo LLC       Transdev Alternative Services       Cruise LLC       General Motors       and Argo AI       because multiple manufacturers can report the same crash  the sum exceeds the total number of reportable incidents                                    Of the     crashes      had no associated injuries reported  there was only one serious injury associated with the remaining crashes                                  The most commonly reported damage location was the rear of the ADS equipped vehicle                                 
Similarly  ADAS  Level    from    different manufacturers were involved in     crashes over the same period      crashes were reported in total  but    either occurred before July      or had no associated date  Reported incidents were led by Tesla        Honda       and Subaru                                         Of the     crashes     included injury reporting  of the        had no injuries reported    resulted in serious injuries and   resulted in fatalities                                  The most commonly reported damage location was the front of the ADAS equipped vehicle                                 

Potential issues and concerns edit 
Need for standardization edit 
According to PACTS  lack of full standardization might make the system have difficulty being understandable by the driver who might believe that the car behaves like another car while it does not             

We can t help feeling that this lack of standardisation is one of the more problematic aspects of driver assistance systems  and it s one that is likely to be felt more keenly as systems become increasingly commonplace in years to come  particularly if traffic laws change to allow  hands off  driving in the future         EuroNCAP            
ADAS might have many limitations  for instance a pre collision system might have    pages to explain    exceptions where ADAS may operate when not needed and    exceptions where ADAS may not operate when a collision is likely             

Adaptive cruise control display in the instrument panel of a Volkswagen Golf  Mk  
Names for ADAS features are not standardized  For instance  adaptive cruise control is called Adaptive Cruise Control by Fiat  Ford  GM  VW  Volvo and Peugeot  but Intelligent Cruise Control by Nissan  Active Cruise Control by Citroen and BMW  and DISTRONIC by Mercedes              To help with standardization  SAE International has endorsed a series of recommendations for generic ADAS terminology for car manufacturers  that it created with Consumer Reports  the American Automobile Association  J D  Power  and the National Safety Council                         
Buttons and dashboard symbols change from car to car due to lack of standardization             
ADAS behavior might change from car to car  for instance ACC speed might be temporarily overridden in most cars  while some switch to standby after one minute             

Insurance and economic impact edit 
The AV industry is growing exponentially  and according to a report by Market Research Future  the market is expected to hit over     billion by       AV insurance and rising competition are expected to fuel that growth              Auto insurance for ADAS has directly affected the global economy  and many questions have arisen within the general public  ADAS allow autonomous vehicles to enable self driving features  but there are associated risks with ADAS  AV companies and manufacturers are recommended to have insurance in the following areas in order to avoid any serious litigations  Depending on the level  ranging from   to    each car manufacturer would find it in its best interest to find the right combination of different insurances to best match their products  Note that this list is not exhaustive and may be constantly updated with more types of insurances and risks in the years to come 

Technology errors and omissions   This insurance will cover any physical risk if the technology itself has failed  These usually include all of the associated expenses of a car crash 
Auto liability and physical damage   This insurance covers third party injuries and technology damage 
Cyber liability   This insurance will protect companies from any lawsuits from third parties and penalties from regulators regarding cybersecurity 
Directors and officers   This insurance protects a company s balance sheet and assets by protecting the company from bad management or misappropriation of assets 
With the technology embedded in autonomous vehicles  these self driving cars are able to distribute data if a car crash occurs  This  in turn  will invigorate the claims administration and their operations  Fraud reduction will also disable any fraudulent staging of car crashes by recording the car s monitoring of every minute on the road              ADAS are expected to streamline the insurance industry and its economic efficiency with capable technology to fight off fraudulent human behavior  In September       the NHTSA published the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy  which describes the U S  Department of Transportation s policies related to highly automated vehicles  HAV  which range from vehicles with ADAS features to autonomous vehicles 

Ethical issues and current solutions edit 
See also  Self driving car liability and Tesla Autopilot        Fatal crashesIn March       the US Department of Transportation s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  announced that it will require all new vehicles under        pounds             kg  to have rear view cameras by May       The rule was required by Congress as part of the Cameron Gulbransen Kids Transportation Safety Act of                   The Act is named after two year old Cameron Gulbransen  Cameron s father backed up his SUV over him  when he did not see the toddler in the family s driveway             
The advancement of autonomous driving is accompanied by ethical concerns  The earliest moral issue associated with autonomous driving can be dated back to as early as the age of the trolleys  The trolley problem is one of the most well known ethical issues  Introduced by English philosopher Philippa Foot in       the trolley problem asks that under a situation which the trolley s brake does not work  and there are five people ahead of the trolley  the driver may go straight  killing the five persons ahead  or turn to the side track killing the one pedestrian  what should the driver do              Before the development of autonomous vehicles  the trolley problem remains an ethical dilemma between utilitarianism and deontological ethics  However  as the advancement in ADAS proceeds  the trolley problem becomes an issue that needs to be addressed by the programming of self driving cars  The crashes that autonomous vehicles might face could be very similar to those depicted in the trolley problem              Although ADAS make vehicles generally safer than only human driven cars  crashes are unavoidable              This raises questions such as  whose lives should be prioritized in the event of an inevitable crash   Or  What should be the universal principle for these  crash algorithms   

NTSB investigators examine the Volvo XC   operated by Uber that struck and killed Elaine Herzberg        
Many researchers have been working on ways to address the ethical concerns associated with ADAS  For instance  the artificial intelligence approach allows computers to learn human ethics by feeding them data regarding human actions              Such a method is useful when the rules cannot be articulated because the computer can learn and identify the ethical elements on its own without precisely programming whether an action is ethical              However  there are limitations to this approach  For example  many human actions are done out of self preservation instincts  which is realistic but not ethical  feeding such data to the computer cannot guarantee that the computer captures the ideal behavior              Furthermore  the data fed to an artificial intelligence must be carefully selected to avoid producing undesired outcomes             
Another notable method is a three phase approach proposed by Noah J  Goodall  This approach first necessitates a system established with the agreement of car manufacturers  transportation engineers  lawyers  and ethicists  and should be set transparently              The second phase is letting artificial intelligence learn human ethics while being bound by the system established in phase one              Lastly  the system should provide constant feedback that is understandable by humans

Future edit 
Intelligent transport systems  ITS  highly resemble ADAS  but experts believe that ITS goes beyond automatic traffic to include any enterprise that safely transports humans              ITS is where the transportation technology is integrated with a city s infrastructure              This would then lead to a  smart city               These systems promote active safety by increasing the efficiency of roads  possibly by adding       capacity on average  not the actual count              ADAS have aided in this increase in active safety  according to a study in       ITS systems use a wide system of communication technology  including wireless technology and traditional technology  to enhance productivity             
Driver control assistance systems  DCAS  is the name of a draft ADAS regulation             
It would allow hands free driving with a possible risk of lack of attentiveness             
Such DCAS regulation would allow system such as Tesla FSD in Europe             
The UNECE driver control assistance systems regulation plan that DCAS shall be designed to ensure that the driver performs the driving task  that the driver s hands must remain on the wheel and that the system shall monitor the driver s visual engagement
