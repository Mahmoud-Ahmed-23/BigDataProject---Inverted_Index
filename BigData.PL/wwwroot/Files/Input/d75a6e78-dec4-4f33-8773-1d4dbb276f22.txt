							In Egypt  cash is king  when it comes to different financial transaction  Out of the     million population  the World Bank estimates that just        have a bank account  which is considered to be one of the lowest global penetration rates  Over the past few years  financial inclusion has been brought to the forefront in Egypt as a means for financial sector growth  Along with the increasing need for innovation and the shift toward digitisation  plenty of FinTech startups have emerged in the country 
According to the International Monetary Fund  IMF  Egypt has tremendous potential to expand in FinTech due to its large economy and mature banking industry  One of the most notable Egyptian FinTech startups is Masary  a provider of e payments through more than        locations 
According to the Chairperson and CEO of Masary  Mohamed Nagy  the company has completed the first transaction in       and Masary currently processes    m transactions daily 
As per the Arab Youth Survey       just     of youth in north Africa prefer to pay via credit card online  But with the high mobile penetration rates  more and more start ups are relying on mobile phone payments to make the user       s experience easier and financial services more accessible 
Daily News Egypt interviewed the Chairperson and CEO of Masary  Mohamed Nagy  to find out how would Seamless bring the financial inclusion target a step closer  and the company s latest updates  the transcript for which is below  lightly edited for clarity 

As a company  what do you plan to achieve from your participation in Seamless North Africa      
The Seamless conference is considered to be the premier forum and conference when it comes to bringing together the brightest minds from across payments  FinTech and banking  Almost a year ago in      the first edition of Seamless North Africa came to the first time in Egypt  under the under the patronage of the Central Bank of Egypt  CBE  
     s edition had a spectacular engagement  and participation of all industry leaders  As a company  we strive to support  and play an active role in the development of the e payment sector in Egypt  that s why we decided to participate in the conference  to have a discussion with industry experts from across the globe  as well as banking experts 
We have been operating for almost    years in the Egyptian market  Masary managed to become the country s second largest player in e payments 
How do you evaluate the e payments sector in Egypt  and how can we achieve high penetration rates 
The e payments sector is unique in every country  although it started in developing nations  where economic development is dependent on financial transactions  technological advancement in the last few decades allowed the facilitation of such transactions 
In Egypt s case  although we are a developing country  but our case is different  as we have a strong banking sector   Unlike other countries our e payments development was not chaotic  it was regulated in a very well mannered fashion as the Central Bank of Egypt  CBE  has learned from other countries  experiences  to avoid any set backs 
 
You can say that this allowed Egypt to start where the others ended 
I believe that the turning point for the industry in Egypt was the      s Sharm El Sheikh Accord on Financial Inclusion  under the auspices of the President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi and the CBE  which tackled the need to raise awareness and advocate for financial inclusion policies and regulatory approaches  and implementing financial inclusion policy solutions that have positive outcomes 
Since that day the authorities  political will to support digitalisation and e payment increased and      witnessed a remarkable development in the fields of electronic payment and the transition to a cashless society  The Egyptian market is highly competitive according to professional standards  encouraging many companies operating in the market to improve their services and focus  Masary has an ambitious vision aimed at the expansion of the Egyptian market  aiming to boost financial inclusion 
 
Where does Masary currently stand  and what are the company s future expansion plans 
 
In      more than    million people benefited monthly  and currently we have more than        outlets across the country  including       points of sale  POS  supporting prepaid electricity cards 
Also we aim to that all our POS to be compatible with the  Meeza  card  and we are currently studying  partnering with more than one bank to activate this feature as a means of payment 
Our company       s share reached     of the Egyptian payment market  Also we aim to increase the number of services provided by the company  Presently  more than    m transaction go through Masary on a daily basis  and we aim to bring that number up to  m by the end of      
Regarding the POS  we target to more than double our POS to reach         POS by the end of      
We currently provide     services through Total services      up from a Total services    across Egypt in       as we put customer satisfaction and service and achieving financial inclusion as our priority 
As a company we provide an efficient solution to everyone  companies  merchants  and consumers  Everyone is benefiting from the system and it is cheaper for them to use that service 
 
Collaboration with e finance for the government related payments  boosted the company       s growth rates and contributed to a growing customer base 
 
How does the company target the micro finance and micro insurance segment 
 
We collaborated with various micro financing institutions who provide credit for micro enterprises  to allow their beneficiaries to pay their loan instalments through our company s outlets  to ease the process   enhance payment channels  and that s what would play a role in enhancing inclusion 
 
The company believes in the role that financial achievement can play in driving economic development  as well as the role that Masary can play as a purely Egyptian company in supporting the country       s direction in this field 
Ease of use  feasibility  low services charge  and accessibility  are the most important factors of the success of the system of financial inclusion 
 
Any plans to collaborate with telecom companies  and banks for mobile wallet services 
The company seeks to expand the base of cooperation with the Egyptian banks in several areas  for example adding credit and withdrawals from the personal cash portfolios and transferring funds via mobile phone  which received all the support from the CBE and other services aimed at supporting the government       s direction  Also  spreading awareness and financial integration among citizens by providing services in a simple  safe and cost effective manner 
New services provided by the company are in support of the expansion of government services to citizens in cooperation with e finance  while continuing to work with private sector companies to support them in the service of our customers and to simplify and accelerate the collection process 
Masary also cooperates with banking and non bank financial institutions to provide services to the largest base of citizens dealing with these institutions 
Masary Electronic Payment Solutions is holding semi final talks with the three entities  Vodafone  Orange  and Etisalat mobile operators to provide cash in  amp  out services through their nationwide outlets 
Does the company target the B B segment 
 
It is not our main focus  but we are definitely working on it  but our main goal is to make a difference in e payment in the society  which is more concerned with b c 
Allowing users to pay for utilities  buy merchandise  pay for tuition etc with ease  would help economic growth 
B b market has great demand  we are definitely working on it but it s not our main goal 
We plan to include further utilities and government services  and of course electronic payments  such as the  Meeza  card  through our collaboration with e finance
