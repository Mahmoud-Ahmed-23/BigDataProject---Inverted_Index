Artificial intelligence  AI  has a range of uses in government  It can be used to further public policy objectives  in areas such as emergency services  health and welfare   as well as assist the public to interact with the government   through the use of virtual assistants  for example   According to the Harvard Business Review   Applications of artificial intelligence to the public sector are broad and growing  with early experiments taking place around the world              Hila Mehr from the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard University notes that AI in government is not new  with postal services using machine methods in the late     s to recognise handwriting on envelopes to automatically route letters             The use of AI in government comes with significant benefits  including efficiencies resulting in cost savings  for instance by reducing the number of front office staff   and reducing the opportunities for corruption             However  it also carries risks  described below  


Uses of AI in government edit 
The potential uses of AI in government are wide and varied             with Deloitte considering that  Cognitive technologies could eventually revolutionize every facet of government operations              Mehr suggests that six types of government problems are appropriate for AI applications            

Resource allocation   such as where administrative support is required to complete tasks more quickly 
Large datasets   where these are too large for employees to work efficiently and multiple datasets could be combined to provide greater insights 
Experts shortage   including where basic questions could be answered and niche issues can be learned 
Predictable scenario   historical data makes the situation predictable 
Procedural   repetitive tasks where inputs or outputs have a binary answer 
Diverse data   where data takes a variety of forms  such as visual and linguistic  and needs to be summarised regularly 
Mehr states that  While applications of AI in government work have not kept pace with the rapid expansion of AI in the private sector  the potential use cases in the public sector mirror common applications in the private sector             
Potential and actual uses of AI in government can be divided into three broad categories  those that contribute to public policy objectives  those that assist public interactions with the government  and other uses 

Contributing to public policy objectives edit 
There are a range of examples of where AI can contribute to public policy objectives             These include 

Receiving benefits at job loss  retirement  bereavement and child birth almost immediately  in an automated way  thus without requiring any actions from citizens at all            
Social insurance service provision           
Classifying emergency calls based on their urgency  like the system used by the Cincinnati Fire Department in the United States            
Detecting and preventing the spread of diseases           
Assisting public servants in making welfare payments and immigration decisions           
Adjudicating bail hearings           
Triaging health care cases           
Monitoring social media for public feedback on policies           
Monitoring social media to identify emergency situations           
Identifying fraudulent benefits claims           
Predicting a crime and recommending optimal police presence           
Predicting traffic congestion and car accidents           
Anticipating road maintenance requirements           
Identifying breaches of health regulations           
Providing personalised education to students           
Marking exam papers           
Assisting with defence and national security  see Artificial intelligence        Military and Applications of artificial intelligence        Other fields in which AI methods are implemented respectively 
Assisting public interactions with government edit 
AI can be used to assist members of the public to interact with government and access government services             for example by 

Answering questions using virtual assistants or chatbots  see below 
Directing requests to the appropriate area within government           
Filling out forms           
Assisting with searching documents  e g  IP Australia s trade mark search            
Scheduling appointments           
Various governments  including those of Australia             and Estonia              have implemented virtual assistants to aid citizens in navigating services  with applications ranging from tax inquiries to life event registrations 

Gerrymandering edit 
Gerrymandering is an insidious method of influencing political process              Depending on the objective of its use  the application of artificial intelligence to redraw districts based on voter distribution and demographic datasets can either contribute to impartiality  or sustain partisan gains for interested stakeholders in the election process             

Other uses edit 
Other uses of AI in government include 

Translation           
Language interpretation pioneered by the European Commission s Directorate General for Interpretation and Florika Fink Hooijer 
Drafting documents           
Potential benefits edit 
AI offers potential efficiencies and costs savings for the government  For example  Deloitte has estimated that automation could save US Government employees between      million to     billion hours a year  resulting in potential savings of between      billion to       billion a year             The Harvard Business Review has stated that while this may lead a government to reduce employee numbers   Governments could instead choose to invest in the quality of its services  They can re employ workers  time towards more rewarding work that requires lateral thinking  empathy  and creativity   all things at which humans continue to outperform even the most sophisticated AI program             

Risks edit 
Risks associated with the use of AI in government include AI becoming susceptible to bias             a lack of transparency in how an AI application may make decisions             and the accountability for any such decisions            
AI in governance and the economic world might make the market more difficult for companies to keep up with the increases in technology  Large U S  companies like Apple and Google are able to dominate the market with their latest and most advanced technologies  This gives them an advantage over smaller companies that do not have the means of advancing as far in the digital technology fields with AI
