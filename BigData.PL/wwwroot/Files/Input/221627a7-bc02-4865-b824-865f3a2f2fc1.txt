Language for communicating instructions to a machine



The source code for a computer program in C  The gray lines are comments that explain the program to humans  When compiled and run  it will give the output  Hello  world   
A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs            
Programming languages are described in terms of their syntax  form  and semantics  meaning   usually defined by a formal language  Languages usually provide features such as a type system  variables  and mechanisms for error handling  An implementation of a programming language is required in order to execute programs  namely an interpreter or a compiler  An interpreter directly executes the source code  while a compiler produces an executable program 
Computer architecture has strongly influenced the design of programming languages  with the most common type  imperative languages which implement operations in a specified order  developed to perform well on the popular von Neumann architecture  While early programming languages were closely tied to the hardware  over time they have developed more abstraction to hide implementation details for greater simplicity 
Thousands of programming languages often classified as imperative  functional  logic  or object oriented have been developed for a wide variety of uses  Many aspects of programming language design involve tradeoffs for example  exception handling simplifies error handling  but at a performance cost  Programming language theory is the subfield of computer science that studies the design  implementation  analysis  characterization  and classification of programming languages 


Definitions edit 
Programming languages differ from natural languages in that natural languages are used for interaction between people  while programming languages are designed to allow humans to communicate instructions to machines      citation needed     
The term computer language is sometimes used interchangeably with  programming language              However  usage of these terms varies among authors 
In one usage  programming languages are described as a subset of computer languages             Similarly  the term  computer language  may be used in contrast to the term  programming language  to describe languages used in computing but not considered programming languages      citation needed      Most practical programming languages are Turing complete             and as such are equivalent in what programs they can compute 
Another usage regards programming languages as theoretical constructs for programming abstract machines and computer languages as the subset thereof that runs on physical computers  which have finite hardware resources             John C  Reynolds emphasizes that formal specification languages are just as much programming languages as are the languages intended for execution  He also argues that textual and even graphical input formats that affect the behavior of a computer are programming languages  despite the fact they are commonly not Turing complete  and remarks that ignorance of programming language concepts is the reason for many flaws in input formats

Early developments edit 
The first programmable computers were invented at the end of the     s  and with them  the first programming languages             The earliest computers were programmed in first generation programming languages   GLs   machine language  simple instructions that could be directly executed by the processor   This code was very difficult to debug and was not portable between different computer systems             In order to improve the ease of programming  assembly languages  or second generation programming languages  GLs  were invented  diverging from the machine language to make programs easier to understand for humans  although they did not increase portability            
Initially  hardware resources were scarce and expensive  while human resources were cheaper  Therefore  cumbersome languages that were time consuming to use  but were closer to the hardware for higher efficiency were favored              The introduction of high level programming languages  third generation programming languages  GLs  revolutionized programming  These languages abstracted away the details of the hardware  instead being designed to express algorithms that could be understood more easily by humans  For example  arithmetic expressions could now be written in symbolic notation and later translated into machine code that the hardware could execute             In       Fortran  FORmula TRANslation  was invented  Often considered the first compiled high level programming language                         Fortran has remained in use into the twenty first century             

    s and     s edit 
Two people using an IBM     mainframe the first hardware to support floating point arithmetic in       Fortran was designed for this machine                         
Around       the first mainframes general purpose computers were developed  although they could only be operated by professionals and the cost was extreme  The data and instructions were input by punch cards  meaning that no input could be added while the program was running  The languages developed at this time therefore are designed for minimal interaction              After the invention of the microprocessor  computers in the     s became dramatically cheaper              New computers also allowed more user interaction  which was supported by newer programming languages             
Lisp  implemented in       was the first functional programming language              Unlike Fortran  it supported recursion and conditional expressions              and it also introduced dynamic memory management on a heap and automatic garbage collection              For the next decades  Lisp dominated artificial intelligence applications              In       another functional language  ML  introduced inferred types and polymorphic parameters                         
After ALGOL  ALGOrithmic Language  was released in      and                   it became the standard in computing literature for describing algorithms  Although its commercial success was limited  most popular imperative languages including C  Pascal  Ada  C    Java  and C  are directly or indirectly descended from ALGOL                             Among its innovations adopted by later programming languages included greater portability and the first use of context free  BNF grammar              Simula  the first language to support object oriented programming  including subtypes  dynamic dispatch  and inheritance   also descends from ALGOL and achieved commercial success              C  another ALGOL descendant  has sustained popularity into the twenty first century  C allows access to lower level machine operations more than other contemporary languages  Its power and efficiency  generated in part with flexible pointer operations  comes at the cost of making it more difficult to write correct code             
Prolog  designed in       was the first logic programming language  communicating with a computer using formal logic notation                          With logic programming  the programmer specifies a desired result and allows the interpreter to decide how to achieve it                         

    s to     s edit 
A small selection of programming language textbooks
During the     s  the invention of the personal computer transformed the roles for which programming languages were used              New languages introduced in the     s included C    a superset of C that can compile C programs but also supports classes and inheritance              Ada and other new languages introduced support for concurrency              The Japanese government invested heavily into the so called fifth generation languages that added support for concurrency to logic programming constructs  but these languages were outperformed by other concurrency supporting languages                         
Due to the rapid growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web in the     s  new programming languages were introduced to support Web pages and networking              Java  based on C   and designed for increased portability across systems and security  enjoyed large scale success because these features are essential for many Internet applications                          Another development was that of dynamically typed scripting languages Python  JavaScript  PHP  and Ruby designed to quickly produce small programs that coordinate existing applications  Due to their integration with HTML  they have also been used for building web pages hosted on servers                         

    s to present edit 
During the     s  there was a slowdown in the development of new programming languages that achieved widespread popularity              One innovation was service oriented programming  designed to exploit distributed systems whose components are connected by a network  Services are similar to objects in object oriented programming  but run on a separate process              C  and F  cross pollinated ideas between imperative and functional programming              After       several new languages Rust  Go  Swift  Zig and Carbon  competed for the performance critical software for which C had historically been used              Most of the new programming languages use static typing while a few numbers of new languages use dynamic typing like Ring and Julia                         
Some of the new programming languages are classified as visual programming languages like Scratch  LabVIEW and PWCT  Also  some of these languages mix between textual and visual programming usage like Ballerina                                                  Also  this trend lead to developing projects that help in developing new VPLs like Blockly by Google              Many game engines like Unreal and Unity added support for visual scripting too                         

Elements edit 
Every programming language includes fundamental elements for describing data and the operations or transformations applied to them  such as adding two numbers or selecting an item from a collection  These elements are governed by syntactic and semantic rules that define their structure and meaning  respectively 

Syntax edit 
Main article  Syntax  programming languages 
Parse tree of Python code with inset tokenization
Syntax highlighting is often used to aid programmers in recognizing elements of source code  The language above is Python 
A programming language s surface form is known as its syntax  Most programming languages are purely textual  they use sequences of text including words  numbers  and punctuation  much like written natural languages  On the other hand  some programming languages are graphical  using visual relationships between symbols to specify a program 
The syntax of a language describes the possible combinations of symbols that form a syntactically correct program  The meaning given to a combination of symbols is handled by semantics  either formal or hard coded in a reference implementation   Since most languages are textual  this article discusses textual syntax 
The programming language syntax is usually defined using a combination of regular expressions  for lexical structure  and Backus Naur form  for grammatical structure   Below is a simple grammar  based on Lisp 

expression     atom   list
atom           number   symbol
number                                        
symbol               A           Z          a           z        
list                       expression             

This grammar specifies the following 

an expression is either an atom or a list 
an atom is either a number or a symbol 
a number is an unbroken sequence of one or more decimal digits  optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign 
a symbol is a letter followed by zero or more of any alphabetical characters  excluding whitespace   and
a list is a matched pair of parentheses  with zero or more expressions inside it 
The following are examples of well formed token sequences in this grammar            and  a b c         
Not all syntactically correct programs are semantically correct  Many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless ill formed  per the language s rules  and may  depending on the language specification and the soundness of the implementation  result in an error on translation or execution  In some cases  such programs may exhibit undefined behavior  Even when a program is well defined within a language  it may still have a meaning that is not intended by the person who wrote it 
Using natural language as an example  it may not be possible to assign a meaning to a grammatically correct sentence or the sentence may be false 

 Colorless green ideas sleep furiously   is grammatically well formed but has no generally accepted meaning 
 John is a married bachelor   is grammatically well formed but expresses a meaning that cannot be true 
The following C language fragment is syntactically correct  but performs operations that are not semantically defined  the operation  p  gt  gt    has no meaning for a value having a complex type and p  gt im is not defined because the value of p is the null pointer  

complex  p   NULL 
complex abs p   sqrt  p  gt  gt      p  gt im  

If the type declaration on the first line were omitted  the program would trigger an error on the undefined variable p during compilation  However  the program would still be syntactically correct since type declarations provide only semantic information 
The grammar needed to specify a programming language can be classified by its position in the Chomsky hierarchy  The syntax of most programming languages can be specified using a Type   grammar  i e   they are context free grammars              Some languages  including Perl and Lisp  contain constructs that allow execution during the parsing phase  Languages that have constructs that allow the programmer to alter the behavior of the parser make syntax analysis an undecidable problem  and generally blur the distinction between parsing and execution              In contrast to Lisp s macro system and Perl s BEGIN blocks  which may contain general computations  C macros are merely string replacements and do not require code execution

The term semantics refers to the meaning of languages  as opposed to their form  syntax  

Static semantics edit 
Static semantics defines restrictions on the structure of valid texts that are hard or impossible to express in standard syntactic formalisms                 failed verification      For compiled languages  static semantics essentially include those semantic rules that can be checked at compile time  Examples include checking that every identifier is declared before it is used  in languages that require such declarations  or that the labels on the arms of a case statement are distinct              Many important restrictions of this type  like checking that identifiers are used in the appropriate context  e g  not adding an integer to a function name   or that subroutine calls have the appropriate number and type of arguments  can be enforced by defining them as rules in a logic called a type system  Other forms of static analyses like data flow analysis may also be part of static semantics  Programming languages such as Java and C  have definite assignment analysis  a form of data flow analysis  as part of their respective static semantics             

Dynamic semantics edit

Once data has been specified  the machine must be instructed to perform operations on the data  For example  the semantics may define the strategy by which expressions are evaluated to values  or the manner in which control structures conditionally execute statements  The dynamic semantics  also known as execution semantics  of a language defines how and when the various constructs of a language should produce a program behavior  There are many ways of defining execution semantics  Natural language is often used to specify the execution semantics of languages commonly used in practice  A significant amount of academic research goes into formal semantics of programming languages  which allows execution semantics to be specified in a formal manner  Results from this field of research have seen limited application to programming language design and implementation outside academia             

Type system edit 
Main articles  Data type  Type system  and Type safety
A data type is a set of allowable values and operations that can be performed on these values              Each programming language s type system defines which data types exist  the type of an expression  and how type equivalence and type compatibility function in the language             
According to type theory  a language is fully typed if the specification of every operation defines types of data to which the operation is applicable              In contrast  an untyped language  such as most assembly languages  allows any operation to be performed on any data  generally sequences of bits of various lengths              In practice  while few languages are fully typed  most offer a degree of typing              
Because different types  such as integers and floats  represent values differently  unexpected results will occur if one type is used when another is expected  Type checking will flag this error  usually at compile time  runtime type checking is more costly               With strong typing  type errors can always be detected unless variables are explicitly cast to a different type  Weak typing occurs when languages allow implicit casting for example  to enable operations between variables of different types without the programmer making an explicit type conversion  The more cases in which this type coercion is allowed  the fewer type errors can be detected               

Commonly supported types edit 
See also  Primitive data type
Early programming languages often supported only built in  numeric types such as the integer  signed and unsigned  and floating point  to support operations on real numbers that are not integers   Most programming languages support multiple sizes of floats  often called float and double  and integers depending on the size and precision required by the programmer  Storing an integer in a type that is too small to represent it leads to integer overflow  The most common way of representing negative numbers with signed types is twos complement  although ones complement is also used              Other common types include Boolean which is either true or false and character traditionally one byte  sufficient to represent all ASCII characters              
Arrays are a data type whose elements  in many languages  must consist of a single type of fixed length  Other languages define arrays as references to data stored elsewhere and support elements of varying types              Depending on the programming language  sequences of multiple characters  called strings  may be supported as arrays of characters or their own primitive type              Strings may be of fixed or variable length  which enables greater flexibility at the cost of increased storage space and more complexity              Other data types that may be supported include lists              associative  unordered  arrays accessed via keys              records in which data is mapped to names in an ordered structure              and tuples similar to records but without names for data fields              Pointers store memory addresses  typically referencing locations on the heap where other data is stored             
The simplest user defined type is an ordinal type  often called an enumeration  whose values can be mapped onto the set of positive integers              Since the mid     s  most programming languages also support abstract data types  in which the representation of the data and operations are hidden from the user  who can only access an interface              The benefits of data abstraction can include increased reliability  reduced complexity  less potential for name collision  and allowing the underlying data structure to be changed without the client needing to alter its code             

Static and dynamic typing edit 
In static typing  all expressions have their types determined before a program executes  typically at compile time              Most widely used  statically typed programming languages require the types of variables to be specified explicitly  In some languages  types are implicit  one form of this is when the compiler can infer types based on context  The downside of implicit typing is the potential for errors to go undetected              Complete type inference has traditionally been associated with functional languages such as Haskell and ML              
With dynamic typing  the type is not attached to the variable but only the value encoded in it  A single variable can be reused for a value of a different type  Although this provides more flexibility to the programmer  it is at the cost of lower reliability and less ability for the programming language to check for errors              Some languages allow variables of a union type to which any type of value can be assigned  in an exception to their usual static typing rules             

Concurrency edit 
See also  Concurrent computing
In computing  multiple instructions can be executed simultaneously  Many programming languages support instruction level and subprogram level concurrency              By the twenty first century  additional processing power on computers was increasingly coming from the use of additional processors  which requires programmers to design software that makes use of multiple processors simultaneously to achieve improved performance              Interpreted languages such as Python and Ruby do not support the concurrent use of multiple processors              Other programming languages do support managing data shared between different threads by controlling the order of execution of key instructions via the use of semaphores  controlling access to shared data via monitor  or enabling message passing between threads             

Exception handling edit 
Main article  Exception handling
Many programming languages include exception handlers  a section of code triggered by runtime errors that can deal with them in two main ways             

Termination  shutting down and handing over control to the operating system  This option is considered the simplest 
Resumption  resuming the program near where the exception occurred  This can trigger a repeat of the exception  unless the exception handler is able to modify values to prevent the exception from reoccurring 
Some programming languages support dedicating a block of code to run regardless of whether an exception occurs before the code is reached  this is called finalization             
There is a tradeoff between increased ability to handle exceptions and reduced performance              For example  even though array index errors are common             C does not check them for performance reasons              Although programmers can write code to catch user defined exceptions  this can clutter a program  Standard libraries in some languages  such as C  use their return values to indicate an exception              Some languages and their compilers have the option of turning on and off error handling capability  either temporarily or permanently             

Design and implementation edit 
Main article  Programming language design and implementation
One of the most important influences on programming language design has been computer architecture  Imperative languages  the most commonly used type  were designed to perform well on von Neumann architecture  the most common computer architecture              In von Neumann architecture  the memory stores both data and instructions  while the CPU that performs instructions on data is separate  and data must be piped back and forth to the CPU  The central elements in these languages are variables  assignment  and iteration  which is more efficient than recursion on these machines               
Many programming languages have been designed from scratch  altered to meet new needs  and combined with other languages  Many have eventually fallen into disuse      citation needed      The birth of programming languages in the     s was stimulated by the desire to make a universal programming language suitable for all machines and uses  avoiding the need to write code for different computers              By the early     s  the idea of a universal language was rejected due to the differing requirements of the variety of purposes for which code was written              

Tradeoffs edit 
Desirable qualities of programming languages include readability  writability  and reliability              These features can reduce the cost of training programmers in a language  the amount of time needed to write and maintain programs in the language  the cost of compiling the code  and increase runtime performance              

Although early programming languages often prioritized efficiency over readability  the latter has grown in importance since the     s  Having multiple operations to achieve the same result can be detrimental to readability  as is overloading operators  so that the same operator can have multiple meanings              Another feature important to readability is orthogonality  limiting the number of constructs that a programmer has to learn              A syntax structure that is easily understood and special words that are immediately obvious also supports readability             
Writability is the ease of use for writing code to solve the desired problem  Along with the same features essential for readability              abstraction interfaces that enable hiding details from the client and expressivity enabling more concise programs additionally help the programmer write code              The earliest programming languages were tied very closely to the underlying hardware of the computer  but over time support for abstraction has increased  allowing programmers express ideas that are more remote from simple translation into underlying hardware instructions  Because programmers are less tied to the complexity of the computer  their programs can do more computing with less effort from the programmer               Most programming languages come with a standard library of commonly used functions              
Reliability means that a program performs as specified in a wide range of circumstances               Type checking  exception handling  and restricted aliasing  multiple variable names accessing the same region of memory  all can improve a program s reliability              
Programming language design often involves tradeoffs               For example  features to improve reliability typically come at the cost of performance               Increased expressivity due to a large number of operators makes writing code easier but comes at the cost of readability              

Natural language programming has been proposed as a way to eliminate the need for a specialized language for programming  However  this goal remains distant and its benefits are open to debate  Edsger W  Dijkstra took the position that the use of a formal language is essential to prevent the introduction of meaningless constructs               Alan Perlis was similarly dismissive of the idea               

Specification edit 
Main article  Programming language specification
The specification of a programming language is an artifact that the language users and the implementors can use to agree upon whether a piece of source code is a valid program in that language  and if so what its behavior shall be 
A programming language specification can take several forms  including the following 

An explicit definition of the syntax  static semantics  and execution semantics of the language  While syntax is commonly specified using a formal grammar  semantic definitions may be written in natural language  e g   as in the C language   or a formal semantics  e g   as in Standard ML              and Scheme              specifications  
A description of the behavior of a translator for the language  e g   the C   and Fortran specifications   The syntax and semantics of the language have to be inferred from this description  which may be written in natural or formal language 
A reference or model implementation  sometimes written in the language being specified  e g   Prolog or ANSI REXX                The syntax and semantics of the language are explicit in the behavior of the reference implementation 
Implementation edit 
Main article  Programming language implementation
An implementation of a programming language is the conversion of a program into machine code that can be executed by the hardware  The machine code then can be executed with the help of the operating system               The most common form of interpretation in production code is by a compiler  which translates the source code via an intermediate level language into machine code  known as an executable  Once the program is compiled  it will run more quickly than with other implementation methods               Some compilers are able to provide further optimization to reduce memory or computation usage when the executable runs  but increasing compilation time              
Another implementation method is to run the program with an interpreter  which translates each line of software into machine code just before it executes  Although it can make debugging easier  the downside of interpretation is that it runs    to     times slower than a compiled executable               Hybrid interpretation methods provide some of the benefits of compilation and some of the benefits of interpretation via partial compilation  One form this takes is just in time compilation  in which the software is compiled ahead of time into an intermediate language  and then into machine code immediately before execution              

Proprietary languages edit 
Although most of the most commonly used programming languages have fully open specifications and implementations  many programming languages exist only as proprietary programming languages with the implementation available only from a single vendor  which may claim that such a proprietary language is their intellectual property  Proprietary programming languages are commonly domain specific languages or internal scripting languages for a single product  some proprietary languages are used only internally within a vendor  while others are available to external users      citation needed     
Some programming languages exist on the border between proprietary and open  for example  Oracle Corporation asserts proprietary rights to some aspects of the Java programming language               and Microsoft s C  programming language  which has open implementations of most parts of the system  also has Common Language Runtime  CLR  as a closed environment              
Many proprietary languages are widely used  in spite of their proprietary nature  examples include MATLAB  VBScript  and Wolfram Language  Some languages may make the transition from closed to open  for example  Erlang was originally Ericsson s internal programming language              
Open source programming languages are particularly helpful for open science applications  enhancing the capacity for replication and code sharing              

Use edit 
Thousands of different programming languages have been created  mainly in the computing field              
Individual software projects commonly use five programming languages or more              
Programming languages differ from most other forms of human expression in that they require a greater degree of precision and completeness  When using a natural language to communicate with other people  human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors  and still expect their intent to be understood  However  figuratively speaking  computers  do exactly what they are told to do   and cannot  understand  what code the programmer intended to write  The combination of the language definition  a program  and the program s inputs must fully specify the external behavior that occurs when the program is executed  within the domain of control of that program  On the other hand  ideas about an algorithm can be communicated to humans without the precision required for execution by using pseudocode  which interleaves natural language with code written in a programming language 
A programming language provides a structured mechanism for defining pieces of data  and the operations or transformations that may be carried out automatically on that data  A programmer uses the abstractions present in the language to represent the concepts involved in a computation  These concepts are represented as a collection of the simplest elements available  called primitives                Programming is the process by which programmers combine these primitives to compose new programs  or adapt existing ones to new uses or a changing environment 
Programs for a computer might be executed in a batch process without any human interaction  or a user might type commands in an interactive session of an interpreter  In this case the  commands  are simply programs  whose execution is chained together  When a language can run its commands through an interpreter  such as a Unix shell or other command line interface   without compiling  it is called a scripting language              

Measuring language usage edit 
Determining which is the most widely used programming language is difficult since the definition of usage varies by context  One language may occupy the greater number of programmer hours  a different one has more lines of code  and a third may consume the most CPU time  Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications  For example  COBOL is still strong in the corporate data center  often on large mainframes                            Fortran in scientific and engineering applications  Ada in aerospace  transportation  military  real time  and embedded applications  and C in embedded applications and operating systems  Other languages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applications 
Various methods of measuring language popularity  each subject to a different bias over what is measured  have been proposed 

counting the number of job advertisements that mention the language             
the number of books sold that teach or describe the language             
estimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the language                   which may underestimate languages not often found in public searches             
counts of language references  i e   to the name of the language  found using a web search engine 
Combining and averaging information from various internet sites  stackify com reported the ten most popular programming languages  in descending order by overall popularity   Java  C  C    Python  C   JavaScript  VB  NET  R  PHP  and MATLAB              
As of June       the top five programming languages as measured by TIOBE index are Python  C    C  Java and C   TIOBE provides a list of top     programming languages according to popularity and update this list every month              

Dialects  flavors and implementations edit 
A dialect of a programming language or a data exchange language is a  relatively small  variation or extension of the language that does not change its intrinsic nature  With languages such as Scheme and Forth  standards may be considered insufficient  inadequate  or illegitimate by implementors  so often they will deviate from the standard  making a new dialect  In other cases  a dialect is created for use in a domain specific language  often a subset  In the Lisp world  most languages that use basic S expression syntax and Lisp like semantics are considered Lisp dialects  although they vary wildly as do  say  Racket and Clojure  As it is common for one language to have several dialects  it can become quite difficult for an inexperienced programmer to find the right documentation  The BASIC language has many dialects 

Classifications edit 
Further information  Categorical list of programming languages
Programming languages are often placed into four main categories  imperative  functional  logic  and object oriented              

Imperative languages are designed to implement an algorithm in a specified order  they include visual programming languages such as  NET for generating graphical user interfaces  Scripting languages  which are partly or fully interpreted rather than compiled  are sometimes considered a separate category but meet the definition of imperative languages              
Functional programming languages work by successively applying functions to the given parameters  Although appreciated by many researchers for their simplicity and elegance  problems with efficiency have prevented them from being widely adopted              
Logic languages are designed so that the software  rather than the programmer  decides what order in which the instructions are executed              
Object oriented programming whose characteristic features are data abstraction  inheritance  and dynamic dispatch is supported by most popular imperative languages and some functional languages              
Although markup languages are not programming languages  some have extensions that support limited programming  Additionally  there are special purpose languages that are not easily compared to other programming languages

  Mayer  Philip  Bauer  Alexander          An empirical analysis of the utilization of multiple programming languages in open source projects   Proceedings of the   th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering  Proceedings of the   th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering   EASE      New York  NY  US  ACM  pp                 doi                          ISBN                         Results  We found  a  a mean number of   languages per project with a clearly dominant main general purpose language and   often used DSL types   b  a significant influence of the size  number of commits  and the main language on the number of languages as well as no significant influence of age and number of contributors  and  c  three language ecosystems grouped around XML  Shell Make  and HTML CSS  Conclusions  Multi language programming seems to be common in open source projects and is a factor that must be dealt with in tooling and when assessing the development and maintenance of such software systems
