Industrial artificial intelligence  or industrial AI  usually refers to the application of artificial intelligence to industry and business  Unlike general artificial intelligence which is a frontier research discipline to build computerized systems that perform tasks requiring human intelligence  industrial AI is more concerned with the application of such technologies to address industrial pain points for customer value creation  productivity improvement  cost reduction  site optimization  predictive analysis            and insight discovery            
Artificial intelligence and machine learning  have become key enablers to leverage data in production in recent years due to a number of different factors  More affordable sensors and the automated process of data acquisition  More powerful computation capability of computers to perform more complex tasks at a faster speed with lower cost  Faster connectivity infrastructure and more accessible cloud services for data management and computing power outsourcing            


Categories edit 
Possible applications of industrial AI and machine learning in the production domain can be divided into seven application areas            

Market and trend analysis
Machinery and equipment
Intralogistics
Production process
Supply chain
Building
Product
Taxonomy of application areas and application scenarios for machine learning and artificial intelligence in production
Each application area can be further divided into specific application scenarios that describe concrete AI ML scenarios in production  While some application areas have a direct connection to production processes  others cover production adjacent fields like logistics or the factory building            
An example from the application scenario Process Design  amp  Innovation are collaborative robots  Collaborative robotic arms are able to learn the motion and path demonstrated by human operators and perform the same task              Predictive and preventive maintenance through data driven machine learning are exemplary application scenarios from the Machinery  amp  Equipment application area            

Challenges edit 
In contrast to entirely virtual systems  in which ML applications are already widespread today  real world production processes are characterized by the interaction between the virtual and the physical world  Data is recorded using sensors and processed on computational entities and  if desired  actions and decisions are translated back into the physical world via actuators or by human operators             This poses major challenges for the application of ML in production engineering systems  These challenges are attributable to the encounter of process  data and model characteristics  The production domain s high reliability requirements  high risk and loss potential  the multitude of heterogeneous data sources and the non transparency of ML model functionality impede a faster adoption of ML in real world production processes 

The challenges for ML applications in production engineering result from the encounter of process  data and ML model characteristics 
In particular  production data comprises a variety of different modalities  semantics and quality             Furthermore  production systems are dynamic  uncertain and complex             and engineering and manufacturing problems are data rich but information sparse             Besides that  due the variety of use cases and data characteristics  problem specific data sets are required  which are difficult to acquire  hindering both practitioners and academic researchers in this domain            

Process and industry characteristics edit 
The domain of production engineering can be considered as a rather conservative industry when it comes to the adoption of advanced technology and their integration into existing processes  This is due to high demands on reliability of the production systems resulting from the potentially high economic harm of reduced process effectiveness due to e g   additional unplanned downtime or insufficient product qualities  In addition  the specifics of machining equipment and products prevent area wide adoptions across a variety of processes  Besides the technical reasons  the reluctant adoption of ML is fueled by a lack of IT and data science expertise across the domain            

Data characteristics edit 
The data collected in production processes mainly stem from frequently sampling sensors to estimate the state of a product  a process  or the environment in the real world  Sensor readings are susceptible to noise and represent only an estimate of the reality under uncertainty  Production data typically comprises multiple distributed data sources resulting in various data modalities  e g   images from visual quality control systems  time series sensor readings  or cross sectional job and product information   The inconsistencies in data acquisition lead to low signal to noise ratios  low data quality and great effort in data integration  cleaning and management  In addition  as a result from mechanical and chemical wear of production equipment  process data is subject to various forms of data drifts 

Machine learning model characteristics edit 
ML models are considered as black box systems      given their complexity and intransparency of input output relation  This reduces the comprehensibility of the system behavior and thus also the acceptance by plant operators  Due to the lack of transparency and the stochasticity of these models  no deterministic proof of functional correctness can be achieved complicating the certification of production equipment  Given their inherent unrestricted prediction behavior  ML models are vulnerable against erroneous or manipulated data further risking the reliability of the production system because of lacking robustness and safety  In addition to high development and deployment costs  the data drifts cause high maintenance costs  which is disadvantageous compared to purely deterministic programs 

Standard processes for data science in production edit 
The development of ML applications   starting with the identification and selection of the use case and ending with the deployment and maintenance of the application   follows dedicated phases that can be organized in standard process models  The process models assist in structuring the development process and defining requirements that must be met in each phase to enter the next phase  The standard processes can be classified into generic and domain specific ones  Generic standard processes  e g   CRISP DM  ASUM DM  KDD  SEMMA  or Team Data Science Process  describe a generally valid methodology and are thus independent of individual domains              Domain specific processes on the other hand consider specific peculiarities and challenges of special application areas 
The Machine Learning Pipeline in Production is a domain specific data science methodology that is inspired by the CRISP DM model and was specifically designed to be applied in fields of engineering and production technology              To address the core challenges of ML in engineering   process  data  and model characteristics   the methodology especially focuses on use case assessment  achieving a common data and process understanding data integration  data preprocessing of real world production data and the deployment and certification of real world ML applications

Industrial data sources edit 
The foundation of most artificial intelligence and machine learning applications in industrial settings are comprehensive datasets from the respective fields  Those datasets act as the basis for training the employed models             In other domains  like computer vision  speech recognition or language models  extensive reference datasets  e g  ImageNet  Librispeech              The People s Speech  and data scraped from the open internet             are frequently used for this purpose  Such datasets rarely exist in the industrial context because of high confidentiality requirements             and high specificity of the data  Industrial applications of artificial intelligence are therefore often faced with the problem of data availability            
For these reasons  existing open datasets applicable to industrial applications  often originate from public institutions like governmental agencies or universities  and data analysis competitions hosted by companies  In addition to this  data sharing platforms exist  However  most of these platforms have no industrial focus and offer limited filtering abilities regarding industrial data sources 

Artificial intelligence for business education edit
