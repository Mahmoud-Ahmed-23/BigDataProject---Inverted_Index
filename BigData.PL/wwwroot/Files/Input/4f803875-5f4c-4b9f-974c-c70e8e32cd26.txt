Recognition of a speaker from their voice

Speaker recognition is the identification of a person from characteristics of voices             It is used to answer the question  Who is speaking   The term voice recognition                                                        can refer to speaker recognition or speech recognition  Speaker verification  also called speaker authentication  contrasts with identification  and speaker recognition differs from speaker diarisation  recognizing when the same speaker is speaking  
Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on specific voices or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process  Speaker recognition has a history dating back some four decades as of      and uses the acoustic features of speech that have been found to differ between individuals  These acoustic patterns reflect both anatomy and learned behavioral patterns 


Verification versus identification edit 
There are two major applications of speaker recognition technologies and methodologies  If the speaker claims to be of a certain identity and the voice is used to verify this claim  this is called verification or authentication  On the other hand  identification is the task of determining an unknown speaker s identity  In a sense  speaker verification is a     match where one speaker s voice is matched to a particular template whereas speaker identification is a   N match where the voice is compared against multiple templates 
From a security perspective  identification is different from verification  Speaker verification is usually employed as a  gatekeeper  in order to provide access to a secure system  These systems operate with the users  knowledge and typically require their cooperation  Speaker identification systems can also be implemented covertly without the user s knowledge to identify talkers in a discussion  alert automated systems of speaker changes  check if a user is already enrolled in a system  etc 
In forensic applications  it is common to first perform a speaker identification process to create a list of  best matches  and then perform a series of verification processes to determine a conclusive match  Working to match the samples from the speaker to the list of best matches helps figure out if they are the same person based on the amount of similarities or differences  The prosecution and defense use this as evidence to determine if the suspect is actually the offender            

Training edit 
One of the earliest training technologies to commercialize was implemented in Worlds of Wonder s      Julie doll  At that point  speaker independence was an intended breakthrough  and systems required a training period   A      ad for the doll carried the tagline  Finally  the doll that understands you     despite the fact that it was described as a product  which children could train to respond to their voice              The term voice recognition  even a decade later  referred to speaker independence                 clarification needed     

Variants of speaker recognition edit 
Each speaker recognition system has two phases  enrollment and verification  During enrollment  the speaker s voice is recorded and typically a number of features are extracted to form a voice print  template  or model  In the verification phase  a speech sample or  utterance  is compared against a previously created voice print  For identification systems  the utterance is compared against multiple voice prints in order to determine the best match es  while verification systems compare an utterance against a single voice print  Because of the process involved  verification is faster than identification 
Speaker recognition systems fall into two categories  text dependent and text independent               Text dependent recognition requires the text to be the same for both enrollment and verification              In a text dependent system  prompts can either be common across all speakers  e g  a common pass phrase  or unique  In addition  the use of shared secrets  e g   passwords and PINs  or knowledge based information can be employed in order to create a multi factor authentication scenario   Conversely  text independent systems do not require the use of a specific text   They are most often used for speaker identification as they require very little if any cooperation by the speaker  In this case the text during enrollment and test is different  In fact  the enrollment may happen without the user s knowledge  as in the case for many forensic applications  As text independent technologies do not compare what was said at enrollment and verification  verification applications tend to also employ speech recognition to determine what the user is saying at the point of authentication      citation needed      In text independent systems both acoustics and speech analysis techniques are used             

Technology edit 
Speaker recognition is a pattern recognition problem  The various technologies used to process and store voice prints include frequency estimation  hidden Markov models  Gaussian mixture models  pattern matching algorithms  neural networks  matrix representation  vector quantization and decision trees  For comparing utterances against voice prints  more basic methods like cosine similarity are traditionally used for their simplicity and performance  Some systems also use  anti speaker  techniques such as cohort models and world models  Spectral features are predominantly used in representing speaker characteristics              Linear predictive coding  LPC  is a speech coding method used in speaker recognition and speech verification      citation needed     
Ambient noise levels can impede both collections of the initial and subsequent voice samples  Noise reduction algorithms can be employed to improve accuracy  but incorrect application can have the opposite effect  Performance degradation can result from changes in behavioural attributes of the voice and from enrollment using one telephone and verification on another telephone  Integration with two factor authentication products is expected to increase  Voice changes due to ageing may impact system performance over time  Some systems adapt the speaker models after each successful verification to capture such long term changes in the voice  though there is debate regarding the overall security impact imposed by automated adaptation     citation needed     

Legal implications edit 
Due to the introduction of legislation like the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act in the United States  there has been much discussion about the use of speaker recognition in the work place  In September      Irish speech recognition developer Soapbox Labs warned about the legal implications that may be involved             

Applications edit 
The first international patent was filed in       coming from the telecommunication research in CSELT              Italy  by Michele Cavazza and Alberto Ciaramella as a basis for both future telco services to final customers and to improve the noise reduction techniques across the network 
Between      and       speaker recognition technology was used at the Scobey Coronach Border Crossing to enable enrolled local residents with nothing to declare to cross the Canada United States border when the inspection stations were closed for the night               The system was developed for the U S  Immigration and Naturalization Service by Voice Strategies of Warren  Michigan      citation needed     
In      Barclays Wealth  the private banking division of Barclays  became the first financial services firm to deploy voice biometrics as the primary means of identifying customers to their call centers  The system used passive speaker recognition to verify the identity of telephone customers within    seconds of normal conversation              It was developed by voice recognition company Nuance  that in      acquired the company Loquendo  the spin off from CSELT itself for speech technology   the company behind Apple s Siri technology      of customers gave the system at    out of     for speed  ease of use and security             
Speaker recognition may also be used in criminal investigations  such as those of the      executions of  amongst others  James Foley and Steven Sotloff             
In February      UK high street bank HSBC and its internet based retail bank First Direct announced that it would offer    million customers its biometric banking software to access online and phone accounts using their fingerprint or voice             
In      Vice News and The Guardian separately demonstrated they could defeat standard financial speaker authentication systems using AI generated voices generated from about five minutes of the target s voice samples
