In       Mansfield met Maureen Hayes  a local schoolteacher who would become his wife  She encouraged him to pursue further education              In December       Mansfield began his studies at the University of Montana  UM  in Missoula             where he took both high school and college courses               Maureen moved to Missoula  and they married on September           She worked as a social worker  to help support Mansfield through his studies

A new comer to the House  who is reportedly internationalist minded  having been professor of history and political science at Montana State University             for ten years  Though a supporter of the Administration s foreign policy  he is likely to be strongly critical of the smallness of China s share of Lend Lease  and of what he fears is the Administration s tendency to regard the Atlantic as more important than the Pacific  and of its apparent reluctance to regard the Chinese as an ally on equal footing  His strongly pro Chinese sentiments may tend to make him somewhat anti British on this score 
Mansfield served five terms in the House  being re elected in                   and       His military service and academic experience landed him a seat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee             He went to China on a special mission for US President Franklin D  Roosevelt in      and served as a delegate to the ninth Inter American Conference in Colombia in                   In       he was appointed by President Harry S  Truman as a delegate to the United Nations  sixth session in Paris  During his House tenure  he also expressed his support for price controls  a higher minimum wage  the Marshall Plan  and aid to Turkey and Greece  He opposed the House Un American Activities Committee  the Taft Hartley Act  and the Twenty second Amendment

Mansfield was critical of US involvement in Laos  On December           he opined that US aid to Laos had produced nothing but  chaos  discontent  armies on the loose  and a large mission of hundreds of officials in Vientiane              
An early supporter of Ngo Dinh Diem  Mansfield altered his opinion on the Vietnam War after a visit to Vietnam in       He reported to John F  Kennedy on December          that US money given to Diem s government was being squandered and that the US should avoid further involvement in Vietnam  He was thus the first American official to comment even mildly negatively on the war s condition             
On September           Mansfield introduced Kennedy during a joint appearance with him at the Yellowstone County Fairgrounds  Kennedy expressing his appreciation afterward and adding   I know that those of you who live in Montana know something of his character and his high standard of public service  but I am not sure that you are completely aware of what a significant role he has played in the last   years in passing through the United States Senate measure after measure which strengthens this country at home and abroad              
Mansfield delivered a eulogy on November           as President Kennedy s casket lay in state in the Capitol rotunda  saying   He gave that we might give of ourselves  that we might give to one another until there would be no room  no room at all  for the bigotry  the hatred  prejudice  and the arrogance which converged in that moment of horror to strike him down              
During the Johnson administration  Mansfield  convinced that it was a blunder based on just aims  became a skeptic of US involvement in the Vietnam War  In February       he lobbied against escalating aerial bombardment of North Vietnam in the aftermath of Pleiku  arguing in a letter to the president that Operation Rolling Thunder would lead to a need for  vastly strengthened    American forces              
In       Mansfield  as Senate Majority Leader  filed a procedural motion to have the Civil Rights Act of      discussed by the whole Senate rather than by the Judiciary Committee  which had killed similar legislation seven years earlier              Mansfield voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of      and                               as well as the   th Amendment to the U S  Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of                                           Mansfield voted in favor of the initial Senate amendment to the Civil Rights Act of      on August                      but did not vote on the House amendment to the bill on August                       Mansfield did not vote on the Civil Rights Act of      or the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U S  Supreme Court                         
He hailed the new Richard Nixon administration  especially the  Nixon Doctrine  announced at Guam in      that the US would honor all treaty commitments  provide a nuclear umbrella for its allies  and supply weapons and technical assistance to countries where warranted without committing American forces to local conflicts 
In turn  Nixon turned to Mansfield for advice and as his liaison with the Senate on Vietnam  Nixon began a steady withdrawal and replacement of US troops shortly after he took office in January       a policy supported by Mansfield  During his first term  Nixon reduced American forces by      leaving only        in late       the last ones left in March      
During the economic crisis of       Mansfield was not afraid to reach across the aisle to help the economy 

What we re in is not a Republican recession or a Democratic recession  both parties had much to do with bringing us where we are today  But we re facing a national situation which calls for the best which all of us can produce  because we know the results will be something which we will regret             
Mansfield attended the November           meeting between President elect Jimmy Carter and Democratic congressional leaders in which Carter sought out support for a proposal to have the president s power to reorganize the government reinstated with potential to be vetoed by Congress             

Mansfield Amendments edit 
Two controversial amendments by Mansfield limiting military funding of research were passed by Congress 

The Mansfield Amendment of       passed as part of the fiscal year      Military Authorization Act  Public Law          prohibited military funding of research that lacked a direct or apparent relationship to specific military function  Through subsequent modification the Mansfield amendment moved the Department of Defense toward the support of more short term applied research in universities              The amendment affected the military  such as research funding by the Office of Naval Research  ONR              
The Mansfield Amendment of      expressly limited appropriations for defense research through the Advanced Research Projects Agency  which is largely independent of the military  to projects with direct military application               This controversial amendment greatly reduced ARPA funding for many university based computer projects  thereby forcing many American computer science experts to move to private sector research facilities such as Xerox PARC   However  for that very reason  the amendment is also credited with giving birth to the contemporary computer technology industry             
An earlier Mansfield Amendment  offered in       called for the number of US troops stationed in Europe to be halved  On May           however  the Senate defeated the resolution
