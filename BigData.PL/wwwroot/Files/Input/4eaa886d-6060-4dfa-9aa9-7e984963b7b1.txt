The trailer sold a sci fi type horror flick with cheap thrills and a snowy destitute landscape  The subject of its advertisement seemed to fall into that category of films listed in eponymous actor Liam Neeson s overflowing portfolio of projects in which he graces us with his presence for fun rather than for any intrinsic artistic value 
Defying all expectations   The Grey         has held its ground in the box office rankings  debuting at number one and remaining in the top five at time of press 
As it turns out  the movie is far less a horror film than it is an existential drama and there is not a shred of science fiction involved but rather as primal a battle as they come 
If  The Grey s  thrills can be called cheap  it is only in as much as it contains poorly constructed computer generated imagery of somewhat larger than life wolves that in itself takes away from the otherwise raw and realistic quality of the remainder of the story and forces to one s recollection a most unfortunate and off putting ongoing saga in cinematic history parading itself under the title of a solar phenomenon 
 The Grey  tells the story of a team of workers for an oil rigging company stationed in Alaska who become stranded in the vast unforgiving expanse of this northernmost state after their plane crashes amidst a snow storm on its way to Anchorage  The survivors must contend with their limited food supplies  their prolonged exposure to forbiddingly cold weather and  last but not least  their trespassing on a different turf  namely that of the wolves whose natural habitat is where the plane crashes 
The men will soon learn that  taken out of their comfort zone and deprived of the reliable use of their superior  toys   their every mistake  their arguments and tensions can and will result in an increasingly critical thinning of their numbers  This is essentially the story of a humbling episode from the everlasting conflict ridden relationship between humankind and the animal kingdom  one in which the scales may for once in a blue moon get tipped over 
It is also the story of men who have sought to run away from their lives and their past mistakes only to find themselves forced to reflect upon and face them   The Grey  offers a metaphysical exploration of life  death  fear  isolation  intimidation  power struggles  courage  love and loss 
Director Joe Carnahan  best known for his work on  Smokin  Aces         and  The A Team          co wrote the script with author Ian Mackenzie Jeffers  who penned the short story  Ghost Walker  that  The Grey  is based on 
Neeson plays Ottway  the leader of the pack  a role that was originally destined for another one of his A Team co stars  Bradley Cooper  This alteration in the casting of the main character works quite well in favor of the narrative as Neeson endows his Alfa male character with the qualities of a weathered experienced hunter in combination with a sensible vulnerability and mellowness that enrich his authoritative and assertive efforts to unite the men while attempting to guide them to safety 
Carnahan s film showcases its strongest attribute in the filmmaker s ability to allow the men s sense of endangerment  their doubts and their struggle  as they take every dreadful step forward on shaky grounds  to guide the pace of the narrative  The longer the men survive in this wilderness  the more societal veils they remove from their consciousness 
They eventually come to realizations about who they are as individuals  what their contributions to society   or lack thereof   have amounted to and ultimately what  if any  would be the value of their reintegration within society  Carnahan s insightful exploration of these men s physical and spiritual journeys is one that is most moving and most difficult to watch 
While  The Grey  exhibits a highly commendable mastery of storytelling and an innate balance of suspense and introspective reflection  the film has failings that can be hard to overlook 
Carnahan resorts to disruptive flashbacks  robbing the unfolding events of their immediacy  The backgrounds of the men illustrated in these flashbacks are underdeveloped  melodramatic and stereotypical  The women from their past lives are portrayed as mere indefinite shadows that they remember and yearn for as they hover over the critical divide between life and death 
The ending  though clearly striving to set itself apart from the usual Hollywoodish farfetched conclusions  is hardly earned and impossible to take seriously  It recalls almost exactly the ending of another film  Edward Zwick s  Legends of the Fall         except that the relationship between man and animal was significantly developed over the course of Zwick s film while in  The Grey   that connection is merely circumstantial 
The unwavering honest depiction of Ottway and his team members  external and internal struggles in  The Grey  allows the film s pitfalls to be dismissed as inconsequential choices in the big picture  Carnahan produces a remarkable feat of storytelling with his film  one that may well inspire his audience to take a hard look at their own lives and perhaps make certain choices differently
