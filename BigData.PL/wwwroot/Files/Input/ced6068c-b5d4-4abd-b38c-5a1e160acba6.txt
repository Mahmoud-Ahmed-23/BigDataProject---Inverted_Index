Joel Feinberg gives an account of harm as setbacks to interests              He distinguishes welfare interests from ulterior interests   Hence on his view there are two kinds of harm 
Welfare interests are 

interests in the continuance for a foreseeable interval of one s life  and the interests in one s own physical health and vigor  the integrity and normal functioning of one s body  the absence of absorbing pain and suffering or grotesque disfigurement  minimal intellectual acuity  emotional stability  the absence of groundless anxieties and resentments  the capacity to engage normally in social intercourse and to enjoy and maintain friendships  at least minimal income and financial security  a tolerable social and physical environment  and a certain amount of freedom from interference and coercion            
Ulterior interests are  a person s more ultimate goals and aspirations   such as  producing good novels or works of art  solving a crucial scientific problem  achieving high political office  successfully raising a family  
Many philosophers have proposed variations of moral obligations to avoid causing harm  or have promoted harmlessness as a virtue  and ethical frameworks have been developed considering harmlessness as a principle in decision making and social interactions  The phrase   do no harm   in Latin  Primum non nocere    is a popular medical ethic  According to Gonzalo Herranz  Professor of Medical Ethics at the University of Navarre  Primum non nocere was introduced into American and British medical culture by Worthington Hooker in his      book Physician and Patient  Hooker attributed it to the Parisian pathologist and clinician Auguste Fran ois Chomel              the successor of Laennec in the chair of medical pathology  and the preceptor of Pierre Louis  Apparently  the axiom was part of Chomel s oral teaching             Hooker  however  was quoting an earlier work by Elisha Bartlett            who  on pages          says  The golden axiom of Chomel  that it is only the second law of therapeutics to do good  its first law being this   not to do harm   is gradually finding its way into the medical mind  preventing an incalculable amount of positive ill   A detailed investigation of the origins of the aphorism was reported by the clinical pharmacologist Cedric M  Smith in the April      issue of The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology             It addresses the questions of the origin and chronology of appearance of the maxim  Rather than being of ancient origin as usually assumed  the specific expression  and its even more distinctive associated Latin phrase  has been traced back to an attribution to Thomas Sydenham             in a book by Thomas Inman         Foundation for a New Theory and Practice of Medicine  Inman s book and his attribution were reviewed by an author who signed simply as  H  H   in The American Journal of the Medical Sciences  also in                 

Medical classifications edit 
In the UK  harm is classified in a medical context as  severe    moderate  or  mild   Severe harm is associated with resulting permanent disability  whereas mild and moderate harm can be resolved over a period of time             Medical reporting duties and the statutory duty of candour are associated with moderate and severe harm and also with  prolonged psychological harm
