In computer science  computational intelligence  CI  refers to concepts  paradigms  algorithms and implementations of systems that are designed to show  intelligent  behavior in complex and changing environments             These systems are aimed at mastering complex tasks in a wide variety of technical or commercial areas and offer solutions that recognize and interpret patterns  control processes  support decision making or autonomously manoeuvre vehicles or robots in unknown environments  among other things             These concepts and paradigms are characterized by the ability to learn or adapt to new situations  to generalize  to abstract  to discover and associate             Nature analog or nature inspired methods play a key role  such as in neuroevolution for Computational Intelligence            
CI approaches primarily address those complex real world problems for which mathematical or traditional modeling is not appropriate for various reasons  the processes cannot be described exactly with complete knowledge  the processes are too complex for mathematical reasoning  they contain some uncertainties during the process  such as unforeseen changes in the environment or in the process itself  or the processes are simply stochastic in nature  Thus  CI techniques are properly aimed at processes that are ill defined  complex  nonlinear  time varying and or stochastic            
A recent definition of the IEEE Computational Intelligence Societey describes CI as the theory  design  application and development of biologically and linguistically motivated computational paradigms  Traditionally the three main pillars of CI have been Neural Networks  Fuzzy Systems and Evolutionary Computation      CI is an evolving field and at present in addition to the three main constituents  it encompasses computing paradigms like ambient intelligence  artificial life  cultural learning  artificial endocrine networks  social reasoning  and artificial hormone networks      Over the last few years there has been an explosion of research on Deep Learning  in particular deep convolutional neural networks  Nowadays  deep learning has become the core method for artificial intelligence  In fact  some of the most successful AI systems are based on CI             However  as CI is an emerging and developing field there is no final definition of CI                                   especially in terms of the list of concepts and paradigms that belong to it                                   
The general requirements for the development of an  intelligent system  are ultimately always the same  namely the simulation of intelligent thinking and action in a specific area of application  To do this  the knowledge about this area must be represented in a model so that it can be processed  The quality of the resulting system depends largely on how well the model was chosen in the development process  Sometimes data driven methods are suitable for finding a good model and sometimes logic based knowledge representations deliver better results  Hybrid models are usually used in real applications            
According to actual textbooks  the following methods and paradigms  which largely complement each other  can be regarded as parts of CI

Relationship between hard and soft computing and artificial and computational intelligence edit 
Artificial intelligence  AI  is used in the media  but also by some of the scientists involved  as a kind of umbrella term for the various techniques associated with it or with CI                         Craenen and Eiben state that attempts to define or at least describe CI can usually be assigned to one or more of the following groups

Relationship between hard computing and artificial intelligence on the one hand and soft computing and computational intelligence on the other            The relationship between CI and AI has been a frequently discussed topic during the development of CI  While the above list implies that they are synonyms  the vast majority of AI CI researchers working on the subject consider them to be distinct fields  where either                       
CI is an alternative to AI
AI includes CI
CI includes AI
The view of the first of the above three points goes back to Zadeh  the founder of the fuzzy set theory  who differentiated machine intelligence into hard and soft computing techniques  which are used in artificial intelligence on the one hand and computational intelligence on the other                          In hard computing  HC  and AI  inaccuracy and uncertainty are undesirable characteristics of a system  while soft computing  SC  and thus CI focus on dealing with these characteristics              The adjacent figure illustrates these relationships and lists the most important CI techniques             Another frequently mentioned distinguishing feature is the representation of information in symbolic form in AI and in sub symbolic form in CI techniques                         
Hard computing is a conventional computing method based on the principles of certainty and accuracy and it is deterministic  It requires a precisely stated analytical model of the task to be processed and a prewritten program  i e  a fixed set of instructions  The models used are based on Boolean logic  also called crisp logic               where e g  an element can be either a member of a set or not and there is nothing in between  When applied to real world tasks  systems based on HC result in specific control actions defined by a mathematical model or algorithm  If an unforeseen situation occurs that is not included in the model or algorithm used  the action will most likely fail                                                 
Soft computing  on the other hand  is based on the fact that the human mind is capable of storing information and processing it in a goal oriented way  even if it is imprecise and lacks certainty              SC is based on the model of the human brain with probabilistic thinking  fuzzy logic and multi valued logic  Soft computing can process a wealth of data and perform a large number of computations  which may not be exact  in parallel  For hard problems for which no satisfying exact solutions based on HC are available  SC methods can be applied successfully  SC methods are usually stochastic in nature i e   they are a randomly defined processes that can be analyzed statistically but not with precision  Up to now  the results of some CI methods  such as deep learning  cannot be verified and it is also not clear what they are based on  This problem represents an important scientific issue for the future                                                 
AI and CI are catchy terms              but they are also so similar that they can be confused  The meaning of both terms has developed and changed over a long period of time                          with AI being used first                        Bezdek describes this impressively and concludes that such buzzwords are frequently used and hyped by the scientific community  science management and  science  journalism              Not least because AI and biological intelligence are emotionally charged terms                        and it is still difficult to find a generally accepted definition for the basic term intelligence                        

History edit 
In       Alan Turing  one of the founding fathers of computer science  developed a test for computer intelligence known as the Turing test              In this test  a person can ask questions via a keyboard and a monitor without knowing whether his counterpart is a human or a computer  A computer is considered intelligent if the interrogator cannot distinguish the computer from a human  This illustrates the discussion about intelligent computers at the beginning of the computer age 
The term Computational Intelligence was first used as the title of the journal of the same name in                              and later by the IEEE Neural Networks Council  NNC   which was founded      by a group of researchers interested in the development of biological and artificial neural networks              On November           the NNC  became the IEEE Neural Networks Society  to become the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society two years later by including new areas of interest such as fuzzy systems and evolutionary computation  
The NNC helped organize the first IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence in Orlando  Florida in                   On this conference the first clear definition of Computational Intelligence was introduced by Bezdek  A system is computationally intelligent when it  deals with only numerical  low level  data  has pattern recognition components  does not use knowledge in the AI sense  and additionally when it  begins to  exhibit     computational adaptivity      computational fault tolerance      speed approaching human like turnaround and     error rates that approximate human performance             
Today  with machine learning and deep learning in particular utilizing a breadth of supervised  unsupervised  and reinforcement learning approaches  the CI landscape has been greatly enhanced  with novell intelligent approaches 

The main algorithmic approaches of CI and their applications edit 
The main applications of Computational Intelligence include computer science  engineering  data analysis and bio medicine 

Fuzzy logic edit 
Unlike conventional Boolean logic  fuzzy logic is based on fuzzy sets  In both models  a property of an object is defined as belonging to a set  in fuzzy logic  however  the membership is not sharply defined by a yes no distinction  but is graded gradually  This is done using membership functions that assign a real number between   and   to each element as the degree of membership  The new set operations introduced in this way define the operations of an associated logic calculus that allows the modeling of inference processes  i e  logical reasoning              Therefore  fuzzy logic is well suited for engineering decisions without clear certainties and uncertainties or with imprecise data   as with natural language processing technologies             but it doesn t have learning abilities             
This technique tends to apply to a wide range of domains such as control engineering              image processing              fuzzy data clustering                         and decision making              Fuzzy logic based control systems can be found  for example  in the field of household appliances in washing machines  dish washers  microwave ovens  etc  or in the area of motor vehicles in gear transmission and braking systems  This principle can also be encountered when using a video camera  as it helps to stabilize the image when the camera is held unsteadily  Other areas such as medical diagnostics  satellite controllers and business strategy selection are just a few more examples of today s application of fuzzy logic                         

Neural networks edit 
An important field of CI is the development of artificial neural networks  ANN  based on the biological ones  which can be defined by three main components  the cell body which processes the information  the axon  which is a device enabling the signal conducting  and the synapse  which controls signals                          Therefore  ANNs are very well suited for distributed information processing systems  enabling the process and the learning from experiential data                          ANNs aim to mimic cognitive processes of the human brain  The main advantages of this technology therefore include fault tolerance  pattern recognition even with noisy images and the ability to learn                         
Concerning its applications  neural networks can be classified into five groups  data analysis and classification  associative memory  data clustering or compression  generation of patterns  and control systems                                      The numerous applications include  for example  the analysis and classification of medical data  including the creation of diagnoses  speech recognition  data mining  image processing  forecasting  robot control  credit approval  pattern recognition  face and fraud detection and dealing with nonlinearities of a system in order to control it                                      ANNs have the latter area of application and data clustering in common with fuzzy logic  Generative systems based on deep learning and convolutional neural networks  such as chatGPT or DeepL  are a relatively new field of application 

Evolutionary computation edit 
Evolutionary computation can be seen as a family of methods and algorithms for global optimization  which are usually based on a population of candidate solutions  They are inspired by biological evolution and are often summarized as evolutionary algorithms              These include the genetic algorithms  evolution strategy  genetic programming and many others              They are considered as problem solvers for tasks not solvable by traditional mathematical methods             and are frequently used for optimization including multi objective optimization              Since they work with a population of candidate solutions that are processed in parallel during an iteration  they can easily be distributed to different computer nodes of a cluster              As often more than one offspring is generated per pairing  the evaluations of these offspring  which are usually the most time consuming part of the optimization process  can also be performed in parallel             
In the course of optimization  the population learns about the structure of the search space and stores this information in the chromosomes of the solution candidates  After a run  this knowledge can be reused for similar tasks by adapting some of the  old  chromosomes and using them to seed a new population                         

Swarm intelligence edit 
Swarm intelligence is based on the collective behavior of decentralized  self organizing systems  typically consisting of a population of simple agents that interact locally with each other and with their environment  Despite the absence of a centralized control structure that dictates how the individual agents should behave  local interactions between such agents often lead to the emergence of global behavior                                      Among the recognized representatives of algorithms based on swarm intelligence are particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization              Both are metaheuristic optimization algorithms that can be used to  approximately  solve difficult numerical or complex combinatorial optimization tasks                                      Since both methods  like the evolutionary algorithms  are based on a population and also on local interaction  they can be easily parallelized                         and show comparable learning properties                         

Bayesian networks edit 
In complex application domains  Bayesian networks provide a means to efficiently store and evaluate uncertain knowledge  A Bayesian network is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies by a directed acyclic graph  The probabilistic representation makes it easy to draw conclusions based on new information  In addition  Bayesian networks are well suited for learning from data              Their wide range of applications includes medical diagnostics  risk management  information retrieval  and text analysis  e g  for spam filters  Their wide range of applications includes medical diagnostics  risk management  information retrieval  text analysis  e g  for spam filters  credit rating of companies  and the operation of complex industrial processes             

Artificial immune systems edit 
Artificial immune systems are another group of population based metaheuristic learning algorithms designed to solve clustering and optimization problems  These algorithms are inspired by the principles of theoretical immunology and the processes of the vertebrate immune system  and use the learning and memory properties of the immune system to solve a problem  Operators similar to those known from evolutionary algorithms are used to clone and mutate artificial lymphocytes                          Artificial immune systems offer interesting capabilities such as adaptability  self learning  and robustness that can be used for various tasks in data processing              manufacturing systems              system modeling and control  fault detection  or cybersecurity             

Learning theory edit 
Still looking for a way of  reasoning  close to the humans  one  learning theory is one of the main approaches of CI  In psychology  learning is the process of bringing together cognitive  emotional and environmental effects and experiences to acquire  enhance or change knowledge  skills  values and world views                                      Learning theories then helps understanding how these effects and experiences are processed  and then helps making predictions based on previous experience             

Probabilistic methods edit 
Being one of the main elements of fuzzy logic  probabilistic methods firstly introduced by Paul Erdos and Joel Spencer in                               aim to evaluate the outcomes of a Computation Intelligent system  mostly defined by randomness              Therefore  probabilistic methods bring out the possible solutions to a problem  based on prior knowledge 

Impact on university education edit 
According to bibliometrics studies  computational intelligence plays a key role in research              All the major academic publishers are accepting manuscripts in which a combination of Fuzzy logic  neural networks and evolutionary computation is discussed  On the other hand  Computational intelligence isn t available in the university curriculum              The amount of technical universities in which students can attend a course is limited  Only British Columbia  Technical University of Dortmund  involved in the European fuzzy boom  and Georgia Southern University are offering courses from this domain 
The reason why major university are ignoring the topic is because they don t have the resources  The existing computer science courses are so complex  that at the end of the semester there is no room for fuzzy logic              Sometimes it is taught as a subproject in existing introduction courses  but in most cases the universities are preferring courses about classical AI concepts based on Boolean logic  turing machines and toy problems like blocks world 
Since a while with the upraising of STEM education  the situation has changed a bit              There are some efforts available in which multidisciplinary approaches are preferred which allows the student to understand complex adaptive systems              These objectives are discussed only on a theoretical basis  The curriculum of real universities wasn t adapted yet
