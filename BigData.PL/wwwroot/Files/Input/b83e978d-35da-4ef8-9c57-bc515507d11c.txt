Statement supporting an argument
This article is about the usage of premise in discourse and logic  For other uses  see Premise  disambiguation  
A premise or premiss     a      is a proposition a true or false declarative statement used in an argument to prove the truth of another proposition called the conclusion             Arguments consist of a set of premises and a conclusion 
An argument is meaningful for its conclusion only when all of its premises are true  If one or more premises are false  the argument says nothing about whether the conclusion is true or false  For instance  a false premise on its own does not justify rejecting an argument s conclusion  to assume otherwise is a logical fallacy called denying the antecedent  One way to prove that a proposition is false is to formulate a sound argument with a conclusion that negates that proposition 
An argument is sound and its conclusion logically follows  it is true  if and only if the argument is valid and its premises are true 
An argument is valid if and only if it is the case that whenever the premises are all true  the conclusion must also be true  If there exists a logical interpretation where the premises are all true but the conclusion is false  the argument is invalid 
Key to evaluating the quality of an argument is determining if it is valid and sound  That is  whether its premises are true and whether their truth necessarily results in a true conclusion 


Explanation edit 
In logic  an argument requires a set of declarative sentences  or  propositions   known as the  premises   or  premisses    along with another declarative sentence  or  proposition    known as the conclusion  Complex arguments can use a sequence of rules to connect several premises to one conclusion  or to derive a number of conclusions from the original premises which then act as premises for additional conclusions  An example of this is the use of the rules of inference found within symbolic logic 

Aristotle held that any logical argument could be reduced to two premises and a conclusion             Premises are sometimes left unstated  in which case  they are called missing premises  for example Socrates is mortal because all men are mortal It is evident that a tacitly understood claim is that Socrates is a man   The fully expressed reasoning is thus Because all men are mortal and Socrates is a man  Socrates is mortal In this example  the dependent clauses preceding the comma  namely   all men are mortal  and  Socrates is a man   are the premises  while  Socrates is mortal  is the conclusion 
The proof of a conclusion depends on both the truth of the premises and the validity of the argument  Also  additional information is required over and above the meaning of the premise to determine if the full meaning of the conclusion coincides with what is            
For Euclid  premises constitute two of the three propositions in a syllogism  with the other being the conclusion             These categorical propositions contain three terms  subject and predicate of the conclusion  and the middle term  The subject of the conclusion is called the minor term while the predicate is the major term  The premise that contains the middle term and major term is called the major premise while the premise that contains the middle term and minor term is called the minor premise            
A premise can also be an indicator word if statements have been combined into a logical argument and such word functions to mark the role of one or more of the statements             It indicates that the statement it is attached to is a premise
