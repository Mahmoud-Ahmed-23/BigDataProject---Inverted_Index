The AI effect is the discounting of the behavior of an artificial intelligence program as not  real  intelligence            
The author Pamela McCorduck writes   It s part of the history of the field of artificial intelligence that every time somebody figured out how to make a computer do something play good checkers  solve simple but relatively informal problems there was a chorus of critics to say   that s not thinking              
Researcher Rodney Brooks complains   Every time we figure out a piece of it  it stops being magical  we say   Oh  that s just a computation                  


Definition edit 
 The AI effect  refers to a phenomenon where either the definition of AI or the concept of intelligence is adjusted to exclude capabilities that AI systems have mastered  This often manifests as tasks that AI can now perform successfully no longer being considered part of AI  or as the notion of intelligence itself being redefined to exclude AI achievements                                   Edward Geist credits John McCarthy for coining the term  AI effect  to describe this phenomenon            
McCorduck calls it an  odd paradox  that  practical AI successes  computational programs that actually achieved intelligent behavior were soon assimilated into whatever application domain they were found to be useful in  and became silent partners alongside other problem solving approaches  which left AI researchers to deal only with the  failures   the tough nuts that couldn t yet be cracked              It is an example of moving the goalposts            
Tesler s Theorem is 

AI is whatever hasn t been done yet         Larry Tesler
Douglas Hofstadter quotes this            as do many other commentators            
When problems have not yet been formalised  they can still be characterised by a model of computation that includes human computation  The computational burden of a problem is split between a computer and a human  one part is solved by computer and the other part solved by a human  This formalisation is referred to as a human assisted Turing machine            

AI applications become mainstream edit 

Software and algorithms developed by AI researchers are now integrated into many applications throughout the world  without really being called AI  This underappreciation is known from such diverse fields as computer chess              marketing              agricultural automation             hospitality             and optical character recognition             
Michael Swaine reports  AI advances are not trumpeted as artificial intelligence so much these days  but are often seen as advances in some other field    AI has become more important as it has become less conspicuous   Patrick Winston says   These days  it is hard to find a big system that does not work  in part  because of ideas developed or matured in the AI world              
According to Stottler Henke   The great practical benefits of AI applications and even the existence of AI in many software products go largely unnoticed by many despite the already widespread use of AI techniques in software  This is the AI effect  Many marketing people don t use the term  artificial intelligence  even when their company s products rely on some AI techniques  Why not              
Marvin Minsky writes  This paradox resulted from the fact that whenever an AI research project made a useful new discovery  that product usually quickly spun off to form a new scientific or commercial specialty with its own distinctive name  These changes in name led outsiders to ask  Why do we see so little progress in the central field of artificial intelligence              
Nick Bostrom observes that  A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications  often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it s not labelled AI anymore              
The AI effect on decision making in supply chain risk management is a severely understudied area             
To avoid the AI effect problem  the editors of a special issue of IEEE Software on AI and software engineering recommend not overselling   not hyping   the real achievable results to start with             
The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists organization views the AI effect as a worldwide strategic military threat             They point out that it obscures the fact that applications of AI had already found their way into both US and Soviet militaries during the Cold War             AI tools to advise humans regarding weapons deployment were developed by both sides and received very limited usage during that time             They believe this constantly shifting failure to recognise AI continues to undermine human recognition of security threats in the present day            
Some experts think that the AI effect will continue  with advances in AI continually producing objections and redefinitions of public expectations                                      Some also believe that the AI effect will expand to include the dismissal of specialised artificial intelligences             

Legacy of the AI winter edit 
Main article  AI winter
In the early     s  during the second  AI winter  many AI researchers found that they could get more funding and sell more software if they avoided the bad name of  artificial intelligence  and instead pretended their work had nothing to do with intelligence      citation needed     
Patty Tascarella wrote in        Some believe the word  robotics  actually carries a stigma that hurts a company s chances at funding              

Saving a place for humanity at the top of the chain of being edit 
Michael Kearns suggests that  people subconsciously are trying to preserve for themselves some special role in the universe               By discounting artificial intelligence people can continue to feel unique and special  Kearns argues that the change in perception known as the AI effect can be traced to the mystery being removed from the system  In being able to trace the cause of events implies that it s a form of automation rather than intelligence      citation needed     
A related effect has been noted in the history of animal cognition and in consciousness studies  where every time a capacity formerly thought of as uniquely human is discovered in animals  e g  the ability to make tools  or passing the mirror test   the overall importance of that capacity is deprecated      citation needed     
Herbert A  Simon  when asked about the lack of AI s press coverage at the time  said   What made AI different was that the very idea of it arouses a real fear and hostility in some human breasts  So you are getting very strong emotional reactions  But that s okay  We ll live with that              
Mueller      proposed comparing AI to human intelligence  coining the standard of Human Level Machine Intelligence              This nonetheless suffers from the AI effect however when different humans are used as the standard             

Game  
Deep Blue defeats Kasparov edit 
When IBM s chess playing computer Deep Blue succeeded in defeating Garry Kasparov in       public perception of chess playing shifted from a difficult mental task to a routine operation             
The public complained that Deep Blue had only used  brute force methods  and it wasn t real intelligence              Notably  John McCarthy  an AI pioneer and founder of the term  artificial intelligence   was disappointed by Deep Blue  He described it as a mere brute force machine that did not have any deep understanding of the game  McCarthy would also criticize how widespread the AI effect is   As soon as it works  no one calls it AI anymore                                                 but in this case did not think that Deep Blue was a good example             
On the other side  Fred A  Reed writes             

A problem that proponents of AI regularly face is this  When we know how a machine does something  intelligent   it ceases to be regarded as intelligent  If I beat the world s chess champion  I d be regarded as highly bright
