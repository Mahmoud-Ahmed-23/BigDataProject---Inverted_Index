Family of views in the philosophy of mind
Not to be confused with Theory of computation or Pancomputationalism 
In philosophy of mind  the computational theory of mind  CTM   also known as computationalism  is a family of views that hold that the human mind is an information processing system and that cognition and consciousness together are a form of computation  It is closely related to functionalism  a broader theory that defines mental states by what they do rather than what they are made of            
Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts        were the first to suggest that neural activity is computational  They argued that neural computations explain cognition             The theory was proposed in its modern form by Hilary Putnam in      and                  and then developed by his PhD student  philosopher  and cognitive scientist Jerry Fodor in the     s      s  and     s                        It was later criticized in the     s by Putnam himself  John Searle  and others 
The computational theory of mind holds that the mind is a computational system that is realized  i e  physically implemented  by neural activity in the brain  The theory can be elaborated in many ways and varies largely based on how the term computation is understood  Computation is commonly understood in terms of Turing machines which manipulate symbols according to a rule  in combination with the internal state of the machine  The critical aspect of such a computational model is that we can abstract away from particular physical details of the machine that is implementing the computation             For example  the appropriate computation could be implemented either by silicon chips or biological neural networks  so long as there is a series of outputs based on manipulations of inputs and internal states  performed according to a rule  CTM therefore holds that the mind is not simply analogous to a computer program  but that it is literally a computational system            
Computational theories of mind are often said to require mental representation because  input  into a computation comes in the form of symbols or representations of other objects  A computer cannot compute an actual object but must interpret and represent the object in some form and then compute the representation  The computational theory of mind is related to the representational theory of mind in that they both require that mental states are representations  However  the representational theory of mind shifts the focus to the symbols being manipulated  This approach better accounts for systematicity and productivity             In Fodor s original views  the computational theory of mind is also related to the language of thought  The language of thought theory allows the mind to process more complex representations with the help of semantics 
Recent work has suggested that we make a distinction between the mind and cognition  Building from the tradition of McCulloch and Pitts  the computational theory of cognition  CTC  states that neural computations explain cognition             The computational theory of mind asserts that not only cognition  but also phenomenal consciousness or qualia  are computational  That is to say  CTM entails CTC  While phenomenal consciousness could fulfill some other functional role  computational theory of cognition leaves open the possibility that some aspects of the mind could be non computational  CTC  therefore  provides an important explanatory framework for understanding neural networks  while avoiding counter arguments that center around phenomenal consciousness 


 Computer metaphor  edit 
Computational theory of mind is not the same as the computer metaphor  comparing the mind to a modern day digital computer             Computational theory just uses some of the same principles as those found in digital computing             While the computer metaphor draws an analogy between the mind as software and the brain as hardware  CTM is the claim that the mind is a computational system  More specifically  it states that a computational simulation of a mind is sufficient for the actual presence of a mind  and that a mind truly can be simulated computationally 
 Computational system  is not meant to mean a modern day electronic computer  Rather  a computational system is a symbol manipulator that follows step by step functions to compute input and form output  Alan Turing describes this type of computer in his concept of a Turing machine 

Criticism edit 
A range of arguments have been proposed against physicalist conceptions used in computational theories of mind 
An early  though indirect  criticism of the computational theory of mind comes from philosopher John Searle   In his thought experiment known as the Chinese room  Searle attempts to refute the claims that artificially intelligent agents can be said to have intentionality and understanding and that these systems  because they can be said to be minds themselves  are sufficient for the study of the human mind              Searle asks us to imagine that there is a man in a room with no way of communicating with anyone or anything outside of the room except for a piece of paper with symbols written on it that is passed under the door   With the paper  the man is to use a series of provided rule books to return paper containing different symbols   Unknown to the man in the room  these symbols are of a Chinese language  and this process generates a conversation that a Chinese speaker outside of the room can actually understand  Searle contends that the man in the room does not understand the Chinese conversation   This is essentially what the computational theory of mind presents us a model in which the mind simply decodes symbols and outputs more symbols   Searle argues that this is not real understanding or intentionality   This was originally written as a repudiation of the idea that computers work like minds 
Searle has further raised questions about what exactly constitutes a computation 


the wall behind my back is right now implementing the WordStar program  because there is some pattern of molecule movements that is isomorphic with the formal structure of WordStar  But if the wall is implementing WordStar  if it is a big enough wall it is implementing any program  including any program implemented in the brain            


Objections like Searle s might be called insufficiency objections  They claim that computational theories of mind fail because computation is insufficient to account for some capacity of the mind  Arguments from qualia  such as Frank Jackson s knowledge argument  can be understood as objections to computational theories of mind in this way though they take aim at physicalist conceptions of the mind in general  and not computational theories specifically      citation needed     
There are also objections which are directly tailored for computational theories of mind 
Jerry Fodor himself argues that the mind is still a very long way from having been explained by the computational theory of mind  The main reason for this shortcoming is that most cognition is abductive and global  hence sensitive to all possibly relevant background beliefs to  dis confirm a belief  This creates  among other problems  the frame problem for the computational theory  because the relevance of a belief is not one of its local  syntactic properties but context dependent             
Putnam himself  see in particular Representation and Reality and the first part of Renewing Philosophy  became a prominent critic of computationalism for a variety of reasons  including ones related to Searle s Chinese room arguments  questions of world word reference relations  and thoughts about the mind body problem  Regarding functionalism in particular  Putnam has claimed along lines similar to  but more general than Searle s arguments  that the question of whether the human mind can implement computational states is not relevant to the question of the nature of mind  because  every ordinary open system realizes every abstract finite automaton               Computationalists have responded by aiming to develop criteria describing what exactly counts as an implementation                                     
Roger Penrose has proposed the idea that the human mind does not use a knowably sound calculation procedure to understand and discover mathematical intricacies  This would mean that a normal Turing complete computer would not be able to ascertain certain mathematical truths that human minds can              However  the application of G del s theorem by Penrose to demonstrate it was widely criticized  and is considered erroneous             

Pancomputationalism edit 
CTM raises a question that remains a subject of debate  what does it take for a physical system  such as a mind  or an artificial computer  to perform computations  A very straightforward account is based on a simple mapping between abstract mathematical computations and physical systems  a system performs computation C if and only if there is a mapping between a sequence of states individuated by C and a sequence of states individuated by a physical description of the system                         
Putnam        and Searle        argue that this simple mapping account  SMA  trivializes the empirical import of computational descriptions                          As Putnam put it   everything is a Probabilistic Automaton under some Description               Even rocks  walls  and buckets of water contrary to appearances are computing systems  Gualtiero Piccinini identifies different versions of Pancomputationalism             
In response to the trivialization criticism  and to restrict SMA  philosophers of mind have offered different accounts of computational systems  These typically include causal account  semantic account  syntactic account  and mechanistic account              Instead of a semantic restriction  the syntactic account imposes a syntactic restriction              The mechanistic account was first introduced by Gualtiero Piccinini in

Daniel Dennett proposed the multiple drafts model  in which consciousness seems linear but is actually blurry and gappy  distributed over space and time in the brain  Consciousness is the computation  there is no extra step in which you become conscious of the computation 
Jerry Fodor argues that mental states  such as beliefs and desires  are relations between individuals and mental representations  He maintains that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought  LOT  in the mind  Further  this language of thought itself is codified in the brain  not just a useful explanatory tool  Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism  maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought  In later work  Concepts and The Elm and the Expert   Fodor has refined and even questioned some of his original computationalist views  and adopted LOT   a highly modified version of LOT 
David Marr proposed that cognitive processes have three levels of description  the computational level  which describes that computational problem solved by the cognitive process  the algorithmic level  which presents the algorithm used for computing the problem postulated at the computational level  and the implementational level  which describes the physical implementation of the algorithm postulated at the algorithmic level in the brain 
Ulric Neisser coined the term cognitive psychology in his book with that title published in       Neisser characterizes people as dynamic information processing systems whose mental operations might be described in computational terms 
Steven Pinker described language instinct as an evolved  built in capacity to learn language  if not writing   His      book How the Mind Works sought to popularize the computational theory of mind for wide audiences 
Hilary Putnam proposed functionalism to describe consciousness  asserting that it is the computation that equates to consciousness  regardless of whether the computation is operating in a brain or in a computer
