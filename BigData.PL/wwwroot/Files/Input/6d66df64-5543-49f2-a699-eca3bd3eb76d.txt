Ability to experience feelings and sensations
Not to be confused with Sapience 
 Sentient  redirects here  For other uses  see Sentient  disambiguation  
Determining which animals can experience sensations is challenging  but scientists generally agree that vertebrates  as well as many invertebrate species  are likely sentient                       
Sentience is the ability to experience feelings and sensations             It may not necessarily imply higher cognitive functions such as awareness  reasoning  or complex thought processes  Sentience is an important concept in ethics  as the ability to experience happiness or suffering often forms a basis for determining which entities deserve moral consideration  particularly in utilitarianism            
Some writers define sentience exclusively as the capacity for valenced  positive or negative  mental experiences  such as pain or pleasure             Others differentiate between the mere ability to perceive sensations  such as light or pain  and the ability to perceive emotions  such as fear or grief      citation needed     
In Asian religions  the word  sentience  has been used to translate a variety of concepts  In science fiction   sentience  is sometimes used interchangeably with  sapience    self awareness   or  consciousness             


Sentience in philosophy edit 
 Sentience  was first coined by philosophers in the     s for the concept of an ability to feel  derived from Latin sentiens  feeling              In philosophy  different authors draw different distinctions between consciousness and sentience  According to Antonio Damasio  sentience is a minimalistic way of defining consciousness  which otherwise commonly and collectively describes sentience plus further features of the mind and consciousness  such as creativity  intelligence  sapience  self awareness  and intentionality  the ability to have thoughts about something   These further features of consciousness may not be necessary for sentience  which is the capacity to feel sensations and emotions            

Consciousness edit 
According to Thomas Nagel in his paper  What Is It Like to Be a Bat    consciousness can refer to the ability of any entity to have subjective perceptual experiences  or as some philosophers refer to them   qualia  in other words  the ability to have states that it feels like something to be in             Some philosophers  notably Colin McGinn  believe that the physical process causing consciousness to happen will never be understood  a position known as  new mysterianism   They do not deny that most other aspects of consciousness are subject to scientific investigation but they argue that qualia will never be explained              Other philosophers  such as Daniel Dennett  argue that qualia is not a meaningful concept             
Regarding animal consciousness  the Cambridge Declaration of Consciousness  publicly proclaimed on   July      at Cambridge University  states that many non human animals possess the neuroanatomical  neurochemical  and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states  and can exhibit intentional behaviors  a  The declaration notes that all vertebrates  including fish and reptiles  have this neurological substrate for consciousness  and that there is strong evidence that many invertebrates also have it            

Phenomenal vs  affective consciousness edit 
David Chalmers argues that sentience is sometimes used as shorthand for phenomenal consciousness  the capacity to have any subjective experience at all  but sometimes refers to the narrower concept of affective consciousness  the capacity to experience subjective states that have affective valence  i e   a positive or negative character   such as pain and pleasure             

Sentience quotient edit 
The sentience quotient concept was introduced by Robert A  Freitas Jr  in the late     s              It defines sentience as the relationship between the information processing rate of each individual processing unit  neuron   the weight size of a single unit  and the total number of processing units  expressed as mass   It was proposed as a measure for the sentience of all living beings and computers from a single neuron up to a hypothetical being at the theoretical computational limit of the entire universe  On a logarithmic scale it runs from     up to     

Eastern religions edit 
See also  Sentient beings  Buddhism 
Eastern religions including Hinduism  Buddhism  Sikhism  and Jainism recognise non humans as sentient beings              The term sentient beings is translated from various Sanskrit terms  jantu  bahu jana  jagat  sattva  and  conventionally refers to the mass of living things subject to illusion  suffering  and rebirth  Sa s ra                It is related to the concept of ahimsa  non violence toward other beings              In some forms of Buddhism  plants  stones and other inanimate objects are considered to be  sentient                           In Jainism many things are endowed with a soul  j va  which is sometimes translated as  sentience                           Some things are without a soul  aj va  such as a chair or spoon              There are different rankings of j va based on the number of senses it has  Water  for example  is a sentient being of the first order  as it is considered to possess only one sense  that of touch             
Sentience in Buddhism is the state of having senses  In Buddhism  there are six senses  the sixth being the subjective experience of the mind  Sentience is simply awareness prior to the arising of Skandha  Thus  an animal qualifies as a sentient being  According to Buddhism  sentient beings made of pure consciousness are possible  In Mahayana Buddhism  which includes Zen and Tibetan Buddhism  the concept is related to the Bodhisattva  an enlightened being devoted to the liberation of others  The first vow of a Bodhisattva states   Sentient beings are numberless  I vow to free them  

Animal welfare  rights  and sentience edit

An octopus traveling with shells collected for protection  Despite evolving independently from humans for over     million years  octopuses show various signs of sentience                          Octopuses  along with all other cephalopod molluscs and decapod crustaceans  were recognized as sentient by the United Kingdom in                  
Sentience has been a central concept in the animal rights movement  tracing back to the well known writing of Jeremy Bentham in An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation   The question is not  Can they reason  nor  Can they talk  but  Can they suffer  
Richard D  Ryder defines sentientism broadly as the position according to which an entity has moral status if and only if it is sentient              In David Chalmer s more specific terminology  Bentham is a narrow sentientist  since his criterion for moral status is not only the ability to experience any phenomenal consciousness at all  but specifically the ability to experience conscious states with negative affective valence  i e  suffering               Animal welfare and rights advocates often invoke similar capacities  For example  the documentary Earthlings argues that while animals do not have all the desires and ability to comprehend as do humans  they do share the desires for food and water  shelter and companionship  freedom of movement and avoidance of pain              b 
Animal welfare advocates typically argue that any sentient being is entitled  at a minimum  to protection from unnecessary suffering     citation needed       though animal rights advocates may differ on what rights  e g   the right to life  may be entailed by simple sentience 
Gary Francione also bases his abolitionist theory of animal rights  which differs significantly from Singer s  on sentience  He asserts that   All sentient beings  humans or nonhuman  have one right  the basic right not to be treated as the property of others              
Andrew Linzey  a British theologian  considers that Christianity should regard sentient animals according to their intrinsic worth  rather than their utility to humans             
In      the concept of animal sentience was written into the basic law of the European Union  The legally binding protocol annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam recognises that animals are  sentient beings   and requires the EU and its member states to  pay full regards to the welfare requirements of animals              

Indicators of sentience edit 
Experiments suggest that bees can display an optimistic mood  engage in playful behavior  and strategically avoid threats or harmful situations unless the reward is significant             
Nociception is the process by which the nervous system detects and responds to potentially harmful stimuli  leading to the sensation of pain  It involves specialized receptors called nociceptors that sense damage or threat and send signals to the brain  Nociception is widespread among animals  even among insects             
The presence of nociception indicates an organism s ability to detect harmful stimuli  A further question is whether the way these noxious stimuli are processed within the brain leads to a subjective experience of pain              To address that  researchers often look for behavioral cues  For example   if a dog with an injured paw whimpers  licks the wound  limps  lowers pressure on the paw while walking  learns to avoid the place where the injury happened and seeks out analgesics when offered  we have reasonable grounds to assume that the dog is indeed experiencing something unpleasant   Avoiding painful stimuli unless the reward is significant can also provide evidence that pain avoidance is not merely an unconscious reflex  similarly to how humans  can choose to press a hot door handle to escape a burning building               

Sentient animals edit 
Animals such as pigs  chickens  and fish are typically recognized as sentient  There is more uncertainty regarding insects  and findings on certain insect species may not be applicable to others             
Historically  fish were not considered sentient  and their behaviors were often viewed as  reflexes or complex  unconscious species typical responses  to their environment  Their dissimilarity with humans  including the absence of a direct equivalent of the neocortex in their brain  was used as an argument against sentience              Jennifer Jacquet suggests that the belief that fish do not feel pain originated in response to a     s policy aimed at banning catch and release              The range of animals regarded by scientists as sentient or conscious has progressively widened  now including animals such as fish  lobsters and octopus             

Digital sentience edit 
Main article  Artificial consciousness
Digital sentience  or artificial sentience  means the sentience of artificial intelligences  The question of whether artificial intelligences can be sentient is controversial              
The AI research community does not consider sentience  that is  the  ability to feel sensations   as an important research goal  unless it can be shown that consciously  feeling  a sensation can make a machine more intelligent than just receiving input from sensors and processing it as information  Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig wrote in        We are interested in programs that behave intelligently  Individual aspects of consciousness awareness  self awareness  attention can be programmed and can be part of an intelligent machine  The additional project making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on               
Indeed  leading AI textbooks do not mention  sentience  at all             
Digital sentience is of considerable interest to the philosophy of mind  Functionalist philosophers consider that sentience is about  causal roles  played by mental states  which involve information processing  In this view  the physical substrate of this information processing does not need to be biological  so there is no theoretical barrier to the possibility of sentient machines              According to type physicalism however  the physical constitution is important  and depending on the types of physical systems required for sentience  it may or may not be possible for certain types of machines  such as electronic computing devices  to be sentient             
The discussion on the topic of alleged sentience of artificial intelligence has been reignited in      by the claims made about Google s LaMDA  Language Model for Dialogue Applications  artificial intelligence system that it is  sentient  and had a  soul               LaMDA is an artificial intelligence system that creates chatbots AI robots designed to communicate with humans by gathering vast amounts of text from the internet and using algorithms to respond to queries in the most fluid and natural way possible  The transcripts of conversations between scientists and LaMDA reveal that the AI system excels at this  providing answers to challenging topics about the nature of emotions  generating Aesop style fables on cue  and even describing its alleged fears             
Nick Bostrom considers that while LaMDA is probably not sentient  being very sure of it would require understanding how consciousness works  having access to unpublished information about LaMDA s architecture  and finding how to apply the philosophical theory to the machine              He also said about LLMs that  it s not doing them justice to say they re simply regurgitating text   noting that they  exhibit glimpses of creativity  insight and understanding that are quite impressive and may show the rudiments of reasoning   He thinks that  sentience is a matter of degree              
In       philosopher David Chalmers made a speech on whether large language models  LLMs  can be conscious  encouraging more research on the subject  He suggested that current LLMs were probably not conscious  but that the limitations are temporary and that future systems could be serious candidates for consciousness             
According to Jonathan Birch   measures to regulate the development of sentient AI should run ahead of what would be proportionate to the risks posed by current technology  considering also the risks posed by credible future trajectories   He is concerned that AI sentience would be particularly easy to deny  and that if achieved  humans might nevertheless continue to treat AI systems as mere tools  He notes that the linguistic behaviour of LLMs is not a reliable way to assess whether they are sentient  He suggests to apply theories of consciousness  such as the global workspace theory  to the algorithms implicitly learned by LLMs  but noted that this technique requires advances in AI interpretability to understand what happens inside  He also mentions some other pathways that may lead to AI sentience  such as the brain emulation of sentient animals

Notes edit 

a     Quote   The absence of a neocortex does not appear to preclude an organism from experiencing affective states  Convergent evidence indicates that non human animals have the neuroanatomical  neurochemical  and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors  Consequently  the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate consciousness  Non human animals  including all mammals and birds  and many other creatures  including octopuses  also possess these neurological substrates             
b     Quote   Granted  these animals do not have all the desires we humans have  granted  they do not comprehend everything we humans comprehend  nevertheless  we and they do have some of the same desires and do comprehend some of the same things  The desires for food and water  shelter and companionship  freedom of movement and avoidance of pain
