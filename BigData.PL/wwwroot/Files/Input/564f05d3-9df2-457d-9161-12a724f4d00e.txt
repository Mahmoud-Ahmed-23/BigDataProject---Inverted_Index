Topical guide to object recognition
This article is about object recognition in computer vision  For object recognition in neuroscience  see cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition 

Object recognition         technology in the field of computer vision for finding and identifying objects in an image or video sequence  Humans recognize a multitude of objects in images with little effort  despite the fact that the image of the objects may vary somewhat in different view points  in many different sizes and scales or even when they are translated or rotated  Objects can even be recognized when they are partially obstructed from view  This task is still a challenge for computer vision systems  Many approaches to the task have been implemented over multiple decades

Appearance based methods edit 
Use example images  called templates or exemplars  of the objects to perform recognition
Objects look different under varying conditions 
Changes in lighting or color
Changes in viewing direction
Changes in size shape
A single exemplar is unlikely to succeed reliably  However  it is impossible to represent all appearances of an object 
Edge matching edit 
Uses edge detection techniques  such as the Canny edge detection  to find edges 
Changes in lighting and color usually don t have much effect on image edges
Strategy 
Detect edges in template and image
Compare edges images to find the template
Must consider range of possible template positions
Measurements 
Good    count the number of overlapping edges  Not robust to changes in shape
Better   count the number of template edge pixels with some distance of an edge in the search image
Best    determine probability distribution of distance to nearest edge in search image  if template at correct position   Estimate likelihood of each template position generating image
Divide and Conquer search edit 
Strategy 
Consider all positions as a set  a cell in the space of positions 
Determine lower bound on score at best position in cell
If bound is too large  prune cell
If bound is not too large  divide cell into subcells and try each subcell recursively
Process stops when cell is  small enough 
Unlike multi resolution search  this technique is guaranteed to find all matches that meet the criterion  assuming that the lower bound is accurate 
Finding the Bound 
To find the lower bound on the best score  look at score for the template position represented by the center of the cell
Subtract maximum change from the  center  position for any other position in cell  occurs at cell corners 
Complexities arise from determining bounds on distance     citation needed     
Greyscale matching edit 
Edges are  mostly  robust to illumination changes  however they throw away a lot of information
Must compute pixel distance as a function of both pixel position and pixel intensity
Can be applied to color also
Gradient matching edit 
Another way to be robust to illumination changes without throwing away as much information is to compare image gradients
Matching is performed like matching greyscale images
Simple alternative  Use  normalized  correlation
Histograms of receptive field responses edit 
Avoids explicit point correspondences
Relations between different image points implicitly coded in the receptive field responses

a search is used to find feasible matches between object features and image features 
the primary constraint is that a single position of the object must account for all of the feasible matches 
methods that extract features from the objects to be recognized and the images to be searched 
surface patches
corners
linear edges
Interpretation trees edit 
A method for searching for feasible matches  is to search through a tree 
Each node in the tree represents a set of matches 
Root node represents empty set
Each other node is the union of the matches in the parent node and one additional match 
Wildcard is used for features with no match
Nodes are  pruned  when the set of matches is infeasible 
A pruned node has no children
Historically significant and still used  but less commonly
Hypothesize and test edit 
General Idea 
Hypothesize a correspondence between a collection of image features and a collection of object features
Then use this to generate a hypothesis about the projection from the object coordinate frame to the image frame
Use this projection hypothesis to generate a rendering of the object  This step is usually known as backprojection
Compare the rendering to the image  and  if the two are sufficiently similar  accept the hypothesis
Obtaining Hypothesis 
There are a variety of different ways of generating hypotheses 
When camera intrinsic parameters are known  the hypothesis is equivalent to a hypothetical position and orientation   pose   for the object 
Utilize geometric constraints
Construct a correspondence for small sets of object features to every correctly sized subset of image points   These are the hypotheses 
Three basic approaches 
Obtaining Hypotheses by Pose Consistency
Obtaining Hypotheses by Pose Clustering
Obtaining Hypotheses by Using Invariants
Expense search that is also redundant  but can be improved using Randomization and or Grouping
Randomization
Examining small sets of image features until likelihood of missing object becomes small
For each set of image features  all possible matching sets of model features must be considered 
Formula 
     Wc k   Z
W    the fraction of image points that are  good   w   m n 
c    the number of correspondences necessary
k    the number of trials
Z    the probability of every trial using one  or more  incorrect correspondences
Grouping
If we can determine groups of points that are likely to come from the same object  we can reduce the number of hypotheses that need to be examined
Pose consistency edit 
Also called Alignment  since the object is being aligned to the image
Correspondences between image features and model features are not independent   Geometric constraints
A small number of correspondences yields the object position   the others must be consistent with this
General Idea 
If we hypothesize a match between a sufficiently large group of image features and a sufficiently large group of object features  then we can recover the missing camera parameters from this hypothesis  and so render the rest of the object 
Strategy 
Generate hypotheses using small number of correspondences  e g  triples of points for  D recognition 
Project other model features into image  backproject  and verify additional correspondences
Use the smallest number of correspondences necessary to achieve discrete object poses
Pose clustering edit 
General Idea 
Each object leads to many correct sets of correspondences  each of which has  roughly  the same pose
Vote on pose  Use an accumulator array that represents pose space for each object
This is essentially a Hough transform
Strategy 
For each object  set up an accumulator array that represents pose space   each element in the accumulator array corresponds to a  bucket  in pose space 
Then take each image frame group  and hypothesize a correspondence between it and every frame group on every object
For each of these correspondences  determine pose parameters and make an entry in the accumulator array for the current object at the pose value 
If there are large numbers of votes in any object s accumulator array  this can be interpreted as evidence for the presence of that object at that pose 
The evidence can be checked using a verification method
Note that this method uses sets of correspondences  rather than individual correspondences
Implementation is easier  since each set yields a small number of possible object poses 
Improvement
The noise resistance of this method can be improved by not counting votes for objects at poses where the vote is obviously unreliable
  For example  in cases where  if the object was at that pose  the object frame group would be invisible 
These improvements are sufficient to yield working systems
Invariance edit 
There are geometric properties that are invariant to camera transformations
Most easily developed for images of planar objects  but can be applied to other cases as well
Geometric hashing edit 
An algorithm that uses geometric invariants to vote for object hypotheses
Similar to pose clustering  however instead of voting on pose  we are now voting on geometry
A technique originally developed for matching geometric features  uncalibrated affine views of plane models  against a database of such features
Widely used for pattern matching  CAD CAM  and medical imaging 
It is difficult to choose the size of the buckets
It is hard to be sure what  enough  means  Therefore  there may be some danger that the table will get clogged 
Scale invariant feature transform  SIFT  edit 
Keypoints of objects are first extracted from a set of reference images and stored in a database
An object is recognized in a new image by individually comparing each feature from the new image to this database and finding candidate matching features based on Euclidean distance of their feature vectors 
Lowe                             
Speeded Up Robust Features  SURF  edit 
A robust image detector  amp  descriptor
The standard version is several times faster than SIFT and claimed by its authors to be more robust against different image transformations than SIFT
Based on sums of approximated  D Haar wavelet responses and made efficient use of integral images

Genetic algorithms can operate without prior knowledge of a given dataset and can develop recognition procedures without human intervention  A recent project achieved     percent accuracy on the benchmark motorbike  face  airplane and car image datasets from Caltech and      percent accuracy on fish species image datasets
