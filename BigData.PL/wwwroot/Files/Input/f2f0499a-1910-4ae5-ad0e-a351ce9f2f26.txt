Sexual grooming is the action or behavior used to establish an emotional connection with a vulnerable person   generally a minor under the age of consent                         and sometimes the victim s family             to lower their inhibitions with the objective of sexual abuse                        It can occur in various settings  including online  in person  and through other means of communication             Children who are groomed may experience mental health issues  including  anxiety  depression  post traumatic stress  and suicidal thoughts             


History and recognition edit 
Origins edit 
Before the term  grooming  was associated with grooming a child for sexual abuse  it had come to have a meaning of mentorship  coaching  or preparing someone for leadership                       
From      to       law enforcement in the United States became increasingly aware of child sexual abuse that happened to children from outside their family  committed by those who were not strangers             Previously  the focus of law enforcement had been on  stranger danger  and those who used threats of violence to ensure compliance from their victims             In these newly recognized sexual abuse cases  children were manipulated with a  combination of attention  affection  kindness  gifts  alcohol  drugs  money  and privileges              While there are examples before this time where the pattern was recognized  it was during this decade that the FBI became aware of the pattern and criminal investigations were first taken seriously in the United States             There was also growing awareness that offenders joined youth serving organizations to gain access to potential victims            
As an example  a      study used the terminology  pressured sexual contacts  and  forced sex contacts  to distinguish two types of offenders              Sex pressure offenses had a lack of physical force and behavior that was counter aggressive  using  persuasion of reward  attention  affection  money  gifts  or entrapment                Sex force offenses  used the threat of harm or physical force  such as  intimidation  verbal threat  restraint  manipulation  and physical strength              
Ken Lanning is credited with being one of the first professionals using the term  grooming               He recalls it being used in conversations between law enforcement professionals  and pinpoints the first known written description of the process of child grooming to a      book written by Nicholas Groth  and the first printed use of the word grooming to a      article by Jon Conte             At the beginning of its use  both grooming and seduction were being used to describe this type of non violent offender  and Lanning recalls using both terms interchangeably            
A January      FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin used  seduction  and being  seduced  to describe the activity of non violent offenders             By       the Chicago Tribune had used the term  reporting  These  friendly molesters  become acquainted with their targeted victim  gaining their trust while secretly grooming the child as a sexual partner             
In the     s  the public in the United States became increasingly aware of child sexual abuse through the nursery school cases and abuse in religious settings             

Changing meaning edit 
During the     s  the term grooming was increasingly used to replace  seduction  as the most commonly used term             However  there was not  one official  legal  mental health  or even lay definition  of grooming             Growing awareness of chat rooms being used by pedophiles to target victims came to public notice  and the use of  grooming  to mean  to win the confidence of  a victim  in order to a commit sexual assault on him or her  became mainstream             In academia  the description of grooming strategies in online cases became distinct from the descriptions of pre Internet grooming strategies             
In       a BBC report stated that  grooming  had taken on a pejorative meaning  no longer associated with animal care or mentoring  it had become associated with pedophiles and pedophilia             This caused outrage when the term  groomed  was used to describe the behavior of someone who had obtained leaked documents from a civil servant             The news report mentioned other uses of the term  groom  that also had negative connotation  such as  groomed for terrorism  or  groomed to become suicide bombers             
A      report by the Christian Monitor  reported that the word  grooming  was now seen as  sinister              Instead of meaning  to prepare as a political candidate          to prepare or coach for a career   the term had shifted in public discourse to mean  to befriend or influence  a child   now esp  via the internet  in preparation for future sexual abuse             

Patterns edit 
Non violent offenders edit 
To establish a good relationship with a child and the child s family  child groomers might do several things  They might try to gain the child s or parents  trust by befriending them  with the goal of easy access to the child                                     A trusting relationship with the family means the child s parents are less likely to believe potential accusations             Child groomers might look for opportunities to have time alone with the child  which can be done by offering to babysit  the groomers may also invite the child for sleepovers  for opportunistic bed sharing              They might give gifts or money to the child in exchange for sexual contact  or for no apparent reason                          Commonly  they show pornography to the child  or talk about sexual topics with the child  hoping to make it easy for the child to accept such acts  thus normalizing the behavior                                      They may also engage in hugging  kissing  or other physical contact  even when the child does not want it                         
When grooming techniques are successful  the resulting compliance of the child can be mis interpreted as consent  and the child treated as if they were not a victim of crime             When the behavior is considered criminal  it can still be perceived as a lesser offense            
Some offenders prefer sexual gratification from less obvious types of behaviors  and grooming behaviors in and of themselves are the goal as they provide a chance to engage in a paraphilia            
Signs that characterize child groomers include  a person who tries to communicate with a child online or in person in secret  outside the knowledge of the child s parents or guardians              a person who attempts to isolate a child from their friends or family  or who discourages the child from spending time with others              or a person who asks a child to keep secrets or who makes the child feel like they are special or important in a way that is inappropriate             

Online offenders edit 
Sexual grooming of children also occurs on the Internet  Some abusers  sometimes posing as children themselves  chat with children online and make arrangements to meet with them in person  Online grooming of minors is most prevalent in relation to the       age group      of cases   and particularly              The majority of targeted children are girls  and most victimization occurs with mobile phone support  Children and teenagers who are highly curious and high sensation seeking are at higher risk than others             
Facebook has been involved in controversy as to whether it takes enough precautions against the sexual grooming of children  Jim Gamble  leader of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre  CEOP  in the UK  said in      that his office had received     complaints about Facebook users in      but that none of the complaints had come directly from Facebook  A spokesman for Facebook responded to complaints by meeting CEOP directly in person  and said that they take safety issues  very seriously               In       MSN implemented chat room restrictions to help protect children from adults seeking sexual conversations with them              In       Yahoo  chat rooms were investigated by the New York State attorney general s office for allowing users to create rooms whose names suggested they were being used for this purpose  that October  Yahoo  agreed to  implement policies and procedures designed to ensure  that such rooms would not be allowed              Computer programs have been developed to analyse chat rooms and other instant messaging logs for suspicious activity              As this can be prevented not only on platform level but also on the point of entry  it is recommended that parents establish safe environments for their children to use the Internet  with reduced risk of encountering cyber grooming individuals             
Pedophiles and predators                                     use online grooming to carry out cybersex trafficking crimes  After the pedophile gains the trust from a local cybersex trafficker  often a parent or neighbor of the victim  the online sexual exploitation will take place             
Suspected offenders have used the so called  fantasy defense   the argument that they were only expressing fantasies and not plans of future behavior  to defend actions such as online communication              In the U S   case law draws a distinction between those two and some people accused of  grooming  have successfully used this defense             
In the US  an online privacy law  Children s Online Privacy Protection Act  has been misattributed             as a measure to prevent online child grooming and protect children from child predators             

Religious settings edit 
Further information  Religious abuse
Some characteristics of some religions can facilitate sexual grooming  including religious texts which justify sexual grooming  deference towards religious authority  unquestioned faith in persons with religious authority  spiritual punishments  power  patriarchy and obedience              Sexual grooming in religious setting can be within some religious institutions or outside of religious institutions in case of religious rhetoric              Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse found evidence for sexual grooming in religious settings for    groups              Examples of sexual grooming in religious settings include Catholic Church sexual abuse cases  Jehovah s Witnesses  handling of child sexual abuse  Rochdale child sex abuse ring  Adass Israel School sex abuse scandal and religious child marriage 

Impact on victims edit 
Grooming has devastating impacts on victims  damaging their sense of self  eroding their ability to trust others  and severely impacting mental health  Children who are groomed may feel they are to blame for their abuse  and have difficulty placing blame on the perpetrator              Survivors may perceive aspects of human connection as threat cues  and thus may find it difficult to fully engage mentally with simple positive interactions  such as affirmation or compliments      citation needed     
Many grooming tactics involve isolating a victim through fostering distrust or otherwise sabotaging other close relationships  This directly weakens the potential support network to process traumatic experiences  increasing the risk of long term psychological ramifications  Victims can be left having been both isolated from existing social connections  and finding it difficult to form new ones      citation needed

Australia edit 
Australian Criminal Code Act      section        and        prohibits the use of a  carrier service  to communicate with the intent to procure a person under the age of     or expose such a person to any indecent matter for grooming  The various states and territories have similar laws  some of which use a different ages  for example the victim only has to be under    in Queensland   Such laws across Australia were recently     when       strengthened in the wake of the murder of Carly Ryan
