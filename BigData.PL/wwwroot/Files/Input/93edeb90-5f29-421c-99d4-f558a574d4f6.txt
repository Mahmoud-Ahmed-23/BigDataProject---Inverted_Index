The Ministry of Antiquities  the governorate of Cairo and the Ministry of Interior have begun implementing a project involving the closing off of Gamaliya Street in the historic Old Cairo and converting it into an open air museum for pedestrians  similarly to the famous Al Moez Street  said Minister of Antiquities Mohamed Ibrahim  The minister confirmed that the plan has been approved by the cabinet 
Ibrahim clarified that the project to convert the street into a pedestrian only zone and museum comes under the bigger goal of renovating historic Cairo with a cost of up to EGP   m  which includes renovating facades and floors on the street from Bab Al Nasr to Mashhad Al Husseiny as well as the area from the intersection of Ghouri Mosque and Al Azhar Street to Bab Zuweila 
Project Manager Mohamed Abdel Aziz said that the ministry has signed a contract with a company hired to fix and operate electronic gates on Moez Street  paving the way for a new project on Sunday to raise the general standards of the street with a cost of EGP    m  funded by the Ministry of Tourism 
Before the January      Revolution  the street was off limits to automobiles  After the revolution  the law had been ignored in the aftermath of the chaos  Reverting the street to a pedestrian only zone will be achieved through the cooperation of the Ministry of Interior  represented by the tourism police  the Gamaliya Police Station  the Cairo Security Directorate and the Cairo governorate 
Abdel Aziz added that all regular operations  including fixing granite floors and painting facades and woodwork for shops  of the first phase have been concluded  and that all operations will be completed by February  The aim of the project is that the street be presented free of vandalism  which had appeared after the      revolution
