French actress Corinne Masiero stripped naked on stage during a scaled back Cesar Awards ceremony in Paris  to protest the French government s months long closure of theatres and cinemas  AFP reported 



Theatres and cinemas have been closed down across the country due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus  COVID     pandemic 



The actress had  no culture no future  written on her chest and  give us art back Jean  on her back  in a message to Prime Minister Jean Castex 



Masiero was on stage to present the award for best costume  wearing a donkey outfit and a blood stained dress before she stripped before the audience 



France s answer to the Oscars  the ceremony is in normal times the biggest night on the country s cinema calendar  On Friday  however  there were no flashbulbs on the red carpet  and no partners on the arms of award nominees 



The ceremony took place at a theatre as anger and frustration grew amongst actors  musicians  and artists at the government s unwillingness to set a date for the reopening of museums  galleries  concert halls  and film houses 



Marina Fois  one of France s best known comedians  took aim at the government s months long closure of theatres and cinemas during the coronavirus pandemic in a searing speech to open the ceremony 



Fois  who hosted the night  took a swipe at Culture Minister Roselyne Bachelot for finding time to write a book during the COVID    crisis  and said   I m losing confidence in you  



Nor did she hold back from attacking the French government s broader strategy to counter the COVID    crisis  as cases in the country topped   million 



 They cooped up our youngsters  closed our cinemas and theatres  and banned concerts so that they could open churches  because we re a secular country  so that old people could go to church   she said 



Across the capital  several dozen protesters were occupying the Odeon Theatre for an eighth night  demanding cultural venues be reopened and more financial support be given
