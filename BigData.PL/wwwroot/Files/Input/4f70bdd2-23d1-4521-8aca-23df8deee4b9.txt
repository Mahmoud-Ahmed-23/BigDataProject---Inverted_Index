							Dr Mohamed Fouad
Over the past   years  there may have been numerous instances when Egypt has taken the wrong turn  Some of those wasted chances are indeed lamentable  The bitter irony is that    months following    Jan  there isn t a single concrete aspect in Egypt that justifies the soaring death tolls  the economic stalemate  the degradation of state security and worsening living conditions  We should stop and ask ourselves  where we went wrong  We cannot simply allow ourselves to continue getting caught in the heat of the moment  living the daily grind  getting our media fix and clinging on that empty hope that tomorrow will be a better day  This is not an invitation for depression but simply an invitation to contemplate and ask the question  Was it all for nothing 
Never Asking  What s Next 
The calls for the removal of President Hosni Mubarak although justifiable in some sense  never really considered what would be the roadmap thereafter  In the midst of the crowds motivated by mixed emotions of hope and hatred  there were some who knew the game can play in their favour  The moment it was announced that Mubarak has stepped down  there were jubilations and celebrations  I was taken aback realising that the dizzying events never allowed us to fully answer the question  What s next  Fortunately  following    June  the army acted swiftly to disallow the same situation from happening again by proposing a roadmap of the events to be 
Never Having a Priority
The moment Mubarak was out  our reforming process has adopted the  Open Buffet  approach  where people gathered so many issues on their plates than they can chew and ultimately getting nothing achieved  Consecutive weak governments made matters worse by allowing people to completely derail them from achieving anything let alone setting any feasible objectives  Government officials were too busy placating the masses and obeying revolutionary thoughts  although  at times these thoughts were absurd  they continue following them to avoid rocking the boat  even though that boat was already sinking  There was chaos everywhere with people demanding things such as  Salary increases  reforming of the police force  media reforms  and judiciary reforms to list a few  The country suddenly fell under a growing demand and diminishing resources and the system just went into hibernation to preserve itself from collapsing 
Always Carrying a Vendetta
The masses succumbed to the campaigns of flame and shame  Everyone associated in any way with the old regime was labeled a bad guy  The overall change management approach has always been to eradicate and confront rather than reform  Even within the ranks of the ruling Muslim Brotherhood  the same mistake has occurred  The reformists within the Brotherhood were shoved aside in favour of the old guard  as Political Science Professor Carrie Rosefsky Wickham noted   Sacrifice  loyalty and obedience counted more than competence  
Bottom Line
It is great to hope for tomorrow to be a better day  one cannot live otherwise  However  without carefully assessing the mistakes of the past  one is also bound to repeat them  The evidence on the ground suggests that we have a lot of learning to take in  In a poll conducted by Gallup two weeks before former president Morsi was deposed      of Egyptians interviewed said that their country was worse off than it was when Mubarak has stepped down and     believed that their country will still be worse off in five years  Now  if you frankly have to ask the question  Was it all for nothing  Sad as it is  I think you have the answer  Now  do something about it
