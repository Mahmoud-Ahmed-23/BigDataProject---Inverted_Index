Parkinson s disease  PD   or simply Parkinson s  is a neurodegenerative disease primarily of the central nervous system  affecting both motor and non motor systems  Symptoms typically develop gradually  with non motor issues becoming more prevalent as the disease progresses  The motor symptoms are collectively called parkinsonism and include tremors  bradykinesia  rigidity as well as postural instability  i e   difficulty maintaining balance   Non motor symptoms develop later in the disease and include behavioral changes or neuropsychiatric problems such as sleep abnormalities  psychosis  and mood swings 
Most Parkinson s disease cases are sporadic  though contributing factors have been identified  Pathophysiology involves progressive degeneration of nerve cells in the substantia nigra  a midbrain region that provides dopamine to the basal ganglia  a system involved in voluntary motor control  The cause of this cell death is poorly understood but involves the aggregation of alpha synuclein into Lewy bodies within neurons  Other potential factors involve genetic and environmental influences  medications  lifestyle  and prior health conditions 
Diagnosis is primarily based on signs and symptoms  typically motor related  identified through neurological examination  Medical imaging techniques like positron emission tomography can support the diagnosis  Parkinson s  typically manifests in individuals over     with about one percent affected  In those younger than     it is termed  early onset PD  
No cure for Parkinson s is known  and treatment focuses on alleviating symptoms  Initial treatment typically includes levodopa  MAO B inhibitors  or dopamine agonists  As the disease progresses  these medications become less effective and may cause involuntary muscle movements  Diet and rehabilitation therapies can help improve symptoms  Deep brain stimulation is used to manage severe motor symptoms when drugs are ineffective  There is little evidence for treatments addressing non motor symptoms  such as sleep disturbances and mood instability  Life expectancy for those with PD is near normal but is decreased for early onset 


Classification and terminology edit 
See also  Parkinsonism and Parkinson plus syndrome
Parkinson s disease  PD  is a neurodegenerative disease affecting both the central and peripheral nervous systems  characterized by the loss of dopamine producing neurons in the substantia nigra region of the brain             It is classified as a synucleinopathy due to the abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha synuclein  which aggregates into Lewy bodies within affected neurons            
The loss of dopamine producing neurons in the substantia nigra causes movement abnormalities  leading to Parkinson s further categorization as a movement disorder             In     of cases  disease progression leads to the cognitive decline  resulting in Parkinson s disease dementia  PDD              Alongside dementia with Lewy bodies  PDD is one of the two subtypes of Lewy body dementia            
The four cardinal motor symptoms of Parkinson s bradykinesia  slowed movements   postural instability  rigidity  and tremor are called parkinsonism                        These four symptoms are not exclusive to Parkinson s and can occur in many other conditions              including HIV infection and recreational drug use                          Neurodegenerative diseases that feature parkinsonism but have distinct differences are grouped under the umbrella of Parkinson plus syndromes or  alternatively  atypical parkinsonian disorders                          Parkinson s disease can be attributed to genetic factors  but most cases are sporadic  with no clearly identifiable cause            

Signs and symptoms edit 
Main article  Signs and symptoms of Parkinson s disease
Motor edit 
See also  Parkinsonism
Motor symptoms include a stooping posture  the Parkinsonian gait  and micrographia jagged  diminutive handwriting 
A wide spectrum of motor and non motor symptoms appear in Parkinson s  the cardinal features are tremor  bradykinesia  rigidity  and postural instability  collectively termed parkinsonism              Appearing in       percent of those with PD                          tremor is often the predominant motor symptom              Resting tremor is the most common  but kinetic tremors occurring during voluntary movements and postural tremor preventing upright  stable posture also occur              Tremor largely affects the hands and feet              a classic parkinsonian tremor is  pill rolling   a resting tremor in which the thumb and index finger make contact in a circular motion at     Hz frequency                         
Bradykinesia describes difficulties in motor planning  beginning  and executing  resulting in overall slowed movement with reduced amplitude that affects sequential and simultaneous tasks              Bradykinesia can also lead to hypomimia  reduced facial expressions              Rigidity  also called rigor  refers to a feeling of stiffness and resistance to passive stretching of muscles              Postural instability typically appears in later stages  leading to impaired balance and falls              Postural instability also leads to a forward stooping posture             
Beyond the cardinal four  other motor deficits  termed secondary motor symptoms  commonly occur              Notably  gait disturbances result in the Parkinsonian gait  which includes shuffling and paroxysmal deficits  where a normal gait is interrupted by rapid footsteps known as festination or sudden stops  impairing balance and causing falls                          Most people with PD experience speech problems  including stuttering  hypophonic   soft  speech  slurring  and festinating speech  rapid and poorly intelligible               Handwriting is commonly altered in Parkinson s  decreasing in size known as micrographia and becoming jagged and sharply fluctuating              Grip and dexterity are also impaired

Psychosis

     


Neuropsychiatric symptoms like anxiety  apathy  depression  hallucination  and impulse control disorders occur in up to     of those with Parkinson s  They often precede motor symptoms and vary with disease progression              Non motor fluctuations  including dysphoria  fatigue  and slowness of thought  are also common              Some neuropsychiatric symptoms are not directly caused by neurodegeneration but rather by its pharmacological management             
Cognitive impairments rank among the most prevalent and debilitating non motor symptoms              These deficits may emerge in the early stages or before diagnosis                          and their prevalence and severity tend to increase with disease progression  Ranging from mild cognitive impairment to severe Parkinson s disease dementia  these impairments include executive dysfunction  slowed cognitive processing speed  and disruptions in time perception and estimation             

Autonomic edit 
Autonomic nervous system failures  known as dysautonomia  can appear at any stage of Parkinson s                          They are among the most debilitating symptoms and greatly reduce quality of life              Although almost all individuals with PD have cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction  only some are symptomatic              Chiefly  orthostatic hypotension a sustained blood pressure drop of at least    mmHg systolic or    mmHg diastolic after standing occurs in       percent of cases  This can result in lightheadedness or fainting  subsequent falls are associated with higher morbidity and mortality                          
Other autonomic failures include gastrointestinal issues like chronic constipation  impaired stomach emptying and subsequent nausea  excessive salivation  and dysphagia  difficulty swallowing   all greatly reduce quality of life              Dysphagia  for instance  can prevent pill swallowing and lead to aspiration pneumonia              Urinary incontinence  sexual dysfunction  and thermoregulatory dysfunction including heat and cold intolerance and excessive sweating also frequently occur             

Other edit 
Sensory deficits appear in up to    percent of people with PD and are usually present at early stages              Nociceptive and neuropathic pain are common              with peripheral neuropathy affecting up to    percent of individuals              Visual impairments are also frequently observed  including deficits in visual acuity  color vision  eye coordination  and visual hallucinations              An impaired sense of smell is also prevalent              Individuals often struggle with spatial awareness  recognizing faces and emotions  and may experience challenges with reading and double vision             
Sleep disorders are highly prevalent in PD  affecting up to                  These disorders include insomnia  excessive daytime sleepiness  restless legs syndrome  REM sleep behavior disorder  RBD   and sleep disordered breathing  many of which can be worsened by medication  RBD may begin years before the initial motor symptoms  Individual presentation of symptoms varies  although most people affected by PD show an altered circadian rhythm at some point of disease progression                         
PD is also associated with a variety of skin disorders that include melanoma  seborrheic dermatitis  bullous pemphigoid  and rosacea              Seborrheic dermatitis is recognized as a premotor feature that indicates dysautonomia and demonstrates that PD can be detected not only by changes of nervous tissue  but tissue abnormalities outside the nervous system as well             

Causes edit 
Main article  Causes of Parkinson s disease
As of       the cause of neurodegeneration in Parkinson s is unclear              though it is believed to result from the interplay of genetic and environmental factors              The majority of cases are sporadic with no clearly identifiable cause  while approximately      percent are familial              Around a third of familial cases can be attributed to a single monogenic cause             
Molecularly  abnormal aggregation of alpha synuclein is considered a key contributor to PD pathogenesis              although the trigger for this aggregation is debated              Proteostasis disruption and the dysfunction of cell organelles  including endosomes  lysosomes  and mitochondria  are implicated in pathogenesis              Additionally  maladaptive immune and inflammatory responses are potential contributors              The substantial heterogeneity in PD presentation and progression suggests the involvement of multiple interacting triggers and pathogenic pathways             

Genetic edit 
Ribbon diagram of parkin
Parkinson s can be narrowly defined as a genetic disease  as rare inherited gene variants have been firmly linked to monogenic PD  and the majority of sporadic cases carry variants that increase PD risk                                      PD heritability is estimated to range from    to    percent              Around    percent of diagnosed individuals have a family history  of which      percent can be attributed to a causative risk gene mutation  Carrying one of these mutations may not lead to disease  Rates of familial PD vary by ethnicity  monogenic PD occurs in up to     of Arab Berber and     of Ashkenazi Jewish people with PD             
As of       around    genetic risk variants across    genomic loci have been identified              Notable risk variants include SNCA  which encodes alpha synuclein   LRRK   and VPS   for autosomal dominant inheritance  and PRKN  PINK   and DJ  for autosomal recessive inheritance                          LRRK  is the most common autosomal dominant variant  responsible for     percent of all PD cases and    percent of familial cases                          Parkin variants are associated with nearly half of recessive  early onset monogenic PD              Mutations in the GBA  gene  linked to Gaucher s disease  can cause monogenic PD              and are associated with cognitive decline             

Environmental edit 
See also  Environmental health and Exposome
The limited heritability of Parkinson s strongly suggests environmental factors are involved  though identifying these risk factors and establishing causality is challenging due to PD s decade long prodromal period              
Environmental toxicants such as air pollution  pesticides  and industrial solvents like trichloroethylene are strongly linked to Parkinson s              Certain pesticides like paraquat  glyphosate  and rotenone are the most established environmental toxicants for Parkinson s and are likely causal                                      PD prevalence is strongly associated with local pesticide use  and many pesticides are mitochondrial toxins              Paraquat  for instance  structurally resembles metabolized MPTP              which selectively kills dopaminergic neurons by inhibiting mitochondrial complex   and is widely used to model PD                          Pesticide exposure after diagnosis may also accelerate disease progression              Without high pesticide exposure  an estimated    percent of all PD cases would be prevented             

Hypotheses edit 
Prionic edit 
The hallmark of Parkinson s is the formation of protein aggregates  beginning with alpha synuclein fibrils and followed by Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites              The prion hypothesis suggests that alpha synuclein aggregates are pathogenic and can spread to neighboring  healthy neurons and seed new aggregates  Some propose that the heterogeneity of PD may stem from different  strains  of alpha synuclein aggregates and varying anatomical sites of origin                          Alpha synuclein propagation has been demonstrated in cell and animal models and is the most popular explanation for the progressive spread through specific neuronal systems              However  therapeutic efforts to clear alpha synuclein have failed              Additionally  postmortem brain tissue analysis shows that alpha synuclein pathology does not clearly progress through the nearest neural connections             

Braak s edit 
Main article  Parkinson s disease and gut brain axis        Braak s hypothesis
In       Heiko Braak and colleagues proposed that Parkinson s disease begins outside the brain and is triggered by a  neuroinvasion  of some unknown pathogen                          The pathogen enters through the nasal cavity and is swallowed into the digestive tract  initiating Lewy pathology in both areas                          This alpha synuclein pathology may then travel from the gut to the central nervous system through the vagus nerve              This theory could explain the presence of Lewy pathology in both the enteric nervous system and olfactory tract neurons  as well as clinical symptoms like loss of smell and gastrointestinal problems              It has also been suggested that environmental toxicants might be ingested in a similar manner to trigger PD             

Risk factors edit 
As    percent of Parkinson s cases are sporadic  the identification of the risk factors that may influence disease progression or severity is critical                          The most significant risk factor in developing PD is age  with a prevalence of   percent in those aged over    and approximately     percent in age over                 Traumatic brain injury significantly increases PD risk  especially if recent                          Dairy consumption correlates with a higher risk  possibly due to contaminants like heptachlor epoxide              Although the connection is unclear  melanoma diagnosis is  associated with an approximately    percent risk increase              There is also an association between methamphetamine use and PD risk             

Protective factors edit 
Although no compounds or activities have been mechanistically established as neuroprotective for Parkinson s                          several factors have been found to be associated with a decreased risk              Tobacco use and smoking is strongly associated with a decreased risk  reducing the chance of developing PD by up to                                          Various tobacco and smoke components have been hypothesized to be neuroprotective  including nicotine  carbon monoxide  and monoamine oxidase B inhibitors                          Consumption of caffeine as an ingredient of coffee or tea is also strongly associated with neuroprotection              Prescribed adrenergic antagonists like terazosin may reduce risk             
Although findings have varied  usage of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs  NSAIDs  like ibuprofen may be neuroprotective                          Calcium channel blockers may also have a protective effect  with a     risk reduction reported              Higher blood concentrations of urate a potent antioxidant have been proposed to be neuroprotective                          Although longitudinal studies observe a slight decrease in PD risk among those who consume alcohol possibly due to alcohol s urate increasing effect alcohol abuse may increase risk             

Pathophysiology edit 
Main article  Pathophysiology of Parkinson s disease
Parkinson s results from the death of dopamine releasing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta  seen by the loss of dark neuromelanin in the lower inset 
Parkinson s disease has two hallmark pathophysiological processes  the abnormal aggregation of alpha synuclein that leads to Lewy pathology  and the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta                          The death of these neurons reduces available dopamine in the striatum  which in turn affects circuits controlling movement in the basal ganglia              By the time motor symptoms appear        percent of all dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra have degenerated             
However  cell death and Lewy pathology are not limited to the substantia nigra              The six stage Braak system holds that alpha synuclein pathology begins in the olfactory bulb or outside the central nervous system in the enteric nervous system before ascending the brain stem               In the third Braak stage  Lewy body pathology appears in the substantia nigra               and  by the sixth step  Lewy pathology has spread to the limbic and neocortical regions               Although Braak staging offers a strong basis for PD progression  around    percent of individuals do not adhere to the predicted model               Lewy pathology is highly variable and may be entirely absent in some persons with PD                          

Alpha synuclein pathology edit 
Further information  Protein aggregation and Lewy body
Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites stained brown in PD brain tissue
Alpha synuclein is an intracellular protein typically localized to presynaptic terminals and involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking  intracellular transport  and neurotransmitter release                            When misfolded  it can aggregate into oligomers and proto fibrils that in turn lead to Lewy body formation                                         Due to their lower molecular weight  oligomers and proto fibrils may disseminate and be transmitted to other cells more rapidly              
Lewy bodies consist of a fibrillar exterior and granular core  Although alpha synuclein is the dominant proteinaceous component  the core contains mitochondrial and autophagosomal membrane components  suggesting a link with organelle dysfunction                            It is unclear whether Lewy bodies themselves contribute to or are simply the result of PD pathogenesis  alpha synuclein oligomers can independently mediate cell damage  and neurodegeneration can precede Lewy body formation              

Pathways involved in neurodegeneration edit 
See also  Neurodegeneration        Mechanisms
Three major pathways vesicular trafficking  lysosomal degradation  and mitochondrial maintenance are known to be affected by and contribute to Parkinson s pathogenesis  with all three linked to alpha synuclein               High risk gene variants also impair all three of these processes               All steps of vesicular trafficking are impaired by alpha synuclein  It blocks endoplasmic reticulum  ER  vesicles from reaching the Golgi leading to ER stress and Golgi vesicles from reaching the lysosome  preventing alpha synuclein degradation and leading to its build up               Risky gene variants  chiefly GBA  further  compromise lysosomal function               Although the mechanism is not well established  alpha synuclein can impair mitochondrial function and cause subsequent oxidative stress  Mitochondrial dysfunction can in turn lead to further alpha synuclein accumulation in a positive feedback loop               Microglial activation  possibly caused by alpha synuclein  is also strongly indicated                           

Mitochondrial dysfunction edit 
See also  Mitochondrial disease
Mitochondrial dysfunction is well established in Parkinson s               Increased oxidative stress and reduced calcium buffering may contribute to neurodegeneration               The finding that MPP  a respiratory complex I inhibitor and MPTP metabolite caused parkinsonian symptoms strongly implied that mitochondria contributed to PD pathogenesis               Additionally  faulty gene variants involved in familial Parkinson s including PINK  and Parkin prevent the elimination of dysfunctional mitochondria through mitophagy              

Neuroinflammation edit 
Some hypothesize that neurodegeneration arises from a chronic neuroinflammatory state created by local activated microglia and infiltrating immune cells              Mitochondrial dysfunction may also drive immune activation  particularly in monogenic PD              Some autoimmune disorders increase the risk of developing PD  supporting an autoimmune contribution               Additionally  influenza and herpes simplex virus infections increase the risk of PD  possibly due to a viral protein resembling alpha synuclein               Parkinson s risk is also decreased with immunosuppressants             

Diagnosis edit 
Diagnosis of Parkinson s disease is largely clinical  relying on medical history and examination of symptoms  with an emphasis on symptoms that appear in later stages                            Although early stage diagnosis is not reliable                            prodromal diagnosis may consider previous family history of Parkinson s and possible early symptoms like rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder  RBD   reduced sense of smell  and gastrointestinal issues               Isolated RBD is a particularly significant sign as     of those affected will develop some form of neurodegenerative parkinsonism               Diagnosis in later stages requires the manifestation of parkinsonism  specifically bradykinesia and rigidity or tremor  Further support includes other motor and non motor symptoms and genetic profiling               
A PD diagnosis is typically confirmed by two of the following criteria  responsiveness to levodopa  resting tremor  levodopa induced dyskinesia  or with dopamine transporter single proton emission computed tomography               If these criteria are not met  atypical parkinsonism is considered               Definitive diagnoses can only be made post mortem through pathological analysis               Misdiagnosis is common  with a reported error rate of near    percent  and diagnoses often change during follow ups                            Diagnosis can be further complicated by multiple overlapping conditions              

Imaging edit 
Reduced radioisotopic F DOPA uptake in the striatum of a Parkinson s patient  captured through PET
Diagnosis can be aided by molecular imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging  MRI   positron emission tomography  PET   and single photon emission computed tomography  SPECT                             As both conventional MRI and computed tomography  CT  scans are usually normal in early PD  they can be used to exclude other pathologies that cause parkinsonism                            Diffusion MRI can differentiate PD from multiple systems atrophy  MSA                Emerging MRI techniques of at least     T field strength including neuromelanin MRI   H MRSI  and resting state fMRI may detect abnormalities in the substantia nigra  nigrostriatal pathway  and elsewhere              
Unlike MRI  PET and SPECT use radioisotopes for imaging               Both techniques can aid diagnosis by characterizing PD associated alterations in the metabolism and transport of dopamine in the basal ganglia                            Largely used outside the United States  iodine     meta iodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy can assess heart muscle denervation to support a PD diagnosis              

Differential diagnosis edit 
See also  Parkinson plus syndrome
Differential diagnosis of Parkinson s is among the most difficult in neurology               Differentiating early PD from atypical parkinsonian disorders is a major difficulty  In their initial stages  PD can be difficult to distinguish from the atypical neurodegenerative parkinsonisms  including MSA  dementia with Lewy bodies  and the tauopathies progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration                            Other conditions that may present similarly to PD include vascular parkinsonism  Alzheimer s disease  and frontotemporal dementia                           
The International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society has proposed a set of criteria that  unlike the standard Queen s Square Brain Bank Criteria  includes non exclusionary  red flag  clinical features that may not suggest Parkinson s               A large number of  red flags  have been proposed and adopted for various conditions that might mimic the symptoms of PD               Diagnostic tests  including gene sequencing  molecular imaging techniques  and assessment of smell may also distinguish PD               MRI is particularly powerful due to several unique features for atypical parkinsonisms

Management edit 
Main article  Management of Parkinson s disease
As of       no disease modifying therapies exist that reverse or slow neurodegeneration                          Management typically combines lifestyle modifications with physical therapy               Current pharmacological interventions purely target symptoms  by either increasing endogenous dopamine levels or directly mimicking dopamine s effect on the patient s brain                            These include dopamine agonists  MAO B inhibitors  and levodopa  the most widely used and effective drug                            The optimal time to initiate pharmacological treatment is debated               but initial dopamine agonist and MAO B inhibitor treatment and later levodopa therapy is common               Invasive procedures such as deep brain stimulation may be used when medication is ineffective                           

Medications edit 
Levodopa edit 
LCE  levodopa carbidopa entacapone  pills contain a cocktail of the dopamine precursor levadopa and COMT and AAAD inhibitors 
Levodopa is the most widely used and the most effective therapy the gold standard for Parkinson s treatment               The compound occurs naturally and is the immediate precursor for dopamine synthesis in the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra               Levodopa administration reduces the dopamine deficienciency in parkinsonism                            
Despite its efficacy  levodopa poses several challenges and its administration has been called the  pharmacologist s nightmare                             Its metabolism outside the brain by aromatic L amino acid decarboxylase  AAAD  and catechol O methyltransferase  COMT  can cause nausea and vomiting  inhibitors like carbidopa  entacapone  and benserazide are usually taken with levodopa to mitigate these effects                                note        Long term levodopa use may also induce dyskinesia and motor fluctuations  Although this often causes levodopa use to be delayed to later stages  earlier administration leads to improved motor function and quality of life              

Dopamine agonists edit 
Dopamine agonists are an alternative or complement for levodopa therapy  They activate dopamine receptors in the striatum  with reduced risk of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia  and are efficacious in both early and late stage Parkinson s               The agonist apomorphine is often used for drug resistant OFF time in later stage PD                            After five years of use  impulse control disorders may occur in over    percent of those taking dopamine agonists               A problematic  narcotic like withdrawal effect may occur when agonist use is reduced or stopped                            Compared to levodopa  dopamine agonists are more likely to cause fatigue  daytime sleepiness  and hallucinations              

MAO B inhibitors edit 
MAO B inhibitors such as safinamide  selegiline and rasagiline increase the amount of dopamine in the basal ganglia by inhibiting the activity of monoamine oxidase B  an enzyme that breaks down dopamine               These compounds mildly alleviate motor symptoms when used as monotherapy but can also be used with levodopa and can be used at any disease stage               Common side effects are nausea  dizziness  insomnia  sleepiness  and orthostatic hypotension               MAO Bs are known to increase serotonin and cause a potentially dangerous condition known as serotonin syndrome              

Other drugs edit 
Treatments for non motor symptoms of PD have not been well studied and many medications are used off label              A diverse range of symptoms beyond those related to motor function can be treated pharmaceutically               Examples include cholinesterase inhibitors for cognitive impairment and modafinil for excessive daytime sleepiness               Fludrocortisone  midodrine and droxidopa are commonly used off label for orthostatic hypotension related to autonomic dysfunction  Sublingual atropine or botulinum toxin injections may be used off label for drooling  SSRIs and SNRIs are often used for depression related to PD  but there is a risk of serotonin syndrome with the SSRI or SNRI antidepressants              Doxepin and rasagline may reduce physical fatigue in PD              

Invasive interventions edit 
Placement of an electrode into the brain for deep brain stimulation
Surgery for Parkinson s first appeared in the   th century and by the     s had evolved into ablative brain surgery that lesioned the basal ganglia  thalamus or globus pallidus  a pallidotomy                The discovery of levadopa for PD treatment caused ablative therapies to largely disappear                            Ablative surgeries experienced a resurgence in the     s but were quickly superseded by newly developed deep brain stimulation  DBS                Although gamma knife  and high intensity focused ultrasound surgeries have been developed for pallidotomies and thalamotomies  their use is rare as of                                     failed verification     
Deep brain stimulation  DBS  involves the implantation of electrodes called neurostimulators  which sends electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain               DBS for the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus interna has high efficacy for up to   years  but longterm efficacy is unclear and likely decreases with time               DBS typically targets rigidity and tremor               and is recommended for PD patients who are intolerant or do not respond to medication               Cognitive impairment is the most common exclusion criteria              

Rehabilitation edit 
Further information  Management of Parkinson s disease        Rehabilitation
Although pharmacological therapies can improve symptoms  autonomy and ability to perform everyday tasks is still reduced by PD  Rehabilitation is often useful  but the scientific support for any single rehabilitation treatment is limited              
Exercise programs are often recommended  with preliminary evidence of efficacy                                         Regular physical exercise with or without physical therapy can be beneficial to maintain and improve mobility  flexibility  strength  gait speed  and quality of life               Aerobic  mind body  and resistance training may be beneficial in alleviating PD associated depression and anxiety                            Strength training may increase manual dexterity and strength  facilitating daily tasks that require grasping objects               Aerobic exercise  resistance training  balance and task specific training have been found to improve strength  VO  Max and balance  While flexibility training is commonly used  but it has a lower strength of recommendation compared to aerobic and resistance training                

Exercise  like the tricycle ride of this PD patient  is often recommended 
In improving flexibility and range of motion for people experiencing rigidity  generalized relaxation techniques such as gentle rocking have been found to decrease excessive muscle tension  Other effective techniques to promote relaxation include slow rotational movements of the extremities and trunk  rhythmic initiation  diaphragmatic breathing  and meditation               Deep diaphragmatic breathing may also improve chest wall mobility and vital capacity decreased by the stooped posture and respiratory dysfunctions of advanced Parkinson s               Rehabilitation techniques targeting gait and the challenges posed by bradykinesia  shuffling  and decreased arm swing include pole walking  treadmill walking  and marching exercises               Long term physiotherapy  greater than six months  reduces the need for antiparkinsonian medication  multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs combined with physiotherapy can result in reduction in the levodopa equivalent dose              
Speech therapies such as the Lee Silverman voice treatment may reduce the effect of speech disorders associated with PD               Occupational therapy is a rehabilitation strategy that can improve quality of life by enabling people with PD to find engaging activities and communal roles  adapt to their living environment  and improve domestic and work abilities              

Diet edit 
Parkinson s poses digestive problems like constipation and prolonged emptying of stomach contents  and a balanced diet with periodical nutritional assessments is recommended to avoid weight loss or gain and minimize the consequences of gastrointestinal dysfunction  In particular  a Mediterranean diet is advised and may slow disease progression                            As it can compete for uptake with amino acids derived from protein  levodopa should be taken    minutes before meals to minimize such competition  Low protein diets may also be needed by later stages               As the disease advances  swallowing difficulties often arise  Using thickening agents for liquid intake and an upright posture when eating may be useful  both measures reduce the risk of choking  Gastrostomy can be used to deliver food directly into the stomach                            Increased water and fiber intake is used to treat constipation              

Palliative care edit 
As Parkinson s is incurable  palliative care aims to improve the quality of life for both the patient and family by alleviating the symptoms and stress associated with illness                                         Early integration of palliative care into the disease course is recommended  rather than delaying until later stages               Palliative care specialists can help with physical symptoms  emotional factors such as loss of function and jobs  depression  fear  as well as existential concerns               Palliative care team members also help guide difficult decisions caused by disease progression  such as wishes for a feeding tube  noninvasive ventilator or tracheostomy  use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation  and entering hospice care

As Parkinson s is a heterogeneous condition with multiple etiologies  prognostication can be difficult and prognoses can be highly variable                            On average  life expectancy is reduced in those with Parkinson s  with younger age of onset resulting in greater life expectancy decreases               Although PD subtype categorization is controversial  the      Parkinson s Progression Markers Initiative study identified three broad scorable subtypes of increasing severity and more rapid progression  mild motor predominant  intermediate  and diffuse malignant  Mean years of survival post diagnosis were             and                   
Around     of individuals with Parkinson s develop dementia  which is    times more likely to occur in the elderly with severe PD               Dementia is less likely to arise in tremor dominant PD               Parkinson s disease dementia is associated with a reduced quality of life in people with PD and their caregivers  increased mortality  and a higher probability of needing nursing home care              
The incidence rate of falls is approximately    to      thrice that of healthy individuals  and half of such falls result in serious secondary injuries  Falls increase morbidity and mortality               Around     of those with PD develop hypokinetic dysarthria  which worsens with disease progression and can hinder communication               Over     develop dysphagia  consequent inhalation of gastric and oropharyngeal secretions can lead to aspiration pneumonia              

Epidemiology edit 
Agricultural areas are associated with higher Parkinson s prevalence  possibly due to exposure to pesticides and industrial waste 
As of       Parkinson s is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and the fastest growing in total cases                            As of       global prevalence was estimated to be      per                    Although it is around     more common in men               age is the dominant predeterminant of Parkinson s               Consequently  as global life expectancy has increased  Parkinson s disease prevalence has also risen  with an estimated increase in cases by     from      to                    The number is predicted to rise to over    million by                    
This increase may be due to a number of global factors  including prolonged life expectancy  increased industrialisation  and decreased smoking               Although genetics is the sole factor in a minority of cases  most cases of Parkinson s are likely a result of gene environment interactions  concordance studies with twins have found Parkinson s heritability to be just                   The influence of multiple genetic and environmental factors complicates epidemiological efforts              
Relative to Europe and North America  disease prevalence is lower in Africa but similar in Latin America               Although China is predicted to have nearly half of the global Parkinson s population by                    estimates of prevalence in Asia vary               Potential explanations for these geographic differences include genetic variation  environmental factors  health care access  and life expectancy               Although PD incidence and prevalence may vary by race and ethnicity  significant disparities in care  diagnosis  and study participation limit generalizability and lead to conflicting results                            Within the United States  high rates of PD have been identified in the Midwest  the South  and agricultural regions of other states  collectively termed the  PD belt                The association between rural residence and Parkinson s has been hypothesized to be caused by environmental factors like herbicides  pesticides  and industrial waste              

History edit 
Main article  History of Parkinson s disease
In       Jean Martin Charcot  left  named Parkinson s disease after the first person to comprehensively describe it  James Parkinson  Patient Pierre D   right  served as the model for William Gowers  illustration of the disease              
In       English physician James Parkinson published the first full medical description of the disease as a neurological syndrome in his monograph An Essay on the Shaking Palsy                            He presented six clinical cases  including three he had observed on the streets near Hoxton Square in London               Parkinson described three cardinal symptoms  tremor  postural instability and  paralysis   undistinguished from rigidity or bradykinesia   and speculated that the disease was caused by trauma to the spinal cord                           
There was little discussion or investigation of the  shaking palsy  until       when Frenchman Jean Martin Charcot regarded as the father of neurology began expanding Parkinson s description  adding bradykinesia as one of the four cardinal symptoms                                         In       Charcot renamed the disease after Parkinson  as the tremor suggested by  shaking palsy  is not present in all                            Subsequent neurologists who made early advances to the understanding of Parkinson s include Armand Trousseau  William Gowers  Samuel Kinnier Wilson  and Wilhelm Erb              
Although Parkinson is typically credited with the first detailed description of PD  many previous texts reference some of the disease s clinical signs               In his essay  Parkinson himself acknowledged partial descriptions by Galen  William Cullen  Johann Juncker  and others               Possible earlier but incomplete descriptions include a Nineteenth Dynasty Egyptian papyrus  the ayurvedic text Charaka Samhita  Ecclesiastes       and a discussion of tremors by Leonardo da Vinci                            Multiple traditional Chinese medicine texts may include references to PD  including a discussion in the Yellow Emperor s Internal Classic  c                BC  of a disease with symptoms of tremor  stiffness  staring  and stooped posture               In       a systematic description of PD was found in the Hungarian medical text Pax corporis written by Ferenc P pai P riz in       some     years before Parkinson  Although P riz correctly described all four cardinal signs  it was only published in Hungarian and was not widely distributed                           
In       Frederic Lewy described microscopic particles in affected brains  later named Lewy bodies               In       Konstantin Tretiakoff reported that the substantia nigra was the main brain structure affected  corroborated by Rolf Hassler in                    The underlying changes in dopamine signaling were identified in the     s  largely by Arvid Carlsson and Oleh Hornykiewicz               In       Polymeropoulos and colleagues at the NIH discovered the first gene for PD               SNCA  which encodes  alpha synuclein  Alpha synuclein was in turn found to be the main component of Lewy bodies by Spillantini  Trojanowski  Goedert  and others               Anticholinergics and surgery were the only treatments until the use of levodopa                            which  although first synthesized by Casimir Funk in                    did not enter clinical use until                    By the late     s  deep brain stimulation introduced by Alim Louis Benabid and colleagues at Grenoble  France  emerged as an additional treatment              

Society and culture edit 
Social impact edit 
The reduced ability to facially express emotions as depicted here by French anatomist Paul Richer in      can harm social well being 
For some people with PD  masked facial expressions and difficulty moderating facial expressions of emotion or recognizing other people s facial expressions can impact social well being               As the condition progresses  tremor  other motor symptoms  difficulty communicating  or mobility issues may interfere with social engagement  causing individuals with PD to feel isolated               Public perception and awareness of PD symptoms such as shaking  hallucinating  slurring speech  and being off balance is lacking in some countries and can lead to stigma              

Cost edit 
The economic cost of Parkinson s to both individuals and society is high               Globally  most government health insurance plans do not cover Parkinson s therapies  requiring expenses to be paid out of pocket               Indirect costs include lifetime earnings losses due to premature death  productivity losses  and caregiver burdens               The duration and progressive nature of PD can place a heavy burden on caregivers               family members like spouses dedicate around    hours per week to care               
In       the total economic burden of Parkinson s across Europe  including indirect and direct medical costs  was estimated to be       billion  US       billion  in                    The total burden in the United States was estimated to be            billion in       and is project to surpass          billion by                    As of       no rigorous economic surveys had been performed for low or middle income nations               Preventative care has been identified as crucial to prevent the rapidly increasing incidence of Parkinson s from overwhelming national health systems              

Advocacy edit 
The birthday of James Parkinson     April  has been designated as World Parkinson s Day               A red tulip was chosen by international organizations as the symbol of the disease in       it represents the  James Parkinson  tulip cultivar  registered in      by a Dutch horticulturalist              
Advocacy organizations include the National Parkinson Foundation  which has provided more than           million in care  research  and support services since                    Parkinson s Disease Foundation  which has distributed more than           million for research and nearly          million for education and advocacy programs since its founding in      by William Black                            the American Parkinson Disease Association  founded in                    and the European Parkinson s Disease Association  founded in                   

Notable cases edit 
Main article  List of people diagnosed with Parkinson s disease
Actor Michael J  Fox and boxer Muhammad Ali  center  are pictured in      speaking before the US Senate to urge increased funding for Parkinson s research 
In the   st century  the diagnosis of Parkinson s among notable figures has increased the public s understanding of the disorder               Actor Michael J  Fox was diagnosed with PD at    years old               and has used his diagnosis to increase awareness of the disease               To illustrate the effects of the disease  Fox has appeared without medication in television roles and before the United States Congress without medication               The Michael J  Fox Foundation  which he founded in       has raised over    billion for Parkinson s research              
Boxer Muhammad Ali showed signs of PD when he was     but was undiagnosed until he was     he has been called the  world s most famous Parkinson s patient  
              Whether he had PD or parkinsonism related to boxing is unresolved               Cyclist and Olympic medalist Davis Phinney  diagnosed with Parkinson s at     started the Davis Phinney Foundation in      to support PD research                           
Adolf Hitler is believed to have had Parkinson s  and the condition may have influenced his decision making                                        

Clinical research edit 
Main article  Research in Parkinson s disease
Astronaut Alexander Gerst conducts Parkinson s research aboard the International Space Station in     
As of       no disease modifying therapies exist that reverse or slow the progression of Parkinson s                          Active research directions include the search for new animal models of the disease and development and trial of gene therapy  stem cell transplants  and neuroprotective agents               Improved treatments will likely combine therapeutic strategies to manage symptoms and enhance outcomes               Reliable biomarkers are needed for early diagnosis  and research criteria for their identification have been established                           

Neuroprotective treatments edit 
See also  Anti   synuclein drug
Anti alpha synuclein drugs that prevent alpha synuclein oligomerization and aggregation or promote their clearance are under active investigation  and potential therapeutic strategies include small molecules and immunotherapies like vaccines and monoclonal antibodies                                         While immunotherapies show promise  their effiacy is often inconsistent               Anti inflammatory drugs that target NLRP  and the JAK STAT signaling pathway offer another potential therapeutic approach              
As the gut microbiome in PD is often disrupted and produces toxic compounds  fecal microbiota transplants might restore a healthy microbiome and alleviate various motor and non motor symptoms               Neurotrophic factors peptides that enhance the growth  maturation  and survival of neurons show modest results but require invasive surgical administration  Viral vectors may represent a more feasible delivery platform               Calcium channel blockers may restore the calcium imbalance present in Parkinson s  and are being investigated as a neuroprotective treatment               Other therapies  like deferiprone  may reduce the abnormal accumulation of iron in PD              

Cell based therapies edit 
Main article  Cell based therapies for Parkinson s disease
Researchers at Argonne National Laboratory examine induced pluripotent stem cells  iPSCs  for use in Parkinson s and other diseases  the action potentials of one such iPSC differentiated into a dopaminergic neuron are visible at right 
In contrast to other neurodegenerative disorders  many Parkinson s symptoms can be attributed to the loss of a single cell type  Consequently  dopaminergic neuron regeneration is a promising therapeutic approach               Although most initial research sought to generate dopaminergic neuron precursor cells from fetal brain tissue               pluripotent stem cells particularly induced pluripotent stem cells  iPSCs  have become an increasingly popular tissue source                           
Both fetal and iPSC derived DA neurons have been transplanted into patients in clinical trials                            Although some individuals see improvement  the results are highly variable  Adverse effects  such as dyskinesia arising from excess dopamine release by the transplanted tissues  have also been observed                           

Gene therapy edit 
Main article  Gene therapy in Parkinson s disease
Gene therapy for Parkinson s seeks to restore the healthy function of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra by delivering genetic material typically through a viral vector to these diseased cells                            This material may deilver a functional  wildtype version of a gene  or knockdown a pathological variants               Experimental gene therapies for PD have aimed to increase the expression of growth factors or enzymes involved in dopamine synthesis  like tyrosine hydroxylase               The one time delivery of genes circumvents the recurrent invasive administration required to administer some peptides and proteins to the brain               MicroRNAs are an emerging PD gene therapy platform that may serve as an alternative to viral vectors
