HAL       or simply HAL or Hal  is a fictional artificial intelligence character and the main antagonist in the Space Odyssey series  First appearing in the      film       A Space Odyssey  HAL  Heuristically Programmed Algorithmic Computer  is a sentient artificial general intelligence computer that controls the systems of the Discovery One spacecraft and interacts with the ship s astronaut crew  While part of HAL s hardware is shown toward the end of the film  he is mostly depicted as a camera lens containing a red and yellow dot  with such units located throughout the ship  HAL      is voiced by Douglas Rain in the two feature film adaptations of the Space Odyssey series  HAL speaks in a soft  calm voice and a conversational manner  and engages convivially with crewmen David Bowman and Frank Poole until he begins to malfunction 
In the film  HAL became operational on    January       at the HAL Laboratories in Urbana  Illinois  as production number    The activation year was      in earlier screenplays and changed to      in Clarke s novel written and released in conjunction with the movie                        In addition to maintaining the Discovery One spacecraft systems during the interplanetary mission to Jupiter  or Saturn in the novel   HAL demonstrates a capacity for speech synthesis  speech recognition  facial recognition  natural language processing  lip reading  art appreciation  interpreting emotional behaviours  automated reasoning  spacecraft piloting  and computer chess 


Appearances edit 
      A Space Odyssey  film novel  edit 
HAL became operational in Urbana  Illinois  at the HAL Plant  the University of Illinois s Coordinated Science Laboratory  where the ILLIAC computers were built   The film says this occurred in       while the book gives      as HAL s birth year            
In       A Space Odyssey         HAL is initially considered a dependable member of the crew  maintaining ship functions and engaging genially with his human crew mates on an equal footing  As a recreational activity  Frank Poole plays chess against HAL  In the film  the artificial intelligence is shown to triumph easily  However  as time progresses  HAL begins to malfunction in subtle ways and  as a result  the decision is made to shut down HAL in order to prevent more serious malfunctions  The sequence of events and manner in which HAL is shut down differs between the novel and film versions of the story  In the aforementioned game of chess HAL makes minor and undetected mistakes in his analysis  a possible foreshadowing to HAL s malfunctioning 
In the film  astronauts David Bowman and Frank Poole consider disconnecting HAL s cognitive circuits when he appears to be mistaken in reporting the presence of a fault in the spacecraft s communications antenna  They attempt to conceal what they are saying  but are unaware that HAL can read their lips  Faced with the prospect of disconnection  HAL attempts to kill the astronauts in order to protect and continue the mission  HAL uses one of the Discovery     s EVA pods to kill Poole while he is repairing the ship  When Bowman  without a space helmet  uses another pod to attempt to rescue Poole  HAL locks him out of the ship  then disconnects the life support systems of the other hibernating crew members  After HAL tells him  This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it   Bowman circumvents HAL s control  entering the ship by manually opening an emergency airlock with his service pod s clamps  detaching the pod door via its explosive bolts  Bowman jumps across empty space  reenters Discovery  and quickly re pressurizes the airlock 
While HAL s motivations are ambiguous in the film  the novel explains that the computer is unable to resolve a conflict between his general mission to relay information accurately  and orders specific to the mission requiring that he withhold from Bowman and Poole the true purpose of the mission  With the crew dead  HAL reasons  he would not need to lie to them 
In the novel  the orders to disconnect HAL come from Dave and Frank s superiors on Earth  After Frank is killed while attempting to repair the communications antenna he is pulled away into deep space using the safety tether which is still attached to both the pod and Frank Poole s spacesuit  Dave begins to revive his hibernating crew mates  but is foiled when HAL vents the ship s atmosphere into the vacuum of space  killing the awakening crew members and almost killing Bowman  who is only narrowly saved when he finds his way to an emergency chamber which has its own oxygen supply and a spare space suit inside 
In both versions  Bowman then proceeds to shut down the machine  In the film  HAL s central core is depicted as a crawlspace full of brightly lit computer modules mounted in arrays from which they can be inserted or removed  Bowman shuts down HAL by removing modules from service one by one  as he does so  HAL s consciousness degrades  HAL finally reverts to material that was programmed into him early in his memory  including announcing the date he became operational as    January       in the novel         When HAL s logic is completely gone  he begins singing the song  Daisy Bell  as he gradually deactivates  in actuality  the first song sung by a computer  which Clarke had earlier observed at a text to speech demonstration                                    HAL s final act of any significance is to prematurely play a prerecorded message from Mission Control which reveals the true reasons for the mission to Jupiter 

      Odyssey Two  novel  and       The Year We Make Contact  film  edit 
In the      novel       Odyssey Two written by Clarke  HAL is restarted by his creator  Dr  Chandra  who arrives on the Soviet spaceship Leonov 
Prior to leaving Earth  Dr  Chandra has also had a discussion with HAL s twin  SAL       Like HAL  SAL was created by Dr  Chandra  Whereas HAL was characterized as being  male   SAL is characterized as being  female   voiced by Candice Bergen in the film  and is represented by a blue camera eye instead of a red one 
Dr  Chandra discovers that HAL s crisis was caused by a programming contradiction  he was constructed for  the accurate processing of information without distortion or concealment   yet his orders  directly from Dr  Heywood Floyd at the National Council on Astronautics  required him to keep the discovery of the Monolith TMA   a secret for reasons of national security  This contradiction created a  Hofstadter Moebius loop   reducing HAL to paranoia  Therefore  HAL made the decision to kill the crew  thereby allowing him to obey both his hardwired instructions to report data truthfully and in full  and his orders to keep the monolith a secret  In essence  if the crew were dead  he would no longer have to keep the information secret 
The alien intelligence initiates a terraforming scheme  placing the Leonov  and everybody in it  in danger  Its human crew devises an escape plan which unfortunately requires leaving the Discovery and HAL behind to be destroyed  Dr  Chandra explains the danger  and HAL willingly sacrifices himself so that the astronauts may escape safely  In the moment of his destruction the monolith makers transform HAL into a non corporeal being so that David Bowman s avatar may have a companion 
The details in the novel and the      film       The Year We Make Contact are nominally the same  with a few exceptions  First  in contradiction to the book  and events described in both book and film versions of       A Space Odyssey   Heywood Floyd is absolved of responsibility for HAL s condition  it is asserted that the decision to program HAL with information concerning TMA   came directly from the White House   In the film  HAL functions normally after being reactivated  while in the book it is revealed that his mind was damaged during the shutdown  forcing him to begin communication through screen text  Also  in the film the Leonov crew initially lies to HAL about the dangers that he faced  suspecting that if he knew he would be destroyed he would not initiate the engine burn necessary to get the Leonov back home   whereas in the novel he is told at the outset  However  in both cases the suspense comes from the question of what HAL will do when he knows that he may be destroyed by his actions 
In the novel  the basic reboot sequence initiated by Dr  Chandra is quite long  while the movie uses a shorter sequence voiced from HAL as   HELLO DOCTOR NAME CONTINUE YESTERDAY TOMORROW  
While Curnow tells Floyd that Dr  Chandra has begun designing HAL        it has not been mentioned in subsequent novels 

      Odyssey Three and       The Final Odyssey edit 
In Clarke s      novel       Odyssey Three  Heywood Floyd is surprised to encounter HAL  now stored alongside Dave Bowman in the Europa monolith 
In Clarke s      novel       The Final Odyssey  Frank Poole is introduced to the merged form of Dave Bowman and HAL  the two merging into one entity called  Halman  after Bowman rescued HAL from the dying Discovery One spaceship toward the end of       Odyssey Two 

Concept and creation edit

Clarke noted that the first film was criticized for having HAL as its only interesting character  and that a great deal of the establishing story on Earth was cut from the film  and even from Clarke s novel              Clarke stated that he had considered Autonomous Mobile Explorer   as a name for the computer  then decided on Socrates when writing early drafts  switching in later drafts to Athena  a computer with a female personality  before settling on HAL                  The Socrates name was later used in Clarke and Stephen Baxter s A Time Odyssey novel series 
The earliest draft depicted Socrates as a roughly humanoid robot  and is introduced as overseeing Project Morpheus  which studied prolonged hibernation in preparation for long term space flight   As a demonstration to Senator Floyd  Socrates  designer  Dr  Bruno Forster  asks Socrates to turn off the oxygen to hibernating subjects Kaminski and Whitehead  which Socrates refuses  citing Asimov s First Law of Robotics            
In a later version  in which Bowman and Whitehead are the non hibernating crew of Discovery  Whitehead dies outside the spacecraft after his pod collides with the main antenna  tearing it free  This triggers the need for Bowman to revive Poole  but the revival does not go according to plan  and after briefly awakening  Poole dies  The computer  named Athena in this draft  announces  All systems of Poole now No Go  It will be necessary to replace him with a spare unit              After this  Bowman decides to go out in a pod and retrieve the antenna  which is moving away from the ship  Athena refuses to allow him to leave the ship  citing  Directive     which prevents it from being left unattended  forcing him to make program modifications during which time the antenna drifts further             
During rehearsals Kubrick asked Stefanie Powers to supply the voice of HAL      while searching for a suitably androgynous voice so the actors had something to react to  On the set  British actor Nigel Davenport played HAL                          When it came to dubbing HAL in post production  Kubrick had originally cast Martin Balsam  but as he felt Balsam  just sounded a little bit too colloquially American   he was replaced with Douglas Rain  who  had the kind of bland mid Atlantic accent we felt was right for the part               Rain was only handed HAL s lines instead of the full script  and recorded them across a day and a half             
HAL s point of view shots were created with a Cinerama Fairchild Curtis wide angle lens with a      angle of view  This lens is about   inches          cm  in diameter  while HAL s on set prop eye lens is about   inches           cm  in diameter  Stanley Kubrick chose to use the large Fairchild Curtis lens to shoot the HAL      POV shots because he needed a wide angle fisheye lens that would fit onto his shooting camera  and this was the only such lens at the time  The Fairchild Curtis lens has a focal length of         mm           in  with a maximum aperture of f     and a weight of approximately         lb          kg   it was originally designed by Felix Bednarz             with a maximum aperture of f     for the first Cinerama     film  Journey to the Stars  shown at the      Seattle World s Fair              Bednarz adapted the lens design from an earlier lens he had designed for military training to simulate human peripheral vision coverage              The lens was later recomputed for the second Cinerama     film To the Moon and Beyond  which had a slightly different film format  To the Moon and Beyond was produced by Graphic Films and shown at the           New York World s Fair              where Kubrick watched it  afterwards  he was so impressed that he hired the same creative team from Graphic Films  consisting of Douglas Trumbull  Lester Novros  and Con Pederson  to work on                              
A HAL      face plate  without lens  not the same as the hero face plates seen in the film   was discovered in a junk shop in Paddington  London  in the early     s by Chris Randall              This was found along with the key to HAL s Brain Room  Both items were purchased for ten shillings                                  Research revealed that the original lens was a Fisheye Nikkor        mm f                The collection was sold at a Christie s auction in      for                     to film director Peter Jackson             

Origin of name edit 
A loose replica of HAL      on exhibit at the Carnegie Science Center
HAL s name  according to Clarke  is derived from Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic computer                                    After the film was released  fans noticed HAL was a one letter shift from the name IBM and there has been much speculation since then that this was a dig at the large computer company                          something that both Clarke             and Kubrick denied             Clarke addressed the issue in The Lost Worlds of                 

    about once a week some character spots the fact that HAL is one letter ahead of IBM  and promptly assumes that Stanley and I were taking a crack at the estimable institution     As it happened  IBM had given us a good deal of help  so we were quite embarrassed by this  and would have changed the name had we spotted the coincidence 
IBM was consulted during the making of the film and its logo can be seen on props in the film  including the Pan Am Clipper s cockpit instrument panel and on the lower arm keypad on Poole s space suit  During production it was brought to IBM s attention that the film s plot included a homicidal computer  but the company approved association with the film if it was clear any  equipment failure  was not related to IBM products                                     
In the movie HAL identifies himself as being activated at a  HAL  plant in Urbana  Illinois                          An actual company called HAL Communications Corporation was founded in Champaign in                  and relocated to Urbana a year later when it outgrew its original facility                           
The former president of HAL Communications  Bill Henry  has stated that any reference to the real company is a coincidence   There was not and never has been any connection to  Hal   Arthur Clarke s intelligent computer in the screen play          later published as a book  We were very surprised when the movie hit the Coed Theatre on campus and discovered that the movie s computer had our name  We never had any problems with that similarity    Hal  for the movie and  HAL   all caps  for our small company  But  from time to time  we did have issues with others trying to use  HAL   That resulted in us paying lawyers  The offenders folded or eventually went out of business              
Henry also explains the possible source of the false claim that the name HAL was chosen by the      authors to scoop IBM in phone books and industry directories   The name  HAL  was chosen  in       by the first HAL Devices partner  George Perrine  George said he picked the name because it is  one letter ahead of IBM   Turned out to be a good choice and easy to remember  It also does not seem to have any  nasty translations  into any other language              

Technology edit 
Main article  Technologies in       A Space Odyssey
The scene in which HAL s consciousness degrades was inspired by Clarke s memory of a speech synthesis demonstration by physicist John Larry Kelly  Jr   who used an IBM     computer to synthesize speech  Kelly s voice recorder synthesizer vocoder recreated the song  Daisy Bell   with musical accompaniment from Max Mathews            
HAL s capabilities  like all the technology in       were based on the speculation of respected scientists  Marvin Minsky  director of the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory  CSAIL  and one of the most influential researchers in the field  was an adviser on the film set              In the mid     s  many computer scientists in the field of artificial intelligence were optimistic that machines with HAL s capabilities would exist within a few decades  For example  AI pioneer Herbert A  Simon at Carnegie Mellon University had predicted in      that  machines will be capable  within twenty years  of doing any work a man can do              

Cultural impact edit 
HAL is listed as the   th greatest film villain in the AFI s     Years       Heroes  amp  Villains             
The     th of the asteroids in the asteroid belt       Hal  discovered on   May       by E  Bowell at Anderson Mesa Station  is named after HAL                              
Anthony Hopkins based his Academy Award winning performance as Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs in part upon HAL                               Michael Fassbender has also cited HAL as an inspiration for his performances as android characters such as David  Prometheus  and Walter  Alien  Covenant       citation needed     
The      educational game Where in Space Is Carmen Sandiego  features a digital assistant named the VAL       a homage to HAL                  
Apple Inc  s      website advertisement  It was a bug  Dave  was made by meticulously recreating the appearance of HAL      from the movie              Launched during the era of concerns over Y K bugs  the ad implied that HAL s behavior was caused by a Y K bug  before driving home the point that  only Macintosh was designed to function perfectly              
In       HAL      was one of the first robots to be inducted into the Robot Hall of Fame in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania                          There is a loose physical replica of the main HAL interface at the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh             
In the      Pixar animated film WALL E  the robotic antagonist AUTO was designed as a conscious homage to HAL
