							Amid the unprecedented escalation in the Gaza Strip  Qatar and Egypt have reaffirmed their joint mediation efforts between Hamas and Israel  seeking to end the war and address the deepening humanitarian crisis 
In a joint statement issued Wednesday  the two countries emphasized that their mediation efforts are  ongoing  consistent  and rooted in a unified vision  aimed at halting the unprecedented humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip  The statement underscored the goal of achieving a comprehensive ceasefire and warned against attempts to undermine the mediation process through misinformation or political manipulation 
 Attempts to sow division among brothers through misinformation  distortion  or media escalation will not succeed   the statement read  reaffirming the countries  full coordination with the United States toward securing a lasting agreement that safeguards civilians and ends the bloodshed 
Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed Al Ansari confirmed that mediation efforts continue despite the escalating complexity of the situation  He pushed back against criticism from within Israel  labelling it a product of  internal political polarization   and reiterated that Qatar is internationally recognized as an impartial mediator 
Al Ansari pointed to contradictions in Israeli leadership  noting the divergence between President Isaac Herzog s praise of Qatar s mediation and more hostile rhetoric from the Israeli Foreign Ministry   We are fully aware of which parties are obstructing the path to an agreement   he said  adding that several opportunities to reach a ceasefire have been deliberately thwarted 
Meanwhile  the conflict on the ground intensified  On Wednesday  Hamas accused Israeli forces of committing a  new barbaric massacre  after an airstrike hit a crowded restaurant in western Gaza City  killing and injuring dozens  including women and children  The group condemned the attack as part of a broader campaign of  systematic genocide  that includes targeting civilian shelters and food distribution centres 
Calling for urgent international intervention  Hamas accused the global community of a  suspicious silence  and urged Arab and Islamic nations to escalate support for Palestinians through mass mobilization and diplomatic pressure 
In a related development     international humanitarian and aid organizations including Oxfam  Save the Children  and the Norwegian Refugee Council issued a joint statement condemning new Israeli restrictions on NGO registration and operations  They warned the measures jeopardize humanitarian access and violate international law 
Additionally  six European nations including Spain  Ireland  and Norway voiced strong opposition to Israel s plans to expand its military control in Gaza  warning that any demographic or territorial changes would breach international law  Spain called for immediate action at the United Nations to halt the war 
According to the Gaza Ministry of Health     Palestinians were killed and     injured in the past    hours  Since fighting resumed on    March  the death toll has reached        with       wounded  Since the war began in October       a staggering        people have been killed and         injured marking one of the deadliest chapters in the Israeli Palestinian conflict 
Separately  Hamas        armed wing  the Al Qassam Brigades  released footage showing what it claimed was a complex ambush against Israeli soldiers and military vehicles near Al Zahraa Mosque in the Al Jeneina neighborhood of Gaza  The operation is reportedly part of a broader campaign dubbed  Gates of Hell
