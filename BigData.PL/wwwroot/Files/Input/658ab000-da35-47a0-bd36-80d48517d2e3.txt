							U S  use democracy institute as reason for cutting aid
CAIRO  On June    the International Republican Institute  IRI  was asked to stop all functions by the government until it had received a permit to conduct their activities in the country  The IRI has closed its office in Cairo until further notice  and have even begun to remove personnel from the country 
An intern working with the institute in Cairo has been told by the head office in Washington to pack their bags and leave the country as soon as possible 
A government spokesman on Monday said that until the group received official permission to work in the country  it must stop meddling with internal Egyptian affairs 
The controversy over the organization began when Gina London  the local head of the institute  in a recent interview with Nahdet Masr said that IRI would help to speed up political reform in the country  
London also said that IRI had not broken any laws and that the Egyptian and U S  governments had signed agreements letting groups funded by the U S  Agency for International Development operate without prior permission 
However  according to the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights  EOHR   the institute can be asked to stop functioning in the country because they do not have an official permit 
       Even if they did not break any laws  if they are not registered with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  they can be shut down   says Tariq Zaghloul of the EOHR 
       While the government can shut them down  it doesn       t look good when the U S  is in the middle of trying to limit the amount of aid given to the country   this will look bad on Egypt   he continues 
London is due to meet the minister of foreign affairs this coming week in order to discuss the decision of the government to shut down 
In the U S  Congress  the debate against continuing to give Egypt      billion is heating up  The IRI was mentioned on Thursday in Washington as a pivotal point why aid should be reduced  arguing that dialogue is not getting the job done 
 The choice we have today is to do nothing and hope with dialogue and cajoling things will improve or we can send a clear message that Congress will not stand by as thugs beat peaceful demonstrators   Rep  Gary Ackerman  a Democrat of New York  told reporters 
The IRI s Web site describes it as a  nonpartisan  nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing democracy worldwide  
The organization was founded in       following a speech by then U S  President Ronald Reagan in which he proposed a broad objective of helping countries build the infrastructure of democracy 
The current misunderstanding amongst American politicians and rights activists is that the move by the government is another error on the long list that includes violence  and alleged torture and sexual assault at demonstrations  However  the IRI is not a registered NGO in Egypt and therefore can be asked to shut down if the government deems their activities to be harmful to their policies 
As Zaghloul says  if they don       t have a permit they can be legally asked to stop working in the country  He  however  believes that this shows the governments unwillingness to continue to implement promised reforms 
       If they start shutting down American NGO       s it is only a matter of time before they start cracking down on Egyptian organizations   he says 
With Egypt in the midst of a political struggle with Washington and much of the west  this move to block an American based democracy institute doesn       t bode well for the country       s relationship with the U S 
IRI was unavailable for further comment  saying that the head office in Washington had instructed them not to speak to the press until further information could be uncovered  According to IRI members in Cairo  at least one member of the local office has been instructed to leave and is flying out of the country immediately due to perceived security threats
