Face ID is a biometric authentication facial recognition system designed and developed by Apple Inc  for the iPhone and iPad Pro  The system can be used for unlocking a device             making payments  accessing sensitive data  providing detailed facial expression tracking for Animoji  as well as six degrees of freedom   DOF  head tracking  eye tracking  and other features  Initially released in November      with the iPhone X  it has since been updated and introduced to all iPhones outside of SE models and all iPad Pro models from      onwards             Users on iOS    and newer can choose to lock specific apps  requiring Face ID to access them            
The Face ID hardware uses a TrueDepth Camera            that consists of a sensor with three modules  a laser            dot projector that projects a grid of small infrared dots onto a user s face  a module called the flood illuminator that shines infrared light at the face  and an infrared camera that takes an infrared picture of the user  reads the resulting pattern  and generates a  D facial map  
Face ID has sparked a number of debates about security and privacy  Apple claims that Face ID is statistically more advanced than Touch ID fingerprint scanning             It exhibits significantly fewer false positives  Multiple security features are in place to limit the risk of the system being bypassed using photos or masks  and only one proof of concept attempt using detailed scans has succeeded   
Debate continues over the lack of legal protections offered by biometric systems as compared to passcode authentication in the United States  Hackers have been able to use combinations of FaceID data and SMS messages to enter various locked information on Apple users iPhones protected by FaceID technology  Privacy advocates have also expressed concern about third party app developers  access to  rough maps  of user facial data  despite rigid requirements by Apple of how developers handle facial data  Privacy concerns also exist regarding the use FaceID data to retrieve other personal information stored on Apple technology             Use of FaceID technology and biometric data in criminal cases as been of much debate due to lack of legal regulation  FaceID has been compared to fingerprint and passcode locking mechanisms to evaluate the ethics behind use of FaceID in criminal cases  Finally  infiltration on Apple products has been a concern of the public as twins and close relatives have been successful in fooling the FaceID technology  Facial replication into realistic masks has been an infiltration concern  but has thus far been unsuccessful   
With the onset of the COVID    pandemic  it was noted that Face ID was unable to recognize users wearing face coverings on some devices                        Apple responded to criticism by offering faster fallback to passcode input  and the option for Apple Watch users to confirm whether they intended to unlock their iPhone             In March       Apple released iOS      which adds mask compatible Face ID for iPhone    and later devices             


History edit 
Apple announced Face ID during the unveiling of the iPhone X on September                       The system was presented as the successor to Touch ID  Apple s previous fingerprint based authentication technology embedded in the home button of the iPhone   and earlier devices in addition to the second and third generation iPhone SE              On September           Apple introduced the iPhone XS and XR with faster neural network processing speeds  providing a significant speed increase to Face ID  On October           Apple introduced the third generation iPad Pro  which brings Face ID to the iPad and allows face recognition in any orientation              iOS    included an upgraded version of Face ID which is up to     faster than Face ID on previous versions             
In February           following the announcement of the iPhone   e and the discontinuation of the iPhone SE   rd generation   all the iPhone models have transitioned from the Touch ID to Face ID             

Technology edit

Face ID s technology is based on PrimeSense s previous work with low cost infrared depth perception that was the basis of the Kinect motion sensor for the Xbox console line from Microsoft  Apple had acquired PrimeSense in      after Microsoft started to wane on the use of Kinect                         
Face ID is based on a facial recognition sensor that consists of two parts  a vertical cavity surface emitting laser dot projector module that projects more than        infrared dots onto the user s face  and an infrared camera module that reads the pattern              The pattern is projected from the laser using an Active Diffractive Optical Element which divides the beam into        dots             
The TrueDepth Camera             uses infrared light to create a  D map of users unique facial identity  This map is compared with the registered face using a secure subsystem  and the user is authenticated if the two faces match sufficiently  The system can recognize faces with glasses  clothing  makeup  and facial hair  and it adapts to changes in appearance over time  Concerns regarding the safety of longterm infrared facial screening has been debated and studied             
The pattern is encrypted and sent to a local  Secure Enclave  in the device s CPU to confirm a match with the registered face                          The stored facial data is a mathematical representation of key details of the face  and it is inaccessible to Apple or other parties              To avoid involuntary authentication  the system requires the user to open their eyes and look at the device to attempt a match  although this can be disabled through an accessibility setting              Face ID is temporarily disabled and the user s passcode is required after   unsuccessful scans     hours of inactivity  restarting the device  or if both of the device s side buttons are held briefly             
Apple claimed the probability of someone else unlocking a phone with Face ID is   in           as opposed to Touch ID at   in                                 During initial setup  the user s face is scanned twice from a number of angles to create a complete reference map  As the system is used  it learns about typical variations in a user s appearance  and will adjust its registered face data to match aging  facial hair growth  and other changes using the Neural Engine  The system will recognize a face wearing hats  scarves  glasses  most sunglasses              facial hair or makeup              When significant facial changes occur  FaceID may not recognize the person when comparing the image to stored data  In such cases  the user will be prompted to verify using their passcode and the facial recognition data will update to the changes             It also works in the dark by invisibly illuminating the whole face with a dedicated infrared flash module             
Authentication with Face ID is used to enable a number of iOS features  including unlocking the phone automatically on wake  making payments with Apple Pay  and viewing saved passwords  Apps by Apple or third party developers can protect sensitive data with a system framework  the device will verify the user s identity and return success or failure without sharing face data with the app  Additionally  Face ID can be used without authentication to track over    aspects of a user s facial expression and positioning  which can be used to create live effects such as Animoji or camera filters  In recent years  third party developers have developed more use cases for FaceID such as e g  Eyeware Beam  an iOS app that provides a reliable and precise  multi purpose head and eye tracking tool  It is used to enable control of the camera angle through head motion in games and eye tracking to share attention with audience in streams  but also augmentative and alternative communication  AAC  and biometric research             

Devices with Face ID edit 
iPhone X        and newer  except the  nd and  rd generation iPhone SE
iPad Pro   rd generation        and newer
Safety edit 
Face ID uses an infrared flood illuminator and laser infrared dot projector and prolonged exposure to infrared light has been known to cause harm to skin and the eyes  Apple has stated that the output is low enough that it will cause no harm to the eyes or skin  and meets  international safety standards               FaceID infrared output has been compared to what is put out from TV remotes               They do not  however  recommend the sensor be repaired by third parties  citing security concerns  There is also an in built feature to deactivate Face ID should unauthorized components be found             

Issues edit 
Twins and close relatives edit 
Inconsistent results have been shown when testing Face ID on identical twins  with some tests showing the system managing to separate the two              while other tests have failed              The system has additionally been fooled by close relatives              Apple states that the probability of a false match is different for twins and siblings  as well as children under    years of age  as  their distinct facial features may not have fully developed              

Law enforcement access edit 
Face ID has raised concerns regarding the possibility of law enforcement accessing an individual s phone by pointing the device at the user s face              United States Senator Al Franken asked Apple to provide more information on the security and privacy of Face ID a day after the announcement              with Apple responding by highlighting the recent publication of a security white paper and knowledge base detailing answers                         
In August       the FBI obtained a warrant to search the property  which includes electronic devices  of a man  Grant Michalski  accused of transmitting child pornography  they unlocked the suspect s iPhone by holding it up to his face  without needing his passcode             
The Verge noted that courts in the United States have granted different Fifth Amendment rights to keycode and biometric unlocking systems  Keycodes are considered  testimonial  evidence based on the contents of users  thoughts  whereas fingerprints are considered physical evidence  with some suspects having been ordered to unlock their phones via fingerprint               Debates are ongoing regarding the use of FaceID technology in law enforcement and criminal cases as laws and regulations have not yet been put in place  Currently  law enforcements  need for evidence is to be balanced with individual privacy rights in regards to biometric data 

Infiltration edit 
Verification experts claim that if biometric technology does not account for skin texture or blood flow  sophisticated masks may be successful in bypassing FaceID technology  However  many people have attempted to fool Face ID with sophisticated masks  though most have failed              In November       Vietnamese security firm Bkav announced in a blog post that it had  created a      mask that successfully unlocked Face ID  but WIRED noted that Bkav s technique was more of a  proof of concept  rather than active exploitation risk  with the technique requiring a detailed measurement or digital scan of the iPhone owner s face  putting the real risk of danger only to targets of espionage and world leaders                          

Third party developers edit 
If the user explicitly grants a third party app permission to use the camera  the app can also access basic facial expression and positioning data from Face ID for features such as precise selfie filters such as those seen in Snapchat  or game characters mirroring real world user facial expressions  The data accessible to third parties is not sufficient to unlock a device or even identify a user  and Apple prohibits developers from selling the data to others  creating profiles on users  or using the data for advertising  The American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Democracy and Technology raised privacy questions about Apple s enforcement of the privacy restrictions connected to third party access  with Apple maintaining that its App Store review processes were effective safeguards  Jay Stanley  a senior policy analyst with the ACLU  has stated that the overall idea of letting developers access sensitive facial information was still not satisfactorily handled  with Stanley telling Reuters that  the privacy issues around of the use of very sophisticated facial recognition technology for unlocking the phone have been overblown  The real privacy issues have to do with the access by third party developers                          

Hacking concerns edit 
Mobile hackers have been able to combine data from FaceID and SMS one time verification codes to access information from other accounts of Apple devices  Bank accounts of users in Asia and the Pacific Islands have been breached in isolated attacks by mobile hackers using FaceID data             Hackers were able to use facial images  stored in FaceID data  to make deepfake images that open information secured on Apple users devices with FaceID security  Combining FaceID data and one time SMS verification codes gave hackers access to various FaceID protected accounts              While these cyber attacks have been isolated in Asia and the Pacific Islands  it raises concerns about the security of FaceID technology 
On the dark web  users have been selling their personal FaceID images and identity for acute financial gain  Hackers are using identities bought off the dark web for  sophisticated impersonation fraud               This type of  hacking  or fraud is extremely difficult to detect because the FaceID documents submitted are real  as they are coming directly from the user  meaning they match biometric FaceID data almost perfectly               
iProov  a biometric data verification service  has suggested various ways to prevent FaceID biometric data from being successfully used to hack user data   Embedded imagery and meta data analysis  can be used detect if FaceID images are a real person or a media image              Technology can be used to quickly detect and respond to threats on verification systems using FaceID through ongoing monitoring and proactively searching for threats  With adequate training  engineers can learn how to reverse potential hacking situations to better understand how to prevent them              Without understanding how hackers are using FaceID biometric data to bypass verifications  ways to prevent cyber attacks can better be initiated to protect users 

Use with face masks edit 
During the COVID    pandemic  face masks were employed as a public and personal health control measure against the spread of SARS CoV    Face ID at the time was incompatible with face masks  with Apple stating  Face ID is designed to work with your eyes  nose and mouth visible               With the release of iOS       Apple added a feature that automatically brought up the passcode screen if it detected that the user was wearing a mask                          Apple was criticized for not addressing these issues with the release of the iPhone     but was praised for the lack of inclusion of Face ID in favor of Touch ID integration into the power button on the fourth generation iPad Air                         In April       Apple released iOS      and watchOS     with an option to allow Apple Watch to act as a backup if Face ID fails due to face masks             In March       Apple released iOS      which adds mask compatible Face ID for iPhone    and later devices
