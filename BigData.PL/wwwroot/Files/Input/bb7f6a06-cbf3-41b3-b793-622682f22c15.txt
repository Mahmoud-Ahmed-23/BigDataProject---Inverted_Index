can range from simple setups  like connecting two devices in your home  to massive global systems  like the Internet  Below are the main components of a computer network Node   Any device which can share or receive data  Examples of devices are laptop  mobile  printer  earbuds and server Transmission Media   The medium through which devices communicate It can be a wired media like Optical Fiber

types of communications  Examples are HTTP  For web browsing  and SMTP  For emails  Networking Devices   The devices with main purpose of providing network facilities  Examples are Router  Switch  Access Point and Hub Networking Applications   Software that provide an interface to communicate and share  Examples are browser  email clients and file sharing applications Computer networks are an important part of our daily lives  They allow devices like computers  smartphones and tablets to connect and communicate with each other  Whether you re browsing the internet  sending an email or streaming a video  it all happens because of computer networks Fundamentals of Computer NetworkThis section introduces the core concepts behind computer networking  In this we will learn what is
