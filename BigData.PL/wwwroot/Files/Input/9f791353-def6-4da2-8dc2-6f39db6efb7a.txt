							CAIRO   ldquo I think we have more opportunities than challenges  for the IT industry  in Egypt   hellip It rsquo s exciting because the scalability and numbers are hellip massive  rdquo  said Wael Fakharany  regional manager of Google in the Middle East 
With    million students     million internet users    million mobile internet users and    million mobiles  he added  even a small percentage represents a wide scale information technology  IT  and intellectual property development base 
In an interview with Daily News Egypt  Fakharany said   ldquo We have been quite vocal about our monetizing products but it rsquo s time to talk to other segments of society  people who do research and development  work on IT innovations and develop intellectual property  rdquo  he said 
In line these plans  Google will host its first  lsquo  rdquo G Egypt rdquo  event from Dec        where executives will meet with computer science students  software developers  small businesses and tech entrepreneurs  Google will demonstrate its suite of products that are driving innovation in technology and business across the globe and here in the Middle East 
 ldquo I see a lot of hungry and striving young dynamic kids  whose talent just needs to be incubated  rdquo  Fakharany said 
 ldquo The objectives of these three days are to start a vibrant tech community and establish a connection between us and them  My dream is to have the next big thing in IT  mdash  Facebook  Twitter or something like that coming from this part of the world  rdquo  he added 
Day one of G Egypt will target academia  discussing with professors and university students some of Google       s most powerful technologies and coding languages for building online and mobile applications 
According to Fakharany     Google engineers and product managers from all over the globe will share their knowledge and answer questions as well as discuss existing Google student outreach programs and opportunities that Egyptian students can harness 
Day two will target software developers   ldquo It rsquo s one of our best kept secrets that we have many tools that are completely free of charge for software developers that we haven rsquo t been vocal about  rdquo  Fakharany said 
On this day  Google engineers and web developers will lead participants through one full day of in depth sessions on the latest Google technologies and hands on codelabs and bring developers together to share their own ideas 
Fakharany explained that since Google supports open source software and access to IT resources  finances and technology  its software and products could be a good self service platform for up and coming software developers  
The third day will host entrepreneurs and business owners to discuss content creation using online tools  how to market them and how to monetize focusing toward online and mobile usage 
Fakharany credited this initiative to the fact that Google has recognized the substantial amounts of internet content which Egypt is producing 
 ldquo We believe that this is a good triangle of focus areas for fostering innovation and entrepreneurship in line with the government rsquo s initiatives to push the envelope when it comes to IT talent in Egypt 
 ldquo It is not about the internet infrastructure anymore  the infrastructure is there  but it rsquo s about the people using it  rdquo 
 ldquo We have never done this anywhere in the Middle East before at all and this shows how committed we are to this market  This is almost like taking the internet to the next level and it rsquo s all about the region rsquo s potential  rdquo  he concluded
