A global catastrophic risk or a doomsday scenario is a hypothetical event that could damage human well being on a global scale             even endangering or destroying modern civilization             An event that could cause human extinction or permanently and drastically curtail humanity s existence or potential is known as an  existential risk             
In the   st century  a number of academic and non profit organizations have been established to research global catastrophic and existential risks  formulate potential mitigation measures and either advocate for or implement these measures                                             


Definition and classification edit 
Scope severity grid from Bostrom s paper  Existential Risk Prevention as Global Priority            
Defining global catastrophic risks edit 
The term global catastrophic risk  lacks a sharp definition   and generally refers  loosely  to a risk that could inflict  serious damage to human well being on a global scale              
Humanity has suffered large catastrophes before  Some of these have caused serious damage but were only local in scope e g  the Black Death may have resulted in the deaths of a third of Europe s population                  of the global population at the time              Some were global  but were not as severe e g  the      influenza pandemic killed an estimated      of the world s population              Most global catastrophic risks would not be so intense as to kill the majority of life on earth  but even if one did  the ecosystem and humanity would eventually recover  in contrast to existential risks  
Similarly  in Catastrophe  Risk and Response  Richard Posner singles out and groups together events that bring about  utter overthrow or ruin  on a global  rather than a  local or regional  scale  Posner highlights such events as worthy of special attention on cost benefit grounds because they could directly or indirectly jeopardize the survival of the human race as a whole             

Defining existential risks edit 
Existential risks are defined as  risks that threaten the destruction of humanity s long term potential               The instantiation of an existential risk  an existential catastrophe              would either cause outright human extinction or irreversibly lock in a drastically inferior state of affairs                         Existential risks are a sub class of global catastrophic risks  where the damage is not only global but also terminal and permanent  preventing recovery and thereby affecting both current and all future generations            

Non extinction risks edit 
While extinction is the most obvious way in which humanity s long term potential could be destroyed  there are others  including unrecoverable collapse and unrecoverable dystopia              A disaster severe enough to cause the permanent  irreversible collapse of human civilisation would constitute an existential catastrophe  even if it fell short of extinction              Similarly  if humanity fell under a totalitarian regime  and there were no chance of recovery then such a dystopia would also be an existential catastrophe              Bryan Caplan writes that  perhaps an eternity of totalitarianism would be worse than extinction                George Orwell s novel Nineteen Eighty Four suggests             an example               A dystopian scenario shares the key features of extinction and unrecoverable collapse of civilization  before the catastrophe humanity faced a vast range of bright futures to choose from  after the catastrophe  humanity is locked forever in a terrible state             
Psychologist Steven Pinker has called existential risk a  useless category  that can distract from threats he considers real and solvable  such as climate change and nuclear war             

Potential sources of risk edit 
Main article  Global catastrophe scenarios
Potential global catastrophic risks are conventionally classified as anthropogenic or non anthropogenic hazards  Examples of non anthropogenic risks are an asteroid or comet impact event  a supervolcanic eruption  a natural pandemic  a lethal gamma ray burst  a geomagnetic storm from a coronal mass ejection destroying electronic equipment  natural long term climate change  hostile extraterrestrial life  or the Sun transforming into a red giant star and engulfing the Earth billions of years in the future             

Arrangement of global catastrophic risks into three sets according to whether they are largely human caused  human influences upon nature  or purely natural
Anthropogenic risks are those caused by humans and include those related to technology  governance  and climate change  Technological risks include the creation of artificial intelligence misaligned with human goals  biotechnology  and nanotechnology  Insufficient or malign global governance creates risks in the social and political domain  such as global war and nuclear holocaust              biological warfare and bioterrorism using genetically modified organisms  cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism destroying critical infrastructure like the electrical grid  or radiological warfare using weapons such as large cobalt bombs  Other global catastrophic risks include climate change  environmental degradation  extinction of species  famine as a result of non equitable resource distribution  human overpopulation or underpopulation  crop failures  and non sustainable agriculture 

Methodological challenges edit 
Research into the nature and mitigation of global catastrophic risks and existential risks is subject to a unique set of challenges and  as a result  is not easily subjected to the usual standards of scientific rigour              For instance  it is neither feasible nor ethical to study these risks experimentally  Carl Sagan expressed this with regards to nuclear war   Understanding the long term consequences of nuclear war is not a problem amenable to experimental verification               Moreover  many catastrophic risks change rapidly as technology advances and background conditions  such as geopolitical conditions  change  Another challenge is the general difficulty of accurately predicting the future over long timescales  especially for anthropogenic risks which depend on complex human political  economic and social systems              In addition to known and tangible risks  unforeseeable black swan extinction events may occur  presenting an additional methodological problem                         

Lack of historical precedent edit 
Humanity has never suffered an existential catastrophe and if one were to occur  it would necessarily be unprecedented              Therefore  existential risks pose unique challenges to prediction  even more than other long term events  because of observation selection effects              Unlike with most events  the failure of a complete extinction event to occur in the past is not evidence against their likelihood in the future  because every world that has experienced such an extinction event has gone unobserved by humanity  Regardless of civilization collapsing events  frequency  no civilization observes existential risks in its history              These anthropic issues may partly be avoided by looking at evidence that does not have such selection effects  such as asteroid impact craters on the Moon  or directly evaluating the likely impact of new technology            
To understand the dynamics of an unprecedented  unrecoverable global civilizational collapse  a type of existential risk   it may be instructive to study the various local civilizational collapses that have occurred throughout human history              For instance  civilizations such as the Roman Empire have ended in a loss of centralized governance and a major civilization wide loss of infrastructure and advanced technology  However  these examples demonstrate that societies appear to be fairly resilient to catastrophe  for example  Medieval Europe survived the Black Death without suffering anything resembling a civilization collapse despite losing    to    percent of its population             

Incentives and coordination edit 
There are economic reasons that can explain why so little effort is going into global catastrophic risk reduction   First  it is speculative and may never happen  so many people focus on other more pressing issues   It is also a global public good  so we should expect it to be undersupplied by markets             Even if a large nation invested in risk mitigation measures  that nation would enjoy only a small fraction of the benefit of doing so  Furthermore  global catastrophic risk reduction can be thought of as an intergenerational global public good   Since most of the hypothetical benefits of the reduction would be enjoyed by future generations  and though these future people would perhaps be willing to pay substantial sums for risk reduction  no mechanism for such a transaction exists            

Cognitive biases edit 
Numerous cognitive biases can influence people s judgment of the importance of existential risks  including scope insensitivity  hyperbolic discounting  availability heuristic  the conjunction fallacy  the affect heuristic  and the overconfidence effect             
Scope insensitivity influences how bad people consider the extinction of the human race to be  For example  when people are motivated to donate money to altruistic causes  the quantity they are willing to give does not increase linearly with the magnitude of the issue  people are roughly as willing to prevent the deaths of         or       birds              Similarly  people are often more concerned about threats to individuals than to larger groups             
Eliezer Yudkowsky theorizes that scope neglect plays a role in public perception of existential risks                         

Substantially larger numbers  such as     million deaths  and especially qualitatively different scenarios such as the extinction of the entire human species  seem to trigger a different mode of thinking    People who would never dream of hurting a child hear of existential risk  and say   Well  maybe the human species doesn t really deserve to survive  
All past predictions of human extinction have proven to be false  To some  this makes future warnings seem less credible  Nick Bostrom argues that the absence of human extinction in the past is weak evidence that there will be no human extinction in the future  due to survivor bias and other anthropic effects             
Sociobiologist E  O  Wilson argued that   The reason for this myopic fog  evolutionary biologists contend  is that it was actually advantageous during all but the last few millennia of the two million years of existence of the genus Homo    A premium was placed on close attention to the near future and early reproduction  and little else  Disasters of a magnitude that occur only once every few centuries were forgotten or transmuted into myth              

Proposed mitigation edit 
Multi layer defense edit 
Defense in depth is a useful framework for categorizing risk mitigation measures into three layers of defense             

Prevention  Reducing the probability of a catastrophe occurring in the first place  Example  Measures to prevent outbreaks of new highly infectious diseases 
Response  Preventing the scaling of a catastrophe to the global level  Example  Measures to prevent escalation of a small scale nuclear exchange into an all out nuclear war 
Resilience  Increasing humanity s resilience  against extinction  when faced with global catastrophes  Example  Measures to increase food security during a nuclear winter             
Human extinction is most likely when all three defenses are weak  that is   by risks we are unlikely to prevent  unlikely to successfully respond to  and unlikely to be resilient against              
The unprecedented nature of existential risks poses a special challenge in designing risk mitigation measures since humanity will not be able to learn from a track record of previous events             

Funding edit 
Some researchers argue that both research and other initiatives relating to existential risk are underfunded  Nick Bostrom states that more research has been done on Star Trek  snowboarding  or dung beetles than on existential risks  Bostrom s comparisons have been criticized as  high handed                           As of       the Biological Weapons Convention organization had an annual budget of US          million             

Survival planning edit 
Some scholars propose the establishment on Earth of one or more self sufficient  remote  permanently occupied settlements specifically created for the purpose of surviving a global disaster                                      Economist Robin Hanson argues that a refuge permanently housing as few as     people would significantly improve the chances of human survival during a range of global catastrophes                         
Food storage has been proposed globally  but the monetary cost would be high  Furthermore  it would likely contribute to the current millions of deaths per year due to malnutrition              In       a team led by David Denkenberger modeled the cost effectiveness of resilient foods to artificial general intelligence  AGI  safety and found          confidence  for a higher marginal impact of work on resilient foods              Some survivalists stock survival retreats with multiple year food supplies 
The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is buried     feet           m  inside a mountain on an island in the Arctic  It is designed to hold          billion seeds from more than     countries as a precaution to preserve the world s crops  The surrounding rock is          C           F   as of       but the vault is kept at           C          F  by refrigerators powered by locally sourced coal                         
More speculatively  if society continues to function and if the biosphere remains habitable  calorie needs for the present human population might in theory be met during an extended absence of sunlight  given sufficient advance planning  Conjectured solutions include growing mushrooms on the dead plant biomass left in the wake of the catastrophe  converting cellulose to sugar  or feeding natural gas to methane digesting bacteria                         

Global catastrophic risks and global governance edit 
Insufficient global governance creates risks in the social and political domain  but the governance mechanisms develop more slowly than technological and social change  There are concerns from governments  the private sector  as well as the general public about the lack of governance mechanisms to efficiently deal with risks  negotiate and adjudicate between diverse and conflicting interests  This is further underlined by an understanding of the interconnectedness of global systemic risks              In absence or anticipation of global governance  national governments can act individually to better understand  mitigate and prepare for global catastrophes             

Climate emergency plans edit 
In       the Club of Rome called for greater climate change action and published its Climate Emergency Plan  which proposes ten action points to limit global average temperature increase to     degrees Celsius              Further  in       the Club published the more comprehensive Planetary Emergency Plan             
There is evidence to suggest that collectively engaging with the emotional experiences that emerge during contemplating the vulnerability of the human species within the context of climate change allows for these experiences to be adaptive  When collective engaging with and processing emotional experiences is supportive  this can lead to growth in resilience  psychological flexibility  tolerance of emotional experiences  and community engagement             

Space colonization edit 
Main article  Space and survival
Space colonization is a proposed alternative to improve the odds of surviving an extinction scenario              Solutions of this scope may require megascale engineering 
Astrophysicist Stephen Hawking advocated colonizing other planets within the Solar System once technology progresses sufficiently  in order to improve the chance of human survival from planet wide events such as global thermonuclear war                         

Organizations edit 
The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  est        is one of the oldest global risk organizations  founded after the public became alarmed by the potential of atomic warfare in the aftermath of WWII  It studies risks associated with nuclear war and energy and famously maintains the Doomsday Clock established in       The Foresight Institute  est        examines the risks of nanotechnology and its benefits  It was one of the earliest organizations to study the unintended consequences of otherwise harmless technology gone haywire at a global scale  It was founded by K  Eric Drexler who postulated  grey goo                          
Beginning after       a growing number of scientists  philosophers and tech billionaires created organizations devoted to studying global risks both inside and outside of academia             
Independent non governmental organizations  NGOs  include the Machine Intelligence Research Institute  est         which aims to reduce the risk of a catastrophe caused by artificial intelligence              with donors including Peter Thiel and Jed McCaleb              The Nuclear Threat Initiative  est        seeks to reduce global threats from nuclear  biological and chemical threats  and containment of damage after an event             It maintains a nuclear material security index              The Lifeboat Foundation  est        funds research into preventing a technological catastrophe              Most of the research money funds projects at universities              The Global Catastrophic Risk Institute  est        is a US based non profit  non partisan think tank founded by Seth Baum and Tony Barrett  GCRI does research and policy work across various risks  including artificial intelligence  nuclear war  climate change  and asteroid impacts               The Global Challenges Foundation  est         based in Stockholm and founded by Laszlo Szombatfalvy  releases a yearly report on the state of global risks                          The Future of Life Institute  est        works to reduce extreme  large scale risks from transformative technologies  as well as steer the development and use of these technologies to benefit all life  through grantmaking  policy advocacy in the United States  European Union and United Nations  and educational outreach             Elon Musk  Vitalik Buterin and Jaan Tallinn are some of its biggest donors              
University based organizations included the Future of Humanity Institute  est        which researched the questions of humanity s long term future  particularly existential risk             It was founded by Nick Bostrom and was based at Oxford University             The Centre for the Study of Existential Risk  est        is a Cambridge University based organization which studies four major technological risks  artificial intelligence  biotechnology  global warming and warfare             All are man made risks  as Huw Price explained to the AFP news agency   It seems a reasonable prediction that some time in this or the next century intelligence will escape from the constraints of biology   He added that when this happens  we re no longer the smartest things around   and will risk being at the mercy of  machines that are not malicious  but machines whose interests don t include us               Stephen Hawking was an acting adviser  The Millennium Alliance for Humanity and the Biosphere is a Stanford University based organization focusing on many issues related to global catastrophe by bringing together members of academia in the humanities                          It was founded by Paul Ehrlich  among others              Stanford University also has the Center for International Security and Cooperation focusing on political cooperation to reduce global catastrophic risk              The Center for Security and Emerging Technology was established in January      at Georgetown s Walsh School of Foreign Service and will focus on policy research of emerging technologies with an initial emphasis on artificial intelligence              They received a grant of   M USD from Good Ventures as suggested by Open Philanthropy             
Other risk assessment groups are based in or are part of governmental organizations  The World Health Organization  WHO  includes a division called the Global Alert and Response  GAR  which monitors and responds to global epidemic crisis              GAR helps member states with training and coordination of response to epidemics              The United States Agency for International Development  USAID  has its Emerging Pandemic Threats Program which aims to prevent and contain naturally generated pandemics at their source              The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has a division called the Global Security Principal Directorate which researches on behalf of the government issues such as bio security and counter terrorism
