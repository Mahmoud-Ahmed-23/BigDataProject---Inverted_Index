Artificial intelligence  AI  has many applications in warfare  including in communications  intelligence  and munitions control 


Uses edit 
AI can enhance command and control  communications  sensors  integration and interoperability             AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors  threat detection and identification  marking of enemy positions  target acquisition  coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles  both human operated and autonomous            
AI has been used in military operations in Iraq  Syria  Ukraine and Israel                                  

Autonomous armament edit

Military drones capable of autonomous action are in wide use            

Command and control edit 
In      a Chinese laboratory at the Joint Operations College of the National Defense University in Shijiazhuang has created an AI military commander  for use in large scale war simulations in the role of the commander in chief            
In       the Ukrainian Army developed autonomous Kamikaze drones in order to make Russian interference during flight ineffective            

Military intelligence edit 
In       the United States Department of Defense tested generative AI based on large language models to digitize and integrate data across the military            
In the Gaza war  Israel used two AI systems to generate targets to strike  Habsora  translated   the gospel   was used to compile a list of buildings to target  while  Lavender  produced a list of people   Lavender  produced a list of        people to target                        The list of buildings to target included Gazan private homes of people that were suspected of affiliation to Hamas operatives  The combination of AI targeting technology with policy shift away from avoiding civilian targets resulted in unprecedented numbers of civilian deaths  IDF officials say the program addresses the previous issue of the air force running out of targets  Using Habsora  officials say that suspected and junior Hamas members homes significantly expand the  AI target bank   An internal source describes the process as a  mass assassination factory                        
In       the U S  military trained artificial intelligence to identify airstrike targets during its operations in Iraq and Syria             

Global trends edit 
Various countries are researching and deploying AI military applications             in what has been termed the  artificial intelligence arms race   Ongoing research is focused on intelligence collection and analysis  logistics  cyber operations  information operations  and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles            
Worldwide annual military spending on robotics rose from US     billion in      to US     billion in                              
In November            US Vice President Kamala Harris disclosed a declaration signed by    nations to set guardrails for the military use of AI  The commitments include using legal reviews to ensure the compliance of military AI with international laws  and being cautious and transparent in the development of this technology             
Many AI researchers try to avoid military applications  with guardrails to prevent military applications integrated into most mainstream large language models            

In popular culture edit 
Military artificial intelligence systems have appeared in many works of fiction  often as antagonists 

Film edit 
The Terminator franchise
The Matrix franchise
Literature edit 
Legends of Dune trilogy by Brian Herbert
