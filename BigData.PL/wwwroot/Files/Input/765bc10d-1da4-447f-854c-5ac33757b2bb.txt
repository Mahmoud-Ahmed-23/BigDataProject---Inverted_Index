							The Egyptian government has announced that it will start disbursing the first batch of the second phase of the country       s exceptional aid to irregular labourers on Sunday 
The financial dispersals will continue for    consecutive days 
Prime Minister Moustafa Madbouly said that the payments come as part of President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi s directives to extend the period of disbursement for the exceptional aid in light of the global health pandemic 
Mobile companies would send text messages to registered irregular workers to urge them to update their data on the platform designed by the Cabinet       s  Information and Decision Support Center  This platform was made available on the website of the Ministry of Manpower from   to    October 
The number of workers who updated their data has reached   million so far  This prompted the government to apply eligibility criteria for the disbursement and carry out a filtration process 
After the filtration process  and in cooperation with the Administrative Control Authority  ACA   those entitled to the stipulated grant amounted to      million workers  
The beneficiaries of the second phase will be divided as follows          workers who previously received aid in the first phase          workers who applied for the first phase and did not meet the conditions as a result of incorrect registration but they updated their data in the second phase  and        workers who meet the conditions out of        workers who updated their data in the second phase  A total of         workers submitted complaints for not being paid during the first phase  in addition to     million workers who applied to obtain the grant for the first time 
Training programmes for irregular workers are being organised  coordinated and conducted in cooperation with the Ministry of Social Solidarity and other companies and agencies through the        Forsa        programme  
The aim is to help them refine their technical skills and raise their efficiency  Coordination is also being made with the Information and Decision Support Center to set up an        opinion poll        mechanism to determine the percentages of those wishing to receive training  
A sample of the database of irregular workers has also been chosen  with nearly     of the sample  those who do not have a job or have a temporary job and are between       years old  have expressed their desire to obtain training programmes to develop their skills to help them obtain decent jobs  
The results also showed that       of irregular workers returned to their work  and     of the sample are looking for jobs  which reinforces the state       s trend to provide training programmes for the affected irregular workers 
Minister of Planning and Economic Development Hala El Said said that supporting irregular workers would help the national economy overcome the current crisis  She noted that the state is keen on implementing the president s directions to ensure that the rights of workers affected by the repercussions of COVID    are preserved
