Inference rule in logic  proof theory  and automated theorem proving
In mathematical logic and automated theorem proving  resolution is a rule of inference leading to a refutation complete theorem proving technique for sentences in propositional logic and first order logic  For propositional logic  systematically applying the resolution rule acts as a decision procedure for formula unsatisfiability  solving the  complement of the  Boolean satisfiability problem  For first order logic  resolution can be used as the basis for a semi algorithm for the unsatisfiability problem of first order logic  providing a more practical method than one following from G del s completeness theorem 
The resolution rule can be traced back to Davis and Putnam                    however  their algorithm required trying all ground instances of the given formula  This source of combinatorial explosion was eliminated in      by John Alan Robinson s syntactical unification algorithm  which allowed one to instantiate the formula during the proof  on demand  just as far as needed to keep refutation completeness            
The clause produced by a resolution rule is sometimes called a resolvent 


Resolution in propositional logic edit 
Resolution rule edit 
The resolution rule in propositional logic is a single valid inference rule that produces a new clause implied by two clauses containing complementary literals  A literal is a propositional variable or the negation of a propositional variable  Two literals are said to be complements if one is the negation of the other  in the following 

  
    
      
          xac 
        c
      
    
      displaystyle  lnot c 
  
 is taken to be the complement to 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
      displaystyle c 
  
   The resulting clause contains all the literals that do not have complements

 is the resolved atom or pivot 
The clause produced by the resolution rule is called the resolvent of the two input clauses  It is the principle of consensus applied to clauses rather than terms            
When the two clauses contain more than one pair of complementary literals  the resolution rule can be applied  independently  for each such pair  however  the result is always a tautology 
Modus ponens can be seen as a special case of resolution  of a one literal clause and a two literal clause

A resolution technique edit 
When coupled with a complete search algorithm  the resolution rule yields a sound and complete algorithm for deciding the satisfiability of a propositional formula  and  by extension  the validity of a sentence under a set of axioms 
This resolution technique uses proof by contradiction and is based on the fact that any sentence in propositional logic can be transformed into an equivalent sentence in conjunctive normal form             The steps are as follows 

All sentences in the knowledge base and the negation of the sentence to be proved  the conjecture  are conjunctively connected 
The resulting sentence is transformed into a conjunctive normal form with the conjuncts viewed as elements in a set  S  of clauses            
For example    
  
    
      
         
        
          A
          
             
          
        
          x     
        
          A
          
             
          
        
         
          x     
         
        
          B
          
             
          
        
          x     
        
          B
          
             
          
        
          x     
        
          B
          
             
          
        
         
          x     
         
        
          C

The resolution rule is applied to all possible pairs of clauses that contain complementary literals  After each application of the resolution rule  the resulting sentence is simplified by removing repeated literals  If the clause contains complementary literals  it is discarded  as a tautology   If not  and if it is not yet present in the clause set S  it is added to S  and is considered for further resolution inferences 
If after applying a resolution rule the empty clause is derived  the original formula is unsatisfiable  or contradictory   and hence it can be concluded that the initial conjecture follows from the axioms 
If  on the other hand  the empty clause cannot be derived  and the resolution rule cannot be applied to derive any more new clauses  the conjecture is not a theorem of the original knowledge base 
One instance of this algorithm is the original Davis Putnam algorithm that was later refined into the DPLL algorithm that removed the need for explicit representation of the resolvents 
This description of the resolution technique uses a set S as the underlying data structure to represent resolution derivations  Lists  Trees and Directed Acyclic Graphs are other possible and common alternatives  Tree representations are more faithful to the fact that the resolution rule is binary  Together with a sequent notation for clauses  a tree representation also makes it clear to see how the resolution rule is related to a special case of the cut rule  restricted to atomic cut formulas  However  tree representations are not as compact as set or list representations  because they explicitly show redundant subderivations of clauses that are used more than once in the derivation of the empty clause  Graph representations can be as compact in the number of clauses as list representations and they also store structural information regarding which clauses were resolved to derive each resolvent

        x
         
      
    
      displaystyle  b x  
  
 is the most general unifier of the resolved literals 
Informal explanation edit 
In first order logic  resolution condenses the traditional syllogisms of logical inference down to a single rule 
To understand how resolution works  consider the following example syllogism of term logic 

All Greeks are Europeans 
Homer is a Greek 
Therefore  Homer is a European 
Or  more generally 


  
    
      
          x     
        x
         
        P
         
        x
         
          x  d  
        Q
         
        x
         
      
    
      displaystyle  forall x P x  Rightarrow Q x  
  


  
    
      
        P
         
        a
         
      
    
      displaystyle P a  
  

Therefore  
  
    
      
        Q
         
        a
         
      
    
      displaystyle Q a  
  

To recast the reasoning using the resolution technique  first the clauses must be converted to conjunctive normal form  CNF   In this form  all quantification becomes implicit  universal quantifiers on variables  X  Y       are simply omitted as understood  while existentially quantified variables are replaced by Skolem functions 


  
    
      
          xac 
        P
         
        x
         
          x     
        Q
         
        x
         
      
    
      displaystyle  neg P x  vee Q x  
  


  
    
      
        P
         
        a
         
      
    
      displaystyle P a  
  

Therefore  
  
    
      
        Q
         
        a
         
      
    
      displaystyle Q a  
  

So the question is  how does the resolution technique derive the last clause from the first two  The rule is simple 

Find two clauses containing the same predicate  where it is negated in one clause but not in the other 
Perform a unification on the two predicates   If the unification fails  you made a bad choice of predicates  Go back to the previous step and try again  
If any unbound variables which were bound in the unified predicates also occur in other predicates in the two clauses  replace them with their bound values  terms  there as well 
Discard the unified predicates  and combine the remaining ones from the two clauses into a new clause  also joined by the     operator 
To apply this rule to the above example  we find the predicate P occurs in negated form

 P X 
in the first clause  and in non negated form

P a 
in the second clause  X is an unbound variable  while a is a bound value  term   Unifying the two produces the substitution

X   a
Discarding the unified predicates  and applying this substitution to the remaining predicates  just Q X   in this case   produces the conclusion 

Q a 
For another example  consider the syllogistic form

All Cretans are islanders 
All islanders are liars 
Therefore all Cretans are liars 
Or more generally 

 X P X    Q X 
 X Q X    R X 
Therefore   X P X    R X 
In CNF  the antecedents become 

 P X    Q X 
 Q Y    R Y 
 The variable in the second clause was renamed to make it clear that variables in different clauses are distinct  
Now  unifying Q X  in the first clause with  Q Y  in the second clause means that X and Y become the same variable anyway  Substituting this into the remaining clauses and combining them gives the conclusion 

 P X    R X 
Factoring edit 
The resolution rule  as defined by Robinson  also incorporated factoring  which unifies two literals in the same clause  before or during the application of resolution as defined above  The resulting inference rule is refutation complete             in that a set of clauses is unsatisfiable if and only if there exists a derivation of the empty clause using only resolution  enhanced by factoring 
An example for an unsatisfiable clause set for which factoring is needed to derive the empty clause is 


  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                 
                 
                 
                 
              
              
                P
                 
                u
                 
              
              
                  x     
              
              
                P
                 
                f
                 
                u
                 
                 
              
            
            
              
                 
                 
                 
                 
              
              
                  xac 
                P
                 
                v
                 
              
              
                  x     
              
              
                P
                 
                f
                 
                w
                 
                 
              
            
            
              
                 
                 
                 
                 
              
              
                  xac 
                P
                 
                x
                 
              
              
                  x     
              
              
                  xac 
                P
                 
                f
                 
                x

Since each clause consists of two literals  so does each possible resolvent  Therefore  by resolution without factoring  the empty clause can never be obtained 
Using factoring  it can be obtained e g  as follows

Non clausal resolution edit 
Generalizations of the above resolution rule have been devised that do not require the originating formulas to be in clausal normal form                                                                       
These techniques are useful mainly in interactive theorem proving where it is important to preserve human readability of intermediate result formulas  Besides  they avoid combinatorial explosion during transformation to clause form                                   and sometimes save resolution steps

 are built as before  the formula

 is obtained by replacing each positive and each negative occurrence of

  respectively  Similar to Murray s approach  appropriate simplifying transformations are to be applied to the resolvent  Traugott proved his rule to be complete  provided

Traugott s resolvent is stronger than Murray s                                    Moreover  it does not introduce new binary junctors  thus avoiding a tendency towards clausal form in repeated resolution  However  formulas may grow longer when a small

From a comparison of both deductions  the following issues can be seen 

Traugott s rule may yield a sharper resolvent  compare     and       which both resolve     and     on 
  
    
      
        p
         
        c
      
    
      displaystyle p c 
  
 
Murray s rule introduced   new disjunction symbols  in           and      while Traugott s rule did not introduce any new symbol  in this sense  Traugott s intermediate formulas resemble the user s style more closely than Murray s 
Due to the latter issue  Traugott s rule can take advantage of the implication in assumption      using as 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
      displaystyle p 
  
 the non atomic formula 
  
    
      
        a
          x     
        e
      
    
      displaystyle a rightarrow e 
  
 in step       Using Murray s rules  the semantically equivalent formula 
  
    
      
        e
          x     
          xac

 was obtained as      however  it could not be used as 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
      displaystyle p 
  
 due to its syntactic form 
Non clausal resolution in first order logic edit 
For first order predicate logic  Murray s rule is generalized to allow distinct  but unifiable  subformulas

 and 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
      displaystyle G 
  
  respectively  If 
  
    
      
          x d  
      
    
      displaystyle  phi  
  
 is the most general unifier of 
  
    
      
        
          p

          p
          
             
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle p     
  
  then the generalized resolvent is 
  
    
      
        F
          x d

      displaystyle F phi    textit  true    lor G phi    textit  false    
  
  While the rule remains sound if a more special substitution 
  
    
      
          x d  
      
    
      displaystyle  phi  
  
 is used  no such rule applications are needed to achieve completeness      citation needed     
Traugott s rule is generalized to allow several pairwise distinct subformulas

 have a common most general unifier  say 
  
    
      
          x d  
      
    
      displaystyle  phi  
  
  The generalized resolvent is obtained after applying 
  
    
      
          x d  
      
    
      displaystyle  phi  
  
 to the parent formulas  thus making the propositional version applicable  Traugott s completeness proof relies on the assumption that this fully general rule is used                                    it is not clear whether his rule would remain complete if restricted to 
  
    
      
        
          p

            m
             
             
          
        
         
          x  ef 
         
        
          p

Paramodulation edit 
Paramodulation is a related technique for reasoning on sets of clauses where the predicate symbol is equality  It generates all  equal  versions of clauses  except reflexive identities  The paramodulation operation takes a positive from clause  which must contain an equality literal  It then searches an into clause with a subterm that unifies with one side of the equality  The subterm is then replaced by the other side of the equality  The general aim of paramodulation is to reduce the system to atoms  reducing the size of the terms when substituting
