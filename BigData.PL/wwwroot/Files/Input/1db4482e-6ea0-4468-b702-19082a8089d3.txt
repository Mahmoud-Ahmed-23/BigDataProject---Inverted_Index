Swarming behaviour of birds when flying or foraging

Flocking is the behavior exhibited when a group of birds  called a flock  are foraging or in flight  Sheep and goats also exhibit flocking behavior  Flocking by birds and mammals is similar to schooling in fish and these are often studied together 
Flocking is generally believed to arise from the need for cover and protection from predators in animal behavior             This is an emergent behaviour governed by local rules that are followed by individuals and does not involve any central coordination 


In nature edit 
There are parallels with the shoaling behaviour of fish  the swarming behaviour of insects  and herd behaviour of land animals  During the winter months  starlings are known for aggregating into huge flocks of hundreds to thousands of individuals  murmurations  which when they take flight altogether  render large displays of intriguing swirling patterns in the skies above observers 

Measurement edit 
Measurements of bird flocking have been made            using high speed cameras  and a computer analysis has been made to test the simple rules of flocking mentioned below  It is found that they generally hold true in the case of bird flocking  but the long range attraction rule  cohesion  applies to the nearest      neighbors of the flocking bird and is independent of the distance of these neighbors from the bird  In addition  there is an anisotropy with regard to this cohesive tendency  with more cohesion being exhibited towards neighbors to the sides of the bird  rather than in front or behind  This is likely due to the field of vision of the flying bird being directed to the sides rather than directly forward or backward 
Another recent study is based on an analysis of high speed camera footage of flocks above Rome  and uses a computer model assuming minimal behavioural rules                                             

Algorithms edit 
Various algorithms have been introduced to aid in the study of biological flocking  These algorithms have different origins  from computer graphics to physics  each offering a unique perspective on the real phenomena 
Computer simulations and mathematical models that have been developed to emulate the flocking behaviours of birds can also generally be applied to the  flocking  behaviour of other species  As a result  the term  flocking  is sometimes applied  in computer science  to species other than birds  to mean collective motion by a group of self propelled entities  a collective animal behaviour exhibited by many living beings such as fish  bacteria  and  insects             

Reynolds  Models edit 
Flocking behaviour was simulated on a computer in      by Craig Reynolds with the program Boids              This program simulates simple agents  boids  that move according to a set of three basic rules  separation  alignment and cohesion  The result  akin to a flock of birds  a school of fish  or a swarm of insects  was developed for motion picture visual effects  

Rules edit 
Reynolds  models of flocking behaviour are controlled by three simple rules 

Separation
Avoid crowding neighbours  short range repulsion 
Alignment
Steer towards average heading of neighbours
Cohesion
Steer towards average position of neighbours  long range attraction 
With these three simple rules  the flock moves in an extremely realistic way  creating complex motion and interaction that would be extremely hard to create otherwise 

Rule variants edit 
The basic model has been extended in several different ways since Reynolds proposed it  For instance  Delgado Mata et al             extended the basic model to incorporate the effects of fear  Olfaction was used to transmit emotion between animals  through pheromones modelled as particles in a free expansion gas  
Hartman and Benes             introduced a complementary force to the alignment that they call the change of leadership  This steer defines the chance of the bird to become a leader and try to escape 

Vicsek Models edit 
An early model from the domain of physics  the Vicsek model              gained attention in the study of flocking as a form active matter  a system where energy is continually added  unlike thermodynamic models  
Applied to collective motion and swarming  Vicsek models demonstrate that a simpler set of rules with just fixed speed  self propelled particles  and neighbor alignment  are able to achieve sub group flocking and milling  vortex structures   These models are attractive in physics due to their simplicity and universality 
Such models however  do not exhibit speed changes due to climbing and diving in flight  or complex phenomena such as orientation waves due to perceptual vision 

Aerodynamic Models edit 
Hemelrijk and Hildenbrandt             used attraction  alignment  and avoidance  and extended this with a number of traits of real starlings  

birds fly according to fixed wing aerodynamics  while rolling when turning  thus losing lift  
they coordinate with a limited number of interaction neighbours of    like real starlings  
they try to stay above a sleeping site  like starlings do at dawn   and when they happen to move outwards from the sleeping site  they return to it by turning  and
they move at relative fixed speed 
The authors showed that the specifics of flying behaviour as well as large flock size and low number of interaction partners were essential to the creation of the variable shape of flocks of starlings 

Orientation Models edit 
Hoetzlein             introduced the orientation model in      which separates the perceptual aspects of bird flight from the underlying aerodynamic model  linking these two control systems only by a heading target similar to real flight control  The perceptual model of each bird is orientation based  mapped to a sphere  more closely match the biological vision system  The output of perception is a target heading angle  not a vector   which is used to control an aerodynamic model much like a flight simulator  Energy and frequency analysis in this work bridge the study of real bird kinetics with simulation models  This model demonstrates emergent  spontaneous orientation waves for the first time  a key feature in flocking murmurations 

Complexity edit 
In flocking simulations  there is no central control  each bird behaves autonomously  In other words  each bird has to decide for itself which flocks to consider as its environment  
A basic implementation of a flocking algorithm has complexity 
  
    
      
        O
         
        
          n
          
             
          
        
         
      
    
      displaystyle O n      
  
   each bird could potentially interact and respond to every other bird  To limit complexity  it is assumed that birds only interact with a limited number of neighbors spatially in  D or  D  This was proven empirically in      by Ballerini et al                where it was shown that Starlings typically interact with at most seven topological neighbors  
Improvements  

Spatial Subdivision               The entire area volume of the flock is divided uniformly  Each bin stores which birds it contains  Each time a bird moves from one bin to another  bin contents are updated

        k
         
      
    
      displaystyle O nk  
  
  k is number of surrounding bins to consider 
Lee Spector  Jon Klein  Chris Perry and Mark Feinstein studied the emergence of collective behaviour in evolutionary computation systems             
Bernard Chazelle proved that under the assumption that each bird adjusts its velocity and position to the other birds within a fixed radius  the time it takes to converge to a steady state is an iterated exponential of height logarithmic in the number of birds  This means that if the number of birds is large enough  the convergence time will be so great that it might as well be infinite              This result applies only to convergence to a steady state  For example  arrows fired into the air at the edge of a flock will cause the whole flock to react more rapidly than can be explained by interactions with neighbors  which are slowed down by the time delay in the bird s central nervous systems bird to bird to bird 

Applications edit 
 Flock like behaviour in humans may occur when people are drawn to a common focal point or when repelled  as below  a crowd fleeing from the sound of gunfire 
In Cologne  Germany  two biologists from the University of Leeds demonstrated a flock like behaviour in humans  The group of people exhibited a very similar behavioural pattern to that of a flock  where if    of the flock would change direction the others would follow suit  When one person was designated as a predator and everyone else was to avoid him  the flock behaved very much like a school of fish             
Flocking has also been considered as a means of controlling the behaviour of Unmanned Air Vehicles  UAVs              
Flocking is a common technology in screensavers  and has found its use in animation  Flocking has been used in many films             to generate crowds which move more realistically  
Tim Burton s Batman Returns         featured flocking bats      improper synthesis      
Flocking behaviour has been used for other interesting applications  It has been applied to automatically program Internet multi channel radio stations             
It has also been used for visualizing information            
and for optimization tasks
