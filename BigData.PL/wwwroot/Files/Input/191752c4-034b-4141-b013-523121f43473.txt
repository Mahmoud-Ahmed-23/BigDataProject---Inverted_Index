							Egypt       s Financial Regulatory Authority  FRA  on Tuesday renewed its warning to all citizens against engaging with calls from individuals and entities  particularly via online platforms  to invest in financial products or deposit funds for investment purposes that violate Egyptian law  The authority emphasized that dealing with unlicensed entities exposes investors to significant risks and subjects the providers of such services to legal accountability 
As part of its oversight of non banking financial markets  the FRA stated it has observed an increase in online platforms and advertisements soliciting investments and offering financing without proper licensing  This includes entities promoting investments with promised returns without FRA approval or an accredited prospectus  which violates Capital Market Law No     of      and Law No      of      concerning companies receiving funds for investment 
The FRA specifically cautioned against engaging with solicitations for virtual cryptocurrencies  highlighting extreme risks  their association with financial crimes  lack of material backing  and severe legal penalties under Egyptian law for unlicensed trading or promotion  including imprisonment and fines ranging from EGP  m to EGP   m  Similarly  the authority urged citizens to avoid unlicensed gold investment schemes  clarifying that legitimate gold investment is regulated exclusively through FRA licensed investment fund units  with three such funds currently approved  rather than direct deals with unauthorized traders 
To protect investors  the FRA is updating its website with a list of licensed non bank financial entities and developing a        negative list        of unauthorized operators identified through reports and verification  The FRA is pursuing legal action against these illicit platforms and encourages citizens to report suspicious solicitations via email with supporting evidence 
The FRA emphasized that these awareness efforts aim to enhance financial literacy  protect investor rights  and maintain market stability  Companies planning public share offerings or seeking to receive funds for investment are advised to consult the FRA regarding legal and regulatory requirements beforehand
