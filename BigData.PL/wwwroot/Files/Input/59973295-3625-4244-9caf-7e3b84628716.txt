RCS methodology for knowledge acquisition and representation
Knowledge acquisition is the process used to define the rules and ontologies required for a knowledge based system  The phrase was first used in conjunction with expert systems to describe the initial tasks associated with developing an expert system  namely finding and interviewing domain experts and capturing their knowledge via rules  objects  and frame based ontologies  
Expert systems were one of the first successful applications of artificial intelligence technology to real world business problems             Researchers at Stanford and other AI laboratories worked with doctors and other highly skilled experts to develop systems that could automate complex tasks such as medical diagnosis  Until this point computers had mostly been used to automate highly data intensive tasks but not for complex reasoning  Technologies such as inference engines allowed developers for the first time to tackle more complex problems                        
As expert systems scaled up from demonstration prototypes to industrial strength applications it was soon realized that the acquisition of domain expert knowledge was one of if not the most critical task in the knowledge engineering process  This knowledge acquisition process became an intense area of research on its own  One of the earlier works            on the topic used Batesonian theories of learning to guide the process 
One approach to knowledge acquisition investigated was to use natural language parsing and generation to facilitate knowledge acquisition  Natural language parsing could be performed on manuals and other expert documents and an initial first pass at the rules and objects could be developed automatically  Text generation was also extremely useful in generating explanations for system behavior  This greatly facilitated the development and maintenance of expert systems            
A more recent approach to knowledge acquisition is a re use based approach  Knowledge can be developed in ontologies that conform to standards such as the Web Ontology Language  OWL              In this way knowledge can be standardized and shared across a broad community of knowledge workers  One example domain where this approach has been successful is bioinformatics            


Applications edit 
Knowledge acquisition has been applied to many fields beyond expert systems  including natural language processing  decision support systems  training simulations  and intelligent tutoring systems  It also plays an essential role in building knowledge based agents and cognitive architectures 

Techniques edit 
A variety of techniques exist for knowledge acquisition  ranging from manual to automatic methods  Manual approaches include structured interviews  protocol analysis  card sorting  and repertory grid analysis  Automated approaches include machine learning  data mining  and natural language processing
