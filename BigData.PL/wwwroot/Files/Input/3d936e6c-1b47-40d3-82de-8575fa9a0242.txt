A sovereign credit rating is the credit rating of a sovereign entity  such as a national government  The sovereign credit rating indicates the risk level of the investing environment of a country and is used by investors when looking to invest in particular jurisdictions  and also takes into account political risk 
The  country risk rankings  table shows the ten least risky countries for investment as of January               update       Ratings are further broken down into components including political risk  economic risk  Euromoney s bi annual country risk index monitors the political and economic stability of     sovereign countries  with Singapore often emerging as the least risky country since        it is also one of the only few countries in the world as well as the only in Asia to achieve a AAA sovereign credit rankings from all major credit agencies                        
Results focus foremost on economics  specifically sovereign default risk or payment default risk for exporters  also known as a trade credit risk   A  M  Best defines  country risk  as the risk that country specific factors could adversely affect an insurer s ability to meet its financial obligations            

Short and long term ratings edit 
A rating expresses the likelihood that the rated party will go into default within a given time horizon  In general  a time horizon of one year or under is considered short term  and anything above that is considered long term  In the past institutional investors preferred to consider long term ratings  Nowadays  short term ratings are commonly used      citation needed     

Corporate credit ratings edit 
Main article  Bond credit rating
Credit ratings can address a corporation s financial instruments i e  debt security such as a bond  but also the corporations itself  Ratings are assigned by credit rating agencies  the largest of which are Standard  amp  Poor s  Moody s and Fitch Ratings  They use letter designations such as A  B  C  Higher grades are intended to represent a lower probability of default 
Agencies do not attach a hard number of probability of default to each grade  preferring descriptive definitions such as   the obligor s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong   or  less vulnerable to non payment than other speculative issues    Standard and Poors  definition of an AAA rated and a BB rated bond respectively               However  some studies have estimated the average risk and reward of bonds by rating  One study by Moody s                       claimed that over a    year time horizon  bonds it gave its highest rating  Aaa  to had a  cumulative default rate  of        the next highest  Aa          the next  Baa                for the next  Ba    and        for the lowest it studied  B     See  Default rate  in  Estimated spreads and default rates by rating grade  table to right   Over a longer period  it stated  the order is by and large  but not exactly  preserved              
Another study in Journal of Finance calculated the additional interest rate or  spread  corporate bonds pay over that of  riskless  US Treasury bonds  according to the bonds  rating   See  Basis point spread  in table to right   Looking at rated bonds for          the authors found a AAA rated bond paid     basis points   or        of a percentage point  over a US Treasury bond  so that it would yield       if the Treasury yielded         A CCC rated  junk   or speculative  bond  on the other hand  paid over         basis points  more than a Treasury bond on average over that period                         
Different rating agencies may use variations of an alphabetical combination of lowercase and uppercase letters  with either plus or minus signs or numbers added to further fine tune the rating  see colored chart   The Standard  amp  Poor s rating scale uses uppercase letters and pluses and minuses             
The Moody s rating system uses numbers and lowercase letters as well as uppercase 
While Moody s  S amp P and Fitch Ratings control approximately     of the credit ratings business              they are not the only rating agencies  DBRS s long term ratings scale is somewhat similar to Standard  amp  Poor s and Fitch Ratings with the words high and low replacing the   and    It goes as follows  from excellent to poor  AAA  AA  high   AA  AA  low   A  high   A  A  low   BBB  high   BBB  BBB  low   BB  high   BB  BB  low   B  high   B  B  low   CCC  high   CCC  CCC  low   CC  high   CC  CC  low   C  high   C  C  low  and D  The short term ratings often map to long term ratings though there is room for exceptions at the high or low side of each equivalent             
S amp P  Moody s  Fitch and DBRS are the only four ratings agencies that are recognized by the European Central Bank  ECB  for determining collateral requirements for banks to borrow from the central bank  The ECB uses a first  best rule among the four agencies that have the designated ECAI status              which means that it takes the highest rating among the four agencies   S amp P  Moody s  Fitch and DBRS   to determine haircuts and collateral requirements for borrowing  Ratings in Europe have been under close scrutiny  particularly the highest ratings given to countries like Spain  Ireland and Italy  because they affect how much banks can borrow against sovereign debt they hold             
A  M  Best rates from excellent to poor in the following manner  A    A   A  A   B    B   B  B   C    C   C  C   D  E  F  and S  The CTRISKS rating system is as follows  CT A  CT A  CT A  CT B  CT B  CT B  CT C  CT C and CT C  All these CTRISKS grades are mapped to one year probability of default 
Under the EU Credit Rating Agency Regulation  CRAR   the European Banking Authority has developed a series of mapping tables that map ratings to the  Credit Quality Steps   CQS  as set out in regulatory capital rules and map the CQS to short run and long run benchmark default rates  These are provided in the table below
