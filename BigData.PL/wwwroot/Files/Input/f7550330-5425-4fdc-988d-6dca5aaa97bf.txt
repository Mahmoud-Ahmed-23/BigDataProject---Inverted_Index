Method of deriving conclusions


Modus ponens is one of the main rules of inference 
Rules of inference are ways of deriving conclusions from premises  They are integral parts of formal logic  serving as norms of the logical structure of valid arguments  If an argument with true premises follows a rule of inference then the conclusion cannot be false  Modus ponens  an influential rule of inference  connects two premises of the form  if 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 then 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle Q 
  
  and  
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
  to the conclusion  
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle Q 
  
   as in the argument  If it rains  then the ground is wet  It rains  Therefore  the ground is wet   There are many other rules of inference for different patterns of valid arguments  such as modus tollens  disjunctive syllogism  constructive dilemma  and existential generalization 
Rules of inference include rules of implication  which operate only in one direction from premises to conclusions  and rules of replacement  which state that two expressions are equivalent and can be freely swapped  Rules of inference contrast with formal fallacies invalid argument forms involving logical errors 
Rules of inference belong to logical systems  and distinct logical systems use different rules of inference  Propositional logic examines the inferential patterns of simple and compound propositions  First order logic extends propositional logic by articulating the internal structure of propositions  It introduces new rules of inference governing how this internal structure affects valid arguments  Modal logics explore concepts like possibility and necessity  examining the inferential structure of these concepts  Intuitionistic  paraconsistent  and many valued logics propose alternative inferential patterns that differ from the traditionally dominant approach associated with classical logic  Various formalisms are used to express logical systems  Some employ many intuitive rules of inference to reflect how people naturally reason while others provide minimalistic frameworks to represent foundational principles without redundancy 
Rules of inference are relevant to many areas  such as proofs in mathematics and automated reasoning in computer science  Their conceptual and psychological underpinnings are studied by philosophers of logic and cognitive psychologists 


Definition edit 
A rule of inference is a way of drawing a conclusion from a set of premises             Also called inference rule and transformation rule             it is a norm of correct inferences that can be used to guide reasoning  justify conclusions  and criticize arguments  As part of deductive logic  rules of inference are argument forms that preserve the truth of the premises  meaning that the conclusion is always true if the premises are true      a      An inference is deductively correct or valid if it follows a valid rule of inference  Whether this is the case depends only on the form or syntactical structure of the premises and the conclusion  As a result  the actual content or concrete meaning of the statements does not affect validity  For instance  modus ponens is a rule of inference that connects two premises of the form  if 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 then 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle Q 
  
  and  
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
  to the conclusion  
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle Q 
  
   where 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 and 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle Q 
  
 stand for statements  Any argument with this form is valid  independent of the specific meanings of 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 and 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle Q 
  
  such as the argument  If it rains  then the ground is wet  It rains  Therefore  the ground is wet   In addition to modus ponens  there are many other rules of inference  such as modus tollens  disjunctive syllogism  hypothetical syllogism  constructive dilemma  and destructive dilemma            
There are different formats to represent rules of inference  A common approach is to use a new line for each premise and separate the premises from the conclusion using a horizontal line  With this format  modus ponens is written as                 b     

  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                P
                  x     
                Q
              
            
            
              
                P
              
            
            
              
                Q
              
            
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle   begin array  l P to Q  P   hline Q end array   
  

Some logicians employ the therefore sign  
  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  therefore  
  
  together or instead of the horizontal line to indicate where the conclusion begins             The sequent notation  a different approach  uses a single line in which the premises are separated by commas and connected to the conclusion with the turnstile symbol  
  
    
      
          x  a  
      
    
      displaystyle  vdash  
  
   as in 
  
    
      
        P
          x     
        Q
         
        P
          x  a  
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle P to Q P vdash Q

 and 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle Q 
  
 in these formulas are so called metavariables  they stand for any simple or compound proposition            
Rules of inference belong to logical systems and distinct logical systems may use different rules of inference  For example  universal instantiation is a rule of inference in the system of first order logic but not in propositional logic              Rules of inference play a central role in proofs as explicit procedures for arriving at a new line of a proof based on the preceding lines  Proofs involve a series of inferential steps and often use various rules of inference to establish the theorem they intend to demonstrate              Rules of inference are definitory rules rules about which inferences are allowed  They contrast with strategic rules  which govern the inferential steps needed to prove a certain theorem from a specific set of premises  Mastering definitory rules by itself is not sufficient for effective reasoning since they provide little guidance on how to reach the intended conclusion              As standards or procedures governing the transformation of symbolic expressions  rules of inference are similar to mathematical functions taking premises as input and producing a conclusion as output  According to one interpretation  rules of inference are inherent in logical operators     c      found in statements  making the meaning and function of these operators explicit without adding any additional information             

George Boole             made key contributions to symbolic logic in general and propositional logic in particular             
Logicians distinguish two types of rules of inference  rules of implication and rules of replacement      d      Rules of implication  like modus ponens  operate only in one direction  meaning that the conclusion can be deduced from the premises but the premises cannot be deduced from the conclusion  Rules of replacement  by contrast  operate in both directions  stating that two expressions are equivalent and can be freely replaced with each other  In classical logic  for example  a proposition  
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
  is equivalent to the negation     e      of its negation  
  
    
      
          xac 
          xac 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  lnot  lnot P 
  
       f      As a result  one can infer one from the other in either direction  making it a rule of replacement  Other rules of replacement include De Morgan s laws as well as the commutative and associative properties of conjunction and disjunction  While rules of implication apply only to complete statements  rules of replacement can be applied to any part of a compound statement             
One of the earliest discussions of formal rules of inference is found in antiquity in Aristotle s logic  His explanations of valid and invalid syllogisms were further refined in medieval and early modern philosophy  The development of symbolic logic in the   th century led to the formulation of many additional rules of inference belonging to classical propositional and first order logic  In the   th and   st centuries  logicians developed various non classical systems of logic with alternative rules of inference             

Basic concepts edit 
Rules of inference describe the structure of arguments  which consist of premises that support a conclusion              Premises and conclusions are statements or propositions about what is true  For instance  the assertion  The door is open   is a statement that is either true or false  while the question  Is the door open   and the command  Open the door   are not statements and have no truth value              An inference is a step of reasoning from premises to a conclusion while an argument is the outward expression of an inference             
Logic is the study of correct reasoning and examines how to distinguish good from bad arguments              Deductive logic is the branch of logic that investigates the strongest arguments  called deductively valid arguments  for which the conclusion cannot be false if all the premises are true  This is expressed by saying that the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises  Rules of inference belong to deductive logic and describe argument forms that fulfill this requirement              In order to precisely assess whether an argument follows a rule of inference  logicians use formal languages to express statements in a rigorous manner  similar to mathematical formulas              They combine formal languages with rules of inference to construct formal systems frameworks for formulating propositions and drawing conclusions      g      Different formal systems may employ different formal languages or different rules of inference              The basic rules of inference within a formal system can often be expanded by introducing new rules of inference  known as admissible rules  Admissible rules do not change which arguments in a formal system are valid but can simplify proofs  If an admissible rule can be expressed through a combination of the system s basic rules  it is called a derived or derivable rule              Statements that can be deduced in a formal system are called theorems of this formal system              Widely used systems of logic include propositional logic  first order logic  and modal logic             
Rules of inference only ensure that the conclusion is true if the premises are true  An argument with false premises can still be valid  but its conclusion could be false  For example  the argument  If pigs can fly  then the sky is purple  Pigs can fly  Therefore  the sky is purple   is valid because it follows modus ponens  even though it contains false premises  A valid argument is called sound argument if all premises are true             
Rules of inference are closely related to tautologies  In logic  a tautology is a statement that is true only because of the logical vocabulary it uses  independent of the meanings of its non logical vocabulary  For example  the statement  if the tree is green and the sky is blue then the tree is green  is true independently of the meanings of terms like tree and green  making it a tautology  Every argument following a rule of inference can be transformed into a tautology  This is achieved by forming a conjunction  and  of all premises and connecting it through implication  if     then      to the conclusion  thereby combining all the individual statements of the argument into a single statement  For example  the valid argument  The tree is green and the sky is blue  Therefore  the tree is green   can be transformed into the tautology  if the tree is green and the sky is blue then the tree is green               Rules of inference are also closely related to laws of thought  which are basic principles of logic that can take the form tautologies  For example  the law of identity asserts that each entity is identical to itself  Other traditional laws of thought include the law of non contradiction and the law of excluded middle             
Rules of inference are not the only way to demonstrate that an argument is valid  Alternative methods include the use of truth tables  which applies to propositional logic  and truth trees  which can also be employed in first order logic             

Systems of logic edit

Propositional logic edit 
Main article  Propositional logic
Propositional logic examines the inferential patterns of simple and compound propositions  It uses letters  such as 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 and 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle Q 
  
  to represent simple propositions  Compound propositions are formed by modifying or combining simple propositions with logical operators  such as 
  
    
      
          xac 
      
    
      displaystyle  lnot  
  
  not

      displaystyle  to  
  
  if     then       For example  if 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 stands for the statement  it is raining  and 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle Q 
  
 stands for the statement  the streets are wet   then 
  
    
      
          xac 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  lnot P 
  
 expresses  it is not raining  and 
  
    
      
        P
          x     
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle P to Q 
  
 expresses  if it is raining then the streets are wet   These logical operators are truth functional  meaning that the truth value of a compound proposition depends only on the truth values of the simple propositions composing it  For instance  the compound proposition  
  
    
      
        P
          x     
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle P land Q 
  
 is only true if both 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 and 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle Q 
  
 are true  in all other cases  it is false  Propositional logic is not concerned with the concrete meaning of propositions other than their truth values              Key rules of inference in propositional logic are modus ponens  modus tollens  hypothetical syllogism  disjunctive syllogism  and double negation elimination  Further rules include conjunction introduction  conjunction elimination  disjunction introduction  disjunction elimination  constructive dilemma  destructive dilemma  absorption  and De Morgan s laws

First order logic edit 
Main article  First order logic
As one of the founding fathers of modern logic  Gottlob Frege             explored some of the foundational concepts of first order logic             
First order logic also employs the logical operators from propositional logic but includes additional devices to articulate the internal structure of propositions  Basic propositions in first order logic consist of a predicate  symbolized with uppercase letters like 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 and 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle Q 
  
  which is applied to singular terms  symbolized with lowercase letters like 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
      displaystyle a 
  
 and 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
      displaystyle b 
  
  For example  if 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
      displaystyle a 
  
 stands for  Aristotle  and 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 stands for  is a philosopher   the formula 
  
    
      
        P
         
        a
         
      
    
      displaystyle P a  
  
 means that  Aristotle is a philosopher   Another innovation of first order logic is the use of the quantifiers 
  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  exists  
  
 and 
  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  forall  
  
  which express that a predicate applies to some or all individuals  For instance  the formula 
  
    
      
          x     
        x
        P
         
        x
         
      
    
      displaystyle  exists xP x  
  
 expresses that philosophers exist while 
  
    
      
          x     
        x
        P
         
        x
         
      
    
      displaystyle  forall xP x  
  
 expresses that everyone is a philosopher  The rules of inference from propositional logic are also valid in first order logic              Additionally  first order logic introduces new rules of inference that govern the role of singular terms  predicates  and quantifiers in arguments  Key rules of inference are universal instantiation and existential generalization  Other rules of inference include universal generalization and existential instantiation

                  Everyone must pay taxes

      displaystyle   begin array  l   text Everyone must pay taxes      hline   text Therefore  Wesley must pay taxes    end array   
  



Existential generalization

  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                P
                 
                a
                 
              
            
            
              
                  x     
                x
                P
                 
                x
                 
              
            
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle   begin array  l P a    hline  exists xP x  end array   
  


  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                
                  Socrates is mortal 
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  Therefore  someone is mortal 
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle   begin array  l   text Socrates is mortal      hline   text Therefore  someone is mortal    end array   
  


Modal logics edit 
Main article  Modal logic
Modal logics are formal systems that extend propositional logic and first order logic with additional logical operators  Alethic modal logic introduces the operator 
  
    
      
          x  ca 
      
    
      displaystyle  Diamond  
  
 to express that something is possible and the operator 
  
    
      
          x  fb 
      
    
      displaystyle  Box  
  
 to express that something is necessary  For example  if the 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 means that  Parvati works   then 
  
    
      
          x  ca 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  Diamond P 
  
 means that  It is possible that Parvati works  while 
  
    
      
          x  fb 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  Box P 
  
 means that  It is necessary that Parvati works   These two operators are related by a rule of replacement stating that 
  
    
      
          x  fb 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  Box P 
  
 is equivalent to 
  
    
      
          xac 
          x  ca 
          xac 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  lnot  Diamond  lnot P 
  
  In other words  if something is necessarily true then it is not possible that it is not true  Further rules of inference include the necessitation rule  which asserts that a statement is necessarily true if it is provable in a formal system without any additional premises  and the distribution axiom  which allows one to derive 
  
    
      
          x  ca 
        P
          x     
          x  ca 
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle  Diamond P to  Diamond Q 
  
 from 
  
    
      
          x  ca 
         
        P
          x     
        Q
         
      
    
      displaystyle  Diamond  P to Q  
  
  These rules of inference belong to system K  a weak form of modal logic with only the most basic rules of inference  Many formal systems of alethic modal logic include additional rules of inference  such as system T  which allows one to deduce 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 from 
  
    
      
          x  ca 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  Diamond P 
  
             
Non alethic systems of modal logic introduce operators that behave like 
  
    
      
          x  ca 
      
    
      displaystyle  Diamond  
  
 and 
  
    
      
          x  fb 
      
    
      displaystyle  Box  
  
 in alethic modal logic  following similar rules of inference but with different meanings  Deontic logic is one type of non alethic logic  It uses the operator 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 to express that an action is permitted and the operator 
  
    
      
        O
      
    
      displaystyle O 
  
 to express that an action is required  where 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 behaves similarly to 
  
    
      
          x  ca 
      
    
      displaystyle  Diamond  
  
 and 
  
    
      
        O
      
    
      displaystyle O 
  
 behaves similarly to 
  
    
      
          x  fb 
      
    
      displaystyle  Box  
  
  For instance  the rule of replacement in alethic modal logic asserting that 
  
    
      
          x  fb 
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle  Box Q 
  
 is equivalent to 
  
    
      
          xac 
          x  ca 
          xac 
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle  lnot  Diamond  lnot Q 
  
 also applies to deontic logic  As a result  one can deduce from 
  
    
      
        O
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle OQ 
  
  e g  Quinn has an obligation to help  that 
  
    
      
          xac 
        P
          xac 
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle  lnot P lnot Q 
  
  e g  Quinn is not permitted not to help               Other systems of modal logic include temporal modal logic  which has operators for what is always or sometimes the case  as well as doxastic and epistemic modal logics  which have operators for what people believe and know             

Others edit 
The rules of inference in Aristotle s          BCE  logic have the form of syllogisms             
Many other systems of logic have been proposed  One of the earliest systems is Aristotelian logic  according to which each statement is made up of two terms  a subject and a predicate  connected by a copula  For example  the statement  all humans are mortal  has the subject  all humans   the predicate  mortal   and the copula  is   All rules of inference in Aristotelian logic have the form of syllogisms  which consist of two premises and a conclusion  For instance  the Barbara rule of inference describes the validity of arguments of the form  All men are mortal  All Greeks are men  Therefore  all Greeks are mortal              
Second order logic extends first order logic by allowing quantifiers to apply to predicates in addition to singular terms  For example  to express that the individuals Adam  
  
    
      
        a
      
    
      displaystyle a 
  
  and Bianca  
  
    
      
        b
      
    
      displaystyle b 
  
  share a property  one can use the formula 
  
    
      
          x     
        X
         
        X
         
        a
         
          x     
        X
         
        b
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle  exists X X a  land X b   
  
              Second order logic also comes with new rules of inference      i      For instance  one can infer 
  
    
      
        P
         
        a
         
      
    
      displaystyle P a  
  
  Adam is a philosopher  from 
  
    
      
          x     
        X
        X
         
        a
         
      
    
      displaystyle  forall XX a  
  
  every property applies to Adam              
Intuitionistic logic is a non classical variant of propositional and first order logic  It shares with them many rules of inference  such as modus ponens  but excludes certain rules  For example  in classical logic  one can infer 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 from 
  
    
      
          xac 
          xac 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  lnot  lnot P 
  
 using the rule of double negation elimination  However  in intuitionistic logic  this inference is invalid  As a result  every theorem that can be deduced in intuitionistic logic can also be deduced in classical logic  but some theorems provable in classical logic cannot be proven in intuitionistic logic             
Paraconsistent logics revise classical logic to allow the existence of contradictions  In logic  a contradiction happens if the same proposition is both affirmed and denied  meaning that a formal system contains both 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 and 
  
    
      
          xac 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  lnot P 
  
 as theorems  Classical logic prohibits contradictions because classical rules of inference lead to the principle of explosion  an admissible rule of inference that makes it possible to infer 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle Q 
  
 from the premises 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 and 
  
    
      
          xac 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  lnot P 
  
  Since 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle Q 
  
 is unrelated to 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
  any arbitrary statement can be deduced from a contradiction  making the affected systems useless for deciding what is true and false              Paraconsistent logics solve this problem by modifying the rules of inference in such a way that the principle of explosion is not an admissible rule of inference  As a result  it is possible to reason about inconsistent information without deriving absurd conclusions             
Many valued logics modify classical logic by introducing additional truth values  In classical logic  a proposition is either true or false with nothing in between  In many valued logics  some propositions are neither true nor false  Kleene logic  for example  is a three valued logic that introduces the additional truth value undefined to describe situations where information is incomplete or uncertain              Many valued logics have adjusted rules of inference to accommodate the additional truth values  For instance  the classical rule of replacement stating that 
  
    
      
        P
          x     
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle P to Q 
  
 is equivalent to 
  
    
      
          xac 
        P
          x     
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle  lnot P lor Q 
  
 is invalid in many three valued systems             

Formalisms edit 
Various formalisms or proof systems have been suggested as distinct ways of codifying reasoning and demonstrating the validity of arguments  Unlike different systems of logic  these formalisms do not impact what can be proven  they only influence how proofs are formulated  Influential frameworks include natural deduction systems  Hilbert systems  and sequent calculi             
Natural deduction systems aim to reflect how people naturally reason by introducing many intuitive rules of inference to make logical derivations more accessible  They break complex arguments into simple steps  often using subproofs based on temporary premises  The rules of inference in natural deduction target specific logical operators  governing how an operator can be added with introduction rules or removed with elimination rules  For example  the rule of conjunction introduction asserts that one can infer 
  
    
      
        P
          x     
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle P land Q 
  
 from the premises 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 and 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle Q 
  
  thereby producing a conclusion with the conjunction operator from premises that do not contain it  Conversely  the rule of conjunction elimination asserts that one can infer 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 from 
  
    
      
        P
          x     
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle P land Q 
  
  thereby producing a conclusion that no longer includes the conjunction operator  Similar rules of inference are disjunction introduction and elimination  implication introduction and elimination  negation introduction and elimination  and biconditional introduction and elimination  As a result  systems of natural deduction usually include many rules of inference                  j     
Hilbert systems  by contrast  aim to provide a minimal and efficient framework of logical reasoning by including as few rules of inference as possible  Many Hilbert systems only have modus ponens as the sole rule of inference  To ensure that all theorems can be deduced from this minimal foundation  they introduce axiom schemes              An axiom scheme is a template to create axioms or true statements  It uses metavariables  which are placeholders that can be replaced by specific terms or formulas to generate an infinite number of true statements              For example  propositional logic can be defined with the following three axiom schemes      
  
    
      
        P
          x     
         
        Q
          x     
        P
         
      
    
      displaystyle P to  Q to P  
  
      
  
    
      
         
        P
          x     
         
        Q
          x     
        R
         
         
          x     
         
         
        P
          x     
        Q
         
          x     
         
        P
          x     
        R
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle  P to  Q to R   to   P to Q  to  P to R   
  
  and     
  
    
      
         
          xac 
        P
          x     
          xac 
        Q
         
          x     
         
        Q
          x     
        P
         
      
    
      displaystyle   lnot P to  lnot Q  to  Q to P  
  
              To formulate proofs  logicians create new statements from axiom schemes and then apply modus ponens to these statements to derive conclusions  Compared to natural deduction  this procedure tends to be less intuitive since its heavy reliance on symbolic manipulation can obscure the underlying logical reasoning             
Sequent calculi  another approach  introduce sequents as formal representations of arguments  A sequent has the form 
  
    
      
        
          A
          
             
          
        
         
          x     
         
        
          A
          
            m
          
        
          x  a  
        
          B
          
             
          
        
         
          x     
         
        
          B
          
            n
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle A      dots  A  m  vdash B      dots  B  n  
  
  where 
  
    
      
        
          A
          
            i
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle A  i  
  
 and 
  
    
      
        
          B
          
            i
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle B  i  
  
 stand for propositions  Sequents are conditional assertions stating that at least one 
  
    
      
        
          B
          
            i
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle B  i  
  
 is true if all 
  
    
      
        
          A
          
            i
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle A  i  
  
 are true  Rules of inference operate on sequents to produce additional sequents  Sequent calculi define two rules of inference for each logical operator  one to introduce it on the left side of a sequent and another to introduce it on the right side  For example  through the rule for introducing the operator 
  
    
      
          xac 
      
    
      displaystyle  lnot  
  
 on the left side  one can infer 
  
    
      
          xac 
        R
         
        P
          x  a  
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle  lnot R P vdash Q 
  
 from 
  
    
      
        P
          x  a  
        Q
         
        R
      
    
      displaystyle P vdash Q R 
  
  The cut rule  an additional rule of inference  makes it possible to simplify sequents by removing certain propositions             

Formal fallacies edit 
Main article  Formal fallacy
While rules of inference describe valid patterns of deductive reasoning  formal fallacies are invalid argument forms that involve logical errors  The premises of a formal fallacy do not properly support its conclusion  the conclusion can be false even if all premises are true  Formal fallacies often mimic the structure of valid rules of inference and can thereby mislead people into unknowingly committing them and accepting their conclusions             
The formal fallacy of affirming the consequent concludes 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 from the premises 
  
    
      
        P
          x     
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle P to Q 
  
 and 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle Q 
  
  as in the argument  If Leo is a cat  then Leo is an animal  Leo is an animal  Therefore  Leo is a cat   This fallacy resembles valid inferences following modus ponens  with the key difference that the fallacy swaps the second premise and the conclusion              The formal fallacy of denying the antecedent concludes 
  
    
      
          xac 
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle  lnot Q 
  
 from the premises 
  
    
      
        P
          x     
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle P to Q 
  
 and 
  
    
      
          xac 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  lnot P 
  
  as in the argument  If Laya saw the movie  then Laya had fun  Laya did not see the movie  Therefore  Laya did not have fun   This fallacy resembles valid inferences following modus tollens  with the key difference that the fallacy swaps the second premise and the conclusion              Other formal fallacies include affirming a disjunct  the existential fallacy  and the fallacy of the undistributed middle             

In various fields edit 
Rules of inference are relevant to many fields  especially the formal sciences  such as mathematics and computer science  where they are used to prove theorems              Mathematical proofs often start with a set of axioms to describe the logical relationships between mathematical constructs  To establish theorems  mathematicians apply rules of inference to these axioms  aiming to demonstrate that the theorems are logical consequences              Mathematical logic  a subfield of mathematics and logic  uses mathematical methods and frameworks to study rules of inference and other logical concepts             
Computer science also relies on deductive reasoning  employing rules of inference to establish theorems and validate algorithms              Logic programming frameworks  such as Prolog  allow developers to represent knowledge and use computation to draw inferences and solve problems              These frameworks often include an automated theorem prover  a program that uses rules of inference to generate or verify proofs automatically              Expert systems utilize automated reasoning to simulate the decision making processes of human experts in specific fields  such as medical diagnosis  and assist in complex problem solving tasks  They have a knowledge base to represent the facts and rules of the field and use an inference engine to extract relevant information and respond to user queries             
Rules of inference are central to the philosophy of logic regarding the contrast between deductive theoretic and model theoretic conceptions of logical consequence  Logical consequence  a fundamental concept in logic  is the relation between the premises of a deductively valid argument and its conclusion  Conceptions of logical consequence explain the nature of this relation and the conditions under which it exists  The deductive theoretic conception relies on rules of inference  arguing that logical consequence means that the conclusion can be deduced from the premises through a series of inferential steps  The model theoretic conception  by contrast  focuses on how the non logical vocabulary of statements can be interpreted  According to this view  logical consequence means that no counterexamples are possible  under no interpretation are the premises true and the conclusion false             
Cognitive psychologists study mental processes  including logical reasoning  They are interested in how humans use rules of inference to draw conclusions  examining the factors that influence correctness and efficiency  They observe that humans are better at using some rules of inference than others  For example  the rate of successful inferences is higher for modus ponens than for modus tollens  A related topic focuses on biases that lead individuals to mistake formal fallacies for valid arguments  For instance  fallacies of the types affirming the consequent and denying the antecedent are often mistakenly accepted as valid  The assessment of arguments also depends on the concrete meaning of the propositions  individuals are more likely to accept a fallacy if its conclusion sounds plausible

Notes edit 


  Non deductive arguments  by contrast  support the conclusion without ensuring that it is true  such as inductive and abductive reasoning            

  The symbol 
  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  to  
  
 in this formula means if     then      expressing material implication            

  Logical operators or constants are expressions used to form and connect propositions  such as not  or  and if   then                

  According to a narrow definition  rules of inference only encompass rules of implication but do not include rules of replacement             

  Logicians use the symbols 
  
    
      
          xac 
      
    
      displaystyle  lnot  
  
 or 
  
    
      
          x   c 
      
    
      displaystyle  sim  
  
 to express negation             

  Rules of replacement are sometimes expressed using a double semi colon  For instance  the double negation rule can be written as 
  
    
      
        P
          
          xac 
          xac 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P   lnot  lnot P 
  
             

  Additionally  formal systems may also define axioms or axiom schemas             

  This example assumes that 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
      displaystyle a 
  
 refers to an individual in the domain of discourse 

  An important difference between first order and second order logic is that second order logic is incomplete  meaning that it is not possible to provide a finite set of rules of inference with which every theorem can be deduced             

  The Fitch notation is an influential way of presenting proofs in natural deduction systems
