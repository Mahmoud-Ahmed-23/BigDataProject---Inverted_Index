Sir Michael James Lighthill FRS     FRAeS                January                July       was a British applied mathematician  known for his pioneering work in the field of aeroacoustics                                                        and for writing the Lighthill report in       which pessimistically stated that  In no part of the field  of AI  have the discoveries made so far produced the major impact that was then promised   contributing to the gloomy climate of AI winter            


Education and early life edit 
James Lighthill was born to Ernest Balzar Lichtenberg and Marjorie Holmes  an Alsatian mining engineer who changed his name to Lighthill in       and the daughter of an engineer  The family lived in Paris until       when the father retired and returned to live in England  As a young man  James Lighthill was known as Michael Lighthill            
Lighthill was educated at Winchester College  and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Cambridge where he was an undergraduate student of Trinity College  Cambridge in                   

Career and research edit 
Lighthill specialised in fluid dynamics  and worked at the National Physical Laboratory at Trinity  Between      and      he was Beyer Professor of Applied Mathematics at the University of Manchester  Lighthill then moved from Manchester to become director of the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough  There he worked on the development of television and communications satellites  and on the development of crewed spacecraft  This latter work was used in the development of the Concorde supersonic airliner 
In       together with Gerald B  Whitham  Lighthill set out the first comprehensive theory of kinematic waves                          an application of the method of characteristics   with a multitude of applications  prime among them fluid flow and traffic flow 
Lighthill s early work included two dimensional aerofoil theory  and supersonic flow around solids of revolution  In addition to the dynamics of gas at high speeds  he studied shock and blast waves and introduced the squirmer model  He is credited with founding the subject of aeroacoustics  a subject vital to the reduction of noise in jet engines  Lighthill s eighth power law states that the acoustic power radiated by a jet engine is proportional to the eighth power of the jet speed              He also founded non linear acoustics  and showed that the same non linear differential equations could model both flood waves in rivers and traffic flow in highways             
In      he became the Royal Society s resident professor in Imperial College London  before returning to Trinity College  Cambridge  five years later as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics  a chair he held until       when he was succeeded by Stephen Hawking  Lighthill then became Provost of University College London  UCL         a post he held until      
Lighthill founded the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications  IMA  in       alongside Professor Sir Bryan Thwaites  In       he was awarded an Honorary Degree  Doctor of Science  by the University of Bath              In      he was invited to deliver the  MacMillan Memorial Lecture to the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland  He chose the subject  Aquatic Animal Locomotion              
In the early     s  partly in reaction to significant internal discord within that field  the Science Research Council  SRC   as it was then known  asked Lighthill to compile a review of academic research in Artificial Intelligence  Lighthill s report  which was published in      and became known as the  Lighthill report   was highly critical of basic research in foundational areas such as robotics and language processing  and  formed the basis for the decision by the British government to end support for AI research in all but two universities               starting what is sometimes referred to as the  AI winter  
In       Lighthill and Alan B  Tayler were jointly awarded the first ever Gold Medal of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications in recognition of their  outstanding contributions to mathematics and its applications over a period of years               In      Lighthill was awarded the Ludwig Prandtl Ring from the Deutsche Gesellschaft f r Luft  und Raumfahrt  German Society for Aeronautics and Astronautics  for  outstanding contribution in the field of aerospace engineering  
His former students include Gerald B  Whitham            and Steve Furber

His hobby was open water swimming  He died in the water in      when the mitral valve in his heart ruptured while he was swimming round the island of Sark  a feat which he had accomplished many times before
