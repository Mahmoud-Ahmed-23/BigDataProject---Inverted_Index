A data set  or dataset  is a collection of data  In the case of tabular data  a data set corresponds to one or more database tables  where every column of a table represents a particular variable  and each row corresponds to a given record of the data set in question  The data set lists values for each of the variables  such as for example height and weight of an object  for each member of the data set   Data sets can also consist of a collection of documents or files            
In the open data discipline  A dataset is a unit used to measure the amount of information released in a public open data repository   The European data europa eu portal aggregates more than a million data sets            


Properties edit 
Several characteristics define a data set s structure and properties   These include the number and types of the attributes or variables  and various statistical measures applicable to them  such as standard deviation and kurtosis            
The values may be numbers  such as real numbers or integers  for example representing a person s height in centimeters  but may also be nominal data  i e   not consisting of numerical values   for example representing a person s ethnicity  More generally  values may be of any of the kinds described as a level of measurement  For each variable  the values are normally all of the same kind  Missing values may exist  which must be indicated somehow 
In statistics  data sets usually come from actual observations obtained by sampling a statistical population  and each row corresponds to the observations on one element of that population  Data sets may further be generated by algorithms for the purpose of testing certain kinds of software   Some modern statistical analysis software such as SPSS still present their data in the classical data set fashion   If data is missing or suspicious an imputation method may be used to complete a data set
