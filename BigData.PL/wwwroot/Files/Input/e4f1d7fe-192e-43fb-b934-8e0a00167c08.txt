A neural network is a group of interconnected units called neurons that send signals to one another  Neurons can be either biological cells or mathematical models  While individual neurons are simple  many of them together in a network can perform complex tasks  There are two main types of neural networks 

In neuroscience  a biological neural network is a physical structure found in brains and complex nervous systems   a population of nerve cells connected by synapses 
In machine learning  an artificial neural network is a mathematical model used to approximate nonlinear functions  Artificial neural networks are used to solve artificial intelligence problems

In the context of biology  a neural network is a population of biological neurons chemically connected to each other by synapses  A given neuron can be connected to hundreds of thousands of synapses            
Each neuron sends and receives electrochemical signals called action potentials to its connected neighbors  A neuron can serve an excitatory role  amplifying and propagating signals it receives  or an inhibitory role  suppressing signals instead            
Populations of interconnected neurons that are smaller than neural networks are called neural circuits  Very large interconnected networks are called large scale brain networks  and many of these together form brains and nervous systems 
Signals generated by neural networks in the brain eventually travel through the nervous system and across neuromuscular junctions to muscle cells  where they cause contraction and thereby motion

In machine learning  a neural network is an artificial mathematical model used to approximate nonlinear functions  While early artificial neural networks were physical machines             today they are almost always implemented in software 
Neurons in an artificial neural network are usually arranged into layers  with information passing from the first layer  the input layer  through one or more intermediate layers  the hidden layers  to the final layer  the output layer             
The  signal  input to each neuron is a number  specifically a linear combination of the outputs of the connected neurons in the previous layer  The signal each neuron outputs is calculated from this number  according to its activation function  The behavior of the network depends on the strengths  or weights  of the connections between neurons  A network is trained by modifying these weights through empirical risk minimization or backpropagation in order to fit some preexisting dataset            
The term deep neural network refers to neural networks that have more than three layers  typically including at least two hidden layers in addition to the input and output layers 
Neural networks are used to solve problems in artificial intelligence  and have thereby found applications in many disciplines  including predictive modeling  adaptive control  facial recognition  handwriting recognition  general game playing  and generative AI

The theoretical base for contemporary neural networks was independently proposed by Alexander Bain in                 and William James in                  Both posited that human thought emerged from interactions among large numbers of neurons inside the brain  In       Donald Hebb described Hebbian learning  the idea that neural networks can change and learn over time by strengthening a synapse every time a signal travels along it            
Artificial neural networks were originally used to model biological neural networks starting in the     s under the approach of connectionism  However  starting with the invention of the perceptron  a simple artificial neural network  by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in                  followed by the implementation of one in hardware by Frank Rosenblatt in                 
artificial neural networks became increasingly used for machine learning applications instead  and increasingly different from their biological counterparts
