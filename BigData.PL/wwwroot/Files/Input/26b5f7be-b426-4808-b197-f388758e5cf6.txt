                                                                Python is the most used language in top companies such as Intel  IBM  NASA  Pixar  Netflix  Facebook  JP Morgan Chase  Spotify and many more because of its simplicity and powerful libraries  To crack their Online Assessment and Interview Rounds as a Python developer  we need to master important Python Interview Questions  We have prepared a list of the Top    Python Interview Questions along with their answers to ace interviews 
Python Interview Questions for Freshers   Is Python a compiled language or an interpreted language Please remember one thing  whether a language is compiled or interpreted or both is not defined in the language standard  In other words  it is not a properly of a programming language  Different Python distributions  or implementations  choose to do different things  compile or interpret or both    However the most common implementations like CPython do both compile and interpret  but in different stages of its execution process 
Compilation  When you write Python code and run it  the source code   py files  is first compiled into an intermediate form called bytecode   pyc files   This bytecode is a lower level representation of your code  but it is still not directly machine code  It s something that the Python Virtual Machine  PVM  can understand and execute Interpretation  After Python code is compiled into bytecode  it is executed by the Python Virtual Machine  PVM   which is an interpreter  The PVM reads the bytecode and executes it line by line at runtime  which is why Python is considered an interpreted language in practice Some implementations  like PyPy  use Just In Time  JIT  compilation  where Python code is compiled into machine code at runtime for faster execution  blurring the lines between interpretation and compilation 
   How can you concatenate two lists in Python We can concatenate two lists in Python using the  operator or the extend   method 
   Using the   operator 
This creates a new list by joining two lists together 

            Python

    a            
b            
res   a   b
print res  

Output                  
   Using the extend   method 
This adds all the elements of the second list to the first list in place 

            Python

    a            
b            
a extend b 
print a  

Output                  
   Difference between for loop and while loop in PythonFor loop  Used when we know how many times to repeat  often with lists  tuples  sets  or dictionaries While loop  Used when we only have an end condition and don t know exactly how many times it will repeat 
            Python

    for i in range    
    print i 

c    
while c  lt    
    print c 
    c     

   How do you floor a number in Python To floor a number in Python  you can use the math floor   function  which returns the largest integer less than or equal to the given number 
floor   method in Python returns the floor of x i e   the largest integer not greater than x  nbsp Also  The method ceil x  in Python returns a ceiling value of x i e   the smallest integer greater than or equal to x 
            Python

    import math

n      
F num   math floor n 

print F num  

Output 
   What is the difference between   and    in Python   represents precise division  result is a floating point number  whereas    represents floor division  result is an integer   For Example 

            Python

    print      
print     

   Is Indentation Required in Python Yes  indentation is required in Python  A Python interpreter can be informed that a group of statements belongs to a specific block of code by using Python indentation  Indentations make the code easy to read for developers in all programming languages but in Python  it is very important to indent the code in a specific order 
Python Indentation   Can we Pass a function as an argument in Python Yes  Several arguments can be passed to a function  including objects  variables  of the same or distinct data types  and functions  Functions can be passed as parameters to other functions because they are objects  Higher order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments 

            Python

    def add x  y  
    return x   y

def apply func func  a  b  
    return func a  b 

print apply func add        

The add function is passed as an argument to apply func  which applies it to   and   
   What is a dynamically typed language In a dynamically typed language  the data type of a variable is determined at runtime  not at compile time No need to declare data types manually  Python automatically detects it based on the assigned value Examples of dynamically typed languages  Python  JavaScript Examples of statically typed languages  C  C    Java Dynamically typed languages are easier and faster to code Statically typed languages are usually faster to execute due to type checking at compile time Example 

            Python

    x              x is an integer
x    quot Hello quot     Now x is a string

Here  the type of x changes at runtime based on the assigned value hence it shows dynamic nature of Python 
   What is pass in Python The pass statement is a placeholder that does nothing It is used when a statement is syntactically required but no code needs to run Commonly used when defining empty functions  classes or loops during development 
            Python

    def fun   
    pass    Placeholder  no functionality yet

  Call the function
fun  

Here  fun   does nothing  but the code stays syntactically correct 
    How are arguments passed by value or by reference in Python Python s argument passing model is nbsp neither  Pass by Value  nor  Pass by Reference  but it is  Pass by Object Reference   nbsp Depending on the type of object you pass in the function  the function behaves differently  Immutable objects show  pass by value  whereas mutable objects show  pass by reference  You can check the difference between pass by value and pass by reference in the example below 

            Python

    def call by val x  
    x   x    
    print  quot value updated to quot   x 
    return

def call by ref b  
    b append  quot D quot  
    print  quot list updated to quot   b 
    return

a     quot E quot  
num    

call by val num 

call by ref a 

Outputvalue updated to   
list updated to   E    D  
    What is a lambda function A lambda function is an anonymous function  This function can have any number of parameters but  can have just one statement  
In the example  we defined a lambda function upper  to convert a string to its upper case using nbsp upper   

            Python

    s         GeeksforGeeks     

s    lambda func  func upper  
print s  s   

OutputGEEKSFORGEEKS
    What is List Comprehension  Give an Example List comprehension nbsp is a way to create lists using a concise syntax  It allows us to generate a new list by applying an nbsp expression nbsp to each item in an existing nbsp iterable nbsp  such as a nbsp list nbsp or nbsp range   This helps us to write cleaner  more readable code compared to traditional looping techniques 
For example  if we have a list of integers and want to create a new list containing the square of each element  we can easily achieve this using list comprehension 

            Python

    a            
res    val      for val in a 
print res 

Output              
    What are  args and   kwargs  args  The special syntax nbsp  args nbsp in function definitions nbsp is used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function  Python program to illustrate  args for a variable number of arguments 
            Python

    def fun  argv  
    for arg in argv 
        print arg 

fun      Hello            Welcome            to            GeeksforGeeks      

OutputHello
Welcome
to
GeeksforGeeks
  kwargs  The special syntax   kwargs in function definitions is used to pass a variable length argument list  We use the name kwargs with the double star    
            Python

    def fun   kwargs  
    for k  val in kwargs items   
        print  quot  s     s quot     k  val  


  Driver code
fun s       Geeks       s       for       s       Geeks      

Outputs     Geeks
s     for
s     Geeks
    What is a break  continue and pass in Python  nbsp Break statement is used to terminate the loop or statement in which it is present  After that  the control will pass to the statements that are present after the break statement  if available Continue is also a loop control statement just like the break statement  continue statement is opposite to that of the break statement  instead of terminating the loop  it forces to execute the next iteration of the loop Pass means performing no operation or in other words  it is a placeholder in the compound statement  where there should be a blank left and nothing has to be written there     What is the difference between a Set and Dictionary A nbsp Python Set nbsp is an unordered collection data type that is iterable  mutable and has no duplicate elements  Python s set class represents the mathematical notion of a set Syntax  Defined using curly braces    or the set   function my set            
Dictionary nbsp in Python is an ordered  since Py       unordered  Py      amp  prior   collection of data values  used to store data values like a map  which  unlike other Data Types that hold only a single value as an element  Dictionary holds nbsp key value nbsp pair  Key value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized Syntax  Defined using curly braces    with key value pairs my dict           a                   b                   c           
    What are Built in data types in Python The following are the standard or built in data types in Python 
Numeric  The numeric data type in Python represents the data that has a numeric value  A numeric value can be an integer  a floating number  a Boolean  or even a complex number Sequence Type  The sequence Data Type in Python is the ordered collection of similar or different data types  There are several sequence types in Python Python StringPython ListPython TuplePython rangeMapping Types  In Python  hashable data can be mapped to random objects using a mapping object  There is currently only one common mapping type  the dictionary and mapping objects are mutable Python DictionarySet Types  In Python  a Set is an unordered collection of data types that is iterable  mutable and has no duplicate elements  The order of elements in a set is undefined though it may consist of various elements     What is the difference between a Mutable datatype and an Immutable data type Mutable data types can be edited i e   they can change at runtime  Eg   List  Dictionary  etc Immutable data types can not be edited i e   they can not change at runtime  Eg   String  Tuple  etc     What is a Variable Scope in Python The location where we can find a variable and also access it if required is called the scope of a variable 
Python Local variable  Local variables are those that are initialized within a function and are unique to that function  A local variable cannot be accessed outside of the function Python Global variables  Global variables are the ones that are defined and declared outside any function and are not specified to any function Module level scope  It refers to the global objects of the current module accessible in the program Outermost scope  It refers to any built in names that the program can call  The name referenced is located last among the objects in this scope     How is a dictionary different from a list A list is an ordered collection of items accessed by their index  while a dictionary is an unordered collection of key value pairs accessed using unique keys  Lists are ideal for sequential data  whereas dictionaries are better for associative data  For example  a list can store               whereas a dictionary can store         a                    b                    c             
    What is docstring in Python Python documentation strings  or docstrings  provide a convenient way of associating documentation with Python modules  functions  classes and methods 
Declaring Docstrings  The docstrings are declared using   triple single quotes   or    triple double quotes    just below the class  method  or function declaration  All functions should have a docstring Accessing Docstrings  The docstrings can be accessed using the   doc   method of the object or using the help function     How is Exceptional handling done in Python There are   main keywords i e  try  except and finally which are used to catch exceptions 
try  A block of code that is monitored for errors except  Executes when an error occurs in the try block finally  Executes after the try and except blocks  regardless of whether an error occurred  It s used for cleanup tasks Example  Trying to divide a number by zero will cause an exception 

            Python

    n     
try 
    res   n        This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
    
except ZeroDivisionError 
    print  quot Can     t be divided by zero  quot  

OutputCan t be divided by zero 
Explanation  nbsp In this example  dividing number by   raises a nbsp ZeroDivisionError  The try block contains the code that might cause an exception and the except block handles the exception  printing an error message instead of stopping the program 
    What is the difference between Python Arrays and Lists Arrays  when talking about the array module in Python  are specifically used to store a collection of numeric elements that are all of the same type  This makes them more efficient for storing large amounts of data and performing numerical computations where the type consistency is maintained Syntax  Need to import the array module to use arrays Example 

            Python

    from array import array
arr   array      i                        Array of integers

Lists nbsp are more flexible than arrays in that they can hold elements of different types  integers  strings  objects  etc    They come built in with Python and do not require importing any additional modules Lists support a variety of operations that can modify the list Example 

            Python

    a            hello

    What are Modules and Packages in Python A module is a single file that contains Python code  functions  variables  classes  which can be reused in other programs  You can think of it as a code library  For example  math is a built in module that provides math functions like sqrt    pi  etc 

            Python

    import math
print math sqrt       

package is a collection of related modules stored in a directory  It helps in organizing and grouping modules together for easier management  For example  The numpy package contains multiple modules for numerical operations 
To create a package  the directory must contain a special file named   init   py 
Intermediate Python Interview Questions    What is the difference between xrange and range functions range   and xrange   are two functions that could be used to iterate a certain number of times in for loops in Python  nbsp 
In Python    there is no xrange  but the range function behaves like xrange In Python  range     This returns a range object  which is an immutable sequence type that generates the numbers on demand  nbsp xrange     This function returns the generator object that can be used to display numbers only by looping  The only particular range is displayed on demand and hence called lazy evaluation     What is Dictionary Comprehension  Give an ExampleDictionary Comprehension is a syntax construction to ease the creation of a dictionary based on the existing iterable 

            Python

    keys         a           b           c           d           e      
values                

  this line shows dict comprehension here  
d     k v for  k v  in zip keys  values    

  We can use below too
  d   dict zip keys  values    

print  d 

Output  a       b       c       d       e     
    Is Tuple Comprehension possible in Python  If yes  how and if not why Tuple comprehensions are not directly supported  Python       s existing features like generator expressions and the tuple   function provide flexible alternatives for creating tuples from iterable data 
 i for i in           
Tuple comprehension is not possible in Python because it will end up in a generator  not a tuple comprehension 
    Differentiate between List and Tuple Let s analyze the differences between List and Tuple 
List
Lists are Mutable datatype Lists consume more memoryThe list is better for performing operations  such as insertion and deletion The implication of iterations is Time consumingTuple
Tuples are Immutable datatype Tuple consumes less memory as compared to the listA Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elementsThe implication of iterations is comparatively Faster    What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy Below is the tabular Difference between the Shallow Copy and Deep Copy 
Shallow CopyDeep CopyShallow Copy stores the references of objects to the original memory address   nbsp  nbsp Deep copy stores copies of the object s value Shallow Copy reflects changes made to the new copied object in the original object Deep copy doesn t reflect changes made to the new copied object in the original object Shallow Copy stores the copy of the original object and points the references to the objects Deep copy stores the copy of the original object and recursively copies the objects as well A shallow copy is faster Deep copy is comparatively slower     Which sorting technique is used by sort   and sorted   functions of python Python uses the Tim Sort algorithm for sorting  It s a stable sorting whose worst case is O N log N   It s a hybrid sorting algorithm  derived from merge sort and insertion sort  designed to perform well on many kinds of real world data 
    What are Decorators Decorators are a powerful and flexible way to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods  without changing their actual code  A decorator is essentially a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function with enhanced functionality 
Decorators are often used in scenarios such as logging  authentication and memorization  allowing us to add additional functionality to existing functions or methods in a clean  reusable way 
    How do you debug a Python program    Using pdb  Python Debugger   
pdb is a built in module that allows you to set breakpoints and step through the code line by line  You can start the debugger by adding import pdb  pdb set trace   in your code where you want to begin debugging 

            Python

    import pdb
x    
pdb set trace      Debugger starts here
print x 

Output
 gt   home repl   c       df   fb  a cd   fe d   c   main py    lt module gt      gt  print x   Pdb  
   Using logging Module 
For more advanced debugging  the logging module provides a flexible way to log messages with different severity levels  INFO  DEBUG  WARNING  ERROR  CRITICAL  

            Python

    import logging
logging basicConfig level logging DEBUG 
logging debug  quot This is a debug message quot  

Output
DEBUG root This is a debug message
    What are Iterators in Python In Python  iterators are used to iterate a group of elements  containers like a list  Iterators are collections of items and they can be a list  tuples  or a dictionary  Python iterator implements   itr   and the next   method to iterate the stored elements  We generally use loops to iterate over the collections  list  tuple  in Python 
    What are Generators in Python In Python  the generator is a way that specifies how to implement iterators  It is a normal function except that it yields expression in the function  It does not implement   itr   and   next   method and reduces other overheads as well 
If a function contains at least a yield statement  it becomes a generator  The yield keyword pauses the current execution by saving its states and then resumes from the same when required 
    Does Python supports multiple Inheritance When a class is derived from more than one base class it is called multiple Inheritance  The derived class inherits all the features of the base case 
Multiple InheritancePython does support multiple inheritances  unlike Java  
    What is Polymorphism in Python Polymorphism means the ability to take multiple forms  Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as if they are instances of the same class through a common interface  This means that a method in a parent class can be overridden by a method with the same name in a child class  but the child class can provide its own specific implementation  This allows the same method to operate differently depending on the object that invokes it  Polymorphism is about overriding  not overloading  it enables methods to operate on objects of different classes  which can have their own attributes and methods  providing flexibility and reusability in the code 
    Define encapsulation in Python Encapsulation is the process of hiding the internal state of an object and requiring all interactions to be performed through an object s methods  This approach 
Provides better control over data Prevents accidental modification of data Promotes modular programming Python achieves encapsulation through nbsp public  nbsp protected nbsp and nbsp private nbsp attributes 
Encapsulation in Python    How do you do data abstraction in Python Data Abstraction is providing only the required details and hides the implementation from the world  The focus is on exposing only the essential features and hiding the complex implementation behind an interface  It can be achieved in Python by using interfaces and abstract classes 
    How is memory management done in Python Python uses its private heap space to manage the memory  Basically  all the objects and data structures are stored in the private heap space  Even the programmer can not access this private space as the interpreter takes care of this space  Python also has an inbuilt garbage collector  which recycles all the unused memory and frees the memory and makes it available to the heap space 
    How to delete a file using Python We can delete a file using Python by following approaches 
Python Delete File using nbsp os  removeDelete file in Python using the nbsp send trash modulePython Delete File using nbsp os rmdir    What is slicing in Python Python Slicing is a string operation for extracting a part of the string  or some part of a list  With this operator  one can specify where to start the slicing  where to end and specify the step  List slicing returns a new list from the existing list 
Syntax  
substring   s start   end   step 
    What is a namespace in Python A namespace in Python refers to a container where names  variables  functions  objects  are mapped to objects  In simple terms  a namespace is a space where names are defined and stored and it helps avoid naming conflicts by ensuring that names are unique within a given scope 
Types of namespacesTypes of Namespaces 
Built in Namespace  Contains all the built in functions and exceptions  like print    int    etc  These are available in every Python program Global Namespace  Contains names from all the objects  functions and variables in the program at the top level Local Namespace  Refers to names inside a function or method  Each function call creates a new local namespace Python InterviewAdvanced Python Interview Questions  amp  Answers nbsp     What is PIP PIP is an acronym for Python Installer Package which provides a seamless interface to install various Python modules  It is a command line tool that can search for packages over the internet and install them without any user interaction 
    What is a zip function Python zip   function returns a zip object  which maps a similar index of multiple containers  It takes an iterable  converts it into an iterator and aggregates the elements based on iterables passed  It returns an iterator of tuples 
Syntax zip  iterables  nbsp 
    What are Pickling and Unpickling Pickling  The pickle module converts any Python object into a byte stream  not a string representation   This byte stream can then be stored in a file  sent over a network  or saved for later use  The function used for pickling is pickle dump   Unpickling  The process of retrieving the original Python object from the byte stream  saved during pickling  is called unpickling  The function used for unpickling is pickle load       What is the difference between  classmethod   staticmethod and instance methods in Python    Instance Method operates on an instance of the class and has access to instance attributes and takes self as the first parameter  Example 
 def method self   
   Class Method directly operates on the class itself and not on instance  it takes cls as the first parameter and defined with  classmethod  
Example   classmethod def method cls   
   Static Method does not operate on an instance or the class and takes no self or cls as an argument and is defined with  staticmethod 
Example   staticmethod def method    align it and dont bolod anything and not bullet points
    What is   init     in Python and how does self play a role in it   init     is Python       s equivalent of constructors in OOP  called automatically when a new object is created  It initializes the object       s attributes with values but doesn t handle memory allocation Memory allocation is handled by the   new     method  which is called before   init     The self parameter in   init     refers to the instance of the class  allowing access to its attributes and methods self must be the first parameter in all instance methods  including   init    
            Python

    class MyClass 
    def   init   self  value  
        self value   value    Initialize object attribute

    def display self  
        print f quot Value   self value  quot  

obj   MyClass    
obj display   

OutputValue    
    Write a code to display the current time 
            Python

    import time

currenttime  time localtime time time   
print   quot Current time is quot   currenttime 

    What are Access Specifiers in Python Python uses the     symbol to determine the access control for a specific data member or a member function of a class  A Class in Python has three types of Python access modifiers 
Public Access Modifier  The members of a class that are declared public are easily accessible from any part of the program  All data members and member functions of a class are public by default  nbsp Protected Access Modifier  The members of a class that are declared protected are only accessible to a class derived from it  All data members of a class are declared protected by adding a single underscore                 symbol before the data members of that class  nbsp Private Access Modifier  The members of a class that are declared private are accessible within the class only  the private access modifier is the most secure access modifier  Data members of a class are declared private by adding a double underscore      symbol before the data member of that class  nbsp     What are unit tests in Python Unit Testing is the first level of software testing where the smallest testable parts of the software are tested  This is used to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed  The unit test framework is Python s xUnit style framework  The White Box Testing method is used for Unit testing 
    Python Global Interpreter Lock  GIL  Python Global Interpreter Lock  GIL  is a type of process lock that is used by Python whenever it deals with processes  Generally  Python only uses only one thread to execute the set of written statements  The performance of the single threaded process and the multi threaded process will be the same in Python and this is because of GIL in Python  We can not achieve multithreading in Python because we have a global interpreter lock that restricts the threads and works as a single thread 
    What are Function Annotations in Python Function Annotation is a feature that allows you to add metadata to function parameters and return values  This way you can specify the input type of the function parameters and the return type of the value the function returns Function annotations are arbitrary Python expressions that are associated with various parts of functions  These expressions are evaluated at compile time and have no life in Python s runtime environment  Python does not attach any meaning to these annotations  They take life when interpreted by third party libraries  for example  mypy     What are Exception Groups in Python The latest feature of Python       Exception Groups  The ExceptionGroup can be handled using a new except  syntax  The   symbol indicates that multiple exceptions can be handled by each except  clause 
ExceptionGroup is a collection group of different kinds of Exception  Without creating Multiple Exceptions we can group together different Exceptions which we can later fetch one by one whenever necessary  the order in which the Exceptions are stored in the Exception Group doesn t matter while calling them 
try raise ExceptionGroup        Example ExceptionGroup          TypeError        Example TypeError         ValueError        Example ValueError         KeyError        Example KeyError         AttributeError        Example AttributeError          except  TypeError        except  ValueError as e        except   KeyError  AttributeError  as e        
    What is Python Switch Statement From version      upward  Python has implemented a switch case feature called  structural pattern matching   You can implement this feature with the match and case keywords  Note that the underscore symbol is what you use to define a default case for the switch statement in Python 
Note  Before Python      Python doesn       t support match Statements 

            Python

    match term 
   case pattern   
   action  
   case pattern   
   action  
   case pattern   
   action  
   case   
   action default

    What is Walrus Operator Walrus Operator allows you to assign a value to a variable within an expression  This can be useful when you need to use a value multiple times in a loop  but don       t want to repeat the calculation Walrus Operator is represented by the      syntax and can be used in a variety of contexts including while loops and if statements Note  Python versions before     doesn       t support Walrus Operator 

            Python
