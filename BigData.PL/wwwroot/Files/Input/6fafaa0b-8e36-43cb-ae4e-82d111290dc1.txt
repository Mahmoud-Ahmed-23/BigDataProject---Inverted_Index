In logic  a quantifier is an operator that specifies how many individuals in the domain of discourse satisfy an open formula  For instance  the universal quantifier 
  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  forall  
  
 in the first order formula 
  
    
      
          x     
        x
        P
         
        x
         
      
    
      displaystyle  forall xP x  
  
 expresses that everything in the domain satisfies the property denoted by 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
  On the other hand  the existential quantifier 
  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  exists  
  
 in the formula 
  
    
      
          x     
        x
        P
         
        x
         
      
    
      displaystyle  exists xP x  
  
 expresses that there exists something in the domain which satisfies that property  A formula where a quantifier takes widest scope is called a quantified formula  A quantified formula must contain a bound variable and a subformula specifying a property of the referent of that variable 
The most commonly used quantifiers are 
  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  forall  
  
 and 
  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  exists  
  
  These quantifiers are standardly defined as duals  in classical logic  each can be defined in terms of the other using negation  They can also be used to define more complex quantifiers  as in the formula 
  
    
      
          xac 
          x     
        x
        P
         
        x
         
      
    
      displaystyle  neg  exists xP x  
  
 which expresses that nothing has the property 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
  Other quantifiers are only definable within second order logic or higher order logics  Quantifiers have been generalized beginning with the work of Andrzej Mostowski and Per Lindstr m 
In a first order logic statement  quantifications in the same type  either universal quantifications or existential quantifications  can be exchanged without changing the meaning of the statement  while the exchange of quantifications in different types changes the meaning  As an example  the only difference in the definition of uniform continuity and  ordinary  continuity is the order of quantifications 
First order quantifiers approximate the meanings of some natural language quantifiers such as  some  and  all   However  many natural language quantifiers can only be analyzed in terms of generalized quantifiers 


Relations to logical conjunction and disjunction edit

Infinite domain of discourse edit 
Consider the following statement  using dot notation for multiplication  

               and                and                     and                      and      etc 
This has the appearance of an infinite conjunction of propositions  From the point of view of formal languages  this is immediately a problem  since syntax rules are expected to generate finite statements 
The example above is fortunate in that there is a procedure to generate all the conjuncts   However  if the same assertion were to be made about real numbers instead of natural numbers  there would be no way to enumerate all the conjuncts  since real numbers cannot be enumerated      dubious             discuss      Succinct equivalent formulations  which avoid these problems  uses universal quantification 

For each natural number n  n       n   n For each real number x  x       x   x 
A similar analysis applies to the disjunction 

  is equal to        or   is equal to        or   is equal to              or     is equal to        or      etc 
which can be rephrased using existential quantification 

For some natural number n  n is equal to     
Algebraic approaches to quantification edit 
It is possible to devise abstract algebras whose models include formal languages with quantification  but progress has been slow     clarification needed      and interest in such algebra has been limited  Three approaches have been devised to date 

Relation algebra  invented by Augustus De Morgan  and developed by Charles Sanders Peirce  Ernst Schr der  Alfred Tarski  and Tarski s students  Relation algebra cannot represent any formula with quantifiers nested more than three deep  Surprisingly  the models of relation algebra include the axiomatic set theory ZFC and Peano arithmetic 
Cylindric algebra  devised by Alfred Tarski  Leon Henkin  and others 
The polyadic algebra of Paul Halmos 
Notation edit 
The two most common quantifiers are the universal quantifier and the existential quantifier  The traditional symbol for the universal quantifier is      a rotated letter  A   which stands for   for all  or  all    The corresponding symbol for the existential quantifier is      a rotated letter  E   which stands for  there exists  or  exists                        
An example of translating a quantified statement in a natural language such as English would be as follows  Given the statement   Each of Peter s friends either likes to dance or likes to go to the beach  or both    key aspects can be identified and rewritten using symbols including quantifiers  So  let X be the set of all Peter s friends  P x  the predicate  x likes to dance   and Q x  the predicate  x likes to go to the beach   Then the above sentence can be written in formal notation as 
  
    
      
          x     
        
          x
        
        
            x     
        
        X
         
         
        P
         
        x
         
          x     
        Q
         
        x
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle  forall  x   in  X  P x  lor Q x   
  
  which is read   for every x that is a member of X  P applies to x or Q applies to x  
Some other quantified expressions are constructed as follows  


  
    
      
          x     
        
          x
        
        
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  exists  x   P 
  
           

  
    
      
          x     
        
          x
        
        
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  forall  x   P 
  

for a formula P  These two expressions  using the definitions above  are read as  there exists a friend of Peter who likes to dance  and  all friends of Peter like to dance   respectively  Variant notations include  for set X and set members x

Some versions of the notation explicitly mention the range of quantification  The range of quantification must always be specified  for a given mathematical theory  this can be done in several ways 

Assume a fixed domain of discourse for every quantification  as is done in Zermelo Fraenkel set theory 
Fix several domains of discourse in advance and require that each variable have a declared domain  which is the type of that variable  This is analogous to the situation in statically typed computer programming languages  where variables have declared types 
Mention explicitly the range of quantification  perhaps using a symbol for the set of all objects in that domain  or the type of the objects in that domain  
One can use any variable as a quantified variable in place of any other  under certain restrictions in which variable capture does not occur  Even if the notation uses typed variables  variables of that type may be used 
Informally or in natural language  the   x  or   x  might appear after or in the middle of P x   Formally  however  the phrase that introduces the dummy variable is placed in front 
Mathematical formulas mix symbolic expressions for quantifiers with natural language quantifiers such as 

 For every natural number x     
 There exists an x such that    
 For at least one x      
Keywords for uniqueness quantification include 

 For exactly one natural number x     
 There is one and only one x such that     
Further  x may be replaced by a pronoun  For example 

For every natural number  its product with   equals to its sum with itself 
Some natural number is prime 
Order of quantifiers  nesting  edit 
See also  Quantifier shift
The order of quantifiers is critical to meaning  as is illustrated by the following two propositions 

For every natural number n  there exists a natural number s such that s   n  
This is clearly true  it just asserts that every natural number has a square  The meaning of the assertion in which the order of quantifiers is reversed is different 

There exists a natural number s such that for every natural number n  s   n  
This is clearly false  it asserts that there is a single natural number s that is the square of every natural number  This is because the syntax directs that any variable cannot be a function of subsequently introduced variables 
A less trivial example from mathematical analysis regards the concepts of uniform and pointwise continuity  whose definitions differ only by an exchange in the positions of two quantifiers  A function f from R to R is called

In the former case  the particular value chosen for   can be a function of both   and x  the variables that precede it 
In the latter case    can be a function only of    i e   it has to be chosen independent of x   For example  f x    x  satisfies pointwise  but not uniform continuity  its slope is unbound   In contrast  interchanging the two initial universal quantifiers in the definition of pointwise continuity does not change the meaning 
As a general rule  swapping two adjacent universal quantifiers with the same scope  or swapping two adjacent existential quantifiers with the same scope  doesn t change the meaning of the formula  see Example here   but swapping an existential quantifier and an adjacent universal quantifier may change its meaning 
The maximum depth of nesting of quantifiers in a formula is called its  quantifier rank  

Equivalent expressions edit 
If D is a domain of x and P x  is a predicate dependent on object variable x  then the universal proposition can be expressed as

  
    
      
          x     
        x
        
          x     
        
        D
        
        P
         
        x
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle  forall x   in   D  P x   
  

This notation is known as restricted or relativized or bounded quantification  Equivalently one can write 

  
    
      
          x     
        x
        
         
        x
        
          x     
        
        D
          x     
        P
         
        x
         
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle  forall x   x   in   D to P x    
  

The existential proposition can be expressed with bounded quantification as

  
    
      
          x     
        x
        
          x     
        
        D
        
        P
         
        x
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle  exists x   in   D  P x   
  

or equivalently

  
    
      
          x     
        x
        
         
        x
        
          x     
        
        
        D
          x     
        P
         
        x
         
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle  exists x   x   in     D land P x    
  

Together with negation  only one of either the universal or existential quantifier is needed to perform both tasks 

  
    
      
          xac 
         
          x     
        x
        
          x     
        
        D
        
        P
         
        x
         
         
          x     
          x     
        x
        
          x     
        
        D
        
          xac 
        P
         
        x
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle  neg   forall x   in   D  P x   equiv  exists x   in   D   neg P x   
  

which shows that to disprove a  for all x  proposition  one needs no more than to find an x for which the predicate is false  Similarly 

  
    
      
          xac 
         
          x     
        x
        
          x     
        
        D
        
        P
         
        x
         
         
          x     
          x     
        x
        
          x     
        
        D
        
          xac 
        P
         
        x
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle  neg   exists x   in   D  P x   equiv  forall x   in   D   neg P x   
  

to disprove a  there exists an x  proposition  one needs to show that the predicate is false for all x 
In classical logic  every formula is logically equivalent to a formula in prenex normal form  that is  a string of quantifiers and bound variables followed by a quantifier free formula 

Quantifier elimination edit 
This section is an excerpt from Quantifier elimination  edit 
Quantifier elimination is a concept of simplification used in mathematical logic  model theory  and theoretical computer science  Informally  a quantified statement  
  
    
      
          x     
        x
      
    
      displaystyle  exists x 
  
 such that           can be viewed as a question  When is there an 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
      displaystyle x 
  
 such that             and the statement without quantifiers can be viewed as the answer to that question            
One way of classifying formulas is by the amount of quantification  Formulas with less depth of quantifier alternation are thought of as being simpler  with the quantifier free formulas as the simplest 

A theory has quantifier elimination if for every formula 
  
    
      
          x b  
      
    
      displaystyle  alpha  
  
  there exists another formula 
  
    
      
        
            x b  
          
            Q
            F
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle  alpha   QF  
  
 without quantifiers that is equivalent to it  modulo this theory  
Range of quantification edit 
Every quantification involves one specific variable and a domain of discourse or range of quantification of that variable  The range of quantification specifies the set of values that the variable takes   In the examples above  the range of quantification is the set of natural numbers  Specification of the range of quantification allows us to express the difference between  say  asserting that a predicate holds for some natural number or for some real number  Expository conventions often reserve some variable names such as  n  for natural numbers  and  x  for real numbers  although relying exclusively on naming conventions cannot work in general  since ranges of variables can change in the course of a mathematical argument 
A universally quantified formula over an empty range  like 
  
    
      
          x     
        x
        
          x     
        
          x     
        
        x
          x     
        x
      
    
      displaystyle  forall x   in    varnothing   x neq x 
  
  is always vacuously true  Conversely  an existentially quantified formula over an empty range  like 
  
    
      
          x     
        x
        
          x     
        
          x     
        
        x
         
        x
      
    
      displaystyle  exists x   in    varnothing   x x 
  
  is always false 
A more natural way to restrict the domain of discourse uses guarded quantification   For example  the guarded quantification 

For some natural number n  n is even and n is prime
means

For some even number n  n is prime 
In some mathematical theories  a single domain of discourse fixed in advance is assumed  For example  in Zermelo Fraenkel set theory  variables range over all sets  In this case  guarded quantifiers can be used to mimic a smaller range of quantification  Thus in the example above  to express

For every natural number n  n     n   n
in Zermelo Fraenkel set theory  one would write

For every n  if n belongs to N  then n     n   n 
where N is the set of all natural numbers 

Formal semantics edit 
Mathematical semantics is the application of mathematics to study the meaning of expressions in a formal language  It has three elements  a mathematical specification of a class of objects via syntax  a mathematical specification of various semantic domains and the relation between the two  which is usually expressed as a function from syntactic objects to semantic ones   This article only addresses the issue of how quantifier elements are interpreted 
The syntax of a formula can be given by a syntax tree  A quantifier has a scope  and an occurrence of a variable x is free if it is not within the scope of a quantification for that variable  Thus in

  
    
      
          x     
        x
         
          x     
        y
        B
         
        x
         
        y

        x
         
      
    
      displaystyle  forall x  exists yB x y   vee C y x  
  

the occurrence of both x and y in C y  x  is free  while the occurrence of x and y in B y  x  is bound  i e  non free

An interpretation for first order predicate calculus assumes as given a domain of individuals X   A formula A whose free variables are x        xn is interpreted as a Boolean valued function F v        vn  of n arguments  where each argument ranges over the domain X   Boolean valued means that the function assumes one of the values T  interpreted as truth  or F  interpreted as falsehood   The interpretation of the formula

The semantics for uniqueness quantification requires first order predicate calculus with equality  This means there is given a distinguished two placed predicate      the semantics is also modified accordingly so that     is always interpreted as the two place equality relation on X  The interpretation of

Each kind of quantification defines a corresponding closure operator on the set of formulas  by adding  for each free variable x  a quantifier to bind x             For example  the existential closure of the open formula n gt     xn yn zn is the closed formula  n  x  y  z  n gt     xn yn zn   the latter formula  when interpreted over the positive integers  is known to be false by Fermat s Last Theorem  As another example  equational axioms  like x y y x  are usually meant to denote their universal closure  like  x  y  x y y x  to express commutativity 

Paucal  multal and other degree quantifiers edit 
See also  Fubini s theorem and measurable
None of the quantifiers previously discussed apply to a quantification such as

There are many integers n  lt       such that n is divisible by   or   or   
One possible interpretation mechanism can be obtained as follows  Suppose that in addition to a semantic domain X  we have given a probability measure P defined on X and cutoff numbers    lt  a   b        If A is a formula with free variables x      xn whose interpretation is
the function F of variables v      vn then the interpretation of

Other quantifiers edit 
A few other quantifiers have been proposed over time  In particular  the solution quantifier                                   noted    section sign  and read  those   For example 

  
    
      
        
           
          
              xa  
            n
              x     
            
              N
            
            
            
              n
              
                 
              
            
              x     
             
          
           
        
         
         
         
         
         
         
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle  left  S n in  mathbb  N   quad n     leq   right            
  

is read  those n in N such that n      are in           The same construct is expressible in set builder notation as

  
    
      
         
        n
          x     
        
          N
        
         
        
          n
          
             
          
        
          x     
         
         
         
         
         
         
         
         
         
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle   n in  mathbb  N   n     leq                
  

Contrary to the other quantifiers    yields a set rather than a formula             
Some other quantifiers sometimes used in mathematics include 

There are infinitely many elements such that   
For all but finitely many elements     sometimes expressed as  for almost all elements      
There are uncountably many elements such that   
For all but countably many elements   
For all elements in a set of positive measure   
For all elements except those in a set of measure zero   
History edit 
Term logic  also called Aristotelian logic  treats quantification in a manner that is closer to natural language  and also less suited to formal analysis  Term logic treated All  Some and No in the  th century BC  in an account also touching on the alethic modalities 
In       George Bentham published his Outline of a New System of Logic  With a Critical Examination of Dr  Whately s Elements of Logic  describing the principle of the quantifier  but the book was not widely circulated             

Augustus De Morgan             was the first to use  quantifier  in the modern sense 
William Hamilton claimed to have coined the terms  quantify  and  quantification   most likely in his Edinburgh lectures c        Augustus De Morgan confirmed this in       but modern usage began with De Morgan in      where he makes statements such as  We are to take in both all and some not all as quantifiers              
Gottlob Frege  in his      Begriffsschrift  was the first to employ a quantifier to bind a variable ranging over a domain of discourse and appearing in predicates  He would universally quantify a variable  or relation  by writing the variable over a dimple in an otherwise straight line appearing in his diagrammatic formulas  Frege did not devise an explicit notation for existential quantification  instead employing his equivalent of   x   or contraposition  Frege s treatment of quantification went largely unremarked until Bertrand Russell s      Principles of Mathematics 
In work that culminated in Peirce         Charles Sanders Peirce and his student Oscar Howard Mitchell independently invented universal and existential quantifiers  and bound variables  Peirce and Mitchell wrote  x and  x where we now write  x and  x  Peirce s notation can be found in the writings of Ernst Schr der  Leopold Loewenheim  Thoralf Skolem  and Polish logicians into the     s  Most notably  it is the notation of Kurt G del s landmark      paper on the completeness of first order logic  and      paper on the incompleteness of Peano arithmetic  Per Martin L f adopted a similar notation for dependent products and sums in his intuitionistic type theory  which are conceptually related to quantification 
Peirce s approach to quantification also influenced William Ernest Johnson and Giuseppe Peano  who invented yet another notation  namely  x  for the universal quantification of x and  in        x for the existential quantification of x  Hence for decades  the canonical notation in philosophy and mathematical logic was  x P to express  all individuals in the domain of discourse have the property P   and    x P  for  there exists at least one individual in the domain of discourse having the property P   Peano  who was much better known than Peirce  in effect diffused the latter s thinking throughout Europe  Peano s notation was adopted by the Principia Mathematica of Whitehead and Russell  Quine  and Alonzo Church  In       Gentzen introduced the   symbol  by analogy with Peano s   symbol    did not become canonical until the     s 
Around       Peirce began developing his existential graphs  whose variables can be seen as tacitly quantified  Whether the shallowest instance of a variable is even or odd determines whether that variable s quantification is universal or existential   Shallowness is the contrary of depth  which is determined by the nesting of negations   Peirce s graphical logic has attracted some attention in recent years by those researching heterogeneous reasoning and diagrammatic inference
