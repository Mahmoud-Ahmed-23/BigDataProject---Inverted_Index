In November       AlphaFold   by DeepMind  a model that performs predictions of protein structure  wins the CASP competition              


OpenAI introduces GPT    a state of the art autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce a variety of computer codes  poetry and other language tasks exceptionally similar  and almost indistinguishable from those written by humans  Its capacity was ten times greater than that of the T NLG  It was introduced in May                    and was in beta testing in June      


    

ChatGPT  an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI  debuts in November       It is initially built on top of the GPT     large language model  While it gains considerable praise for the breadth of its knowledge base  deductive abilities  and the human like fluidity of its natural language responses                            it also garners criticism for  among other things  its tendency to  hallucinate                             a phenomenon in which an AI responds with factually incorrect answers with high confidence  The release triggers widespread public discussion on artificial intelligence and its potential impact on society                           


A November      class action lawsuit against Microsoft  GitHub and OpenAI alleges that GitHub Copilot  an AI powered code editing tool trained on public GitHub repositories  violates the copyrights of the repositories  authors  noting that the tool is able to generate source code which matches its training data verbatim  without providing attribution

OpenAI s GPT   model is released in March      and is regarded as an impressive improvement over GPT      with the caveat that GPT   retains many of the same problems of the earlier iteration               Unlike previous iterations  GPT   is multimodal  allowing image input as well as text  GPT   is integrated into ChatGPT as a subscriber service  OpenAI claims that in their own testing the model received a score of      on the SAT    th percentile                    on the LSAT    th percentile   and     on the Uniform Bar Exam    th percentile               


On March          Nature Biomedical Engineering writes that  it is no longer possible to accurately distinguish  human written text from text created by large language models  and that  It is all but certain that general purpose large language models will rapidly proliferate    It is a rather safe bet that they will change many industries over time
