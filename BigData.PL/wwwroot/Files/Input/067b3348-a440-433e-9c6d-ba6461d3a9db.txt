							Daily News Egypt interviewed James CF Huang  Chairperson of the Taiwan External Trade Development Council  TAITRA   on the sidelines of the           MOBILITY Mega Shows in Taipei  He discussed the impact of US tariffs  the outcomes of the recent mobility expo  and TAITRA       s broader strategy for enhancing Taiwan       s global trade competitiveness 
From TAITRA       s perspective  how significantly are US tariffs currently impacting Taiwanese businesses  and which sectors are most affected 
The recent US tariff adjustments have certainly added pressure to global supply chains  and Taiwanese companies are not exempt from these impacts  In particular  sectors such as automotive parts  electronics  and machinery which maintain close trade ties with the U S  market have felt the most direct effects 
However  Taiwan s industry is known for its resilience and adaptability  Many companies are actively adjusting their supply chain strategies  diversifying customer bases  and exploring new production and logistics models to mitigate risks 
Beyond immediate challenges  how are these tariff situations influencing TAITRA       s long term strategy for promoting Taiwanese exports and diversifying markets away from traditional hubs 
TAITRA has proactively strengthened its long term strategy to support Taiwanese exporters in navigating the evolving global landscape  We are actively working to diversify export markets  with increased focus on Southeast Asia  Europe  Latin America  and emerging markets 
In addition  through initiatives targeting the Americas market  such as those introduced during the      MOBILITY Mega Shows  we are helping companies explore investment opportunities and build new supply chain linkages beyond traditional hubs 
TAITRA will continue to provide intelligence  matchmaking platforms  and strategic consultation services to empower businesses in building resilient  globally diversified operations

The     Mobility Expo recently concluded  Could you share the final figures regarding the number of exhibitors  who participated this year 
This year s      MOBILITY Mega Shows featuring Taipei AMPA and E Mobility Taiwan under a newly launched brand was held concurrently with Autotronics Taipei  bringing together a total of       exhibitors from    countries  across       booths at Taipei Nangang Exhibition Centre Hall   
Together  the three exhibitions created Asia s most comprehensive mobility industry showcase  highlighting Taiwan s strengths across components  systems integration  and innovative mobility solutions 

 nbsp 
A key measure of success for trade shows is tangible business outcomes  Does TAITRA have an estimate of the value or number of deals and concrete business opportunities generated during the expo 
To drive tangible outcomes  TAITRA organised over     on site procurement meetings  connecting Taiwanese suppliers directly with international buyers from key markets including the United States  Japan  China  Malaysia  and South Korea 
With       international buyers from over     countries and regions  the show successfully created numerous concrete business opportunities  though final deal values are still being compiled post event 

Beyond the numbers  what were the key themes  technological highlights  or significant trends that emerged from this year       s     Mobility Expo 
This year       s exhibition highlighted the accelerating trends of vehicle electrification  intelligent mobility  and sustainability  Key showcased technologies included ADAS  Advanced Driver Assistance Systems   smart cockpit solutions  vehicle to everything  V X  connectivity  and autonomous driving systems 
The rise of Software Defined Vehicles  SDV  and modular vehicle design also emerged as significant trends  signalling a shift toward software centric automotive innovation 
Meanwhile  high inflation and extended vehicle ownership cycles in major markets have fuelled demand for aftermarket solutions  an area where Taiwanese suppliers excel with flexible  high quality production capabilities 
How does the success and focus of this expo reinforce Taiwan       s position in the rapidly evolving global e mobility and smart transportation landscape 
The success of this year s      MOBILITY Mega Shows underscores Taiwan s growing role in the global smart mobility ecosystem  Taiwan s integration of semiconductors  AI  EV systems  and flexible manufacturing enables it to be a critical player in advancing electrification  intelligent mobility  and sustainability  Through showcasing cutting edge applications such as ADAS  smart cockpits  V X connectivity  and autonomous driving technologies  the exhibition demonstrated Taiwan s capability to innovate across the mobility value chain 
Additionally  Taiwan s strong performance in the aftermarket sector powered by its agility and consistent quality further strengthens its competitiveness amid global supply chain shifts  As the automotive industry moves towards software defined platforms and greener mobility solutions  Taiwan s robust ICT and semiconductor ecosystems will ensure it remains a resilient and indispensable partner in shaping the future of transportation 

 nbsp 
Considering these initiatives   navigating tariffs  exploring  markets like  Egypt  and fostering future industries like mobility   what is your overarching vision for TAITRA       s role in securing Taiwan       s global trade competitiveness in the next few years 
At TAITRA  our overarching vision is to act as a dynamic bridge connecting Taiwan with global opportunities 
In the face of evolving challenges such as tariff shifts  supply chain realignments  and emerging industries  we are committed to supporting Taiwanese businesses in building resilient  diversified  and forward looking global strategies 
We aim to 
Expand market diversification  actively promoting Taiwanese exports across Southeast Asia  Europe  Latin America  Africa  and other emerging regions 
Facilitate innovation driven industries such as smart mobility  green energy  and advanced manufacturing  showcasing Taiwan s strengths in critical technologies 
Strengthen global supply chain partnerships  helping Taiwanese companies enhance their global resilience and agility 
Ultimately  TAITRA s role is to empower Taiwan s industries to thrive amid change not just adapting to the future  but helping to shape it
