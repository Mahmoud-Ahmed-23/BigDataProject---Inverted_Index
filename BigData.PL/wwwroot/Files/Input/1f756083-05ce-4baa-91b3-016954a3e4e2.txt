Peter Norvig  born    December       is an American computer scientist and Distinguished Education Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human Centered AI             He previously served as a director of research and search quality at Google                                   Norvig is the co author with Stuart J  Russell of the most popular textbook in the field of AI  Artificial Intelligence  A Modern Approach used in more than       universities in     countries            


Early life and education edit 
Norvig grew up in an academic family             His father was Danish and came to the United States after World War II to study math at the University of Minnesota             Norvig received a Bachelor of Science in applied mathematics from Brown University             and a Ph D  in computer science from the University of California  Berkeley            

Career and research edit 
Norvig is a councilor of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence and co author  with Stuart J  Russell  of Artificial Intelligence  A Modern Approach  now the leading college text in the field              He was head of the Computational Sciences Division  now the Intelligent Systems Division  at NASA Ames Research Center  where he oversaw a staff of     scientists performing NASA s research and development in autonomy and robotics  automated software engineering and data analysis  neuroengineering  collaborative systems research  and simulation based decision making  Before that he was chief scientist at Junglee  where he helped develop one of the first Internet comparison shopping services  chief designer at Harlequin Inc   and senior scientist at Sun Microsystems Laboratories 
Norvig has served as an assistant professor at the University of Southern California and as a research faculty member at Berkeley  He has over fifty publications in various areas of computer science  concentrating on artificial intelligence  natural language processing  information retrieval             and software engineering  including the books Artificial Intelligence  A Modern Approach              Paradigms of AI Programming  Case Studies in Common Lisp              Verbmobil  A Translation System for Face to Face Dialog  and Intelligent Help Systems for UNIX             
Norvig is one of the creators of JScheme  Norvig is listed under  Academic Faculty  amp  Advisors  for the Singularity University              In       Norvig worked with Sebastian Thrun to develop a popular online course in Artificial Intelligence             that had more than         students enrolled              He also teaches an online course via the Udacity platform             

Selected publications and presentations edit 
By       Artificial Intelligence  A Modern Approach  which Norvig first co authored with Stuart J  Russell in       was the leading textbook in the field used by over      schools globally                        
In       Norvig published a short article titled Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years              arguing against the fashionable introductory programming textbooks that purported to teach programming in days or weeks   The article was widely shared and discussed  and has attracted contributed translations to over    languages             
Norvig is also known for his      Gettysburg Powerpoint Presentation              a satire about bad presentation practices             using Abraham Lincoln s famous Gettysburg Address 
His      IEEE Intelligent Systems article   The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data  co authored with Alon Y  Halevy and  Fernando Pereira  described how the best approach to highly complex natural language understanding problems is to harness large quantities of data  not to depend on  tidy   simple formulas              They said that by generating  large amounts of unlabeled  noisy data  new algorithms can be used to build high quality models from the data  This has informed the development of foundation models               But invariably  simple models and a lot of data trump more elaborate models based on less data                                    Choose a representation that can use unsupervised learning on unlabeled data  which is so much more plentiful than labeled data                                    The title refers to the physicist Eugene Wigner s      journal article   The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences              
In a    September      lecture presented as part of the Vancouver based University of British Columbia s Department of Computer Science s Distinguished Lecture Series  Norvig  who was then the Director of Research at Google  described how large quantities of data deepen our understanding of phenomena             
In his June      Ted Talk  described the fall of      hybrid class on artificial intelligence attended by         online students around the globe that he co taught with Sebastian Thrun at Stanford University             

Awards and honors edit 
Norvig was elected an AAAI Fellow in      and a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery in
