The IBM     Electronic Data Processing Machine  known as the Defense Calculator while in development  was IBM s first commercial scientific computer and its first series production mainframe computer  which was announced to the public on May                      It was designed and developed by Jerrier Haddad and Nathaniel Rochester and was based on the IAS machine at Princeton                                  
The IBM     was the first computer in the IBM          series  which were IBM s high end computers until the arrival of the IBM System     in                 
The business oriented sibling of the     was the IBM     and a lower cost general purpose sibling was the IBM      which gained fame as the first mass produced computer                       


History edit 
IBM     competed with Remington Rand s UNIVAC      in the scientific computation market              In early       a committee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff requested that the two machines be compared for the purpose of using them for a Joint Numerical Weather Prediction project  Based on the trials  the two machines had comparable computational speed  with a slight advantage for IBM s machine   however when it came to input output the     was favored unanimously for its significantly faster input output equipment                                   
Nineteen IBM     systems were installed              The first     was delivered to IBM s world headquarters in New York  Eight went to aircraft companies  At the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory  having an IBM     meant that scientists could run nuclear explosives computations faster 
 I think there is a world market for maybe five computers  is often attributed to Thomas Watson Sr   chairman and CEO of IBM  in       This misquote may stem from a statement by his son  Thomas Watson Jr  at the      IBM annual stockholders  meeting  Watson Jr  was describing the market acceptance of the IBM     computer  Before production began  Watson visited with    companies that were potential customers  This is what he said at the stockholders  meeting   as a result of our trip  on which we expected to get orders for five machines  we came home with orders for                 
Aviation Week for    May      says the     rental charge was about              equivalent to          in       per month  American Aviation   Nov      says          a month per    hour shift  A second    hour shift ups the rental to         a month       citation needed     
The successor of the     was the index register equipped IBM      introduced   years after the      The     was not compatible with the      however  as the     increased the size of instructions from    bits to    bits to support the extra features  The     also marked the transition to magnetic core memory 

Social impact edit 
In       IBM paired with language scholars from Georgetown University to develop translation software for use on computers  On January          the team developed an experimental software program that allowed the IBM     computer to translate from Russian to English  This was the Georgetown IBM experiment  The Mark   Translating Device  which was developed for the US Air Force  was able to produce its first automated Russian to English translation in      and was shown to the public in                  
In       a group of scientists ran millions of simulated hands of blackjack on an IBM     looking to determine the best playing decision for every combination of cards  The result of the study was the set of correct rules for hitting  standing  doubling or splitting in a blackjack game which are still the same today             
The IBM     has a claim to be the first computer displaying the potential of artificial intelligence in Arthur Samuel s checkers playing program on February           The program  which was developed for play on the IBM      was demonstrated to the public on television  Self proclaimed checkers master Robert Nealey played the game on an IBM      computer in      and the computer won  It is still considered a milestone for artificial intelligence and it offered the public during the early     s an example of the capabilities of an electronic computer             
The University of California Radiation Laboratory at Livermore  developed a language compilation and runtime system called the KOMPILER for their IBM      Speedcode was the first high level programming language created for an IBM computer  The language was developed by John Backus in      for the IBM     to support computation with floating point numbers  The Fortran compiler also developed by Backus was not released by IBM until the IBM

The total weight  depending on configuration  was about        pounds       short tons           t              

Memory edit 
Williams tube from an IBM     at the Computer History Museum
The system used vacuum tube logic circuitry and electrostatic storage  consisting of    Williams tubes with a capacity of      bits each  giving a total memory of      words of    bits each  Each of the    Williams tubes was   inches in diameter  Memory could be expanded to a maximum of      words of    bits by the addition of a second set of    Williams tubes or  later  by replacing the entire memory with magnetic core memory  The Williams tube memory and later core memory each had a memory cycle time of    microseconds  The Williams tube memory required periodic refreshing  mandating the insertion of refresh cycles into the     s timing  An addition operation required five    microsecond cycles  two of which were refresh cycles  while a multiplication or division operation required    cycles      microseconds   In addition  magnetic drum and magnetic tape were utilized for secondary storage

 or       bits 
The IBM     had only two programmer accessible registers 

The accumulator was    bits long  adding two overflow bits  
The multiplier quotient was    bits long 
Peripherals edit 
The Magnetic Drum Reader Recorder was added on the recommendation of John von Neumann  who said it would reduce the need for high speed I O             
The first magnetic tape drives were used on the Tape Processing Machine  TPM  and then adapted to the
