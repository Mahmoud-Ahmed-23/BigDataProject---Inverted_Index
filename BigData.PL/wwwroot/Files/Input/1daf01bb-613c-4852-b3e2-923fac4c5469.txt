							Journalist and political analyst  Abdullah Al Sinawi  believes that Egypt is going through a difficult phase and going into a dark tunnel 
Although some see that Al Sinawi has close connections to the presidency  his writings on public affairs are sharp and scornful  criticising the state       s policies 
He explains that as a free writer  it is one       s duty to speak frankly  just like all writers who are loyal to the country  Otherwise  they will be traitors of the responsibility of writing about the critical time that the state is going through 
Speaking about current risks and how to get out of the dark tunnel  Al Sinawi presented the following dialogue 
Why are we so scared of the coming days 
The general scene in Egypt is disturbing  We are facing a number of crises  some are existential and some prophecy dangers  There is a bottleneck in the political and the media sphere  There are economic and social crises  Difficult days are yet to come 
The baby formula crisis was one of the first indicators  as well as the workers        demonstrations and the return of bread queues  These indicators are introductions to social turbulence that we must face seriously  We must acknowledge that the current policy has failed and needs to be corrected 
Which is more dangerous to the country from your point of view  the economic crisis or political suffocation 
Although the general situation in Egypt is bad and although there is no political opposition that has clear programmes  perceptions  and cohesion  the economic crisis is more serious than political and social opposition 
The danger here is that there is no political head and the state lacks the ability to establish political consensus  Therefore  everything is up to coincidence  random clashes  and the pressures of public anger 
Where do you see the media in that 
We are suffering from media suffocation or the lack of media as a whole  preventing it from playing a role and building an agenda  Priorities raised for public discussion are not determined by the media or the authority  but rather by the alternative media through social networks 
There are issues that the TV and newspapers cannot deal with  but these issues arise on social networks  such as the army       s role in public life 
But are there those who see the importance of the army       s role now 
I understand and appreciate that the army intervened in some cases to face a difficult and intractable situation  but to interfere in every crisis leads to the erosion of trust and exposes it politically in front of an angry public opinion 
The army will be held responsible for the failure of the administration to act and solve problems 
What do you think of Egyptian political discourse 
There is no Egyptian political discourse  There is a difference between political talks and political discourse  as political discourse is cohesive in its vocabulary and semantics 
Political discourse also reflects the attitudes and social biases raised to public opinion to persuade  inspire  and invite public opinion to be patient to find the light at the end of the tunnel 
Do you not see any ray of hope in the near future 
The problem is that Egypt is entering a long  dark economic and social tunnel 
I think that these are signs of danger and the risks exceed the regime  the current president  and even the safety of the community 
Is the regime in danger 
Despite talks about bringing down the state  the main issue is that the community       s cohesion is threatened 
Do you think that ignoring political powers is a deliberate move 
There is a state of disregard or contempt of the political opposition  Egypt has no real political parties with declared programmes and leaders capable of influence 
Public and national interest requires strengthening these parties  not to weaken them  It also requires to call all parties to the scene and to be a part of the political partnership 
But the regime sees that the security solutions are successful  What do you think about that 
Security is not an alternative of policy  the outcomes would be disastrous  and those results have begun to clearly emerge as the regime       s popularity has fallen  The president always says that he has no political support and some people want to eliminate his popular support  Of course  there is no popular support without a political backer 
We are talking about the one man state 
It reflects the idea of   the domination over state institutions or limiting the power to the president  as he is the only one who thinks  decides  and speaks  The one man show would harm the president himself  because he will neither find a political backer nor popular support  When the president loses his patience with the media and different views  then the foreign channels affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood will be the only effective media outlet  alongside social media  The era of the emergence of uncontrolled satellite channels does not suit the nationalisation of the media  Demolishing the political life  fighting political parties  and mistrusting political elites will increase the problems of the regime and will prevent the change 
So are we awaiting new changes 
The change is necessary in all times but the question is whether to bring about this change through normal channels or alternative methods  There is a possibility that the change will happen through irregular methods and this has happened more than once  However  it seems that no one learns from the lessons of the past 
But don       t we have a large number of political parties and a parliament which gathers a lot of those parties 
When the parliament was elected  many political parties joined the Egypt Support Coalition  Then  President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi said that he had no political backer  as if he sentenced this coalition to death or complete failure 
But this coalition controls the parliament and its decisions  What do you think about this 
There is a difference between giving security or administrative instructions to vote in favour of a resolution or law  and the ability to raise controversy and agreement which can convince the public opinion  The parliament       s decision to ban the broadcast of its discussions and deliberations made it an Ali Baba cave 
That way  you do not know what happens inside the parliament  which political forces dominate it  and who makes the final decision the security or other parties  Who are the other parties and what are their visions and programmes 
What is your opinion about Al Sisi 
The issue is not my about the president  The point is the president       s stance on the dangers facing Egypt 
The duty of the journalist is to warn and alert as much as possible  in order to avoid dangerous pitfalls 
The danger facing society is huge  and there is no rule to protect public consensus  The possibility for dialogue should be opened  especially since the community is under imminent threat that requires clear and transparent talking 
 nbsp 
The current situation in Egypt is neither correct nor sustainable  and Egypt cannot tolerate anarchy or a new failure  Our responsibility is warning  but the president is the one who will bear the responsibility before people and before history 
He sat down with the senior intellectuals and writers  and he listened to them  There should be an associate team who reads what they say  and provides a vision to the president 
According to what was just mentioned  where is the political kitchen of the presidency       s institution 
I do not think there is a political kitchen in Egypt  and I wrote that two years ago 
       The president is lonely  and unfortunately  he will bear the responsibility alone        
Perhaps the centres of power are hampering the attempts of reform 
The president       s mistake is letting the security enter the public life  The security       s role is determined by laws and the Constitution  which they greatly influenced  and this lowered the president       s popularity  The president should initiate a national dialogue to listen  allow  and seek to make political ends meet  He needs a protective political network 
How can he establish this network 
Firstly  by releasing the unjustly imprisoned young people  The president has talked more than once about the need to release them  but those statements weren       t accompanied by positive movements on the ground  Releasing young people will lead to a reconciliation between these young people and the state 
The National Council for Human Rights  NCHR  was promised to meet with the president  but the events of the Press Syndicate prevented that from happening  The meeting was scheduled to provide a list of       prisoner cases  I think that this meeting will probably bear positive results 
Secondly  the state should free the media  The hands of the state have become too involved in the media  and talk show programmes turned to variety shows 
Thirdly  managing the Nile water file needs a lot of honesty and strength  The president has pointed out the importance of expanding water stations in order to face any expected lack of water  However  honesty is necessary  Egypt is a pivotal country and should not be treated with disrespect 
But all the dialogues and the state s speech reveal that the crises you are talking about actually exist 
The state       s speech is too confused press wise and politics wise  The state is talking about carrying out procedures to reform the economy which is approaching bankruptcy  The state says that there is no alternative for the loan from the International Monetary Fund  IMF   but it is not a solution  This is merely a step to prevent a potential economic collapse  This  however  will result in social unrest that requires being addressed with economic experts and patriots from all economic fields inside and outside Egypt 
When the president and the government ask people to sacrifice  they must show them the light at the end of the tunnel and acknowledge their responsibility for the policies they made  Priorities must also be determined  and the state of austerity must be imposed first on the government and the presidency  before it is applied to the people  More strict procedures must be imposed to face corruption  and regulatory agencies must work on uncovering corruption 
In terms of distributing burdens  there must be justice  If you take a good look  you will find that it s the poor who pay the price  while the rich do not pay  This is why I demand imposing a tax on wealth  as suggested by Samih Sawiris and Farid Khamis 
There must be real achievements in order for citizens to feel a change 
Where does the Egyptian elite stand on these thoughts 
Some public figures thought of issuing a report on behalf of the intellectuals and sending it to the president  However  the idea never became a reality 
What do you think about power centres and their role in hindering reform projects 
Power centres arise in the joints of any authority whenever rules are absent from institutions  The regime has given a lot of power to the security forces after the    June uprising  The result was that power centres were established at the expense of political affairs  with alliances happening between some security officials with businessmen and media figures  The result was that many mistakes were made  and a lot of phone calls were broadcasted on TV  which was the power centre s first sin  This has led to massive slander at many points  most prominently of the president  No one and no institution was safe from the violations 
Moreover  freeing the hand of the security has led to slandering the    January Revolution  and therefore  picturing the    June uprising as a coup by another party  although those who participated on    June      represent the blocks of the    January Revolution  Both revolutions were hijacked and    June has been used to slander    January  In spite of the fact that the president s discourse about the    January Revolution is positive  it should have been accompanied with determining points of view  especially of the    June supporters 
There is a slogan being promoted now  saying  with bold reform  we can shorten the way   What is your take on that 
Meaningless  What is the bold reform and what way do we want to shorten the way  Egypt is in need of serious talk because the present time is very dangerous  We need to talk about the core of problems  which  in return  will lead to national coherence 
Social media is talking about the militarisation of state institutions  What do you think  
This is very dangerous talk and those who say it should stop saying it  The army has a real popularity  but dealing with it as a political body and blaming it for the general failure is eroding its popularity  which is dangerous for Egypt 
And what is the solution 
The solution is for the army to return to its normal role as soon as possible  and for civil society to quickly fill the void it will leave  Moreover  the army should put a plan to withdraw from the scene  I remember that Al Sisi said at the time of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces that the return of the army to its normal missions will greatly increase its popularity 
What about the calls on reconciliation with the Muslim Brotherhood 
The reconciliation is an idea with bad reputation and almost impossible in the foreseeable future  given the blood shed by the two parties  People should admit that eradicating the Islamic current is an illusion that will not occur  The state has failed in that issue  as well as in the issue of terrorism  The issue needs to be handled under the slogan of        no eradication  and no reconciliation        
Will Al Sisi run for a second term 
The shape of Egypt in      cannot be predicted  The state is suffering and prices are increasing  but Egypt s situation by the end of the current presidential term cannot be predicted  If Al Sisi manages to get everything under control  he will not face real competition in the elections  but if things are uncontrolled  the coming situation will not be foreseeable 
Given the president s personality  if he finds that his popularity had shrunken  he may decide to leave the scene or things may become uncontrollable
