							Chairperson of the Suez Canal Authority  SCA   Osama Rabie  met on Monday with Argentine ambassador to Cairo  Holger Martinsen  to explore avenues for bilateral cooperation  particularly in dredging operations and advanced navigation systems 
At the outset of the meeting  Rabie expressed appreciation for the growing ties between Egypt and Argentina  and conveyed his support for efforts aimed at strengthening economic cooperation and the exchange of technical expertise 
Rabie affirmed the SCA s commitment to building strategic partnerships across global maritime and logistics sectors  He underscored the Authority s critical role in maintaining global supply chain continuity particularly in light of the current challenges affecting the Red Sea region 
Highlighting the SCA s openness to international collaboration  Rabie noted that the Authority and its affiliated companies possess significant technical expertise and state of the art capabilities in shipbuilding  maintenance  and marine engineering  He emphasized their proven track record in executing complex dredging operations and engineering works across both maritime and inland waterways 
Ambassador Martinsen  in turn  praised the strategic significance of the Suez Canal to global trade  describing it as the most vital and irreplaceable waterway in the world  He expressed optimism about a return to the Canal s pre crisis traffic levels  noting that rerouting vessels via the Cape of Good Hope increases delivery times and strains international logistics networks 
Martinsen conveyed Argentina s interest in expanding cooperation with the Suez Canal Authority  particularly in areas where the SCA has long standing experience such as dredging and maritime services  He also proposed exploring opportunities to integrate Argentina s advanced technological solutions  including early emergency response systems  which could enhance navigational safety in the Canal and surrounding waters 
Both sides agreed on the importance of continued dialogue and joint efforts to bolster maritime collaboration between Egypt and Argentina
