							Atef Moatamed is a professor of physical geography at Cairo University and founder director of the House of Geography for geographic studies  Despite being specialised in geomorphology  his research into political geography has seen him received a national award for his book about his sightings in Russia  He was Egypt s cultural advisor in Russia from      to       Moatamed also translated several important writings  and supervised    masters and PhD theses   
Daily News Egypt met with Moatamed to learn more about his journey with geography and his experience in Russia  The interview is below  lightly edited for clarity 
  
Was it always your intention to study physical geography  If not  what made you do  
After graduation  geographers have to choose between physical geography and humanistic geography 
Preliminary research was conducted on the relationship of human interventions to pollution in the northern lakes  At the introductory stage  I found that humanistic geography is not easy as some would imagine 
The monopoly of some professors of geographic disciplines made the picture that if you are not studying the urban geography you are not humanistic geographer  and if you are not studying geomorphology you are not doing physical geography 
One of my difficulties was obtaining data  The statements are either top secret or the specialist refuses to disclose them 
I found physical geography easier for me and I did my masters in physical geography about an area  called the Arab s Bay  west Alexandria  This area was not well studied before 
After getting my masters degree  I received a scholarship from post Soviet Russia in geography  At that time  I received many warnings about the situation in Russia because it was a turbulent period    years after the breakdown of the Soviet Union   Prof Sobhi Abdel Hakim advised me to travel  saying  You will find geomorphology everywhere  but Russia will be only found in Russia 
I chose the topic for my PhD thesis on the geomorphology of Halayib and Shalateen  I started my research at Cairo University and continued at Saint Petersburg State University  after the approval of my supervisor at the Faculty of Geography there  Halayib was a very nice place with friendly people and rich geography 
After my travel  it became clear to me that all the warnings I heard before my trip was correct  as most of the teachers emigrated and the labs were in poor condition  I took three years to complete my doctorate 
 
You started off studying physical geography at university  what made you interested in geopolitics 
 
The exposure  To be exposed to something like an important event  I was in Russia in a very critical period following the breakdown of the Soviet Union  in addition to the second Chechen war from      to       By then  the aftermath of the war in Chechnya had moved to the heart of Russian cities  From time to time  there were bombings  arrests  or clashes  Also  I was an eyewitness to the newly formed state in Russia  Because of my stay in Russia  I woke up to a sense of geopolitics  
On the other hand  I paid a very high price as I was exposed to xenophobia because of my colour  At that time  all coloured people were not welcome  There is no contradiction between the two majors  geomorphology and geopolitics   Nevertheless  physical geography is the base for all geopolitical ideas  and the political geographers need to understand the physical geography very well  
You travel a lot  how important are  trips  for a geographer 
 
Anyone with a passion for a place can do some of what the geographer is doing  even if he has not been geographically educated  Stages based on data collection  classification  and analysis  if they are limited to reading and researching books and statistics  it could contribute to creating a researcher with insights and perspectives  but not necessarily      accurate because his work lacks photographs  maps  and findings of fieldwork  Like many studies of Gamal Hamdan whose work was mainly based on theoretical writing without actually knowing the reality of terrain in the ground 
Trips can benefit you and your work  Imagine a teacher who tells his students about the places he actually visited  However  there is a difference between visits and trips  A visit needs someone who acts as tourist and just does the watching  while the trip is based on adventure as you spent time and money  In geography  the one could not be recognised as a real geographer  if he has not travelled        
 
Is geography a science 
Geographers used to ask this question  what is geography  It is a puzzling question for all people  We can say that the branches adopted by geographies  such as physical geography  geomorphology  hydrology  and geography of soil  are science  Anything subject to the scientific method  such as data collection  analysis  testing  findings  theories  and results  is science 
It happens that sometimes the means of expressing the results that geographers use gives the wrong impression that geography is not science  meaning that whenever a geographer is drowned in the description and speaking in a language that tends to literature  it is normal for people to receive geographic knowledge as a kind of trip literature 
 
We must also distinguish between geography by people who are not scientists  and geography by geographers  I believe that the future of geography and its importance is in making geographic knowledge a companion and a tool for all human beings  One of the manifestations of the importance of geography is that the European colonialism  in the era of geographical discoveries  succeeded in its colonial tasks by depending on gunpowder and maps  
Geography is closer to the cultural composition of the common man  while it is science in the scientific community  However  the excessive use of the word geography on each direction of research  such as the geography of elections or medical geography  negatively affects geography  There should be an umbrella for these research trends  the umbrella of geography 
  
Does Egypt need all those geography graduates  And how can we improve geographic education 
Strangely enough  Egypt needs a hundred times as many graduates from geography departments  For example  Egypt needs a large number of graduates of geography departments to work in teaching geography in schools  and in geographic information systems  maps  and surveys  
It seems that there is congestion in the numbers of graduates because the labour market is not able to absorb the numbers  but the truth is there is no labour market  The situation should be as follows  open a labour market and then demand graduates  but the reality is the opposite  many graduates and no labour market  But Egypt needs a hundred times of the current number of geographers 
As for the development of geographical education  there is a very big problem that many professors are unsuitable to teach and the best for them may be to devote themselves to research 
Attention must be paid to the teaching of geography in the early stages of education  There is a problem in education curriculum besides the limited trips for students and poor tools of geographical education  We can say that     of the problems in geography education in Egypt are at schools  and the rest emerges in the university 
Another very important problem is that one form of geographic education is to expand the teaching of geographic work tools  such as GIS and surveying  Geography departments are graduating specialists in drawing and space tools that any non geographic graduate can learn through an intensive course  Some students believe that by joining the geography department  they can work as a space engineer  which is not true  
We hope that the state establishes a geographic institute  which includes an elite group of scientists and researchers dedicated to scientific research  totalling     scientists conducting field studies  preparing the national atlas and national maps  conducting national researches and studies  holding the national geographic conference  and exploring Egypt  as Egypt is not explored yet by geographers 
 
You are the founder of the House of Geography  can you tell us about the forum and the idea behind it   
The name of the forum was inspired by the name of the Italian Geographical Society called        House of Geography         It aimed to provide geographers with data  as well as to provide a cultural component of geography to non specialists  The forum is a non profit and self financing entity  It is good that some professors gave us their books and papers for publication on our website  The forum offers presentations for books and provides research and studies in geography and geographical heritage  
You served as Egypt s cultural advisor to Russia  can you tell us about this experience 
I worked as cultural advisor of the embassy of Egypt in Russia from      to       It was possible to extend my work there  but I preferred to return to academic and research work  I was an eyewitness to the development of cultural relations between Egypt and Russia  I tried to make contacts between several universities in both sides  such as the agreement between Tanta University and Astrakhan University  Cairo University and Moscow University  and other agreements among Egyptian and Russian universities 
The aim of these agreements is to facilitate the exchange of students and researchers between universities in both countries  During my career  I tried to change stereotypes about Egypt among Russian students and worked on several exhibitions to introduce Egypt       s history and culture to children 
  
Recently  thousands of Egyptian students are heading to Russian universities  what do you think attracts them to study in Russia 
Russia  like other European countries and America  has opened its universities to foreign students as a primary source of funding for these universities  There are many differenced between universities of Russia  America  and Europe in terms of expenses  but not admission  
During my time as a cultural advisor  I have prepared a list of the best universities in Russia  such as Moscow University  St  Petersburg State University  Kazan University  and Tomsk University  The problem is that some provincial universities in Russia are less efficient  aim primarily to make profit  and spread Russian language and culture among foreigners
