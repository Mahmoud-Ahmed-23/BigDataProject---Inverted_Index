Online education  massive open online course edit 
External audio Interview with Coursera Co Founder Andrew Ng  Degree of Freedom            In       Stanford launched a total of three massive open online course  MOOCs  on machine learning  CS   a   databases  and AI  taught by Ng  Peter Norvig  Sebastian Thrun  and Jennifer Widom                          This has led to the modern MOOC movement  Ng taught machine learning and Widom taught databases  The course on AI taught by Thrun led to the genesis of Udacity              
The seeds of massive open online courses  MOOCs  go back a few years before the founding of Coursera in       Two themes emphasized in the founding of modern MOOCs were scale and availability             
By       Ng has notably expanded access to AI education  with an estimated   million individuals worldwide taking his courses via platforms like DeepLearning AI and Coursera            

Founding of Coursera edit 
Ng started the Stanford Engineering Everywhere  SEE  program  which in      published a number of Stanford courses online for free  Ng taught one of these courses   Machine Learning   which includes his video lectures  along with the student materials used in the Stanford CS    class  It offered a similar experience to MIT OpenCourseWare  except it aimed at providing a more  complete course  experience  equipped with lectures  course materials  problems and solutions  etc  The SEE videos were viewed by the millions and inspired Ng to develop and iterate new versions of online tech             
Within Stanford  they include Daphne Koller with her  blended learning experiences  and codesigning a peer grading system  John Mitchell  Courseware  a Learning Management System   Dan Boneh  using machine learning to sync videos  later teaching cryptography on Coursera   Bernd Girod  ClassX   and others  Outside Stanford  Ng and Thrun credit Sal Khan of Khan Academy as a huge source of inspiration  Ng was also inspired by lynda com and the design of the forums of Stack Overflow             
Widom  Ng  and others were ardent advocates of Khan styled tablet recordings  and between      and       several hundred hours of lecture videos recorded by Stanford instructors were recorded and uploaded  Ng tested some of the original designs with a local high school to figure the best practices for recording lessons             
In October       the  applied  version of the Stanford class  CS   a  was hosted on ml class org and launched  with over         students registered for its first edition  The course featured quizzes and graded programming assignments and became one of the first and most successful massive open online courses  MOOCs  created by a Stanford professor             
Two other courses on databases  db class org  and AI  ai class org  were launched  The ml class and db class ran on a platform developed by students  including Frank Chen  Jiquan Ngiam  Chuan Yu Foo  and Yifan Mai  Word spread through social media and popular press  The three courses were    weeks long  and over         Statements of Accomplishment  were awarded             
His work subsequently led to his founding of Coursera with Koller in       As of       the two most popular courses on the platform were taught and designed by Ng   Machine Learning       and  Neural Networks and Deep Learning       

Post Coursera work edit 
In       Ng launched a new course  AI for Everyone   This is a non technical course designed to help people understand AI s impact on society and its benefits and costs for companies  as well as how they can navigate through this technological revolution

Books edit 
He also wrote a book Machine Learning Yearning  a practical guide for those interested in machine learning  which he distributed for free              In December       he wrote a sequel called AI Transformation Playbook             
Ng contributed one chapter to Architects of Intelligence  The Truth About AI from the People Building it        by the American futurist Martin Ford 

Views on AI edit 
Ng thinks that the real threat is contemplating the future of work   Rather than being distracted by evil killer robots  the challenge to labor caused by these machines is a conversation that academia and industry and government should have               He has emphasized the importance of expanding access to AI education  stating that empowering people around the world to use AI tools is essential to building AI applications            
In a December      Financial Times interview  Ng highlighted concerns regarding the impact of potential regulations on open source AI  emphasizing how reporting  licensing  and liability risks could unfairly burden smaller firms and stifle innovation  He argued that regulating basic technologies like open source models could hinder progress without markedly enhancing safety  Ng advocated for carefully designed regulations to prevent obstacles to the development and distribution of beneficial AI technologies             
In a June      interview with the Financial Times  Ng expressed concerns about proposed AI legislation in California that would have required developers to implement safety mechanisms such as a  kill switch  for advanced models  He described the bill as creating  massive liabilities for science fiction risks  and said it  stokes fear in anyone daring to innovate   Other critics argued the bill would impose burdens on open source developers and smaller AI companies              The bill was ultimately vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom in September
