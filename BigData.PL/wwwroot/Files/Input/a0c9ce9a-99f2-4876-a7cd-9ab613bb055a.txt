An economy     a      is an area of the production  distribution and trade  as well as consumption of goods and services  In general  it is defined as a social domain that emphasize the practices  discourses  and material expressions associated with the production  use  and management of resources             A given economy is a set of processes that involves its culture  values  education  technological evolution  history  social organization  political structure  legal systems  and natural resources as main factors  These factors give context  content  and set the conditions and parameters in which an economy functions  In other words  the economic domain is a social domain of interrelated human practices and transactions that does not stand alone 
Economic agents can be individuals  businesses  organizations  or governments  Economic transactions occur when two groups or parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service  commonly expressed in a certain currency  However  monetary transactions only account for a small part of the economic domain 
Economic activity is spurred by production which uses natural resources  labor and capital  It has changed over time due to technology  innovation  new products  services  processes  expanding markets  diversification of markets  niche markets  increases revenue functions  and changes in industrial relations  most notably child labor being replaced in some parts of the world with universal access to education  


Etymology
New York City  the world s principal fintech and financial center                       and the epicenter of the world s principal metropolitan economy           
The word economy in English is derived from the Middle French s yconomie  which itself derived from the Medieval Latin s oeconomia  The Latin word has its origin at the Ancient Greek s oikonomia or oikonomos  The word s first part oikos means  house   and the second part nemein means  to manage             
The most frequently used current sense  denoting  the economic system of a country or an area   seems not to have developed until the     s            

History
Main article  Economic history
Earliest roots
Ancient Roman mosaic from Bosra  depicting a merchant leading camels through the desert
As long as someone has been making  supplying and distributing goods or services  there has been some sort of economy  economies grew larger as societies grew and became more complex  Sumer developed a large scale economy based on commodity money  while the Babylonians and their neighboring city states later developed the earliest system of economics as we think of  in terms of rules laws on debt  legal contracts and law codes relating to business practices  and private property            
The Babylonians and their city state neighbors developed forms of economics comparable to currently used civil society  law  concepts  They developed the first known codified legal and administrative systems  complete with courts  jails  and government records             
The ancient economy was based primarily on subsistence farming              The Shekel are the first to refer to a unit of weight and currency  used by the Semitic peoples  The first usage of the term came from Mesopotamia circa      BC  and referred to a specific mass of barley which related other values in a metric such as silver  bronze  copper  etc  A barley shekel was originally both a unit of currency and a unit of weight  just as the British Pound was originally a unit denominating a one pound mass of silver             
Most exchange of goods had occurred through social relationships  There were also traders who bartered in the marketplaces  In Ancient Greece  where the present English word  economy  originated             many people were bond slaves of the freeholders              The economic discussion was driven by scarcity      citation needed     
In Chinese economic law  the huge cycle of institutional innovation contains an idea  Serving a non market economy promotes a firm s tenure that is legally guaranteed and protected from bureaucratic opportunities             

Middle Ages
In the Middle Ages  what is now known as an economy was not far from the subsistence level  Most exchange occurred within social groups  On top of this  the great conquerors raised what we now call venture capital  from ventura  ital   risk  to finance their captures  The capital should be refunded by the goods they would bring up in the New World  The discoveries of Marco Polo              Christopher Columbus             and Vasco da Gama             led to a first global economy  The first enterprises were trading establishments  In       the first stock exchange was founded in Antwerp  Economy at the time meant primarily trade 
The European captures became branches of the European states  the so called colonies  The rising nation states Spain  Portugal  France  Great Britain and the Netherlands tried to control the trade through custom duties and mercantilism  from mercator  lat   merchant  was a first approach to intermediate between private wealth and public interest  The secularization in Europe allowed states to use the immense property of the church for the development of towns  The influence of the nobles decreased  The first Secretaries of State for economy started their work  Bankers like Amschel Mayer Rothschild             started to finance national projects such as wars and infrastructure  Economy from then on meant national economy as a topic for the economic activities of the citizens of a state 

Industrial Revolution
The first economist in the true modern meaning of the word was the Scotsman Adam Smith             who was inspired partly by the ideas of physiocracy  a reaction to mercantilism and also later Economics student  Adam Mari              He defined the elements of a national economy  products are offered at a natural price generated by the use of competition   supply and demand   and the division of labor  He maintained that the basic motive for free trade is human self interest  The so called self interest hypothesis became the anthropological basis for economics  Thomas Malthus             transferred the idea of supply and demand to the problem of overpopulation 
The Industrial Revolution was a period from the   th to the   th century where major changes in agriculture  manufacturing  mining  and transport had a profound effect on the socioeconomic and cultural conditions starting in the United Kingdom  then subsequently spreading throughout Europe  North America  and eventually the world              The onset of the Industrial Revolution marked a major turning point in human history  almost every aspect of daily life was eventually influenced in some way 
In Europe wild capitalism started to replace the system of mercantilism  today  protectionism  and led to economic growth  The period is called the Industrial Revolution because the system of production and division of labor enabled the mass production of goods 

  th century
The contemporary concept of  the economy  wasn t popularly known until the American Great Depression in the     s             
After the chaos of two World Wars and the devastating Great Depression  policymakers searched for new ways of controlling the course of the economy      citation needed      This was explored and discussed by Friedrich August von Hayek             and Milton Friedman             who pleaded for a global free trade and are supposed to be the fathers of the so called neoliberalism                          However  the prevailing view was that held by John Maynard Keynes              who argued for a stronger control of the markets by the state  The theory that the state can alleviate economic problems and instigate economic growth through state manipulation of aggregate demand is called Keynesianism in his honor              In the late     s  the economic growth in America and Europe often called Wirtschaftswunder  German for economic miracle   brought up a new form of economy  mass consumption economy  In       John Kenneth Galbraith             was the first to speak of an affluent society in his book The Affluent Society              In most of the countries the economic system is called a social market economy             

  st century
Frankfurt Stock Exchange in     
With the fall of the Iron Curtain and the transition of the countries of the Eastern Bloc towards democratic government and market economies  the idea of the post industrial society is brought into importance as its role is to mark together the significance that the service sector receives instead of industrialization  Some attribute the first use of this term to Daniel Bell s      book  The Coming of Post Industrial Society  while others attribute it to social philosopher Ivan Illich s book  Tools for Conviviality  The term is also applied in philosophy to designate the fading of postmodernism in the late   s and especially in the beginning of the   st century 
With the spread of Internet as a mass media and communication medium especially after            the idea for the Internet and information economy is given place because of the growing importance of e commerce and electronic businesses  also the term for a global information society as understanding of a new type of  all connected  society is created  In the late     s  the new type of economies and economic expansions of countries like China  Brazil  and India bring attention and interest to economies different from the usually dominating Western type economies and economic models 

Elements
Types
A market economy is one where goods and services are produced and exchanged according to demand and supply between participants  economic agents  by barter or a medium of exchange with a credit or debit value accepted within the network  such as a unit of currency              A planned economy is one where political agents directly control what is produced and how it is sold and distributed              A green economy is low carbon and resource efficient  In a green economy  growth in income and employment is driven by public and private investments that reduce carbon emissions and pollution  enhance energy and resource efficiency  and prevent the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services              A gig economy is one in which short term jobs are assigned or chosen on demand  The global economy refers to humanity s economic system or systems overall      citation needed      An informal economy is neither taxed nor monitored by any form of government             

Sectors
The economy may be considered as having developed through the following phases or degrees of precedence      according to whom      

The ancient economy was mainly based on subsistence farming 
The Industrial Revolution phase lessened the role of subsistence farming  converting it to more extensive and mono cultural forms of agriculture in the last three centuries  The economic growth took place mostly in mining  construction and manufacturing industries  Commerce became more significant due to the need for improved exchange and distribution of produce throughout the community 
In the economies of modern consumer societies phase there is a growing part played by services  finance  and technology the knowledge economy 
In modern economies  these phase precedences are somewhat differently expressed by the three sector model             

Primary  Involves the extraction and production of raw materials  such as corn  coal  wood and iron 
Secondary  Involves the transformation of raw or intermediate materials into goods e g  manufacturing steel into cars  or textiles into clothing 
Tertiary  Involves the provision of services to consumers and businesses  such as baby sitting  cinema and banking 
Other sectors of the developed community include 

the public sector or state sector  which usually includes  parliament  law courts and government centers  various emergency services  public health  shelters for impoverished and threatened people  transport facilities  air sea ports  post natal care  hospitals  schools  libraries  museums  preserved historical buildings  parks gardens  nature reserves  some universities  national sports grounds stadiums  national arts concert halls or theaters and centers for various religions  
the private sector or privately run businesses 
the voluntary sector or social sector             
Indicators
Main article  Economic indicator
The gross domestic product  GDP  of a country is a measure of the size of its economy  or more specifically  monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced              The most conventional economic analysis of a country relies heavily on economic indicators like the GDP and GDP per capita  While often useful  GDP only includes economic activity for which money is exchanged      citation needed     
Due to the growing importance of the financial sector in modern times              the term real economy is used by analysts                         as well as politicians             to denote the part of the economy that is concerned with the actual production of goods and services              as ostensibly contrasted with the paper economy  or the financial side of the economy              which is concerned with buying and selling on the financial markets  Alternate and long standing terminology distinguishes measures of an economy expressed in real values  adjusted for inflation   such as real GDP  or in nominal values  unadjusted for inflation                          

Studies
Main article  Economics
The study of economics are roughly divided into macroeconomics and microeconomics              Today  the range of fields of study examining the economy revolves around the social science of economics                          but may also include sociology              history              anthropology              and geography              Practical fields directly related to the human activities involving production  distribution  exchange  and consumption of goods and services as a whole are business              engineering              government              and health care              Macroeconomics is studied at the regional and national levels  and common analyses include income and production  money  prices  employment  international trade  and other issues

Notes


  Sometimes spelled oeconomy or  with a ligature   conomy in British English  both are pronounced  i  k n mi   The term is ultimately derived from Greek            from         house   and        to manage   In contemporary times  however  the spelling that begins with   has become obsolete and rarely used  since it has been reduced to e in American English or separated as oe in British English  From the eighteenth century  the spelling oeconomy dropped the letter o  thus making economy the common spelling for the term
