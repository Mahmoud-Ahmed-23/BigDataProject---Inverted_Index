Hala Sedqi  a luminary in the realms of drama and cinema  has graced the industry with her remarkable talent for many years  Renowned for her effortless performances  her participation in any creative endeavor lends it a unique gravitas  With a commitment to preserving her legacy  she selectively undertakes roles that align with her esteemed artistic reputation  Embracing the evolution of life  she recognizes that each stage of life offers roles that resonate with one s experiences  After a hiatus of over two decades from the Theatre  she is poised for a powerful comeback with the play  Sawabi  Zainab   Her portrayal of  Safsaf  in the critically acclaimed series  Jaafar Al Omda  has garnered immense success  the accolades for which she continues to receive to this day 



Can you share insights about  Sawabi  Zainab   the play marking your return to Theatre after a significant hiatus 



Indeed  my absence spanned over two decades  instilling in me a profound excitement and joy for my return  The Theatre  with its unique ambiance and live audience  holds a special place in my heart  In  Sawabi  Zainab   I embody  Zainab   a mother whose life is riddled with humorous contradictions  shared with the ensemble  The play is set to premiere during the Riyadh season in Saudi Arabia 



Does the prospect of returning to the stage intimidate you after such a long break 



Not in the slightest  Theatre  being the cornerstone of the arts  has always been a domain I approach without fear  Despite its grandeur  it signifies a pivotal milestone in an artist s journey  My absence was not by choice but a quest for a script that resonated with me 



You re also making a comeback in cinema  Could you tell us more about this venture 



 Ketf Qanouny  is a comedic film that piqued my interest due to its divergence from my previous roles  I portray a gym owner entangled in comedic situations  This film is a response to the audience s craving for humor and their affection for my comedic performances  Such films are rare  yet highly sought after 



What has led to your prolonged absence from the film industry 



My last cinematic appearance was five years ago in  The Last Rooster in Egypt  alongside Mohamed Ramadan  Since then  I ve been selective  awaiting scripts that truly reflect my essence  The film industry is ever evolving  and I prioritize projects that resonate with me and bring me fulfillment 



After the acclaim for your role in  Jaafar Al Amda   has the selection of future roles become more challenging 



The success of my character in the series  Safsaf  has set a high bar  prompting introspection about my career trajectory  It s a motivator  a new chapter in my life that I embrace wholeheartedly  Post  Safsaf   I ve declined numerous offers  seeking roles that demand my full commitment and align with my artistic vision  It s about looking ahead and not settling for mediocrity 



How do you feel about the numerous awards and honors you ve received for your portrayal of  Safsaf  



It s truly a divine blessing  The role of Safsaf and the series itself have been a stroke of good fortune  I m honored to have received the Best Actress award in several Arab countries  including at prestigious events like the Bahrain International Film Festival  the First International Iraqi Film Festival  the Lebanese Murex D or  the Rabat Film Festival  and even the Women s Festival in America  Additional accolades from Kuwait  Tunisia  the Emirates  and the New Alamein Drama Festival in Egypt have been incredibly humbling  The audience s love and celebration of Safsaf  evidenced by the millions of views and personal accolades through letters  calls  and daily praises  have made me deeply consider my next artistic venture to ensure it resonates as strongly as Safsaf s success 



What s the status of the second part of the  Jaafar Al Omda  series 



Currently  I haven t signed on for the second part of  Jaafar Al Omda   and it seems likely to be postponed until the      Ramadan season  Neither director Mohamed Sami nor Mohamed Ramadan has discussed my participation in the series  filming  The idea was suggested after gauging public opinion on the streets of Egypt  Given my commitment to an Emirati series  joining the new part of  Jaafar Al Omda  this year would be challenging 



What motivated you to venture into Gulf drama with an Emirati project 



Several factors drew me to Gulf drama  The uniqueness and novelty of the project s concept  my desire for artistic transformation  and the distinctiveness of my role compared to  Jaafar Al Omda  were significant motivators  The Emirati series also highlights women s issues  a cause I champion in all circumstances  The series will be filmed across multiple countries  including Egypt  America  the Emirates  and Saudi Arabia  adding to its appeal 



Has your lifelong dream of portraying  Queen Hatshepsut  dissipated 



 Laughs  For many years  I did dream of bringing Queen Hatshepsut s story to life  However  as time passed  I realized that my dream wouldn t come to fruition due to my age  To be candid  I ve decided against depicting biographies of historical figures  Such portrayals haven t historically met success  as they demand extensive research  time  effort  and meticulous preparation  And that s only if the character s story is rich enough to warrant a dramatic retelling 



What are the defining artistic milestones in Hala Sedqi s career 



Every project I ve been a part of holds significance as an artistic milestone  However  some works have surpassed my expectations in their success   Jaafar Al Omda  has been a recent highlight  but it s the film  The Escape  with the legendary Ahmed Zaki  and the enduring series  The Million Trip   still watched after over    years  that stand out  The series  No  My Dear Daughter    Zezenia   and  Arabesque  were pivotal in shaping my career and contributing to my stardom  Today  the landscape has transformed with social media  enhancing the interaction between the public  artists  and their work  thus broadening the reach and viewership of our artistic endeavours
