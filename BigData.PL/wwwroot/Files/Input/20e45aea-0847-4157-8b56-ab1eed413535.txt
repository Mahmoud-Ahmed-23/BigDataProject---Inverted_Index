The Wayback Machine is a digital archive of the World Wide Web founded by Internet Archive  an American nonprofit organization based in San Francisco  California  Launched for public access in       the service allows users to go  back in time  to see how websites looked in the past  Founders Brewster Kahle and Bruce Gilliat developed the Wayback Machine to provide  universal access to all knowledge  by preserving archived copies of defunct web pages            
The Wayback Machine s earliest archives go back at least to       and by the end of       more than      billion webpages had been saved  As of November       the Wayback Machine has archived more than     billion web pages and well over     petabytes of data                       


History edit 
The Internet Archive has been archiving cached web pages since at least       One of the earliest known pages was archived on May                    
Internet Archive founders Brewster Kahle and Bruce Gilliat launched the Wayback Machine in San Francisco  California             in October                             primarily to address the problem of web content vanishing whenever it gets changed or when a website is shut down             The service enables users to see archived versions of web pages across time  which the archive calls a  three dimensional index               Kahle and Gilliat created the machine hoping to archive the entire Internet and provide  universal access to all knowledge               The name  Wayback Machine  is a reference to a fictional time traveling device in the animated cartoon The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends from the     s                                      In a segment of the cartoon entitled  Peabody s Improbable History   the characters Mister Peabody and Sherman use the  Wayback Machine  to travel back in time to witness and participate in famous historical events             
From      to       the information was kept on digital tape  with Kahle occasionally allowing researchers and scientists to tap into the  clunky  database              When the archive reached its fifth anniversary in       it was unveiled and opened to the public in a ceremony at the University of California  Berkeley              By the time the Wayback Machine launched  it already contained over    billion archived pages              The data is stored on the Internet Archive s large cluster of Linux nodes              It revisits and archives new versions of websites on occasion  see technical details below               Sites can also be captured manually by entering a website s URL into the search box  provided that the website allows the Wayback Machine to  crawl  it and save the data             
On October           the Wayback Machine began fact checking content              As of January       domains of ad servers are disabled from capturing             
In May       for Internet Archive s   th anniversary  the Wayback Machine introduced the  Wayforward Machine   which allows users to  travel to the Internet in       where knowledge is under siege                          

Technical information edit 
The Wayback Machine s software has been developed to  crawl  the Web and download all publicly accessible information and data files on webpages  the Gopher hierarchy  the Netnews  Usenet  bulletin board system  and software              The information collected by these  crawlers  does not include all the content available on the Internet since much of the data is restricted by the publisher or stored in databases that are not accessible  To overcome inconsistencies in partially cached websites  Archive It org was developed in      by the Internet Archive as a means of allowing institutions and content creators to voluntarily harvest and preserve collections of digital content and create digital archives             
Crawls are contributed from various sources  some imported from third parties and others generated internally by the Archive              For example  crawls are contributed by the Sloan Foundation and Alexa  crawls run by the Internet Archive on behalf of NARA and the Internet Memory Foundation  and mirrors of Common Crawl              The  Worldwide Web Crawls  have been running since      and capture the global Web                          In September       the Internet Archive announced a partnership with Cloudflare   an American content delivery network service provider   to automatically index websites served via its  Always Online  services             
Documents and resources are stored with time stamp URLs such as                 Pages  individual resources  such as images  style sheets and scripts  as well as outgoing hyperlinks  are linked to with the time stamp of the currently viewed page  so they are redirected automatically to their individual captures that are the closest in time             
The frequency of snapshot captures varies per website              Websites in the  Worldwide Web Crawls  are included in a  crawl list   with the site archived once per crawl              A crawl can take months or even years to complete  depending on size              For example   Wide Crawl Number     started on January          and was completed on July                       However  there may be multiple crawls ongoing at any one time  and a site might be included in more than one crawl list  so how often a site is crawled varies widely             
A  Save Page Now  archiving feature was made available in October                   accessible on the lower right of the Wayback Machine s main page              Once a target URL is entered and saved  the web page will become part of the Wayback Machine              Through the Internet address web archive org              users can upload to the Wayback Machine a large variety of contents  including PDF and data compression file formats  The Wayback Machine creates a permanent local URL of the upload content  that is accessible in the web  even if not listed while searching in the https   archive org official website      jargon     
Starting in October       users were limited to    archival requests and retrievals per minute             

Storage capacity and growth edit 
As technology has developed over the years  the storage capacity of the Wayback Machine has grown  In       after only two years of public access  the Wayback Machine was growing at a rate of    terabytes per month  The data is stored on PetaBox rack systems custom designed by Internet Archive staff  The first    TB rack became fully operational in June       although it soon became clear that they would need much more storage than that                         
The Internet Archive migrated its customized storage architecture to Sun Open Storage in       and hosts a new data centre in a Sun Modular Datacenter on Sun Microsystems  California campus              As of          update       the Wayback Machine contained approximately three petabytes of data and was growing at a rate of     terabytes each month             
A new  improved version of the Wayback Machine  with an updated interface and a fresher index of archived content  was made available for public testing in       where captures appear in a calendar layout with circles whose width visualizes the number of crawls each day  but no marking of duplicates with asterisks or an advanced search page                          A top toolbar was added to facilitate navigating between captures  A bar chart visualizes the frequency of captures per month over the years              Features like  Changes    Summary   and a graphical site map were added subsequently 
In March that year  it was said on the Wayback Machine forum that  the Beta of the new Wayback Machine has a more complete and up to date index of all crawled materials into       and will continue to be updated regularly  The index driving the classic Wayback Machine only has a little bit of material past       and no further index updates are planned  as it will be phased out this year               Also in       the Internet Archive installed their sixth pair of PetaBox racks which increased the Wayback Machine s storage capacity by     terabytes             
In January       the company announced a milestone of     billion URLs             
In October       the company introduced the  Save a Page  feature  which allows any Internet user to archive the contents of a URL  and quickly generates a permanent link unlike the preceding liveweb feature                         
In December       the Wayback Machine contained     billion web pages almost nine petabytes of data  and was growing at about    terabytes a week                                     
In July       the Wayback Machine reportedly contained around    petabytes of data              In October       it was announced that the way web pages are counted would be changed  resulting in the decrease of the archived pages counts shown  Embedded objects such as pictures  videos  style sheets  JavaScripts are no longer counted as a  web page   whereas HTML  PDF  and plain text documents remain counted             
In September       the Wayback Machine contained over    petabytes of data                          As of December       the Wayback Machine contained over    petabytes of data

Wayback Machine APIs edit 
The Wayback Machine service offers three public APIs  SavePageNow  Availability  and CDX              SavePageNow can be used to archive web pages  Availability API for checking the archive availability status for a web page              checking whether an archive for the web page exists or not  CDX API is for complex querying  filtering  and analysis of captured data                         

Website exclusion policy edit 
Historically  the Wayback Machine has respected the robots exclusion standard  robots txt  in determining if a website would be crawled   or if already crawled  if its archives would be publicly viewable  Website owners had the option to opt out of Wayback Machine through the use of robots txt  It applied robots txt rules retroactively  if a site blocked the Internet Archive  any previously archived pages from the domain were immediately rendered unavailable as well  In addition  the Internet Archive stated that  Sometimes  a website owner will contact us directly and ask us to stop crawling or archiving a site  We comply with these requests               In addition  the website says   The Internet Archive is not interested in preserving or offering access to Web sites or other internet documents of persons who do not want their materials in the collection                          
On April           reports surfaced of sites that had gone defunct and became parked domains that were using robots txt to exclude themselves from search engines  resulting in them being inadvertently excluded from the Wayback Machine              Following this  the Internet Archive changed the policy to require an explicit exclusion request to remove sites from the Wayback Machine             

The Oakland Archive Policy edit 
Wayback s retroactive exclusion policy is based in part upon Recommendations for Managing Removal Requests and Preserving Archival Integrity  known as The Oakland Archive Policy  published by the School of Information Management and Systems at University of California  Berkeley in       which gives a website owner the right to block access to the site s archives              Wayback has complied with this policy to help avoid expensive litigation             
The Wayback retroactive exclusion policy began to relax in       when it stopped honoring robots on U S  government and military web sites for both crawling and displaying web pages  As of April       Wayback is ignoring robots txt more broadly  not just for U S  government websites                                                 

Uses edit 
From its public launch in       the Wayback Machine has been studied by scholars both for the ways it stores and collects data as well as for the actual pages contained in its archive  As of       scholars had written about     articles on the Wayback Machine  mostly from the information technology  library science  and social science fields  Social science scholars have used the Wayback Machine to analyze how the development of websites from the mid     s to the present has affected the company s growth             
When the Wayback Machine archives a page  it usually includes most of the hyperlinks  keeping those links active when they just as easily could have been broken by the Internet s instability  Researchers in India studied the effectiveness of the Wayback Machine s ability to save hyperlinks in online scholarly publications and found that it saved slightly more than half of them             
 Journalists use the Wayback Machine to view dead websites  dated news reports  and changes to website contents  Its content has been used to hold politicians accountable and expose battlefield lies               In       an archived social media page of Igor Girkin  a separatist rebel leader in Ukraine  showed him boasting about his troops having shot down a suspected Ukrainian military airplane before it became known that the plane actually was a civilian Malaysian Airlines jet  Malaysia Airlines Flight      after which he deleted the post and blamed Ukraine s military for downing the plane                          In       the March for Science originated from a discussion on Reddit that indicated someone had visited Archive org and discovered that all references to climate change had been deleted from the White House website  In response  a user commented   There needs to be a Scientists  March on Washington                                      
The site is used heavily for verification  providing access to references and content creation by Wikipedia editors              When new URLs are added to Wikipedia  the Internet Archive has been archiving them             
In September       a partnership was announced with Cloudflare to automatically archive websites served via its  Always Online  service  which will also allow it to direct users to its copy of the site if it cannot reach the original host             

Limitations edit 
In       there was a six month lag time between when a website was crawled and when it became available for viewing in the Wayback Machine              As of       the lag time is   to    hours              The Wayback Machine offers only limited search facilities  Its  Site Search  feature allows users to find a site based on words describing the site  rather than words found on the web pages themselves             
The Wayback Machine does not include every web page ever made due to the limitations of its web crawler  The Wayback Machine cannot completely archive web pages that contain interactive features such as Flash platforms and forms written in JavaScript and progressive web applications  because those functions require interaction with the host website  This means that  since approximately July          the Wayback Machine has been unable to display YouTube comments when saving videos  watch pages  as  according to the Archive Team  comments are no longer  loaded within the page itself               The Wayback Machine s web crawler has difficulty extracting anything not coded in HTML or one of its variants  which can often result in broken hyperlinks and missing images  Due to this  the web crawler cannot archive  orphan pages  that are not linked to by other pages                          The Wayback Machine s crawler only follows a predetermined number of hyperlinks based on a preset depth limit  so it cannot archive every hyperlink on every page             

In legal evidence edit 
Civil litigation edit 
Netbula LLC v  Chordiant Software Inc  edit 
In a      case  Netbula  LLC v  Chordiant Software Inc   defendant Chordiant filed a motion to compel Netbula to disable the robots txt file on its website that was causing the Wayback Machine to retroactively remove access to previous versions of pages it had archived from Netbula s site  pages that Chordiant believed would support its case             
Netbula objected to the motion on the ground that defendants were asking to alter Netbula s website and that they should have subpoenaed Internet Archive for the pages directly              An employee of Internet Archive filed a sworn statement supporting Chordiant s motion  however  stating that it could not produce the web pages by any other means  without considerable burden  expense and disruption to its operations              
Magistrate Judge Howard Lloyd in the Northern District of California  San Jose Division  rejected Netbula s arguments and ordered them to disable the robots txt blockage temporarily in order to allow Chordiant to retrieve the archived pages that they sought             

Telewizja Polska USA  Inc  v  Echostar Satellite edit 
In an October      case  Telewizja Polska USA  Inc  v  Echostar Satellite  No     C          Fed  R  Evid  Serv       N D  Ill  October            a litigant attempted to use the Wayback Machine archives as a source of admissible evidence  perhaps for the first time  Telewizja Polska is the provider of TVP Polonia and EchoStar operates the Dish Network  Prior to the trial proceedings  EchoStar indicated that it intended to offer Wayback Machine snapshots as proof of the past content of Telewizja Polska s website  Telewizja Polska brought a motion in limine to suppress the snapshots on the grounds of hearsay and unauthenticated source  but Magistrate Judge Arlander Keys rejected Telewizja Polska s assertion of hearsay and denied TVP s motion in limine to exclude the evidence at trial                          At the trial  however  District Court Judge Ronald Guzman  the trial judge  overruled Magistrate Keys  findings  and held that neither the affidavit of the Internet Archive employee nor the underlying pages  i e   the Telewizja Polska website  were admissible as evidence  Judge Guzman reasoned that the employee s affidavit contained both hearsay and inconclusive supporting statements  and the purported web page  printouts were not self authenticating                         

Patent law edit 
Main article  Internet as a source of prior art
The United States Patent and Trademark Office and the European Patent Office will accept date stamps from the Internet Archive as evidence of when a given Web page was accessible to the public  These dates are used to determine if a Web page is available as prior art for instance in examining a patent application             

Limitations of utility edit 
There are technical limitations to archiving a website  and as a consequence  opposing parties in litigation can misuse the results provided by website archives  This problem can be exacerbated by the practice of submitting screenshots of web pages in complaints  answers  or expert witness reports when the underlying links are not exposed and therefore  can contain errors  For example  archives such as the Wayback Machine do not fill out forms and therefore  do not include the contents of non RESTful e commerce databases in their archives             

Legal status edit 
In Europe  the Wayback Machine could be interpreted as violating copyright laws  Only the content creator can decide where their content is published or duplicated so the Archive would have to delete pages from its system upon request of the creator              The exclusion policies for the Wayback Machine may be found in the FAQ section of the site             
Some cases have been brought against the Internet Archive specifically for its Wayback Machine archiving efforts  

Archived content legal issues edit 
Scientology edit 
See also  Scientology and the Internet
In late       the Internet Archive removed various sites that were critical of Scientology from the Wayback Machine              An error message stated that this was in response to a  request by the site owner               Later  it was clarified that lawyers from the Church of Scientology had demanded the removal and that the site owners did not want their material removed             

Healthcare Advocates  Inc  edit 
In       Harding Earley Follmer  amp  Frailey defended a client from a trademark dispute using the Archive s Wayback Machine  The attorneys were able to demonstrate that the claims made by the plaintiff were invalid  based on the content of their website from several years prior  The plaintiff  Healthcare Advocates  then amended their complaint to include the Internet Archive  accusing the organization of copyright infringement as well as violations of the DMCA and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act  Healthcare Advocates claimed that  since they had installed a robots txt file on their website  even if after the initial lawsuit was filed  the Archive should have removed all previous copies of the plaintiff website from the Wayback Machine  however  some material continued to be publicly visible on Wayback              The lawsuit was settled out of court after Wayback fixed the problem             

Suzanne Shell edit 
Activist Suzanne Shell filed suit in December       demanding Internet Archive pay her US         for archiving her website profane justice org between      and                               Internet Archive filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on January           seeking a judicial determination that Internet Archive did not violate Shell s copyright  Shell responded and brought a countersuit against Internet Archive for archiving her site  which she alleges is in violation of her terms of service              On February           a judge for the United States District Court for the District of Colorado dismissed all counterclaims except breach of contract              The Internet Archive did not move to dismiss the copyright infringement claims that Shell asserted arose out of its copying activities  which would also go forward             
On April           Internet Archive and Suzanne Shell jointly announced the settlement of their lawsuit              The Internet Archive said it     has no interest in including materials in the Wayback Machine of persons who do not wish to have their Web content archived  We recognize that Ms  Shell has a valid and enforceable copyright in her Web site and we regret that the inclusion of her Web site in the Wayback Machine resulted in this litigation   Shell said   I respect the historical value of Internet Archive s goal  I never intended to interfere with that goal nor cause it any harm               

Daniel Davydiuk edit 
Between      and       a pornographic actor named Daniel Davydiuk tried to remove archived images of himself from the Wayback Machine s archive  first by sending multiple DMCA requests to the archive  and then by appealing to the Federal Court of Canada                                         The images were removed from the website in      

FlexiSpy edit 
In       archives of stalkerware application FlexiSpy s website were removed from the Wayback Machine  The company claimed to have contacted the Internet Archive  presumably to remove the archives of its website              

Censorship and other threats edit 
Archive org is blocked in China                                         The Internet Archive was blocked in its entirety in Russia in          ostensibly for hosting a Jihad outreach video                                        Since       the website has been back  available in its entirety  although in      Russian commercial lobbyists were suing the Internet Archive to ban it on copyright grounds              
In March       it was published that security researchers became aware of the threat posed by the service s unintentional hosting of malicious binaries from archived sites                           
Alison Macrina  director of the Library Freedom Project  notes that  while librarians deeply value individual privacy  we also strongly oppose censorship              
There is at least one case in which an article was removed from the archive shortly after it had been removed from its original website  A Daily Beast reporter had written an article that outed several gay Olympian athletes in      after the reporter had made a fake profile posing as a gay man on a dating app  The Daily Beast removed the article after it was met with widespread furor  not long after  the Internet Archive soon did as well  but emphatically stated that they did so for no other reason than to protect the safety of the outed athletes             
Other threats include natural disasters               destruction  both remote and physical                manipulation of the archive s contents  problematic copyright laws               and surveillance of the site s users              
Alexander Rose  executive director of the Long Now Foundation  suspects that in the long term of multiple generations  next to nothing  will survive in a useful way  stating   If we have continuity in our technological civilization  I suspect a lot of the bare data will remain findable and searchable  But I suspect almost nothing of the format in which it was delivered will be recognizable  because sites  with deep back ends of content management systems like Drupal and Ruby and Django  are harder to archive              
In       in an article reflecting on the preservation of human knowledge  The Atlantic has commented that the Internet Archive  which describes itself to be built for the long term                is working furiously to capture data before it disappears without any long term infrastructure to speak of
