Creation of audio files from databases of audio clips
Audio curves     relevant      
Generative audio refers to the creation of audio files from databases of audio clips      citation needed      This technology differs from synthesized voices such as Apple s Siri or Amazon s Alexa  which use a collection of fragments that are stitched together on demand  
Generative audio works by using neural networks to learn the statistical properties of an audio source  then reproduces those properties            


Implications edit 
With this technology  a person s voice can be replicated to speak phrases that they may have never spoken  This could lead to a synthetic version of a public figure s voice being used against them            

Technology edit 
Modern generative audio systems employ various deep learning architectures  One notable approach uses generative adversarial networks  GANs   where two machine learning models work against each other to create realistic audio  Other architectures include WaveNet  which uses dilated causal convolutions to model raw audio waveforms  and implementations like    ai  which demonstrated in      the ability to clone voices using as little as    seconds of training data through specialized neural network architectures
