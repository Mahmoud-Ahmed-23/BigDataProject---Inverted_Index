Type of formal logic

Modal logic is a kind of logic used to represent statements about necessity and possibility  In philosophy and related fields
it is used as a tool for understanding concepts such as knowledge  obligation  and causation  For instance  in epistemic modal logic  the formula 
  
    
      
          x  fb 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  Box P 
  
 can be used to represent the statement that 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 is known  In deontic modal logic  that same formula can represent that 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 is a moral obligation  Modal logic considers the inferences that modal statements give rise to  For instance  most epistemic modal logics treat the formula 
  
    
      
          x  fb 
        P
          x     
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  Box P rightarrow P 
  
 as a tautology  representing the principle that only true statements can count as knowledge  However  this formula is not a tautology in deontic modal logic  since what ought to be true can be false 
Modal logics are formal systems that include unary operators such as 
  
    
      
          x  ca 
      
    
      displaystyle  Diamond  
  
 and 
  
    
      
          x  fb 
      
    
      displaystyle  Box  
  
  representing possibility and necessity respectively  For instance the modal formula 
  
    
      
          x  ca 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  Diamond P 
  
 can be read as  possibly 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
  while 
  
    
      
          x  fb 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  Box P 
  
 can be read as  necessarily 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
   In the standard relational semantics for modal logic  formulas are assigned truth values relative to a possible world  A formula s truth value at one possible world can depend on the truth values of other formulas at other accessible possible worlds  In particular  
  
    
      
          x  ca 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  Diamond P 
  
 is true at a world if 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 is true at some accessible possible world  while 
  
    
      
          x  fb 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  Box P 
  
 is true at a world if 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 is true at every accessible possible world  A variety of proof systems exist which are sound and complete with respect to the semantics one gets by restricting the accessibility relation  For instance  the deontic modal logic D is sound and complete if one requires the accessibility relation to be serial 
While the intuition behind modal logic dates back to antiquity  the first modal axiomatic systems were developed by C  I  Lewis in       The now standard relational semantics emerged in the mid twentieth century from work by Arthur Prior  Jaakko Hintikka  and Saul Kripke  Recent developments include alternative topological semantics such as neighborhood semantics as well as applications of the relational semantics beyond its original philosophical motivation             Such applications include game theory             moral and legal theory             web design             multiverse based set theory             and social epistemology            


Syntax of modal operators edit 
Modal logic differs from other kinds of logic in that it uses modal operators such as 
  
    
      
          x  fb 
      
    
      displaystyle  Box  
  
 and 
  
    
      
          x  ca 
      
    
      displaystyle  Diamond  
  
  The former is conventionally read aloud as  necessarily   and can be used to represent notions such as moral or legal obligation  knowledge  historical inevitability  among others  The latter is typically read as  possibly  and can be used to represent notions including permission  ability  compatibility with evidence  While well formed formulas of modal logic include non modal formulas such as 
  
    
      
        P
          x     
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle P land Q 
  
  it also contains modal ones such as 
  
    
      
          x  fb 
         
        P
          x     
        Q
         
      
    
      displaystyle  Box  P land Q  
  
  
  
    
      
        P
          x     
          x  fb 
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle P land  Box Q 
  
  
  
    
      
          x  fb 
         
          x  ca 
        P
          x     
          x  ca 
        Q
         
      
    
      displaystyle  Box   Diamond P land  Diamond Q  
  
  and so on  
Thus  the language

 of basic propositional logic can be defined recursively as follows

          x c

            L

Modal operators can be added to other kinds of logic by introducing rules analogous to    and    above  Modal predicate logic is one widely used variant which includes formulas such as 
  
    
      
          x     
        x
          x  ca 
        P
         
        x
         
      
    
      displaystyle  forall x Diamond P x  
  
  In systems of modal logic where 
  
    
      
          x  fb 
      
    
      displaystyle  Box  
  
 and 
  
    
      
          x  ca 
      
    
      displaystyle  Diamond  
  
 are duals  
  
    
      
          x  fb 
          x d  
      
    
      displaystyle  Box  phi  
  
 can be taken as an abbreviation for 
  
    
      
          xac 
          x  ca 
          xac 
          x d  
      
    
      displaystyle  neg  Diamond  neg  phi  
  
  thus eliminating the need for a separate syntactic rule to introduce it  However  separate syntactic rules are necessary in systems where the two operators are not interdefinable 
Common notational variants include symbols such as 
  
    
      
         
        K
         
      
    
      displaystyle  K  
  
 and 
  
    
      
          x  e  
        K
          x  e  
      
    
      displaystyle  langle K rangle  
  
 in systems of modal logic used to represent knowledge and 
  
    
      
         
        B
         
      
    
      displaystyle  B  
  
 and 
  
    
      
          x  e  
        B
          x  e  
      
    
      displaystyle  langle B rangle  
  
 in those used to represent belief  These notations are particularly common in systems which use multiple modal operators simultaneously  For instance  a combined epistemic deontic logic could use the formula 
  
    
      
         
        K
         
          x  e  
        D
          x  e  
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  K  langle D rangle P 
  
 read as  I know P is permitted   Systems of modal logic can include infinitely many modal operators distinguished by indices  i e  
  
    
      
        
            x  fb

            x  fb 
          
             
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle  Box      
  
  
  
    
      
        
            x  fb

Semantics edit 
Relational semantics edit 
See also  Kripke semantics
Basic notions edit 
The standard semantics for modal logic is called the relational semantics  In this approach  the truth of a formula is determined relative to a point which is often called a possible world  For a formula that contains a modal operator  its truth value can depend on what is true at other accessible worlds  Thus  the relational semantics interprets formulas of modal logic using models defined as follows            

A relational model is a tuple 
  
    
      
        
          
            M
          
        
         
          x  e  
        W
         
        R
         
        V
          x  e  
      
    
      displaystyle   mathfrak  M    langle W R V rangle  
  
 where 

  
    
      
        W
      
    
      displaystyle W 
  
 is a set of possible worlds

  
    
      
        R
      
    
      displaystyle R 
  
 is a binary relation on 
  
    
      
        W
      
    
      displaystyle W 
  


  
    
      
        V
      
    
      displaystyle V 
  
 is a valuation function which assigns a truth value to each pair of an atomic formula and a world   i e  
  
    
      
        V
         
        W
          xd  
        F
          x     
         
         
         
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle V W times F to         
  
 where 
  
    
      
        F
      
    
      displaystyle F 
  
 is the set of atomic formulae 
The set 
  
    
      
        W
      
    
      displaystyle W 
  
 is often called the universe  The binary relation 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
      displaystyle R 
  
 is called an accessibility relation  and it controls which worlds can  see  each other for the sake of determining what is true  For example  
  
    
      
        w
        R
        u
      
    
      displaystyle wRu 
  
 means that the world 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
      displaystyle u 
  
 is accessible from world 
  
    
      
        w
      
    
      displaystyle w 
  
  That is to say  the state of affairs known as 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
      displaystyle u 
  
 is a live possibility for 
  
    
      
        w
      
    
      displaystyle w 
  
  Finally  the function 
  
    
      
        V
      
    
      displaystyle V 
  
 is known as a valuation function  It determines which atomic formulas are true at which worlds 
Then we recursively define the truth of a formula at a world 
  
    
      
        w
      
    
      displaystyle w 
  
 in a model 
  
    
      
        
          
            M

  it holds that 
  
    
      
        w
        R
        u
      
    
      displaystyle wRu 
  
 and 
  
    
      
        u
          x  a  
        P
      
    
      displaystyle u models P 
  

According to this semantics  a formula is necessary with respect to a world 
  
    
      
        w
      
    
      displaystyle w 
  
 if it holds at every world that is accessible from 
  
    
      
        w
      
    
      displaystyle w 
  
  It is possible if it holds at some world that is accessible from 
  
    
      
        w
      
    
      displaystyle w 
  
  Possibility thereby depends upon the accessibility relation 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
      displaystyle R 
  
  which allows us to express the relative nature of possibility  For example  we might say that given our laws of physics it is not possible for humans to travel faster than the speed of light  but that given other circumstances it could have been possible to do so  Using the accessibility relation we can translate this scenario as follows  At all of the worlds accessible to our own world  it is not the case that humans can travel faster than the speed of light  but at one of these accessible worlds there is another world accessible from those worlds but not accessible from our own at which humans can travel faster than the speed of light 

Frames and completeness edit 
The choice of accessibility relation alone can sometimes be sufficient to guarantee the truth or falsity of a formula  For instance  consider a model 
  
    
      
        
          
            M
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle   mathfrak  M   
  
 whose accessibility relation is reflexive  Because the relation is reflexive  we will have that 
  
    
      
        
          
            M
          
        
         
        w
          x  a  
        P
          x     
          x  ca 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle   mathfrak  M   w models P rightarrow  Diamond P 
  
 for any 
  
    
      
        w
          x     
        G
      
    
      displaystyle w in G 
  
 regardless of which valuation function is used  For this reason  modal logicians sometimes talk about frames  which are the portion of a relational model excluding the valuation function 

A relational frame is a pair 
  
    
      
        
          
            M
          
        
         
          x  e  
        G
         
        R
          x  e  
      
    
      displaystyle   mathfrak  M    langle G R rangle  
  
 where 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
      displaystyle G 
  
 is a set of possible worlds  
  
    
      
        R
      
    
      displaystyle R 
  
 is a binary relation on 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
      displaystyle G 
  
 
The different systems of modal logic are defined using frame conditions  A frame is called 

reflexive if w R w  for every w in G
symmetric if w R u implies u R w  for all w and u in G
transitive if w R u and u R q together imply w R q  for all w  u  q in G 
serial if  for every w in G there is some u in G such that w R u 
Euclidean if  for every u  t  and w  w R u and w R t implies u R t  by symmetry  it also implies t R u  as well as t R t and u R u 
The logics that stem from these frame conditions are 

K         no conditions
D         serial
T         reflexive
B         reflexive and symmetric
S          reflexive and transitive
S          reflexive and Euclidean
The Euclidean property along with reflexivity yields symmetry and transitivity   The Euclidean property can be obtained  as well  from symmetry and transitivity   Hence if the accessibility relation R is reflexive and Euclidean  R is provably symmetric and transitive as well  Hence for models of S   R is an equivalence relation  because R is reflexive  symmetric and transitive 
We can prove that these frames produce the same set of valid sentences as do the frames where all worlds can see all other worlds of W  i e   where R is a  total  relation   This gives the corresponding modal graph which is total complete  i e   no more edges  relations  can be added   For example  in any modal logic based on frame conditions 


  
    
      
        w
          x  a  
          x  ca 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle w models  Diamond P 
  
 if and only if for some element u of G  it holds that 
  
    
      
        u
          x  a  
        P
      
    
      displaystyle u models P 
  
 and w R u 
If we consider frames based on the total relation we can just say that


  
    
      
        w
          x  a  
          x  ca 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle w models  Diamond P 
  
 if and only if for some element u of G  it holds that 
  
    
      
        u
          x  a  
        P
      
    
      displaystyle u models P 
  
 
We can drop the accessibility clause from the latter stipulation because in such total frames it is trivially true of all w and u that w R u  But this does not have to be the case in all S  frames  which can still consist of multiple parts that are fully connected among themselves but still disconnected from each other 
All of these logical systems can also be defined axiomatically  as is shown in the next section  For example  in S   the axioms 
  
    
      
        P
        
          x  f  
        
          x  fb 
          x  ca 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P implies  Box  Diamond P 
  
  
  
    
      
          x  fb 
        P
        
          x  f  
        
          x  fb 
          x  fb 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  Box P implies  Box  Box P 
  
 and 
  
    
      
          x  fb 
        P
        
          x  f  
        
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  Box P implies P 
  
  corresponding to symmetry  transitivity and reflexivity  respectively  hold  whereas at least one of these axioms does not hold in each of the other  weaker logics 

Topological semantics edit 
Modal logic has also been interpreted using topological structures  For instance  the Interior Semantics interprets formulas of modal logic as follows 
A topological model is a tuple 
  
    
      
        
          X
        
         
          x  e  
        X
         
          x c  
         
        V

      displaystyle  mathrm  X    langle X  tau  V rangle

 is a topological space and 
  
    
      
        V
      
    
      displaystyle V 
  
 is a valuation function which maps each atomic formula to some subset of 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
      displaystyle X 
  
  The basic interior semantics interprets formulas of modal logic as follows

Topological approaches subsume relational ones  allowing non normal modal logics  The extra structure they provide also allows a transparent way of modeling certain concepts such as the evidence or justification one has for one s beliefs  Topological semantics is widely used in recent work in formal epistemology and has antecedents in earlier work such as David Lewis and Angelika Kratzer s logics for counterfactuals 

Axiomatic systems edit 
Diagram of common modal logics  K W stands for Provability logic  and B on the top corner stands for Brouwer s system of KTB
The first formalizations of modal logic were axiomatic  Numerous variations with very different properties have been proposed since C  I  Lewis began working in the area in       Hughes and Cresswell         for example  describe    normal and    non normal modal logics  Zeman        describes some systems Hughes and Cresswell omit 
Modern treatments of modal logic begin by augmenting the propositional calculus with two unary operations  one denoting  necessity  and the other  possibility   The notation of C  I  Lewis  much employed since  denotes  necessarily p  by a prefixed  box    p  whose scope is established by parentheses  Likewise  a prefixed  diamond    p  denotes  possibly p   Similar to the quantifiers in first order logic   necessarily p    p  does not assume the range of quantification  the set of accessible possible worlds in Kripke semantics  to be non empty  whereas  possibly p    p  often implicitly assumes

      displaystyle  Diamond  top  
  
  viz  the set of accessible possible worlds is non empty   Regardless of notation  each of these operators is definable in terms of the other in classical modal logic 

 p  necessarily p  is equivalent to    p   not possible that not p  
 p  possibly p  is equivalent to    p   not necessarily not p  
Hence   and   form a dual pair of operators 
In many modal logics  the necessity and possibility operators satisfy the following analogues of de Morgan s laws from Boolean algebra 

 It is not necessary that X  is logically equivalent to  It is possible that not X  
 It is not possible that X  is logically equivalent to  It is necessary that not X  
Precisely what axioms and rules must be added to the propositional calculus to create a usable system of modal logic is a matter of philosophical opinion  often driven by the theorems one wishes to prove  or  in computer science  it is a matter of what sort of computational or deductive system one wishes to model  Many modal logics  known collectively as normal modal logics  include the following rule and axiom 

N  Necessitation Rule  If p is a theorem tautology  of any system model invoking N   then  p is likewise a theorem  i e

      displaystyle   models p  implies   models  Box p  
  
  
K  Distribution Axiom    p   q      p    q  
The weakest normal modal logic  named  K  in honor of Saul Kripke  is simply the propositional calculus augmented by    the rule N  and the axiom K  K is weak in that it fails to determine whether a proposition can be necessary but only contingently necessary  That is  it is not a theorem of K that if  p is true then   p is true  i e   that necessary truths are  necessarily necessary   If such perplexities are deemed forced and artificial  this defect of K is not a great one  In any case  different answers to such questions yield different systems of modal logic 
Adding axioms to K gives rise to other well known modal systems  One cannot prove in K that if  p is necessary  then p is true  The axiom T remedies this defect 

T  Reflexivity Axiom   p   p  If p is necessary  then p is the case  
T holds in most but not all modal logics  Zeman        describes a few exceptions  such as S   
Other well known elementary axioms are

K through S  form a nested hierarchy of systems  making up the core of normal modal logic  But specific rules or sets of rules may be appropriate for specific systems  For example  in deontic logic

  If it ought to be that p  then it is permitted that p  seems appropriate  but we should probably not include that 
  
    
      
        p

          x  ca

      displaystyle p to  Box  Diamond p 
  
  In fact  to do so is to commit the naturalistic fallacy  i e  to state that what is natural is also good  by saying that if p is the case  p ought to be permitted  
The commonly employed system S  simply makes all modal truths necessary  For example  if p is possible  then it is  necessary  that p is possible  Also  if p is necessary  then it is necessary that p is necessary  Other systems of modal logic have been formulated  in part because S  does not describe every kind of modality of interest 

Structural proof theory edit 
Sequent calculi and systems of natural deduction have been developed for several modal logics  but it has proven hard to combine generality with other features expected of good structural proof theories  such as purity  the proof theory does not introduce extra logical notions such as labels  and analyticity  the logical rules support a clean notion of analytic proof   More complex calculi have been applied to modal logic to achieve generality      citation needed     

Decision methods edit 
Analytic tableaux provide the most popular decision method for modal logics            

Modal logics in philosophy edit 
Alethic logic edit 
Main article  Subjunctive possibility
Modalities of necessity and possibility are called alethic modalities  They are also sometimes called special modalities  from the Latin species  Modal logic was first developed to deal with these concepts  and only afterward was extended to others  For this reason  or perhaps for their familiarity and simplicity  necessity and possibility are often casually treated as the subject matter of modal logic  Moreover  it is easier to make sense of relativizing necessity  e g  to legal  physical  nomological  epistemic  and so on  than it is to make sense of relativizing other notions 
In classical modal logic  a proposition is said to be

possible if it is not necessarily false  regardless of whether it is actually true or actually false  
necessary if it is not possibly false  i e  true and necessarily true  
contingent if it is not necessarily false and not necessarily true  i e  possible but not necessarily true  
impossible if it is not possibly true  i e  false and necessarily false  
In classical modal logic  therefore  the notion of either possibility or necessity may be taken to be basic  where these other notions are defined in terms of it in the manner of De Morgan duality  Intuitionistic modal logic treats possibility and necessity as not perfectly symmetric 
For example  suppose that while walking to the convenience store we pass Friedrich s house  and observe that the lights are off  On the way back  we observe that they have been turned on 

 Somebody or something turned the lights on  is necessary 
 Friedrich turned the lights on    Friedrich s roommate Max turned the lights on  and  A burglar named Adolf broke into Friedrich s house and turned the lights on  are contingent 
All of the above statements are possible 
It is impossible that Socrates  who has been dead for over two thousand years  turned the lights on 
 Of course  this analogy does not apply alethic modality in a truly rigorous fashion  for it to do so  it would have to axiomatically make such statements as  human beings cannot rise from the dead    Socrates was a human being and not an immortal vampire   and  we did not take hallucinogenic drugs which caused us to falsely believe the lights were on   ad infinitum  Absolute certainty of truth or falsehood exists only in the sense of logically constructed abstract concepts such as  it is impossible to draw a triangle with four sides  and  all bachelors are unmarried   
For those having difficulty with the concept of something being possible but not true  the meaning of these terms may be made more comprehensible by thinking of multiple  possible worlds   in the sense of Leibniz  or  alternate universes   something  necessary  is true in all possible worlds  something  possible  is true in at least one possible world  

Physical possibility edit 
Something is physically  or nomically  possible if it is permitted by the laws of physics      citation needed      For example  current theory is thought to allow for there to be an atom with an atomic number of                 even if there are no such atoms in existence  In contrast  while it is logically possible to accelerate beyond the speed of light             modern science stipulates that it is not physically possible for material particles or information             Physical possibility does not coincide with empirical possibility             

Metaphysical possibility edit 
Main article  Modal metaphysics
Philosophers     who       debate if objects have properties independent of those dictated by scientific laws  For example  it might be metaphysically necessary  as some who advocate physicalism have thought  that all thinking beings have bodies             and can experience the passage of time  Saul Kripke has argued that every person necessarily has the parents they do have  anyone with different parents would not be the same person             
Metaphysical possibility has been thought to be more restricting than bare logical possibility              i e   fewer things are metaphysically possible than are logically possible   However  its exact relation  if any  to logical possibility or to physical possibility is a matter of dispute  Philosophers     who       also disagree over whether metaphysical truths are necessary merely  by definition   or whether they reflect some underlying deep facts about the world  or something else entirely

Epistemic modalities  from the Greek episteme  knowledge   deal with the certainty of sentences  The   operator is translated as  x is certain that    and the   operator is translated as  For all x knows  it may be true that   In ordinary speech both metaphysical and epistemic modalities are often expressed in similar words  the following contrasts may help 
A person  Jones  might reasonably say both       No  it is not possible that Bigfoot exists  I am quite certain of that   and       Sure  it s possible that Bigfoots could exist   What Jones means by     is that  given all the available information  there is no question remaining as to whether Bigfoot exists  This is an epistemic claim  By     he makes the metaphysical claim that it is possible for Bigfoot to exist  even though he does not  there is no physical or biological reason that large  featherless  bipedal creatures with thick hair could not exist in the forests of North America  regardless of whether or not they do   Similarly   it is possible for the person reading this sentence to be fourteen feet tall and named Chad  is metaphysically true  such a person would not somehow be prevented from doing so on account of their height and name   but not alethically true unless you match that description  and not epistemically true if it is known that fourteen foot tall human beings have never existed 
From the other direction  Jones might say       It is possible that Goldbach s conjecture is true  but also possible that it is false   and also      if it is true  then it is necessarily true  and not possibly false   Here Jones means that it is epistemically possible that it is true or false  for all he knows  Goldbach s conjecture has not been proven either true or false   but if there is a proof  heretofore undiscovered   then it would show that it is not logically possible for Goldbach s conjecture to be false there could be no set of numbers that violated it  Logical possibility is a form of alethic possibility      makes a claim about whether it is possible  i e   logically speaking  that a mathematical truth to have been false  but     only makes a claim about whether it is possible  for all Jones knows   i e   speaking of certitude  that the mathematical claim is specifically either true or false  and so again Jones does not contradict himself  It is worthwhile to observe that Jones is not necessarily correct  It is possible  epistemically  that Goldbach s conjecture is both true and unprovable 
Epistemic possibilities also bear on the actual world in a way that metaphysical possibilities do not  Metaphysical possibilities bear on ways the world might have been  but epistemic possibilities bear on the way the world may be  for all we know   Suppose  for example  that I want to know whether or not to take an umbrella before I leave  If you tell me  it is possible that it is raining outside    in the sense of epistemic possibility   then that would weigh on whether or not I take the umbrella  But if you just tell me that  it is possible for it to rain outside    in the sense of metaphysical possibility   then I am no better off for this bit of modal enlightenment 
Some features of epistemic modal logic are in debate  For example  if x knows that p  does x know that it knows that p  That is to say  should  P     P be an axiom in these systems  While the answer to this question is unclear              there is at least one axiom that is generally included in epistemic modal logic  because it is minimally true of all normal modal logics  see the section on axiomatic systems

It has been questioned whether the epistemic and alethic modalities should be considered distinct from each other  The criticism states that there is no real difference between  the truth in the world   alethic  and  the truth in an individual s mind   epistemic               An investigation has not found a single language in which alethic and epistemic modalities are formally distinguished  as by the means of a grammatical mood             

Temporal logic edit 
Main article  Temporal logic
Temporal logic is an approach to the semantics of expressions with tense  that is  expressions with qualifications of when  Some expressions  such as              are true at all times  while tensed expressions such as  John is happy  are only true sometimes 
In temporal logic  tense constructions are treated in terms of modalities  where a standard method for formalizing talk of time is to use two pairs of operators  one for the past and one for the future  P will just mean  it is presently the case that P    For example 

FP        It will sometimes be the case that P
GP        It will always be the case that P
PP        It was sometime the case that P
HP        It has always been the case that P
There are then at least three modal logics that we can develop  For example  we can stipulate that 


  
    
      
          x  ca 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  Diamond P 
  
   P is the case at some time t

  
    
      
          x  fb 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  Box P 
  
   P is the case at every time t
Or we can trade these operators to deal only with the future  or past   For example 


  
    
      
        
            x  ca

   P and GP
The operators F and G may seem initially foreign  but they create normal modal systems  FP is the same as  G P  We can combine the above operators to form complex statements  For example  PP    PP says  effectively   Everything that is past and true is necessary 
It seems reasonable to say that possibly it will rain tomorrow  and possibly it will not  on the other hand  since we cannot change the past  if it is true that it rained yesterday  it cannot be true that it may not have rained yesterday  It seems the past is  fixed   or necessary  in a way the future is not  This is sometimes referred to as accidental necessity  But if the past is  fixed   and everything that is in the future will eventually be in the past  then it seems plausible to say that future events are necessary too 
Similarly  the problem of future contingents considers the semantics of assertions about the future  is either of the propositions  There will be a sea battle tomorrow   or  There will not be a sea battle tomorrow  now true  Considering this thesis led Aristotle to reject the principle of bivalence for assertions concerning the future 
Additional binary operators are also relevant to temporal logics  see Linear temporal logic  
Versions of temporal logic can be used in computer science to model computer operations and prove theorems about them  In one version   P means  at a future time in the computation it is possible that the computer state will be such that P is true    P means  at all future times in the computation P will be true   In another version   P means  at the immediate next state of the computation  P might be true    P means  at the immediate next state of the computation  P will be true   These differ in the choice of Accessibility relation   P always means  P is true at the current computer state    These two examples involve nondeterministic or not fully understood computations  there are many other modal logics specialized to different types of program analysis  Each one naturally leads to slightly different axioms 

Deontic logic edit 
Main article  Deontic logic
Likewise talk of morality  or of obligation and norms generally  seems to have a modal structure  The difference between  You must do this  and  You may do this  looks a lot like the difference between  This is necessary  and  This is possible   Such logics are called deontic  from the Greek for  duty  
Deontic logics commonly lack the axiom T semantically corresponding to the reflexivity of the accessibility relation in Kripke semantics  in symbols

          x d

          x d  
      
    
      displaystyle  Box  phi  to  phi  
  
  Interpreting   as  it is obligatory that   T informally says that every obligation is true  For example  if it is obligatory not to kill others  i e  killing is morally forbidden   then T implies that people actually do not kill others  The consequent is obviously false 
Instead  using Kripke semantics  we say that though our own world does not realize all obligations  the worlds accessible to it do  i e   T holds at these worlds   These worlds are called idealized worlds  P is obligatory with respect to our own world if at all idealized worlds accessible to our world  P holds  Though this was one of the first interpretations of the formal semantics  it has recently come under criticism             
One other principle that is often  at least traditionally  accepted as a deontic principle is D

  which corresponds to the seriality  or extendability or unboundedness  of the accessibility relation  It is an embodiment of the Kantian idea that  ought implies can    Clearly the  can  can be interpreted in various senses  e g  in a moral or alethic sense  

Intuitive problems with deontic logic edit 
When we try to formalize ethics with standard modal logic  we run into some problems  Suppose that we have a proposition K  you have stolen some money  and another  Q  you have stolen a small amount of money  Now suppose we want to express the thought that  if you have stolen some money  it ought to be a small amount of money   There are two likely candidates 

    
  
    
      
         
        K
          x     
          x  fb 
        Q
         
      
    
      displaystyle  K to  Box Q  
  

    
  
    
      
          x  fb 
         
        K
          x     
        Q
         
      
    
      displaystyle  Box  K to Q  
  

But     and K together entail  Q  which says that it ought to be the case that you have stolen a small amount of money  This surely is not right  because you ought not to have stolen anything at all  And     does not work either  If the right representation of  if you have stolen some money it ought to be a small amount  is      then the right representation of      if you have stolen some money then it ought to be a large amount  is 
  
    
      
          x  fb 
         
        K

      displaystyle  Box  K to  K land  lnot Q   
  
  Now suppose  as seems reasonable  that you ought not to steal anything  or 
  
    
      
          x  fb 
          xac 
        K

        K
      
    
      displaystyle Q to K 
  
   so sentence     follows from our hypothesis  of course the same logic shows sentence       But that cannot be right  and is not right when we use natural language  Telling someone they should not steal certainly does not imply that they should steal large amounts of money if they do engage in theft             

Doxastic logic edit 
Main article  Doxastic logic
Doxastic logic concerns the logic of belief  of some set of agents   The term doxastic is derived from the ancient Greek doxa which means  belief   Typically  a doxastic logic uses    often written  B   to mean  It is believed that   or when relativized to a particular agent s   It is believed by s that  

Extensions edit 
Modal logics may be extended to fuzzy form with calculi in the class of fuzzy Kripke models             
Modal logics may also be enhanced via base extension semantics for the classical propositional systems  In this case  the validity of a formula can be shown by an inductive definition generated by provability in a  base  of atomic rules             
 
Intuitionistic modal logics are used in different areas of application  and they have often risen from different sources  The areas include the foundations of mathematics  computer science and philosophy  In these approaches  often modalities are added to intuitionistic logic to create new intuitionistic connectives and to simulate the monadic elements of intuitionistic first order logic             

Metaphysical questions edit 
Further information  Accessibility relation and Possible worlds
In the most common interpretation of modal logic  one considers  logically possible worlds   If a statement is true in all possible worlds  then it is a necessary truth  If a statement happens to be true in our world  but is not true in all possible worlds  then it is a contingent truth  A statement that is true in some possible world  not necessarily our own  is called a possible truth 
Under this  possible worlds idiom   to maintain that Bigfoot s existence is possible but not actual  one says   There is some possible world in which Bigfoot exists  but in the actual world  Bigfoot does not exist   However  it is unclear what this claim commits us to  Are we really alleging the existence of possible worlds  every bit as real as our actual world  just not actual  Saul Kripke believes that  possible world  is something of a misnomer   that the term  possible world  is just a useful way of visualizing the concept of possibility              For him  the sentences  you could have rolled a   instead of a    and  there is a possible world where you rolled a    but you rolled a   in the actual world  are not significantly different statements  and neither commit us to the existence of a possible world              David Lewis  on the other hand  made himself notorious by biting the bullet  asserting that all merely possible worlds are as real as our own  and that what distinguishes our world as actual is simply that it is indeed our world   this world              That position is a major tenet of  modal realism   Some philosophers decline to endorse any version of modal realism  considering it ontologically extravagant  and prefer to seek various ways to paraphrase away these ontological commitments  Robert Adams holds that  possible worlds  are better thought of as  world stories   or consistent sets of propositions  Thus  it is possible that you rolled a   if such a state of affairs can be described coherently             
Computer scientists will generally pick a highly specific interpretation of the modal operators specialized to the particular sort of computation being analysed  In place of  all worlds   you may have  all possible next states of the computer   or  all possible future states of the computer  

Further applications edit 
Modal logics have begun to be used in areas of the humanities such as literature  poetry  art and history                          In the philosophy of religion  modal logics are commonly used in arguments for the existence of God             

History edit 
The basic ideas of modal logic date back to antiquity  Aristotle developed a modal syllogistic in Book I of his Prior Analytics  ch         which Theophrastus attempted to improve              There are also passages in Aristotle s work  such as the famous sea battle argument in De Interpretatione     that are now seen as anticipations of the connection of modal logic with potentiality and time  In the Hellenistic period  the logicians Diodorus Cronus  Philo the Dialectician and the Stoic Chrysippus each developed a modal system that accounted for the interdefinability of possibility and necessity  accepted axiom T  see below   and combined elements of modal logic and temporal logic in attempts to solve the notorious Master Argument              The earliest formal system of modal logic was developed by Avicenna  who ultimately developed a theory of  temporally modal  syllogistic              Modal logic as a self aware subject owes much to the writings of the Scholastics  in particular William of Ockham and John Duns Scotus  who reasoned informally in a modal manner  mainly to analyze statements about essence and accident 
In the   th century  Hugh MacColl made innovative contributions to modal logic  but did not find much acknowledgment              C  I  Lewis founded modern modal logic in a series of scholarly articles beginning in      with  Implication and the Algebra of Logic                           Lewis was led to invent modal logic  and specifically strict implication  on the grounds that classical logic grants paradoxes of material implication such as the principle that a falsehood implies any proposition              This work culminated in his      book Symbolic Logic  with C  H  Langford               which introduced the five systems S  through S  
After Lewis  modal logic received little attention for several decades  Nicholas Rescher has argued that this was because Bertrand Russell rejected it              However  Jan Dejnozka has argued against this view  stating that a modal system which Dejnozka calls  MDL  is described in Russell s works  although Russell did believe the concept of modality to  come from confusing propositions with propositional functions   as he wrote in The Analysis of Matter             
Ruth C  Barcan  later Ruth Barcan Marcus  developed the first axiomatic systems of quantified modal logic   first and second order extensions of Lewis  S   S   and S                                       Arthur Norman Prior warned her to prepare well in the debates concerning quantified modal logic with Willard Van Orman Quine  because of bias against modal logic             
The contemporary era in modal semantics began in       when Saul Kripke  then only a    year old Harvard University undergraduate  introduced the now standard Kripke semantics for modal logics  These are commonly referred to as  possible worlds  semantics  Kripke and A  N  Prior had previously corresponded at some length  Kripke semantics is basically simple  but proofs are eased using semantic tableaux or analytic tableaux  as explained by E  W  Beth 
A  N  Prior created modern temporal logic  closely related to modal logic  in      by adding modal operators  F  and  P  meaning  eventually  and  previously   Vaughan Pratt introduced dynamic logic in       In       Amir Pnueli proposed using temporal logic to formalise the behaviour of continually operating concurrent programs  Flavors of temporal logic include propositional dynamic logic  PDL    propositional  linear temporal logic  LTL   computation tree logic  CTL   Hennessy Milner logic  and T      clarification needed     
The mathematical structure of modal logic  namely Boolean algebras augmented with unary operations  often called modal algebras   began to emerge with J  C  C  McKinsey s      proof that S  and S  are decidable              and reached full flower in the work of Alfred Tarski and his student Bjarni J nsson  J nsson and Tarski           This work revealed that S  and S  are models of interior algebra  a proper extension of Boolean algebra originally designed to capture the properties of the interior and closure operators of topology  Texts on modal logic typically do little more than mention its connections with the study of Boolean algebras and topology  For a thorough survey of the history of formal modal logic and of the associated mathematics  see Robert Goldblatt
