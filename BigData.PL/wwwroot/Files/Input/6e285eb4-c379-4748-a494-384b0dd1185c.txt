   Start the server
app listen            gt   
    console log      Server is running on http   localhost            
   

It will start a server  and when you visit http   localhost       it will displayWelcome to the Express js TutorialIn this example Express is imported using require  express    and an app instance is created with express   A route is defined using the app get   method  which responds with a message when the root URL     is accessed The app listen   method starts the server and listens on port
