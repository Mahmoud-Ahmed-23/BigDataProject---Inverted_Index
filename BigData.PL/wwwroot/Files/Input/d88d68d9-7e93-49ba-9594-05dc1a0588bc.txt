Artificial intelligence  AI or A I   is a computer program or a machine that is able to learn and mimic human cognition                        Sometimes  AI is used to talk about neural networks or deep learning 
Artificial intelligence is a system s ability to understand external data  to learn from that data  and to use what it has learned to achieve specific goals or tasks through adaptation            
Artificial intelligence is widely applied in speech recognition  image recognition  robotics  autonomous systems  natural language processing  machine translation  predictive analytics  medical diagnostics  fraud detection  and the control of physical processes 


Origin of name change   change source 
John McCarthy came up with the name   artificial intelligence  in       Intelligence allows an organism to act in a meaningful way in its environment  It includes the ability to get sensory inputs  and to react to these 

Laws change   change source 
The European Union made a law       s second quarter  about artificial intelligence  It is the world s first law that regulates AI            
Connecticut and Colorado tried to pass laws  in       regarding use of AI            

History change   change source 
AI research started with a conference at Dartmouth College in       It was a month long brainstorming session many people who like AI came to  At the conference  they wrote programs which were able to beat humans at checkers or solving word problems  The Department of Defense started giving a lot of money to AI research  and labs were created all over the world 
In a paper on AI  mathematician James Lighthill wrote  no aspect of the discipline has so far seen discoveries generated the huge influence that was previously anticipated In no part of the field have the discoveries made so far produced the major impact that was then promised        The governments of the US and UK decided to spend money on other projects which caused little new research to be done  This was known as an  AI winter             

In the   s and early     s  AI became important again in data mining and medical diagnosis  This was possible because of faster computers and focusing on solving more specific problems  Deep Blue  a chess computer that became famous        In       the chess computer Deep Blue became the first computer program to beat chess world champion Garry Kasparov  In       IBM Watson beat the top two Jeopardy  players Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings  In       Google s AlphaGo beat top Go player Lee Sedol   out of   times 
The idea is perhaps much older  Julien Offray de La Mettrie             was a materialist thinker of the Enlightenment  In his work of       L Homme Machine  he had the idea that both matter and life organized themselves             He is seen as one of the precursors of Darwin s theory of evolution             Today  one field of artificial intelligence  called strong artificial intelligence wants to build a machine that can think like a person             However  weak artificial intelligence is about building a system that can support a human  One of the key problems is to make systems that can model wikt uncertainity  Most of the time  this is done with probability theory and statistics 

Uses of artificial intelligence change   change source 
Artificial intelligence is used in many different areas today 

Healthcare  see Artificial intelligence in healthcare  AI helps doctors diagnose diseases and find treatments for patients 
Industry specific tasks  AI applications are used to solve problems in a workplace  industry  or institutions 
Finance  Banks use AI to find fraud and make trading decisions 
Customer service  Many companies use AI chatbots to answer customer questions and provide support 
Personal assistants  AI assistants like Siri and Alexa help people manage their daily tasks 
Entertainment  AI is used in video games to create smart  responsive characters and stories that change in fun ways based on what the player does  AI is used to create videos now a days by using different models like Sora 
Those subjects are part of Game artificial intelligence 

Military  Military artificial intelligence 
Generative AI  or Generative artificial intelligence 
Some software has become well known  such as ChatGPT  a chatbot and virtual assistant  

Domains of artificial intelligence change   change source

Types  and classes  of artificial intelligence change   change source 
Researchers Kaplan and Haenlein say there are three types of AI system  analytical  human inspired  and humanized artificial intelligence             

Analytical A I  has similarities with cognitive intelligence which tries to understand the world and make decisions based on that 
Human inspired A I  which tries to be more  human  with cognitive intelligence with emotional intelligence 
Humanized A I  is able to understand human social activity and is able to be self aware            
Controversies regarding use of A I  change   change source 
In       a municipality in Norway made a report in regard to permanently closing down schools  The report used ghost source  or fictitious sources   Those sources were claimed to be the works of two  named  professors  The municipality admitted that the report was made  partly  by A I   The process of closing down schools  has stopped  as of March               An official that was involved  resigned  or left her job  one month later               See Hallucination  artificial intelligence

Trivia sections are NOT encouraged under Wikipedia guidelines  Please improve this article by integrating relevant items and removing inappropriate ones 
Researchers didn t know how difficult several issues were  They still couldn t offer computers things like emotions or common sense 
Faster computers  deep learning  and more data have made AI popular throughout the world              
An great intelligent machine is flexible and perceives what is around it  It would use what it learns to make its chance of success at some goal better             
AI has been successful with decoding human speech             playing games  like chess and Go   self driving cars  and understanding complex data             
Someday  AI researchers hope to create computer programs that can learn  solve problems  and think logically                          So far  most AI programs only do what computers can do well like searching databases or doing calculations  AI is not able to sense and understand what is happening around itself because of problems with what computers can do 
AI involves many different fields like computer science  mathematics  linguistics  psychology  neuroscience  and philosophy  Researchers hope to make a  general artificial intelligence  which can solve many problems instead of focusing on just one  Researchers are also trying to make creative and emotional AI which could create art  Alan Turing wrote in       I propose to consider the question  can machines think                He said the question should be changed from if a machine  thinks  to  whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behavior               Alain Turing also created the Turing test  This is a very general test  If a human cannot tell if at the other end of the line  there is a machine or a human answering questions  the machine is intelligent 
The authors of Artificial Intelligence  A Modern Approach agree with Turing that AI must be defined by  acting  and not  thinking               But they don t think the test compares machines to people   Aeronautical engineering texts do not define the goal of their field as making  machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons                AI founder John McCarthy agreed  writing that  Artificial intelligence is not  by definition  simulation of human intelligence                          
Computers can do some things like learning and problem solving  but not in the same way as people do            
Interestingly  advancements in AI have expanded its applications  including the use of Large language models  LLMs  to  humanize  AI generated text  This reflects a growing interest in bridging the gap between machine outputs and human like expression              
AI and machine learning technology is used in applications including  search engines  recommendation systems   virtual assistants  autonomous vehicles  automatic language translation  facial recognition  image labeling  advertising  and driving internet traffic 
One interesting use of AI is in helping people with their personal relationships  For example  ChatGPT is a powerful AI tool that can create human like text and assist in many communication tasks             
Optical character recognition is no longer thought of as an example of  artificial intelligence  since it s now commonly used
