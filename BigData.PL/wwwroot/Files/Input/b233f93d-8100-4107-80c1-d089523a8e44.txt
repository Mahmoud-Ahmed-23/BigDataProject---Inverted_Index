							CAIRO  Egypt       s Muslim Brotherhood urged the state to protect Christian places of worship after an Al Qaeda group in Iraq  which claimed a deadly attack on a church in Baghdad  issued a threat against Egypt       s Coptic church  Al Azhar also condemned the attacks in statement on Tuesday 
 quot The Muslim Brotherhood is stressing to all  and primarily Muslims  that the protection of holy places of all monotheistic religions is the mission of the majority of Muslims  quot  the group said in a statement on its website late on Tuesday 
 quot The Brothers reject all stupid threats against Christian places of worship in Egypt issued by anyone and under any pretext  quot  the group said 
 quot The Egyptian state and the Egyptian people must protect holy places of all worshippers of monotheistic religions  quot  it added 
The self proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq  ISI  has declared Christians  quot legitimate targets quot  as a deadline expired for Egypt       s Coptic church to free women allegedly held after converting to Islam 
ISI said in an internet statement its threat was justified by the church       s refusal to indicate the status of the women it said were being held captive in monasteries  the US based monitoring group SITE said 
 quot All Christian centers  organizations and institutions  leaders and followers  are legitimate targets for the mujahedeen  holy warriors  wherever they can reach them  quot  said the statement 
The group which claimed the capturing of Christians in a Baghdad church that ended Sunday with the killing of    worshippers in a rescue drama  had said that the attack was to seek the release of the alleged converts in Egypt 
An Egyptian security source told AFP that security around Coptic places of worship had been  quot discreetly reinforced with plainclothes police and patrols  quot 
Egypt       s top cleric condemned on Tuesday the massacre of hostages by Al Qaeda gunmen in a Baghdad church  calling it a  quot heinous act  quot  his spokesman said 
Ahmed al Tayyeb  grand imam of Al Azhar  the oldest Islamic seat of learning  affirmed that  quot Islam and Muslims have nothing to do with such acts  which harm Islam and violate Islamic precepts  quot  state news agency Mena quoted spokesman Mohamed Al Tahtawi as saying 
 quot Regarding the threat to target Egyptian churches  Al Tayyeb affirmed that this is something to be rejected and strongly denounced  and it serves none but those who want to spark discord and target national unity  quot  Al Tahtawi said
