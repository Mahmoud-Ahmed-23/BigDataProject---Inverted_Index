Forms of handicaps edit 
In the game of Go  a handicap is given by means of stones and compensation points   In contrast to an even game  in which Black plays first  White plays the first move in a game with handicap  after Black s handicap stones have been placed  

Handicap stones edit 
The rank difference within a given amateur ranking system is one guide to how many handicap stones should be given to make the game a more equal contest  As a general rule  each rank represents the value of one stone   In terms of points  one stone is considered to be       points  but this figure is not constant over levels  the more skillful a player  the greater the usefulness of each stone  
For example  a   kyu player gives a    kyu player four handicap stones to allow for an interesting game with roughly equal challenge for both players  If traditional fixed placement of the handicap stones is used  nine stones is normally the maximum handicap  Larger handicaps are certainly possible  but with such a great difference in strength  Black may be simply bewildered  and not understand how many of White s moves relate to his own 
The above rank relationship reliably applies for single digit kyu     k  and amateur dan     d  ranks  The advantage of moving first is equivalent to only half a stone of handicap  as the opponent then has the initiative   Because White gets the next move after Black places the handicap stones  a nominal handicap of n stones is therefore in reality half a stone less than n 
Nowadays professional ranks are awarded by professional Go players  organizations  they are  unlike amateur ranks  not reliable as a measure of current playing strength  but rather an indication of achievements  Before the late   th century  they were used as strength measurement  with a difference in skill of less than a third of a stone per rank 

Small board handicaps edit 
Small boards are often used for novice players  double digit kyu players  just learning to play Go  or for quick games  As the fewer moves made when playing on smaller boards gives White fewer chances to overcome the advantage conferred by the handicap  smaller handicaps are used on smaller Go boards  most commonly       and                 
The per rank handicap is therefore reduced  by a scaling factor  Various estimates have been given for the factor that applies to        in the range     up to    and on grounds both theoretical and experimental  small board tournament play   The evidence is that     is more realistic than    for clock games  The corresponding factor for a     board is not easy to understand  and the change for each stone added is very large 
One theoretical approach is according to the distribution of the number of moves made in a game on a board of a given size relative to the number made on a       board  Using estimates that a       game will last about         moves  a       game about        moves  and a     game about       moves  a quadratic formula for the ratio of the mean number of plays may apply  Arguing that White catches up by means of Black s  small errors   so that White s deficit drifts at a constant rate  it makes sense to take the ratio of game lengths as scaling factor            
Each full stone of handicap on a       board is in any case probably equivalent to about     to   ranks  and each full stone on a     board is equivalent to about   ranks  For example  if the appropriate handicap is    i e        stones on a       board  the handicap between those two players is reduced to    because                   stones on a   x   board  and                 stones on a     board  A    i e        stone handicap on a     board is accordingly equivalent to a handicap of    or    stones on a       board 
These figures are not a consensus  but have wide support  They can be used to give rankings  by converting       handicaps back to rank difference 

Handicap placement edit 
Fixed placement edit 
The traditional placement of handicap stones
There are   star points marked on a    x    board   in each corner on the       point  in the middle of each side on the fourth line          and the very center of the board           Traditionally handicaps are always placed on the star points  as follows 



Stones

Placement

Locations


 

Black plays his first stone as he wishes  and gives no komi

None


 

Black plays the star points to his upper right and lower left

A B


 

Black adds the star point to his lower right  In Classical Chinese rules the third handicap stone is place on tengen 

A B C  or E 


 

Black takes all four corner star points

A B C D


 

Black adds the center star point

A B C D E


 

Black takes all three star points at left and right

A B C D F G


 

Black adds the center star point

A B C D E F G


 

Black takes all star points except the center

A B C D F G H I


 

Black takes all nine star points

A B C D E F G H I

As the stones are always at the same       points in the corners  Black always plays more       openings  and doesn t gain experience playing the       openings  or others such as                      etc   except on two and three stones            

Free placement edit 
Recently  some have advocated free placement of handicap stones  Free placement means one can place handicap stones anywhere on the board without restriction  Here is the list of countries            and servers            that use free placement of handicap stones            



Fixed Placement

Japan  Korea  United States  by default   
IGS online server



Free Placement

China  Ing  New Zealand

Although free placement is less common because many players are attached to tradition  especially in East Asian countries  it offers advantages which are not available with fixed placement 

Advantages edit 
For weaker players 

They can choose their opening strategies according to their own understanding of the game  and thus follow a consistent strategy 
They can think for themselves and learn about different opening strategies through actual game experience 
The mandatory handicap points stress influence rather than taking territory directly  some weaker players have a more territorial style 
They can learn a much larger range of corner plays in actual competition against stronger opponents 
For stronger players 

Many more variations with fewer repetitions mean the game is more refreshing  challenging  and interesting to the strong player  They may be more willing to play and teach the weaker player 
Disadvantages edit 
With free placement  weaker players may not place their stones in respect to their comparable handicap to their opponent  thus eliminating the point of the handicap  The standard fixed handicap points allow for a good standard that allows novices to have the handicap they need since they are not experienced and may not be able to take advantage of the free placement of handicap stones  Therefore  free placement handicap may be best suited for more experienced players or those who want more flexibility and variety in play 

Compensation points edit 
Main article  Komidashi
When the difference in strength is one rank  no handicap stone is given  Instead the stronger player takes White but without compensation points  The compensation points are called Komi in Japanese  It is a custom that Black plays first  White moves second  Playing first is regarded as a significant advantage in modern go  and to make the game fair to both players  this advantage must be compensated  It is regarded that playing first is equal to half a move or more ahead throughout the game 
Another common type of compensation used is the reverse compensation points  where the weaker player takes black  and is given both the first move and compensation points too  This is more advantageous than the above situation 
Compensation points are sometimes preferred to stones because the players would like to play or practice as if it is an even game  They would like to have the feel of an  even game    White  the stronger player  must play better to overcome these disadvantages  points gained by playing first   compensation points  

Fixed compensation point  komi  system edit 
When ranks are equal  Black gets advantages by playing first  The advantage of that first move is compensated by compensation points  However  there are still no absolute standards on the number of compensation points due to the difficulty of determining a fair value      points are used in Japan and Korea      points are used in China and USA  see AGA rules   The     points is used to prevent a draw 

Auction compensation point system edit 
As no one can be absolutely sure what the fair number of compensation points is  some advocate another system which is often used in some amateur matches and tournaments  There are no fixed compensation points  The decision is left to both players  They arrive at a value through negotiation and bidding  This is called auction compensation point system 
Examples of auction komi systems include 

one player chooses how big komi will be given to White and the other player then chooses to play Black or White 
the game is without komi  one player makes the first move of Black  not too weak and not too strong  and the other one then chooses to play Black or White  This is an application of the pie rule 
the players do an  auction  by saying   I am willing to play Black against XXX komi  and the player who wins the auction plays Black 
Handicap strategy edit 
Handicap go is the traditional form of teaching given to go players  Fixed handicap placements are in effect a form of graded tutorials  if you cannot beat your teacher with a nine stone handicap  some fundamental points are still to be learned 
The pedagogic value of fixed handicaps is an old debate for Western players  The  theory  of handicap go shares with much of the rest of the Japanese pedagogic go literature a less explicit approach  based on perception as much as analysis  Whether fixed handicap placement makes it easier or more difficult for the weaker player to learn these fundamental points is moot  The nature of these  tutorial  steps may certainly be misunderstood and contested by Western players new to the game  Handicaps are also unpopular with Chinese players  who have more of a tradition of equality at the board rather than deference to a teacher 
There are some book treatments of low handicap go by strong professionals  Kobayashi Koichi and Kajiwara Takeo  in particular   and examples of pro pro games to follow  With the traditional handicap placements  the only consistent strategy Black can follow depends on the use of influence  This is particularly true in the early stages of the middle game fighting            
While Black often assumes that consolidating territory from the opening stages should be enough to win  that is not the case when the handicap stones are placed on the star points  where they are more effective in obtaining influence than territory  If Black does not understand and utilize the value of star point handicap stones for attack  White will gradually build a more advantageous position  and steadily close the gap

  See page at Sensei s Library for a fuller discussion

  Psychologically speaking  Black  the pupil  probably sees blunders as more important in a loss  but White  the teacher  is more aware of getting into the game by means of Black s inefficiencies 

  Historically  in China  Black and White were constrained to play on diagonally opposite star points for their first two moves in even games  In Japan  from some point in the sixteenth century perhaps  the board was empty in even games  The consequence was a deeper study of the joseki that in the Chinese system were used only in three stone handicaps  Those joseki dominated opening theory in Japan  until the shinfuseki period of the     s  In contemporary go  the     point openings are fundamental 

  Handicap placement convention and effect actually depends on different rule sets  such as Japanese or Chinese rules  and not on different countries  Not all countries have their own rule sets

  Some servers offer a choice between different rule sets

  Comparison of some Go rules

  See for example the book Kage s Secret Chronicles  In it more explicit reference is made  than is typical  to the need to fight hard rather than play slackly  in order to use the handicap stones properly  This lesson on influence is at the heart of the traditional system
