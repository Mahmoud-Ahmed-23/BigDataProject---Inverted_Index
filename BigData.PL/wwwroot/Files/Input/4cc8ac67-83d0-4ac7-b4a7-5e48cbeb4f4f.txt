Terrorism  in its broadest sense  is the use of violence against non combatants to achieve political or ideological aims             The term is used in this regard primarily to refer to intentional violence during peacetime or in the context of war against non combatants             There are various different definitions of terrorism  with no universal agreement about it                                   Different definitions of terrorism emphasize its randomness  its aim to instill fear  and its broader impact beyond its immediate victims            
Modern terrorism  evolving from earlier iterations  employs various tactics to pursue political goals  often leveraging fear as a strategic tool to influence decision makers  By targeting densely populated public areas such as transportation hubs  airports  shopping centers  tourist attractions  and nightlife venues  terrorists aim to instill widespread insecurity  prompting policy changes through psychological manipulation and undermining confidence in security measures            
The terms  terrorist  and  terrorism  originated during the French Revolution of the late   th century             but became widely used internationally and gained worldwide attention in the     s during the Troubles in Northern Ireland  the Basque conflict and the Israeli Palestinian conflict  The increased use of suicide attacks from the     s onwards was typified by the September    attacks in the United States in       The Global Terrorism Database  maintained by the University of Maryland  College Park  has recorded more than        incidents of non state terrorism  resulting in at least         deaths between      and                 
Various organizations and countries have used terrorism to achieve their objectives  These include left wing and right wing political organizations  nationalist groups  religious groups  revolutionaries  and ruling governments             In recent decades  hybrid terrorist organizations have emerged  incorporating both military and political arms             State terrorism  with its institutionalized instrumentation of terror tactics through massacres  genocides  forced disappearances  carpet bombings and torture   is a deadlier form of terrorism than non state terrorism

Seal of the Jacobin Club
The term  terrorism  itself was originally used to describe the actions of the Jacobin Club during the  Reign of Terror  in the French Revolution   Terror is nothing other than justice  prompt  severe  inflexible   said Jacobin leader Maximilien Robespierre              In       Edmund Burke denounced the Jacobins for letting  thousands of those hell hounds called Terrorists          loose on the people  of France              John Calvin s rule over Geneva in the   th century has also been described as a reign of terror                                     
The terms  terrorism  and  terrorist  gained renewed currency in the     s as a result of the Palestine Liberation Organization  PLO               the Irish Republican Army  IRA               the Basque separatist group  ETA              and the operations of groups such as the Red Army Faction              Leila Khaled was described as a terrorist in a      issue of Life magazine              A number of books on terrorism were published in the     s              The topic came further to the fore after the      Beirut barracks bombings             and again after the      September    attacks                                     and the      Bali bombings

Mass killings in the Vend e during the Reign of Terror in France      
No definition of terrorism has gained universal agreement                          Challenges emerge due to the politically and emotionally charged nature of the term  the double standards used in applying it              and disagreement over the nature of terrorist acts and limits of the right to self determination                          Harvard law professor Richard Baxter  a leading expert on the law of war  was a skeptic   We have cause to regret that a legal concept of  terrorism  was ever inflicted upon us  The term is imprecise  it is ambiguous  and above all  it serves no operative legal purpose                          
Different legal systems and government agencies employ diverse definitions of terrorism  with governments showing hesitation in establishing a universally accepted  legally binding definition  Title    of the United States Code defines terrorism as acts that are intended to intimidate or coerce civilians or government              The international community has been slow to formulate a universally agreed  legally binding definition of this crime  and has been unable to conclude a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism that incorporates a single  all encompassing  legally binding  criminal law definition of terrorism              These difficulties arise from the fact that the term  terrorism  is politically and emotionally charged                          The international community has instead adopted a series of sectoral conventions that define and criminalize various types of terrorist activities      citation needed     
Counterterrorism analyst Bruce Hoffman has noted that it is not only individual agencies within the same governmental apparatus that cannot agree on a single definition of terrorism  experts and other long established scholars in the field are equally incapable of reaching a consensus              In       terrorism studies scholar Alex P  Schmid proposed a simple definition to the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice  CCPCJ  as  peacetime equivalents of war crimes   but it was not accepted                          In       it was estimated that there were over     different definitions of terrorism             

History
Main article  History of terrorism
Pre modern terrorism
Early published studies like Paul Wilkinson considered terrorism a product of   th century revolutionary politics  Technological developments like the pistol and dynamite made possible the relentless onslaught of successful attacks and assassinations that shook the   th century                          For the most part  scholars considered terrorism a modern phenomenon until David C  Rapoport published his seminal article Fear and Trembling  Terrorism in Three Religious Traditions in                   
Rapoport proposed three case studies to demonstrate  ancient lineage  of religious terrorism  which he called  sacred terror   the  Thugs   the Assassins and the Jewish Sicarii Zealots  Rapoport argued religious terrorism has been ongoing since ancient times and that  there are signs that it is reviving in new and unusual forms   He is the first to propose that religious doctrines were more important than political rationales for some terrorist groups                          Rapoport s work has since become the basis of the model of  New Terrorism  proposed by Bruce Hoffman and developed by other scholars   New Terrorism  has had an unparalleled impact on policymaking  Critics have pointed out that the model is politically charged and over simplified  The underlying historical assertions have received less critical attention              According to The Oxford Handbook on the History of Terrorism             

Since the publication of Rapoport s article  it has become seemingly pre requisite for standard works on terrorism to cite the three case studies and to reproduce uncritically its findings  In lieu of empirical research  authors tend to crudely paraphrase Rapoport and the assumed relevance of  Thuggee  to the study of modern terrorism is taken for granted  Yet the significance of the article is not simply a matter of citations it has also provided the foundation for what has become known as the  New Terrorism  paradigm  While Rapoport did not suggest which late   th century groups might exemplify the implied recurrence of  holy terror   Bruce Hoffman  recognized today as one of the world s leading terrorism experts  did not hesitate to do so  A decade after Rapoport s article  Hoffman picked up the mantle and taking the three case studies as inspiration  he formulated a model of contemporary  holy terror  or  as he defined it   terrorism motivated by a religious imperative   Completely distinct from  secular terrorists   Hoffman argued that  religious terrorists  carry out indiscriminate acts of violence as a divine duty with no consideration for political efficacy their aim is transcendental and  holy terror  constitutes an end in itself  Hoffman s concept has since been taken up and developed by a number of other writers  including Walter Laquer  Steven Simon and Daniel Benjamen  and rebranded as the  New Terrorism  
Birth of modern terrorism           s 
Arguably  the first organization to use modern terrorist techniques was the Irish Republican Brotherhood              founded in      as a revolutionary Irish nationalist group             that carried out attacks in England              The group initiated the Fenian dynamite campaign in       one of the first modern terror campaigns              Instead of earlier forms of terrorism based on political assassination  this campaign used timed explosives with the express aim of sowing fear in the very heart of metropolitan Britain  in order to achieve political gains

Another early terrorist type group was Narodnaya Volya  founded in Russia in      as a revolutionary anarchist group inspired by Sergei Nechayev and  propaganda by the deed  theorist Carlo Pisacane                          The group developed ideas such as targeted killing of the  leaders of oppression   which were to become the hallmark of subsequent violence by small non state groups  and they were convinced that the developing technologies of the age such as the invention of dynamite  which they were the first anarchist group to make widespread use of             enabled them to strike directly and with discrimination              
In the Western world  and more specifically in France  the repression faced by anarchists from the state led  in the early     s  to France s entry into the  re des attentats              This period  characterized by a surge in terrorist acts following Ravachol s bombings  saw several shifts that pushed terrorism toward modern terrorism                          As with the Fenian campaign  terrorism shifted from being person based to location based  starting with the first attack of that period  the Saint Germain bombing              
However  other major evolutions emerged during this period  the apparition of lone wolves             and the birth of mass or indiscriminate terrorism              Indeed  in the second half of the  re des attentats  three incidents laid the foundation for mass terrorism within a few months of each other  These were the Liceu bombing  the    November      stabbing  and the Caf  Terminus attack              In each of these attacks  the perpetrators targeted not a specific individual but a collective enemy               mile Henry  in particular  responsible for the Caf  Terminus bombing  explicitly claimed the birth of this new form of terrorism  stating that he wanted to  strike at random              

Modern terrorism       present 
In      Leon Trotsky wrote Terrorism and Communism to justify the Red Terror and defend the moral superiority of revolutionary terrorism             
The assassination of the Empress of Austria Elisabeth in      resulted in the International Conference of Rome for the Social Defense Against Anarchists  the first international conference against terrorism             
According to Bruce Hoffman of the RAND Corporation  in         out of    terrorist groups were categorized as having religious motivation while in       almost half     out of     were religiously motivated with the majority having Islam as their guiding force

Depending on the country  the political system  and the time in history  the types of terrorism are varying

In early       the Law Enforcement Assistant Administration in the United States formed the National Advisory Committee on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals  One of the five volumes that the committee wrote was titled Disorders and Terrorism  produced by the Task Force on Disorders and Terrorism under the direction of H  H  A  Cooper  Director of the Task Force staff 
The Task Force defines terrorism as  a tactic or technique by means of which a violent act or the threat thereof is used for the prime purpose of creating overwhelming fear for coercive purposes   It classified disorders and terrorism into seven categories             

Civil disorder   A form of collective violence interfering with the peace  security  and normal functioning of the community 
Political terrorism   Violent criminal behaviour designed primarily to generate fear in the community  or substantial segment of it  for political purposes 
Non Political terrorism   Terrorism that is not aimed at political purposes  but which exhibits  conscious design to create and maintain a high degree of fear for coercive purposes  but the end is individual or collective gain rather than the achievement of a political objective  
Anonymous terrorism   In the two decades prior to           fewer than half  of all terrorist attacks were either  claimed by their perpetrators or convincingly attributed by governments to specific terrorist groups   A number of theories have been advanced as to why this has happened             
Quasi terrorism   The activities incidental to the commission of crimes of violence that are similar in form and method to genuine terrorism  but which nevertheless lack its essential ingredient  It is not the main purpose of the quasi terrorists to induce terror in the immediate victim as in the case of genuine terrorism  but the quasi terrorist uses the modalities and techniques of the genuine terrorist and produces similar consequences and reaction              For example  the fleeing felon who takes hostages is a quasi terrorist  whose methods are similar to those of the genuine terrorist but whose purposes are quite different 
Limited political terrorism   Genuine political terrorism is characterized by a revolutionary approach  limited political terrorism refers to  acts of terrorism which are committed for ideological or political motives but which are not part of a concerted campaign to capture control of the state  
Official or state terrorism    referring to nations whose rule is based upon fear and oppression that reach similar to terrorism or such proportions   It may be referred to as Structural Terrorism defined broadly as terrorist acts carried out by governments in pursuit of political objectives  often as part of their foreign policy 
Other sources have defined the typology of terrorism in different ways  for example  broadly classifying it into domestic terrorism and international terrorism  or using categories such as vigilante terrorism or insurgent terrorism              Some ways the typology of terrorism may be defined are

According to the Global Terrorism Index by the University of Maryland  College Park  religious extremism has overtaken national separatism and become the main driver of terrorist attacks around the world  Since      there has been a five fold increase in deaths from terrorist attacks  The majority of incidents over the past several years can be tied to groups with a religious agenda  Before       it was nationalist separatist terrorist organizations such as the IRA and Chechen rebels who were behind the most attacks  The number of incidents from nationalist separatist groups has remained relatively stable in the years since while religious extremism has grown  The prevalence of Islamist groups in Iraq  Afghanistan  Pakistan  Nigeria and Syria is the main driver behind these trends             

The Islamic State  IS  is a transnational Sunni Islamist insurgent and terrorist group  IS territory  in grey  at the time of its greatest territorial extent in May       Map legend             Islamic State            Iraqi government            Syrian government            Lebanese government            Iraqi Kurdistan forces            Syrian Kurdistan forces            Syrian opposition forces            Turkish Armed Forces            Al Nusra Front            HezbollahNote  Iraq and Syria contain large desert areas with sparse populations  These areas are mapped as under the control of forces holding roads and towns within them  
The emergence of Hezbollah in      marked a pivotal moment in terrorism s history              The Shiite Islamist group  rooted in Lebanon  drew inspiration from the Iranian Revolution and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini s teachings  responding to the      Lebanon War  Beyond pursuing revolutionary goals  Hezbollah members were deeply concerned about the social conditions of Shiite communities across the Middle East  Their activities in Lebanon during the     s garnered support among local Shiites  leading to the rise of smaller terrorist groups  notably the Islamic Jihad             
Hamas  the main Islamist movement in the Palestinian territories  was formed by Palestinian imam Ahmed Yassin in       Some scholars  including constitutional law professor Alexander Tsesis  have voiced concerns over the Hamas Charter s apparent advocacy of genocidal aspirations                                      In the periods of           and            Hamas orchestrated a series of suicide bombings  primarily directed at civilian targets in Israel  killing over       Israeli civilians             
Five of the terrorist groups that have been most active since      are Hamas  Boko Haram  al Qaeda  the Taliban and ISIL  These groups have been most active in Iraq  Afghanistan  Pakistan  Nigeria and Syria  Eighty percent of all deaths from terrorism occurred in these five countries              In      four Islamic extremist groups were responsible for     of all deaths from Islamic terrorism  ISIS  Boko Haram  the Taliban  and al Qaeda  according to the Global Terrorism Index                   Since approximately       these incidents have occurred on a global scale  affecting not only Muslim majority states in Africa and Asia  but also states with non Muslim majority such as United States  United Kingdom  France  Germany  Spain  Belgium  Sweden  Russia  Australia  Canada  Sri Lanka  Israel  China  India and Philippines  Such attacks have targeted both Muslims and non Muslims  however the majority affect Muslims themselves

Terrorism in Pakistan has become a great problem  From the summer of      until late       more than       people were killed in suicide and other attacks on civilians             for reasons attributed to a number of causes sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia Muslims  easy availability of guns and explosives  the existence of a  Kalashnikov culture   an influx of ideologically driven Muslims based in or near Pakistan  who originated from various nations around the world and the subsequent war against the pro Soviet Afghans in the     s which blew back into Pakistan  the presence of Islamist insurgent groups and forces such as the Taliban and Lashkar e Taiba  On July          in Lahore     Muslim scholars of the Sunni Ittehad Council  SIC  issued a collective fatwa against suicide bombings  the killing of innocent people  bomb attacks  and targeted killings declaring them as Haraam or forbidden             
In       the Southern Poverty Law Center released a report on domestic terrorism in the United States  The report  titled The Age of the Wolf  analyzed    incidents and found that  between      and        more people have been killed in America by non Islamic domestic terrorists than jihadists               The  virulent racist and antisemitic  ideology of the ultra right wing Christian Identity movement is usually accompanied by anti government sentiments              Adherents of Christian Identity are not connected with specific Christian denominations              and they believe that whites of European descent can be traced back to the  Lost Tribes of Israel   Adherents have committed hate crimes  bombings and other acts of terrorism  including the Centennial Olympic Park bombing                          Its influence ranges from the Ku Klux Klan and neo Nazi groups to the anti government militia and sovereign citizen movements             

Causes and motivations
Terrorist acts frequently have a political purpose based on self determination claims  ethnonationalist frustrations  single issue causes  like abortion or the environment   or other ideological or religious causes that terrorists claim are a moral justification for their violent acts             

Choice of terrorism as a tactic
Individuals and groups choose terrorism as a tactic because it can 

Act as a form of asymmetric warfare in order to directly force a government to agree to demands
Intimidate a group of people into capitulating to the demands in order to avoid future injury
Get attention and thus political support for a cause
Directly inspire more people to the cause  such as revolutionary acts    propaganda of the deed
Indirectly inspire more people to the cause by provoking a hostile response or over reaction from enemies to the cause            
Attacks on  collaborators  are used to intimidate people from cooperating with the state in order to undermine state control  This strategy was used in Ireland  in Kenya  in Algeria and in Cyprus during their independence struggles             
Stated motives for the September    attacks included inspiring more fighters to join the cause of repelling the United States from Muslim countries with a successful high profile attack  The attacks prompted some criticism from domestic and international observers regarding perceived injustices in U S  foreign policy that provoked the attacks  but the larger practical effect was that the United States government declared a War on Terror that resulted in substantial military engagements in several Muslim majority countries  Various commentators have inferred that al Qaeda expected a military response and welcomed it as a provocation that would result in more Muslims fight the United States  Some commentators believe that the resulting anger and suspicion directed toward innocent Muslims living in Western countries and the indignities inflicted upon them by security forces and the general public also contributes to radicalization of new recruits              Despite criticism that the Iraqi government had no involvement with the September    attacks  Bush declared the      invasion of Iraq to be part of the War on Terror  The resulting backlash and instability enabled the rise of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and the temporary creation of an Islamic caliphate holding territory in Iraq and Syria  until ISIL lost its territory through military defeats 
Attacks used to draw international attention to struggles that are otherwise unreported have included the Palestinian airplane hijackings in      and the      Dutch train hostage crisis 

Causes motivating terrorism
Specific political or social causes have included 

Independence or separatist movements
Irredentist movements
Adoption of a particular political philosophy  such as socialism  left wing terrorism   anarchism  or fascism  possibly through a coup or as an ideology of an independence or separatist movement 
Environmental protection  eco terrorism 
Supremacism of a particular group
Preventing a rival group from sharing or occupying a particular territory  such as by discouraging immigration or encouraging flight 
Subjugation of a particular population  such as lynching of African Americans 
Spread or dominance of a particular religion   religious terrorism
Ending perceived government oppression
Responding to a violent act  for example  tit for tat attacks in the Israeli Palestinian conflict  in The Troubles in Northern Ireland  or Timothy McVeigh s revenge for the Waco siege and Ruby Ridge incident 
Causes for right wing terrorism have included white nationalism  ethnonationalism  fascism  anti socialism  the anti abortion movement  and tax resistance 
Sometimes terrorists on the same side fight for different reasons  For example  in the Chechen Russian conflict secular Chechens using terrorist tactics fighting for national independence are allied with radical Islamist terrorists who have arrived from other countries             

Personal and social factors
Main article  Radicalization
Various personal and social factors may influence the personal choice of whether to join a terrorist group or attempt an act of terror  including 

Identity  including affiliation with a particular culture  ethnicity  or religion
Previous exposure to violence
Financial reward  for example  the Palestinian Authority Martyrs Fund 
Mental illness
Social isolation
Perception that the cause responds to a profound injustice or indignity
A report conducted by Paul Gill  John Horgan and Paige Deckert      dubious             discuss      found that for  lone wolf  terrorists             

    were motivated by religious beliefs
    had pre existing mental health disorders  while many more are found to have mental health problems upon arrest
At least     lived alone at the time of their event planning or execution  a further     lived with others  and no data were available for the remaining cases
    were unemployed at the time of their arrest or terrorist event
    subjectively experienced being disrespected by others
    percent experienced being the victim of verbal or physical assault
Ariel Merari  a psychologist who has studied the psychological profiles of suicide terrorists since      through media reports that contained biographical details  interviews with the suicides  families  and interviews with jailed would be suicide attackers  concluded that they were unlikely to be psychologically abnormal              In comparison to economic theories of criminal behaviour  Scott Atran found that suicide terrorists exhibit none of the socially dysfunctional attributes such as fatherless  friendless  jobless situations or suicidal symptoms  By which he means  they do not kill themselves simply out of hopelessness or a sense of  having nothing to lose              
Abrahm suggests that terrorist organizations do not select terrorism for its political effectiveness              Individual terrorists tend to be motivated more by a desire for social solidarity with other members of their organization than by political platforms or strategic objectives  which are often murky and undefined             
Michael Mousseau shows possible relationships between the type of economy within a country and ideology associated with terrorism      example needed                  Many terrorists have a history of domestic violence             

Democracy and domestic terrorism
Terrorism is most common in nations with intermediate political freedom  and it is least common in the most democratic nations                                                    
Some examples of terrorism in non democratic nations include ETA in Spain under Francisco Franco  although the group s activities increased sharply after Franco s death                the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists in pre war Poland               the Shining Path in Peru under Alberto Fujimori               the Kurdistan Workers Party when Turkey was ruled by military leaders and the ANC in South Africa              
According to Boaz Ganor   Modern terrorism sees the liberal democratic state  in all its variations  as the perfect launching pad and a target for its attacks  Moreover  some terrorist organizations particularly Islamist jihadist organizations have chosen to cynically exploit democratic values and institutions to gain power and status  promote their interests  and achieve internal and international legitimacy              Jihadist militants have shown an ambivalent view towards democracy  as they both exploit it for their ends and oppose it in their ideology  Various quotes from jihadist leaders note their disdain for democracy and their efforts to undermine it in favor of Islamic rule             Democracies  such as Japan  the United Kingdom  the United States  Israel  Indonesia  India  Spain  Germany  Italy and the Philippines  have all experienced domestic terrorism 
While a democratic nation espousing civil liberties may claim a sense of higher moral ground than other regimes  an act of terrorism within such a state may cause a dilemma  whether to maintain its civil liberties and thus risk being perceived as ineffective in dealing with the problem  or alternatively to restrict its civil liberties and thus risk delegitimizing its claim of supporting civil liberties               For this reason  homegrown terrorism has started to be seen as a greater threat  as stated by former CIA Director Michael Hayden               This dilemma  some social theorists would conclude  may very well play into the initial plans of the acting terrorist s   namely  to delegitimize the state and cause a systematic shift towards anarchy via the accumulation of negative sentiments towards the state system

The perpetrators of acts of terrorism can be individuals  groups  or states  According to some definitions  clandestine or semi clandestine state actors may carry out terrorist acts outside the framework of a state of war  The most common image of terrorism is that it is carried out by small and secretive cells  highly motivated to serve a particular cause and many of the most deadly operations in recent times  such as the September    attacks  the London underground bombing       Mumbai attacks and the      Bali bombings were planned and carried out by a close clique  composed of close friends  family members and other strong social networks  These groups benefited from the free flow of information and efficient telecommunications to succeed where others had failed              
Over the years  much research has been conducted to distill a terrorist profile to explain these individuals  actions through their psychology and socio economic circumstances               Some specialists highlight the lack of evidence supporting the idea that terrorists are typically psychologically disturbed  The careful planning and detailed execution seen in many terrorist acts are not characteristics generally associated with mentally unstable individuals               Others  like Roderick Hindery  have sought to discern profiles in the propaganda tactics used by terrorists  Some security organizations designate these groups as violent non state actors      citation needed      A      study by economist Alan B  Krueger found that terrorists were less likely to come from an impoverished background     percent versus    percent  and more likely to have at least a high school education     percent versus    percent   Another analysis found only    percent of terrorists came from impoverished families  versus    percent of male Palestinians  and over    percent had gone beyond high school  versus    percent of the populace                          
To avoid detection  a terrorist will look  dress  and behave normally until executing the assigned mission  Some claim that attempts to profile terrorists based on personality  physical  or sociological traits are not useful               The physical and behavioral description of the terrorist could describe almost any normal person               The majority of terrorist attacks are carried out by military age men  aged    to                 

Non state groups
There is speculation that the      anthrax attacks were the work of a lone wolf

Groups not part of the state apparatus of in opposition to the state are most commonly referred to as a  terrorist  in the media 
According to the Global Terrorism Database  the most active terrorist group in the period      to      was Shining Path  with       attacks   followed by Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front  FMLN   Irish Republican Army  IRA   Basque Fatherland and Freedom  ETA   Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  FARC   Taliban  Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam  New People s Army  National Liberation Army of Colombia  ELN   and Kurdistan Workers Party  PKK               
Israel has had problems with religious terrorism even before independence in       During British mandate over Palestine  the secular Irgun were among the Zionist groups labelled as terrorist organisations by the British authorities and United Nations               for violent terror attacks against Britons and Arabs                            Another extremist group  the Lehi  openly declared its members as  terrorists                             Historian William Cleveland stated many Jews justified any action  even terrorism  taken in the cause of the creation of a Jewish state               In       Yigal Amir assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin  For Amir  killing Rabin was an exemplary act that symbolized the fight against an illegitimate government that was prepared to cede Jewish Holy Land to the Palestinians               Members of Kach  a Jewish ultranationalist party  employed terrorist tactics in pursuit of what they viewed as religious imperatives  Israel and a few other countries have designated the party as a terrorist group              

Funding
Main article  Terrorist financing
State sponsors have constituted a major form of funding  for example  Palestine Liberation Organization  Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and other groups sometimes considered to be terrorist organizations  were funded by the Soviet Union                            Iran has provided funds  training  and weapons to organizations such as Lebanese Shi ite group Hezbollah  the Yemenite Houthi movement  and Palestinian factions such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad                                         Iranian funding for Hamas is estimated to reach several hundred million dollars annually                            These groups and others have played significant roles in Iran s foreign policy and served as proxies in conflicts               The Stern Gang received funding from Italian Fascist officers in Beirut to undermine the British authorities in Palestine              
 Revolutionary tax  is another major form of funding  and essentially a euphemism for  protection money                Revolutionary taxes  play a secondary role as one other means of intimidating the target population               
Other major sources of funding include kidnapping for ransoms  smuggling  including wildlife smuggling                fraud  and robbery               The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant has reportedly received funding  via private donations from the Gulf states                Irish Republican militants  primarily the Provisional Irish Republican Army and the Irish National Liberation Army  and Loyalist paramilitaries  primarily the Ulster Volunteer Force and Ulster Defence Association  received far more financing from criminal and legitimate activities within the British Isles than overseas donations  including Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi and NORAID  see Paramilitary finances in the Troubles for more information                                                      
The Financial Action Task Force is an inter governmental body whose mandate  since October       has included combating terrorist financing              

Tactics
Main article  Tactics of terrorism
The Wall Street bombing at noon on September           killed thirty eight people and injured several hundred  The perpetrators were never caught              
Terrorist attacks are often targeted to maximize fear and publicity  most frequently using explosives              
Terrorist groups usually methodically plan attacks in advance  and may train participants  plant undercover agents  and raise money from supporters or through organized crime  Communications occur through modern telecommunications  or through old fashioned methods such as couriers  There is concern about terrorist attacks employing weapons of mass destruction  Some academics have argued that while it is often assumed terrorism is intended to spread fear  this is not necessarily true  with fear instead being a by product of the terrorist s actions  while their intentions may be to avenge fallen comrades or destroy their perceived enemies              
Terrorism is a form of asymmetric warfare and is more common when direct conventional warfare will not be effective because opposing forces vary greatly in power               Yuval Harari argues that the peacefulness of modern states makes them paradoxically more vulnerable to terrorism than pre modern states  Harari argues that because modern states have committed themselves to reducing political violence to almost zero  terrorists can  by creating political violence  threaten the very foundations of the legitimacy of the modern state  This is in contrast to pre modern states  where violence was a routine and recognised aspect of politics at all levels  making political violence unremarkable  Terrorism thus shocks the population of a modern state far more than a pre modern one and consequently the state is forced to overreact in an excessive  costly and spectacular manner  which is often what the terrorists desire              
The type of people terrorists will target is dependent upon the ideology of the terrorists  A terrorist s ideology will create a class of  legitimate targets  who are deemed as its enemies and who are permitted to be targeted  This ideology will also allow the terrorists to place the blame on the victim  who is viewed as being responsible for the violence in the first place                           

Attack types
Stabbing attacks  a historical tactic  have reemerged as a prevalent form of terrorism in the   st century  notably during the     s and     s               This resurgence originated with the GIA in the     s and later expanded among Palestinian terrorists and Islamic State militants               The trend gained momentum with a wave of  lone wolf  terrorist stabbing attacks by Palestinians targeting Israelis beginning in                    Subsequently  this pattern extended to Europe during the surge of Islamic terrorism in the     s  witnessing  at least     stabbing attacks allegedly motivated by Islamic extremism by the spring of       with France experiencing a notable concentration of such incidents                           

Media spectacle
Terrorists may attempt to use the media to spread their message or manipulate their target audience  Shamil Basayev used this tactic during the Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis and again in the Moscow theater hostage crisis               Terrorists may also target national symbols for attention               Walter Lacquer wrote that  terrorism was always  to a large extent  about public relations and propaganda   Propaganda by Deed  had been the slogan in the nineteenth century                
The El Al Flight     hijacking is considered a turning point for modern terrorism studies  The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine  PFLP  realized they could combine the tactics of targeting national symbols and civilians  in this case as hostages  to generate a mass media spectacle  Zehdi Labib Terzi made a public statement about this in        The first several hijackings aroused the consciousness of the world and awakened the media and world opinion much more   and more effectively   than    years of pleading at the United Nations               

Mass media
Causes of death in the US vs media coverage  The percentage of media attention for terrorism  about         is much greater than the percentage of deaths caused by terrorism  less than

Mass media exposure may be a primary goal of those carrying out terrorism  to expose issues that would otherwise be ignored by the media  Some consider this to be manipulation and exploitation of the media              
The Internet has created a new way for groups to spread their messages               This has created a cycle of measures and counter measures by groups in support of and in opposition to terrorist movements  The United Nations has created its own online counterterrorism resource              
The mass media will  on occasion  censor organizations involved in terrorism  through self restraint or regulation  to discourage further terrorism  This may encourage organizations to perform more extreme acts of terrorism to be shown in the mass media  Conversely James F  Pastor explains the significant relationship between terrorism and the media  and the underlying benefit each receives from the other              

There is always a point at which the terrorist ceases to manipulate the media gestalt  A point at which the violence may well escalate  but beyond which the terrorist has become symptomatic of the media gestalt itself  Terrorism as we ordinarily understand it is innately media related         Novelist William Gibson                   
Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously spoke of the close connection between terrorism and the media  calling publicity  the oxygen of terrorism               

Terrorism and tourism
The connection between terrorism and tourism has been widely studied since the      Luxor massacre  during which    people  including    foreign nationals  were killed by Islamist group al Jama a al Islamiyya in an archaeological site in Egypt                            In the     s  the targets of terrorists were politicians and chiefs of police while now  international tourists and visitors are selected as the main targets of attacks      citation needed      The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September           were the symbolic center  which marked a new epoch in the use of civil transport against the main power of the planet               From this event onwards  the spaces of leisure that characterized the pride of West were conceived as dangerous and frightful                           

Counterterrorism strategies
Sign notifying shoppers of increased surveillance due to a perceived increased risk of terrorism
Responses to terrorism are broad in scope  They can include re alignments of the political spectrum and reassessments of fundamental values 
Specific types of responses include 

Targeted laws  criminal procedures  deportations  and enhanced police powers
Target hardening  such as locking doors or adding traffic barriers
Preemptive or reactive military action
Increased intelligence and surveillance activities
Preemptive humanitarian activities
More permissive interrogation and detention policies
Terrorism research
Terrorism research  also called terrorism studies  or terrorism and counter terrorism research  is an academic field which seeks to understand the causes of terrorism  how to prevent it  as well as its impact in the broadest sense  Terrorism research can be carried out in both military and civilian contexts  for example by research centres such as the British Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence  the Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies  and the International Centre for Counter Terrorism  ICCT   There are several academic journals devoted to the field  including Perspectives on Terrorism                           

International agreements
One of the agreements that promote the international legal counterterrorist framework is the Code of Conduct Towards Achieving a World Free of Terrorism that was adopted at the   rd session of the United Nations General Assembly in       The Code of Conduct was initiated by Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev  Its main goal is to implement a wide range of international commitments to counterterrorism and establish a broad global coalition towards achieving a world free of terrorism by       The Code was signed by more than    countries

America s thinking on how to defeat radical Islamists is split along two very different schools of thought  Republicans  typically follow what is known as the Bush Doctrine  advocate the military model of taking the fight to the enemy and seeking to democratize the Middle East  Democrats  by contrast  generally propose the law enforcement model of better cooperation with nations and more security at home               In the introduction of the U S  Army   Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual  Sarah Sewall states the need for  U S  forces to make securing the civilian  rather than destroying the enemy  their top priority  The civilian population is the center of gravity the deciding factor in the struggle     Civilian deaths create an extended family of enemies new insurgent recruits or informants and erode support of the host nation   Sewall sums up the book s key points on how to win this battle   Sometimes  the more you protect your force  the less secure you may be     Sometimes  the more force is used  the less effective it is     The more successful the counterinsurgency is  the less force can be used and the more risk must be accepted     Sometimes  doing nothing is the best reaction                This strategy  often termed  courageous restraint   has certainly led to some success on the Middle East battlefield  However  it does not address the fact that terrorists are mostly homegrown              

Ending terrorist groups
How terrorist groups end  n         The most common ending for a terrorist group is to convert to nonviolence via negotiations        with most of the rest terminated by routine policing        Groups that were ended by military force constituted only                 
Jones and Libicki        created a list of all the terrorist groups they could find that were active between      and       They found      Of those      splintered and     were still active in                    Of the ones that ended      converted to nonviolent political actions  like the Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland      were defeated by law enforcement         groups  were defeated by military force  and     succeeded 
   groups became large enough to be labeled an insurgency     of those had ended by       Of those      converted to nonviolent political actors  Only    were ended by law enforcement  and     were defeated by military force      won               Jones and Libicki concluded that military force may be necessary to deal with large insurgencies but are only occasionally decisive  because the military is too often seen as a bigger threat to civilians than the terrorists  To avoid that  the rules of engagement must be conscious of collateral damage and work to minimize it 
Another researcher  Audrey Cronin  lists six primary ways that terrorist groups end              

Capture or killing of a group s leader  Decapitation 
Entry of the group into a legitimate political process  Negotiation 
Achievement of group aims  Success 
Group implosion or loss of public support  Failure 
Defeat and elimination through brute force  Repression 
Transition from terrorism into other forms of violence  Reorientation 
State and state sponsored terrorism

Civilization is based on a clearly defined and widely accepted yet often unarticulated hierarchy  Violence done by those higher on the hierarchy to those lower is nearly always invisible  that is  unnoticed  When it is noticed  it is fully rationalized  Violence done by those lower on the hierarchy to those higher is unthinkable  and when it does occur it is regarded with shock  horror  and the fetishization of the victims         Derrick Jensen

As with  terrorism  the concept of  state terrorism  is controversial               The Chairman of the United Nations Counter Terrorism Committee has stated that the committee was conscious of    international conventions on the subject  and none of them referred to state terrorism  which was not an international legal concept  If states abused their power  they should be judged against international conventions dealing with war crimes  international human rights law  and international humanitarian law               Former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan has said that it is  time to set aside debates on so called  state terrorism   The use of force by states is already thoroughly regulated under international law                He made clear that   regardless of the differences between governments on the question of the definition of terrorism  what is clear and what we can all agree on is that any deliberate attack on innocent civilians  or non combatants   regardless of one s cause  is unacceptable and fits into the definition of terrorism

State terrorism has been used to refer to terrorist acts committed by governmental agents or forces  This involves the use of state resources employed by a state s foreign policies  such as using its military to directly perform acts of terrorism  Professor of Political Science Michael Stohl cites the examples that include the German bombing of London  the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor  the Allied firebombing of Dresden  and the U S  atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II  He argues that  the use of terror tactics is common in international relations and the state has been and remains a more likely employer of terrorism within the international system than insurgents   He cites the first strike option as an example of the  terror of coercive diplomacy  as a form of this  which holds the world hostage with the implied threat of using nuclear weapons in  crisis management  and he argues that the institutionalized form of terrorism has occurred as a result of changes that took place following World War II  In this analysis  state terrorism exhibited as a form of foreign policy was shaped by the presence and use of weapons of mass destruction  and the legitimizing of such violent behavior led to an increasingly accepted form of this behavior by the state                                        
Charles Stewart Parnell described William Ewart Gladstone s Irish Coercion Act as terrorism in his  no Rent manifesto  in       during the Irish Land War               The concept is used to describe political repressions by governments against their own civilian populations with the purpose of inciting fear  For example  taking and executing civilian hostages or extrajudicial elimination campaigns are commonly considered  terror  or terrorism  for example during the Red Terror or the Great Terror               Such actions are often described as democide or genocide  which have been argued to be equivalent to state terrorism               Empirical studies on this have found that democracies have little democide                            Western democracies  including the United States  have supported state terrorism              and mass killings                            with some examples being the Indonesian mass killings of         and Operation Condor                                        

State sponsored terrorism
Main article  State sponsored terrorism
Luis Posada and CORU are widely considered responsible for the      bombing of a Cuban airliner that killed    people              
A state can sponsor terrorism by funding or harboring a terrorist group  Opinions as to which acts of violence by states consist of state sponsored terrorism vary widely  When states provide funding for groups considered by some to be terrorist  they rarely acknowledge them as such                   citation needed     

Impact and debate
Terrorism is a charged term  It is often used with the connotation of something that is morally wrong  Governments and non state groups use the term to abuse or denounce opposing groups                                                                While legislation defining terrorism as a crime has been adopted in many states  the distinction between activism and terrorism remains a complex and debated matter                            There is no consensus as to whether terrorism should be regarded as a war crime                            State terrorism is that perpetrated by nation states  but is not considered such by the state conducting it  making legality a grey area               Countries sometimes opt to ignore terrorist activities committed by allies                           
The use of the term in the Israel Palestine conflict has given rise to controversies concerning the vagueness of how terrorists are defined and identified               
Media outlets who wish to convey impartiality may limit their usage of  terrorist  and  terrorism  because they are loosely defined  potentially controversial in nature  and subjective terms                           

Pejorative use
The term  terrorism  is often used to abuse or denounce opposite parties  either governments or non state groups                                                                An example of this is the terruqueo political attack used by right wing groups in Peru to target leftist groups or those opposed to the neoliberal status quo  likening opponents to guerrilla organizations              from the internal conflict in Peru                                        Aftermath of the King David Hotel bombing by the Zionist militant group Irgun  July     Those labeled  terrorists  by their opponents rarely identify themselves as such  but it was not always so  While a multitude of terms like separatist  freedom fighter  liberator  revolutionary  vigilante  militant  paramilitary  guerrilla  rebel  patriot  have come into use   including some culturally specific terms borrowed from other languages like Jihadi  mujahideen  and fedayeen   the unwillingness to self identify as terrorists began when parties in a conflict started to describe each other as terrorists pejoratively               As an example  when Vera Zasulich attacked a Russian official known for abusing prisoners she told the court  I am not a criminal  I am a terrorist    The stunned court acquitted Zazulich when they realized that she was trying to become a martyr  She was carried out of the courtroom on the shoulders of the crowd              
Some groups and individuals have openly admitted to using  terrorist tactics  even while maintaining distance from the pejorative term in their self descriptions  The Zionist militant group Lohamei Herut Yisrael admitted that they used terrorist tactics but used the euphemism  Freedom Fighters  to describe themselves  Lohamei Herut Yisrael means  Freedom Fighters for Israel                
In his book Inside Terrorism Bruce Hoffman offered an explanation of why the term terrorism becomes distorted 

On one point  at least  everyone agrees  terrorism is a pejorative term  It is a word with intrinsically negative connotations that is generally applied to one s enemies and opponents  or to those with whom one disagrees and would otherwise prefer to ignore   What is called terrorism   Brian Jenkins has written   thus seems to depend on one s point of view  Use of the term implies a moral judgment  and if one party can successfully attach the label terrorist to its opponent  then it has indirectly persuaded others to adopt its moral viewpoint   Hence the decision to call someone or label some organization terrorist becomes almost unavoidably subjective  depending largely on whether one sympathizes with or opposes the person group cause concerned  If one identifies with the victim of the violence  for example  then the act is terrorism  If  however  one identifies with the perpetrator  the violent act is regarded in a more sympathetic  if not positive  or  at the worst  an ambivalent  light  and it is not terrorism                           
The pejorative connotations of the word can be summed up in the aphorism   One man s terrorist is another man s freedom fighter                This is exemplified when a group using irregular military methods is an ally of a state against a mutual enemy  but later falls out with the state and starts to use those methods against its former ally 
Groups accused of terrorism understandably prefer terms reflecting legitimate military or ideological action                                         Leading terrorism researcher Professor Martin Rudner  director of the Canadian Centre of Intelligence and Security Studies at Ottawa s Carleton University  defines  terrorist acts  as unlawful attacks for political or other ideological goals  and said  

There is the famous statement   One man s terrorist is another man s freedom fighter   But that is grossly misleading  It assesses the validity of the cause when terrorism is an act  One can have a perfectly beautiful cause and yet if one commits terrorist acts  it is terrorism regardless              
Labelling opponents as  terrorists  has been used as a tactic to evade the usual laws of war against things such as assassinations and other extrajudicial killing  particularly by Israel and the United States                   better      source      needed          attribution needed      Some international legal opinions suggest that terrorist activities by their very nature  deny  the civilian nature of an ostensibly civilian participant                            

President Reagan meeting with Afghan Mujahideen leaders in the Oval Office in     
Some groups  when involved in a  liberation  struggle  have been called  terrorists  by the Western governments or media  Later  these same persons  as leaders of the liberated nations  are called  statesmen  by similar organizations  Two examples of this phenomenon are the Nobel Peace Prize laureates Menachem Begin and Nelson Mandela                                                      WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange has been called a  terrorist  by Sarah Palin and Joe Biden                            
Inversely  some groups like the Afghan Mujahideen that were labelled as  freedom fighters  later became  terrorists  as alliances shifted               During the Second World War  the Malayan People s Anti Japanese Army were allied with the British  but during the Malayan Emergency  members of its successor organisation  the Malayan National Liberation Army  started campaigns against them  and were branded  terrorists  as a result

   The ordinary current use of the word terrorism is much too wide  That is to say  if we list all the different phenomena which are at one time or another described as terrorism in ordinary conversation  or in ordinary newspapers  or by ordinary politicians  we will end up with a huge rag bag of not very similar items     The disadvantages of trying to construct an ordinary language definition based on current usage can be seen  too  in the plethora of conflicting definitions occurring in philosophical and political literature  Thus philosophers for instance disagree about whether or not terrorism is wrong by definition or wrong just as a matter of fact  they disagree about whether terrorism should be defined in terms of its aims  or its methods  or both  or neither  they disagree about whether or not states can perpetrate terrorism  they even disagree about the importance or otherwise of terror for a definition of terrorism   Jenny Teichman   How to Define Terrorism   Philosophy  October       Vol      No       pp

  Clark  David S          Encyclopedia of Law and Society  United Kingdom  Sage  p             Before the advent of dynamite and automatic weapons  groups had to kill on a one to one basis  It took one terrorist  or soldier  to kill one enemy or perhaps a handful of enemies  except in unusual cases  such as the failed      Gunpowder Plot of Guy Fawkes in England  The weapons of choice for the earlier terrorists were the dagger  the noose  the sword and the poison elixir  This changed with the hand thrown bomb and the pistol  introduced in the nineteenth century  and the machine gun and plastic explosives  common in the twentieth century 

  Rapoport  D          Fear and Trembling  in Mahan       S        Griset       P       L                    Terrorism in Perspective       United Kingdom       Sage Publications  Furthermore  the three cases illustrate a kind of terror nowhere adequately analyzed in our theoretical literature  terror designated here as holy or sacred  Before the nineteenth century  religion provided the only acceptable justifications for terror  and the differences between sacred and modern expressions  differences of nature  not scale  raise questions about the appropriateness of contemporary definitions  The holy terrorist believes that only a transcendental purpose which fulfills the meaning of the universe can justify terror  and that the deity reveals at some early moment in both time and end the means and may even participate in the process as well  We see terrorists as free to seek different political ends in this world by whatever means of terror they consider most appropriate  

  Laqueur        The misunderstandings about the nature of terrorism in the     s were founded  in part  on political reasons  At the time  terrorism was predominantly left wing in inspiration and it did not come as a surprise that commentators belonging to the same political persuasion would produce theoretical explanations which were  at the very least  not unsympathetic as far as terrorists were concerned  It was argued in these circles that terrorism always occurred where there was oppression  social or national  that the terrorists had genuine  legitimate grievances hence the conclusion that once the grievances were eradicated  terrorism would also disappear  Terrorism  in brief  was seen as a revolutionary phenomenon  it was carried out by poor and desperate human beings and had  therefore  to be confronted with sympathetic understanding
