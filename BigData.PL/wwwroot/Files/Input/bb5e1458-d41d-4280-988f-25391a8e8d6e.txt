A government is the system or group of people governing an organized community  generally a state 
In the case of its broad associative definition  government normally consists of legislature  executive  and judiciary  Government is a means by which organizational policies are enforced  as well as a mechanism for determining policy  In many countries  the government has a kind of constitution  a statement of its governing principles and philosophy 
While all types of organizations have governance  the term government is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately     independent national governments and subsidiary organizations 
The main types of modern political systems recognized are democracies  totalitarian regimes  and  sitting between these two  authoritarian regimes with a variety of hybrid regimes                        Modern classification systems also include monarchies as a standalone entity or as a hybrid system of the main three                        Historically prevalent forms of government include monarchy  aristocracy  timocracy  oligarchy  democracy  theocracy  and tyranny  These forms are not always mutually exclusive  and mixed governments are common  The main aspect of any philosophy of government is how political power is obtained  with the two main forms being electoral contest and hereditary succession 


Definitions and etymology
A government is the system to govern a state or community  The Cambridge Dictionary defines government as   the system used for controlling a country  city  or group of people   or  an organization that officially manages and controls a country or region  creating laws  collecting taxes  providing public services              While all types of organizations have governance  the word government is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately     independent national governments on Earth  as well as their subsidiary organizations  such as state and provincial governments as well as local governments            
The word government derives from the Greek verb           kubern o  meaning to steer with a gubernaculum  rudder   the metaphorical sense being attested in the literature of classical antiquity  including Plato s Ship of State             In British English   government  sometimes refers to what s also known as a  ministry  or an  administration   i e   the policies and government officials of a particular executive or governing coalition  Finally  government is also sometimes used in English as a synonym for rule or governance            
In other languages  cognates may have a narrower scope  such as the government of Portugal  which is more similar to the concept of  administration  

History
Main articles  Political history of the world and Political philosophy
Earliest governments
The moment and place that the phenomenon of human government developed is lost in time  however  history does record the formations of early governments  About       years ago  the first small city states appeared             By the third to second millenniums BC  some of these had developed into larger governed areas  Sumer  ancient Egypt  the Indus Valley civilization  and the Yellow River civilization             
One reason that explains the emergence of governments includes agriculture  Since the Neolithic Revolution  agriculture has been an efficient method to create food surplus  This enabled people to specialize in non agricultural activities  Some of them included being able to rule over others as an external authority  Others included social experimentation with diverse governance models  Both these activities formed the basis of governments              These governments gradually became more complex as agriculture supported larger and denser populations  creating new interactions and social pressures that the government needed to control  David Christian explains

As farming populations gathered in larger and denser communities  interactions between different groups increased and the social pressure rose until  in a striking parallel with star formation  new structures suddenly appeared  together with a new level of complexity  Like stars  cities and states reorganize and energize the smaller objects within their gravitational field            
Another explanation includes the need to properly manage infrastructure projects such as water infrastructure  Historically  this required centralized administration and complex social organisation  as seen in regions like Mesopotamia              However  there is archaeological evidence that shows similar successes with more egalitarian and decentralized complex societies             

Modern governments
Forms of government in      from The Harmsworth atlas and Gazetter
Starting at the end of the   th century  the prevalence of republican forms of government grew  The English Civil War and Glorious Revolution in England  the American Revolution  and the French Revolution contributed to the growth of representative forms of government  The Soviet Union was the first large country to have a Communist government             Since the fall of the Berlin Wall  liberal democracy has become an even more prevalent form of government             
In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries  there was a significant increase in the size and scale of government at the national level              This included the regulation of corporations and the development of the welfare state

Classification
In political science  it has long been a goal to create a typology or taxonomy of polities  as typologies of political systems are not obvious              It is especially important in the political science fields of comparative politics and international relations  Like all categories discerned within forms of government  the boundaries of government classifications are either fluid or ill defined 
Superficially  all governments have an official de jure or ideal form  The United States is a federal constitutional republic  while the former Soviet Union was a federal socialist republic  However  self identification is not objective  and as Kopstein and Lichbach argue  defining regimes can be tricky  especially de facto  when both its government and its economy deviate in practice              For example  Voltaire argued that  the Holy Roman Empire is neither Holy  nor Roman  nor an Empire               In practice  the Soviet Union was a centralized autocratic one party state under Joseph Stalin 
Identifying a form of government can be challenging because many political systems originate from socio economic movements  and the parties that carry those movements into power often name themselves after those ideologies  These parties may have competing political ideologies and strong ties to particular forms of government  As a result  the movements themselves can sometimes be mistakenly considered as forms of government  rather than the ideologies that influence the governing system             
Other complications include general non consensus or deliberate  distortion or bias  of reasonable technical definitions of political ideologies and associated forms of governing  due to the nature of politics in the modern era  For example  The meaning of  conservatism  in the United States has little in common with the way the word s definition is used elsewhere  As Ribuffo notes   what Americans now call conservatism much of the world calls liberalism or neoliberalism   a  conservative  in Finland would be labeled a  socialist  in the United States              Since the     s  conservatism in the United States has been chiefly associated with right wing politics and the Republican Party  However  during the era of segregation many Southern Democrats were conservatives  and they played a key role in the conservative coalition that controlled Congress from      to                       a     

Social political ambiguity
Opinions vary by individuals concerning the types and properties of governments that exist   Shades of gray  are commonplace in any government and its corresponding classification  Even the most liberal democracies limit rival political activity to one extent or another while the most tyrannical dictatorships must organize a broad base of support thereby creating difficulties for  pigeonholing  governments into narrow categories  Examples include the claims of the United States as being a plutocracy rather than a democracy since some American voters believe elections are being manipulated by wealthy Super PACs              Some consider that government is to be reconceptualised where in times of climatic change the needs and desires of the individual are reshaped to generate sufficiency for all             

Measurement of governing
The quality of a government can be measured by Government effectiveness index  which relates to political efficacy and state capacity

 Politics     portalvte
Plato in his book The Republic      BC  divided governments into five basic types  four being existing forms and one being Plato s ideal form  which exists  only in speech               

Aristocracy  rule by law and order  like ideal traditional  benevolent  kingdoms that are not tyrannical 
Democracy  rule by pure liberty and equality  like a free citizen 
Oligarchy  rule by wealth and market based ethics  like a laissez faire capitalist state 
Timocracy  rule by honor and duty  like a  benevolent  military  Sparta as an example 
Tyranny  rule by fear  like a despot 
These five regimes progressively degenerate starting with aristocracy at the top and tyranny at the bottom             
In his Politics  Aristotle elaborates on Plato s five regimes discussing them in relation to the government of one  of the few  and of the many              From this follows the classification of forms of government according to which people have the authority to rule  either one person  an autocracy  such as monarchy   a select group of people  an aristocracy   or the people as a whole  a democracy  such as a republic  
Thomas Hobbes stated on their classification 

The difference of Commonwealths consisteth in the difference of the sovereign  or the person representative of all and every one of the multitude  And because the sovereignty is either in one man  or in an assembly of more than one  and into that assembly either every man hath right to enter  or not everyone  but certain men distinguished from the rest  it is manifest there can be but three kinds of Commonwealth  For the representative must need to be one man or more  and if more  then it is the assembly of all  or but of a part  When the representative is one man  then is the Commonwealth a monarchy  when an assembly of all that will come together  then it is a democracy or popular Commonwealth  when an assembly of a part only  then it is called an aristocracy  In other kinds of Commonwealth there can be none  for either one  or more  or all  must have the sovereign power  which I have shown to be indivisible  entire             
Modern basic political systems
According to Yale professor Juan Jos  Linz  there a three main types of political systems today  democracies 
totalitarian regimes and  sitting between these two  authoritarian regimes with hybrid regimes                         Another modern classification system includes monarchies as a standalone entity or as a hybrid system of the main three             Scholars generally refer to a dictatorship as either a form of authoritarianism or totalitarianism                                    

Autocracy
Main article  Autocracy
An autocracy is a system of government in which supreme power is concentrated in the hands of one person  whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control  except perhaps for the implicit threat of a coup d  tat or mass insurrection               Absolute monarchy is a historically prevalent form of autocracy  wherein a monarch governs as a singular sovereign with no limitation on royal prerogative  Most absolute monarchies are hereditary  however some  notably the Holy See  are elected by an electoral college  such as the college of cardinals  or prince electors   Other forms of autocracy include tyranny  despotism  and dictatorship 

Aristocracy
Main article  Aristocracy
Aristocracy     b      is a form of government that places power in the hands of a small  elite ruling class              such as a hereditary nobility or privileged caste  This class exercises minority rule  often as a landed timocracy  wealthy plutocracy  or oligarchy 
Many monarchies were aristocracies  although in modern constitutional monarchies  the monarch may have little effective power  The term aristocracy could also refer to the non peasant  non servant  and non city classes in feudalism             

Democracy
Main articles  Democracy and Types of democracy
            National governments which self identify as democracies            National governments which do not self identify as democracies
Governments recognised as  electoral democracies  as of          update      by the Freedom in the World survey     c     
Democracy is a system of government where citizens exercise power by voting and deliberation  In a direct democracy  the citizenry as a whole directly forms a participatory governing body and vote directly on each issue  In indirect democracy  the citizenry governs indirectly through the selection of representatives or delegates from among themselves  typically by election or  less commonly  by sortition  These select citizens then meet to form a governing body  such as a legislature or jury 
Some governments combine both direct and indirect democratic governance  wherein the citizenry selects representatives to administer day to day governance  while also reserving the right to govern directly through popular initiatives  referendums  plebiscites   and the right of recall  In a constitutional democracy the powers of the majority are exercised within the framework of representative democracy  but the constitution limits majority rule  usually through the provision by all of certain universal rights  such as freedom of speech or freedom of association                         

Republics
Main article  Republic
A republic is a form of government in which the country is considered a  public matter   Latin  res publica   not the private concern or property of the rulers  and where offices of states are subsequently directly or indirectly elected or appointed rather than inherited  The people  or some significant portion of them  have supreme control over the government and where offices of state are elected or chosen by elected people                         
A common simplified definition of a republic is a government where the head of state is not a monarch                          Montesquieu included both democracies  where all the people have a share in rule  and aristocracies or oligarchies  where only some of the people rule  as republican forms of government             
Other terms used to describe different republics include democratic republic  parliamentary republic  semi presidential republic  presidential republic  federal republic  people s republic  and Islamic republic 

Federalism
Main article  Federalism
Federalism is a political concept in which a group of members are bound together by covenant with a governing representative head  The term  federalism  is also used to describe a system of government in which sovereignty is constitutionally divided between a central governing authority and constituent political units  variously called states  provinces or otherwise  Federalism is a system based upon democratic principles and institutions in which the power to govern is shared between national and provincial state governments  creating what is often called a federation              Proponents are often called federalists 

Branches
Separation of powers in the US government  demonstrating the trias politica model
Further information  Separation of powers and Fusion of powers
Governments are typically organised into distinct institutions constituting branches of government each with particular powers  functions  duties  and responsibilities  The distribution of powers between these institutions differs between governments  as do the functions and number of branches  An independent  parallel distribution of powers between branches of government is the separation of powers  A shared  intersecting  or overlapping distribution of powers is the fusion of powers 
Governments are often organised into three branches with separate powers  a legislature  an executive  and a judiciary  this is sometimes called the trias politica model  However  in parliamentary and semi presidential systems  branches of government often intersect  having shared membership and overlapping functions  Many governments have fewer or additional branches  such as an independent electoral commission or auditory branch

Further information  Political party and Party system
Presently  most governments are administered by members of an explicitly constituted political party which coordinates the activities of associated government officials and candidates for office  In a multiparty system of government  multiple political parties have the capacity to gain control of government offices  typically by competing in elections  although the effective number of parties may be limited 
A majority government is a government by one or more governing parties together holding an absolute majority of seats in the parliament  in contrast to a minority government in which they have only a plurality of seats and often depend on a confidence and supply arrangement with other parties  A coalition government is one in which multiple parties cooperate to form a government as part of a coalition agreement  In a single party government  a single party forms a government without the support of a coalition  as is typically the case with majority governments                          but even a minority government may consist of just one party unable to find a willing coalition partner at the moment             
A state that continuously maintains a single party government within a  nominally  multiparty system possesses a dominant party system  In a  nondemocratic  one party system a single ruling party has the  more or less  exclusive right to form the government  and the formation of other parties may be obstructed or illegal  In some cases  a government may have a non partisan system  as is the case with absolute monarchy or non partisan democracy
