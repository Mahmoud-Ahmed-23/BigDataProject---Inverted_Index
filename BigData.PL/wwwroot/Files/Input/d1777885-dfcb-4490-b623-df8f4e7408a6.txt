In philosophy and AI  especially  knowledge based systems   the qualification problem is concerned with the impossibility of listing all the preconditions required for a real world action to have its intended effect                        It might be posed as how to deal with the things that prevent me from achieving my intended result  It is strongly connected to  and opposite the ramification side of  the frame problem             John McCarthy gives the following motivating example  in which it is impossible to enumerate all the circumstances that may prevent a robot from performing its ordinary function 

 T he successful use of a boat to cross a river requires  if the boat is a rowboat  that the oars and rowlocks be present and unbroken  and that they fit each other  Many other qualifications can be added  making the rules for using a rowboat almost impossible to apply  and yet anyone will still be able to think of additional requirements not yet stated
