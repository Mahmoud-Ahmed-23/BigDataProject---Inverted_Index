History edit 
           Non profit beginnings edit 
Former headquarters at the Pioneer Building in San Francisco
In December       OpenAI was founded by Sam Altman  Elon Musk  Ilya Sutskever  Greg Brockman  Trevor Blackwell  Vicki Cheung  Andrej Karpathy  Durk Kingma  John Schulman  Pamela Vagata  and Wojciech Zaremba  with Sam Altman and Elon Musk as the co chairs  A total of    billion in capital was pledged by Sam Altman  Greg Brockman  Elon Musk  Reid Hoffman  Jessica Livingston  Peter Thiel  Amazon Web Services  AWS   Infosys  and YC Research                          The actual collected total amount of contributions was only      million until                   According to an investigation led by TechCrunch  while YC Research never contributed any funds  Open Philanthropy contributed     million and another     million in verifiable donations were traced back to Musk              OpenAI later stated that Musk s contributions totaled less than     million              The organization stated it would  freely collaborate  with other institutions and researchers by making its patents and research open to the public                          OpenAI was initially run from Brockman s living room              It was later headquartered at the Pioneer Building in the Mission District  San Francisco                         
According to OpenAI s charter  its founding mission is  to ensure that artificial general intelligence  AGI  by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work benefits all of humanity             
According to Wired  Brockman met with Yoshua Bengio  one of the  founding fathers  of deep learning  and drew up a list of the  best researchers in the field               Brockman was able to hire nine of them as the first employees in December                   In       OpenAI paid corporate level  rather than nonprofit level  salaries  but did not pay AI researchers salaries comparable to those of Facebook or Google             
Microsoft s Peter Lee stated that the cost of a top AI researcher exceeds the cost of a top NFL quarterback prospect              OpenAI s potential and mission drew these researchers to the firm  a Google employee said he was willing to leave Google for OpenAI  partly because of the very strong group of people and  to a very large extent  because of its mission               Brockman stated that  the best thing that I could imagine doing was moving humanity closer to building real AI in a safe way               OpenAI co founder Wojciech Zaremba stated that he turned down  borderline crazy  offers of two to three times his market value to join OpenAI instead             
In April       OpenAI released a public beta of  OpenAI Gym   its platform for reinforcement learning research              Nvidia gifted its first DGX   supercomputer to OpenAI in August      to help it train larger and more complex AI models with the capability of reducing processing time from six days to two hours                          In December       OpenAI released  Universe   a software platform for measuring and training an AI s general intelligence across the world s supply of games  websites  and other applications                                                 
In       OpenAI spent           million  or a quarter of its functional expenses  on cloud computing alone              In comparison  DeepMind s total expenses in      were           million  In the summer of       simply training OpenAI s Dota   bots required renting         CPUs and     GPUs from Google for multiple weeks 
In       Musk resigned from his Board of Directors seat  citing  a potential future conflict  of interest   with his role as CEO of Tesla due to Tesla s AI development for self driving cars              Sam Altman claims that Musk believed that OpenAI had fallen behind other players like Google and Musk proposed instead to take over OpenAI himself  which the board rejected  Musk subsequently left OpenAI 
In February       GPT   was announced  which gained attention for its ability to generate human like text             

      Transition from non profit edit 
In       OpenAI transitioned from non profit to  capped  for profit  with the profit being capped at     times any investment              According to OpenAI  the capped profit model allows OpenAI Global  LLC to legally attract investment from venture funds and  in addition  to grant employees stakes in the company              Many top researchers work for Google Brain  DeepMind  or Facebook  which offer stock options that a nonprofit would be unable to              Before the transition  public disclosure of the compensation of top employees at OpenAI was legally required             
The company then distributed equity to its employees and partnered with Microsoft              announcing an investment package of    billion into the company  Since then  OpenAI systems have run on an Azure based supercomputing platform from Microsoft                                     
OpenAI Global  LLC then announced its intention to commercially license its technologies              It planned to spend the    billion  within five years  and possibly much faster               Altman has stated that even a billion dollars may turn out to be insufficient  and that the lab may ultimately need  more capital than any non profit has ever raised  to achieve artificial general intelligence             
The transition from a nonprofit to a capped profit company was viewed with skepticism by Oren Etzioni of the nonprofit Allen Institute for AI  who agreed that wooing top researchers to a nonprofit is difficult  but stated  I disagree with the notion that a nonprofit can t compete  and pointed to successful low budget projects by OpenAI and others   If bigger and better funded was always better  then IBM would still be number one  
The nonprofit  OpenAI  Inc   is the sole controlling shareholder of OpenAI Global  LLC  which  despite being a for profit company  retains a formal fiduciary responsibility to OpenAI  Inc  s nonprofit charter  A majority of OpenAI  Inc  s board is barred from having financial stakes in OpenAI Global  LLC              In addition  minority members with a stake in OpenAI Global  LLC are barred from certain votes due to conflict of interest              Some researchers have argued that OpenAI Global  LLC s switch to for profit status is inconsistent with OpenAI s claims to be  democratizing  AI             

           ChatGPT  DALL E  partnership with Microsoft edit 
In       OpenAI announced GPT    a language model trained on large internet datasets  GPT   is aimed at natural language answering questions  but it can also translate between languages and coherently generate improvised text  It also announced that an associated API  named simply  the API   would form the heart of its first commercial product

Initial motivations edit 
Some scientists  such as Stephen Hawking and Stuart Russell  have articulated concerns that if advanced AI gains the ability to redesign itself at an ever increasing rate  an unstoppable  intelligence explosion  could lead to human extinction  Co founder Musk characterizes AI as humanity s  biggest existential threat               
Musk and Altman have stated they are partly motivated by concerns about AI safety and the existential risk from artificial general intelligence                            OpenAI states that  it s hard to fathom how much human level AI could benefit society   and that it is equally difficult to comprehend  how much it could damage society if built or used incorrectly               Research on safety cannot safely be postponed   because of AI s surprising history  it s hard to predict when human level AI might come within reach                OpenAI states that AI  should be an extension of individual human wills and  in the spirit of liberty  as broadly and evenly distributed as possible               Co chair Sam Altman expects the decades long project to surpass human intelligence              
Vishal Sikka  former CEO of Infosys  stated that an  openness   where the endeavor would  produce results generally in the greater interest of humanity   was a fundamental requirement for his support  and that OpenAI  aligns very nicely with our long held values  and their  endeavor to do purposeful work                Cade Metz of Wired suggested that corporations such as Amazon might be motivated by a desire to use open source software and data to level the playing field against corporations such as Google and Facebook  which own enormous supplies of proprietary data  Altman stated that Y Combinator companies would share their data with OpenAI              

Strategy edit 
In the early years before his      departure  Musk posed the question   What is the best thing we can do to ensure the future is good  We could sit on the sidelines or we can encourage regulatory oversight  or we could participate with the right structure with people who care deeply about developing AI in a way that is safe and is beneficial to humanity   He acknowledged that  there is always some risk that in actually trying to advance  friendly  AI we may create the thing we are concerned about   but nonetheless  that the best defense was  to empower as many people as possible to have AI  If everyone has AI powers  then there s not any one person or a small set of individuals who can have AI superpower               
Musk and Altman s counterintuitive strategy that of trying to reduce the potential harm of AI by giving everyone access to it is controversial among those concerned with existential risk from AI  Philosopher Nick Bostrom said   If you have a button that could do bad things to the world  you don t want to give it to everyone                During a      conversation about technological singularity  Altman said   We don t plan to release all of our source code  and mentioned a plan to  allow wide swaths of the world to elect representatives to a new governance board   Greg Brockman stated   Our goal right now          is to do the best thing there is to do  It s a little vague               
Conversely  OpenAI s initial decision to withhold GPT   around       due to a wish to  err on the side of caution  in the presence of potential misuse  was criticized by advocates of openness  Delip Rao  an expert in text generation  stated   I don t think      OpenAI      spent enough time proving      GPT        was actually dangerous   Other critics argued that open publication was necessary to replicate the research and to create countermeasures              
More recently  in       OpenAI published its approach to the alignment problem  anticipating that aligning AGI to human values would likely be harder than aligning current AI systems   Unaligned AGI could pose substantial risks to humanity    and solving the AGI alignment problem could be so difficult that it will require all of humanity to work together   They stated that they intended to explore how to better use human feedback to train AI systems  and how to safely use AI to incrementally automate alignment research              
In       following the temporary removal of Sam Altman and his return  many employees gradually left OpenAI  including most of the original leadership team and a significant number of AI safety researchers                            OpenAI also planned a restructuring to operate as a for profit company  This restructuring could grant Altman a stake in the company              

Stance on China edit 
In February       OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated that the company is interested in collaborating with the People s Republic of China  despite regulatory restrictions imposed by the U S  government               This shift comes in response to the growing influence of the Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek  which has disrupted the AI market with advanced models  including DeepSeek V  and DeepSeek R   known for their efficiency and cost effectiveness              
The emergence of DeepSeek has led major Chinese tech firms such as Baidu and others to embrace an open source strategy  intensifying competition with OpenAI  Altman acknowledged the uncertainty regarding U S  government approval for AI cooperation with China but emphasized the importance of fostering dialogue between technological leaders in both nations              

Products and applications edit 
Reinforcement learning edit

RoboSumo edit 
Released in       RoboSumo is a virtual world where humanoid metalearning robot agents initially lack knowledge of how to even walk  but are given the goals of learning to move and to push the opposing agent out of the ring               Through this adversarial learning process  the agents learn how to adapt to changing conditions  When an agent is then removed from this virtual environment and placed in a new virtual environment with high winds  the agent braces to remain upright  suggesting it had learned how to balance in a generalized way                            OpenAI s Igor Mordatch argued that competition between agents could create an intelligence  arms race  that could increase an agent s ability to function even outside the context of the competition              

OpenAI Five edit 
Main article  OpenAI Five
OpenAI Five is a team of five OpenAI curated bots used in the competitive five on five video game Dota    that learn to play against human players at a high skill level entirely through trial and error algorithms  Before becoming a team of five  the first public demonstration occurred at The International       the annual premiere championship tournament for the game  where Dendi  a professional Ukrainian player  lost against a bot in a live one on one matchup                            After the match  CTO Greg Brockman explained that the bot had learned by playing against itself for two weeks of real time  and that the learning software was a step in the direction of creating software that can handle complex tasks like a surgeon                            The system uses a form of reinforcement learning  as the bots learn over time by playing against themselves hundreds of times a day for months  and are rewarded for actions such as killing an enemy and taking map objectives                                        
By June       the ability of the bots expanded to play together as a full team of five  and they were able to defeat teams of amateur and semi professional players                                                      At The International       OpenAI Five played in two exhibition matches against professional players  but ended up losing both games                                         In April       OpenAI Five defeated OG  the reigning world champions of the game at the time      in a live exhibition match in San Francisco                            The bots  final public appearance came later that month  where they played in        total games in a four day open online competition  winning       of those games              
OpenAI Five s mechanisms in Dota   s bot player shows the challenges of AI systems in multiplayer online battle arena  MOBA  games and how OpenAI Five has demonstrated the use of deep reinforcement learning  DRL  agents to achieve superhuman competence in Dota   matches              

Dactyl edit 
Developed in       Dactyl uses machine learning to train a Shadow Hand  a human like robot hand  to manipulate physical objects               It learns entirely in simulation using the same RL algorithms and training code as OpenAI Five  OpenAI tackled the object orientation problem by using domain randomization  a simulation approach which exposes the learner to a variety of experiences rather than trying to fit to reality  The set up for Dactyl  aside from having motion tracking cameras  also has RGB cameras to allow the robot to manipulate an arbitrary object by seeing it  In       OpenAI showed that the system was able to manipulate a cube and an octagonal prism              
In       OpenAI demonstrated that Dactyl could solve a Rubik s Cube  The robot was able to solve the puzzle     of the time  Objects like the Rubik s Cube introduce complex physics that is harder to model  OpenAI did this by improving the robustness of Dactyl to perturbations by using Automatic Domain Randomization  ADR   a simulation approach of generating progressively more difficult environments  ADR differs from manual domain randomization by not needing a human to specify randomization ranges              

API edit

Generative Pre trained Transformer     GPT     is an unsupervised transformer language model and the successor to OpenAI s original GPT model   GPT      GPT   was announced in February       with only limited demonstrative versions initially released to the public  The full version of GPT   was not immediately released due to concern about potential misuse  including applications for writing fake news               Some experts expressed skepticism that GPT   posed a significant threat 
In response to GPT    the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence responded with a tool to detect  neural fake news                Other researchers  such as Jeremy Howard  warned of  the technology to totally fill Twitter  email  and the web up with reasonable sounding  context appropriate prose  which would drown out all other speech and be impossible to filter                In November       OpenAI released the complete version of the GPT   language model               Several websites host interactive demonstrations of different instances of GPT   and other transformer models                                        
GPT   s authors argue unsupervised language models to be general purpose learners  illustrated by GPT   achieving state of the art accuracy and perplexity on   of   zero shot tasks  i e  the model was not further trained on any task specific input output examples  
The corpus it was trained on  called WebText  contains slightly    gigabytes of text from URLs shared in Reddit submissions with at least   upvotes  It avoids certain issues encoding vocabulary with word tokens by using byte pair encoding  This permits representing any string of characters by encoding both individual characters and multiple character tokens

On November           Sam Altman was removed as CEO when its board of directors  composed of Helen Toner  Ilya Sutskever  Adam D Angelo and Tasha McCauley  cited a lack of confidence in him  Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati took over as interim CEO  Greg Brockman  the president of OpenAI  was also removed as chairman of the board                           and resigned from the company s presidency shortly thereafter               Three senior OpenAI researchers subsequently resigned  director of research and GPT   lead Jakub Pachocki  head of AI risk Aleksander M dry           pl       and researcher Szymon Sidor                           
On November           there were reportedly talks of Altman returning as CEO amid pressure placed upon the board by investors such as Microsoft and Thrive Capital  who objected to Altman s departure               Although Altman himself spoke in favor of returning to OpenAI  he has since stated that he considered starting a new company and bringing former OpenAI employees with him if talks to reinstate him didn t work out               The board members agreed  in principle  to resign if Altman returned               On November           negotiations with Altman to return failed and Murati was replaced by Emmett Shear as interim CEO               The board initially contacted Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei  a former OpenAI executive  about replacing Altman  and proposed a merger of the two companies  but both offers were declined              
On November           Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced Altman and Brockman would be joining Microsoft to lead a new advanced AI research team  but added that they were still committed to OpenAI despite recent events               Before the partnership with Microsoft was finalized  Altman gave the board another opportunity to negotiate with him               About     of OpenAI s     employees  including Murati and Sutskever  signed an open letter stating they would quit their jobs and join Microsoft if the board did not rehire Altman and then resign                            This prompted OpenAI investors to consider legal action against the board as well               In response  OpenAI management sent an internal memo to employees stating that negotiations with Altman and the board had resumed and would take some time              

On November           after continued negotiations  Altman and Brockman returned to the company in their prior roles along with a reconstructed board made up of new members Bret Taylor  as chairman  and Lawrence Summers  with D Angelo remaining               On November           emerging reports suggested that Sam Altman s dismissal from OpenAI may have been linked to his alleged mishandling of a significant breakthrough in the organization s secretive project codenamed Q   According to sources within OpenAI  Q  is aimed at developing AI capabilities in logical and mathematical reasoning  and reportedly involves performing math on the level of grade school students                                         Concerns about Altman s response to this development  specifically regarding the discovery s potential safety implications  were reportedly raised with the company s board shortly before Altman s firing               On November           OpenAI announced that an anonymous Microsoft employee had joined the board as a non voting member to observe the company s operations               Microsoft resigned from the board in July                   

Content moderation contract with Sama edit 
For broader coverage of this topic  see Content moderation and working conditions 
In January       OpenAI has been criticized for outsourcing the annotation of data sets to Sama  a company based in San Francisco that employed workers in Kenya  These annotations were used to train an AI model to detect toxicity  which could then be used to moderate toxic content  notably from ChatGPT s training data and outputs  However  these pieces of text usually contained detailed descriptions of various types of violence  including sexual violence  The investigation uncovered that OpenAI began sending snippets of data to Sama as early as November       The four Sama employees interviewed by Time described themselves as mentally scarred  OpenAI paid Sama        per hour of work  and Sama was redistributing the equivalent of between       and       per hour post tax to its annotators  Sama s spokesperson said that the        was also covering other implicit costs  among which were infrastructure expenses  quality assurance and management              

Lack of technological transparency edit 
In March       the company was also criticized for disclosing particularly few technical details about products like GPT    contradicting its initial commitment to openness and making it harder for independent researchers to replicate its work and develop safeguards  OpenAI cited competitiveness and safety concerns to justify this strategic turn  OpenAI s former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever argued in      that open sourcing increasingly capable models was increasingly risky  and that the safety reasons for not open sourcing the most potent AI models would become  obvious  in a few years              

Non disparagement agreement edit 
On May           a Vox article reported that OpenAI was asking departing employees to sign a lifelong non disparagement agreement forbidding them from criticizing OpenAI or acknowledging the existence of the agreement  Daniel Kokotajlo  a former employee  publicly stated that he forfeited his vested equity in OpenAI in order to leave without signing the agreement                            Sam Altman stated that he was unaware of the equity cancellation provision  and that OpenAI never enforced it to cancel any employee s vested equity               Vox published leaked documents and emails challenging this claim               On May           OpenAI sent a memo releasing former employees from the agreement              

Proposed shift from nonprofit control edit 
OpenAI  Inc  was originally designed as a nonprofit in order to ensure that AGI  benefits all of humanity  rather than  the private gain of any person   In       it created OpenAI Global  LLC  a capped profit subsidiary controlled by the nonprofit  In December       OpenAI proposed a restructuring plan to convert the capped profit into a Delaware based public benefit corporation  PBC   and to release it from the control of the nonprofit  The nonprofit would sell its control and other assets  getting equity in return  and would use it to fund and pursue separate charitable projects  including in science and education  OpenAI s leadership described the change as necessary to secure additional investments  and claimed that the nonprofit s founding mission to ensure AGI  benefits all of humanity  would be better fulfilled              
The plan has been criticized by experts and former employees  A legal letter named  Not For Private Gain  asked the attorneys general of California and Delaware to intervene  stating that the restructuring is illegal and would remove governance safeguards from the nonprofit and the attorneys general               The letter argues that OpenAI s complex structure was deliberately designed to remain accountable to its mission  without the conflicting pressure of maximizing profits  It contends that the nonprofit is best positioned to advance its mission of ensuring AGI benefits all of humanity by continuing to control OpenAI Global  LLC  whatever the amount of equity that it could get in exchange               PBCs can choose how they balance their mission with profit making  Controlling shareholders have a large influence on how closely a PBC sticks to its mission                           
Legally  under nonprofit law  assets dedicated to a charitable purpose must continue to serve that purpose  To change its purpose  OpenAI would have to prove that its current purposes have become unlawful  impossible  impracticable  or wasteful               Elon Musk  who had initiated a lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman in August      alleging the company violated contract provisions by prioritizing profit over its mission  reportedly leveraged this lawsuit to stop the restructuring plan               On February           a consortium of investors led by Elon Musk submitted a       billion unsolicited bid to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI  declaring willingness to match or exceed any better offer                            The offer was rejected on    February       with OpenAI stating that it was not for sale               but the offer complicated Altman s restructuring plan by suggesting a lower bar for how much the nonprofit should be valued              
In May       the nonprofit s board chairman Bret Taylor announced that the nonprofit would renounce plans to cede control after outside pressure  The capped profit will still transition to a PBC              

Copyright infringement in training data edit 
OpenAI was sued for copyright infringement by authors Sarah Silverman  Matthew Butterick  Paul Tremblay and Mona Awad in July                                              In September          authors  including George R  R  Martin  John Grisham  Jodi Picoult and Jonathan Franzen  joined the Authors Guild in filing a class action lawsuit against OpenAI  alleging that the company s technology was illegally using their copyrighted work                            The New York Times also sued the company in late December                                 In May      it was revealed that OpenAI had destroyed its Books  and Books  training datasets  which were used in the training of GPT    and which the Authors Guild believed to have contained over         copyrighted books              
In       OpenAI developed a speech recognition tool called Whisper  OpenAI used it to transcribe more than one million hours of YouTube videos into text for training GPT    The automated transcription of YouTube videos raised concerns within OpenAI employees regarding potential violations of YouTube s terms of service  which prohibit the use of videos for applications independent of the platform  as well as any type of automated access to its videos  Despite these concerns  the project proceeded with notable involvement from OpenAI s president  Greg Brockman  The resulting dataset proved instrumental in training GPT                
In February       The Intercept as well as Raw Story and Alternate Media Inc  filed lawsuit against OpenAI on copyright litigation ground                            The lawsuit is said to have charted a new legal strategy for digital only publishers to sue OpenAI              
On April           eight newspapers filed a lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against OpenAI and Microsoft  claiming illegal harvesting of their copyrighted articles  The suing publications included The Mercury News  The Denver Post  The Orange County Register  St  Paul Pioneer Press  Chicago Tribune  Orlando Sentinel  Sun Sentinel  and New York Daily News              

GDPR compliance edit 
In April       the EU s European Data Protection Board  EDPB  formed a dedicated task force on ChatGPT  to foster cooperation and to exchange information on possible enforcement actions conducted by data protection authorities  based on the  enforcement action undertaken by the Italian data protection authority against Open AI about the Chat GPT service               
In late April      NOYB filed a complaint with the Austrian Datenschutzbeh rde against OpenAI for violating the European General Data Protection Regulation  A text created with ChatGPT gave a false date of birth for a living person without giving the individual the option to see the personal data used in the process  A request to correct the mistake was denied  Additionally  neither the recipients of ChatGPT s work nor the sources used  could be made available  OpenAI claimed              

Use by military edit 
OpenAI was criticized for lifting its ban on using ChatGPT for  military and warfare   Up until January           its  usage policies  included a ban on  activity that has high risk of physical harm  including   specifically   weapons development  and  military and warfare   Its new policies prohibit   using  our service to harm yourself or others  and to  develop or use weapons                             As one of the industry collaborators  OpenAI provides LLM to the Artificial Intelligence Cyber Challenge  AIxCC  sponsored by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  DARPA  and Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health to protect software critical to Americans               In October       The Intercept revealed that OpenAI s tools are considered  essential  for AFRICOM s mission and included in an  Exception to Fair Opportunity  contractural agreement between the United States Department of Defense and Microsoft               In December       OpenAI said it would partner with defense tech company Anduril to build drone defense technologies for the United States and its allies              

Data scraping edit 
In June       a lawsuit claimed that OpenAI scraped     billion words online without consent and without registering as a data broker  It was filed in San Francisco  California  by sixteen anonymous plaintiffs               They also claimed that OpenAI and its partner as well as customer Microsoft continued to unlawfully collect and use personal data from millions of consumers worldwide to train artificial intelligence models              
On May           OpenAI entered into an agreement with News Corp to integrate news content from The Wall Street Journal  the New York Post  The Times  and The Sunday Times into its AI platform  Meanwhile  other publications like The New York Times chose to sue OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement over the use of their content to train AI models               In November       a coalition of Canadian news outlets  including the Toronto Star  Metroland Media  Postmedia  The Globe and Mail  The Canadian Press and CBC  sued OpenAI for using their news articles to train its software without permission              

Suicide of Suchir Balaji edit 
Further information  Suchir BalajiSuchir Balaji  a former researcher at OpenAI  was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on November           Independent investigations carried out by the San Francisco Police Department  SFPD  and the San Francisco Office of the Chief Medical Examiner  OCME  concluded that Balaji shot himself              
The death occurred    days after a New York Times interview in which he accused OpenAI of violating copyright law in developing its commercial LLMs  one of which  GPT    he had helped engineer  He was also a likely witness in a major copyright trial against the AI company  and was one of several of its current or former employees named in The New York Times     s court filings as potentially having documents relevant to the case  The death led to speculation and conspiracy theories suggesting he had been deliberately silenced                            Elon Musk  Tucker Carlson  California Congressman Ro Khanna  and San Francisco Supervisor Jackie Fielder have publicly echoed Balaji s parents  skepticism and calls for an investigation  as of January                                 
In February       the OCME autopsy and SFPD police reports were released  A joint letter from both agencies to the parents  legal team noted that he had purchased the firearm used two years prior to his death  and had recently searched for brain anatomy information on his computer  The letter also highlighted that his apartment s only entrance was dead bolted from inside with no signs of forced entry

  a b  OpenAI API   OpenAI  June           Archived from the original on June           Retrieved June           Why did OpenAI choose to release an API instead of open sourcing the models There are three main reasons we did this  First  commercializing the technology helps us pay for our ongoing AI research  safety  and policy efforts  Second  many of the models underlying the API are very large  taking a lot of expertise to develop and deploy and making them very expensive to run  This makes it hard for anyone except larger companies to benefit from the underlying technology  We re hopeful that the API will make powerful AI systems more accessible to smaller businesses and organizations  Third  the API model allows us to more easily respond to misuse of the technology  Since it is hard to predict the downstream use cases of our models  it feels inherently safer to release them via an API and broaden access over time  rather than release an open source model where access cannot be adjusted if it turns out to have harmful applications
