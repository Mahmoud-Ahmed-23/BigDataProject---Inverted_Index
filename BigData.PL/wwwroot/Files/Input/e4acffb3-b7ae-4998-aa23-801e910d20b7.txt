Vincent Willem van Gogh     note         Dutch        v ns nt    l   v      x             note           March                          July       was a Dutch Post Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art  In just over a decade  he created approximately       artworks  including around     oil paintings  most of them in the last two years of his life  His oeuvre includes landscapes  still lifes  portraits  and self portraits  most of which are characterised by bold colours and dramatic brushwork that contributed to the rise of expressionism in modern art  Van Gogh s work was only beginning to gain critical attention before he died from a self inflicted gunshot at age                During his lifetime  only one of Van Gogh s paintings  The Red Vineyard  was sold  
Born into an upper middle class family  Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious  quiet and thoughtful  but showed signs of mental instability  As a young man  he worked as an art dealer  often travelling  but became depressed after he was transferred to London  He turned to religion and spent time as a missionary in southern Belgium  Later he drifted into ill health and solitude  He was keenly aware of modernist trends in art and  while back with his parents  took up painting in       His younger brother  Theo  supported him financially  and the two of them maintained a long correspondence 
Van Gogh s early works consist of mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant labourers  In       he moved to Paris  where he met members of the artistic avant garde  including  mile Bernard and Paul Gauguin  who were seeking new paths beyond Impressionism  Frustrated in Paris and inspired by a growing spirit of artistic change and collaboration  in February      Van Gogh moved to Arles in southern France to establish an artistic retreat and commune  Once there  his paintings grew brighter and he turned his attention to the natural world  depicting local olive groves  wheat fields and sunflowers  Van Gogh invited Gauguin to join him in Arles and eagerly anticipated Gauguin s arrival in late      
Van Gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions  He worried about his mental stability  and often neglected his physical health  did not eat properly and drank heavily  His friendship with Gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor when  in a rage  he mutilated his left ear  Van Gogh spent time in psychiatric hospitals  including a period at Saint R my  After he discharged himself and moved to the Auberge Ravoux in Auvers sur Oise near Paris  he came under the care of the homeopathic doctor Paul Gachet  His depression persisted  and on    July      Van Gogh died from his injuries after shooting himself in the chest with a revolver 
Van Gogh s work began to attract critical artistic attention in the last year of his life  After his death  his art and life story captured public imagination as an emblem of misunderstood genius  due in large part to the efforts of his widowed sister in law Johanna van Gogh Bonger                        His bold use of colour  expressive line and thick application of paint inspired avant garde artistic groups like the Fauves and German Expressionists in the early   th century  Van Gogh s work gained widespread critical and commercial success in the following decades  and he has become a lasting icon of the romantic ideal of the tortured artist  Today  Van Gogh s works are among the world s most expensive paintings ever sold  His legacy is celebrated by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam  which holds the world s largest collection of his paintings and drawings 


Letters
See also  The Letters of Vincent van Gogh
The most comprehensive primary source on Van Gogh is his correspondence with his younger brother  Theo  Their lifelong friendship  and most of what is known of Vincent s thoughts and theories of art  are recorded in the hundreds of letters they exchanged from      until                  Theo van Gogh was an art dealer and provided his brother with financial and emotional support as well as access to influential people on the contemporary art scene            
Theo kept all of Vincent s letters to him              but Vincent kept only a few of the letters he received  After both had died  Theo s widow Jo Bonger van Gogh arranged for the publication of some of their letters  A few appeared in      and       the majority were published in                               Vincent s letters are eloquent and expressive  have been described as having a  diary like intimacy              and read in parts like autobiography             Translator Arnold Pomerans wrote that their publication adds a  fresh dimension to the understanding of Van Gogh s artistic achievement  an understanding granted to us by virtually no other painter              

Vincent van Gogh  left  in       when he worked at the Goupil  amp  Cie gallery in The Hague              his brother  Theo  pictured right  in        was a lifelong supporter and friend 
There are more than     letters from Vincent to Theo and around    from Theo to Vincent  There are    to his sister Wil     to the painter Anthon van Rappard     to  mile Bernard as well as individual letters to Paul Signac  Paul Gauguin  and the critic Albert Aurier  Some are illustrated with sketches             Many are undated  but art historians have been able to place most in chronological order  Problems in transcription and dating remain  mainly with those posted from Arles  While there  Vincent wrote around     letters in Dutch  French  and English              There is a gap in the record when he lived in Paris as the brothers lived together and had no need to correspond             
The highly paid contemporary artist Jules Breton was frequently mentioned in Vincent s letters  In      letters to Theo  Vincent mentions he saw Breton  discusses the Breton paintings he saw at a Salon  and discusses sending one of Breton s books but only on condition that it be returned                          In a March      letter to Rappard he discusses one of Breton s poems that had inspired one of his paintings              In      he describes Breton s famous work The Song of the Lark as being  fine               In March       roughly midway between these letters  Van Gogh set out on an    kilometre trip on foot to meet Breton in the village of Courri res  he was intimidated by Breton s success and the high wall around his estate  and returned without making his presence known 
                                     It appears Breton was unaware of Van Gogh or his attempted visit  There are no known letters between the two artists and Van Gogh is not one of the contemporary artists discussed by Breton in his      autobiography Life of an Artist

Early years

Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on    March      in Groot Zundert  in the predominantly Catholic province of North Brabant in the Netherlands              He was the oldest surviving child of Theodorus van Gogh              a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church  and his wife  Anna Cornelia Carbentus              Van Gogh was given the name of his grandfather and of a brother stillborn exactly a year before his birth      note        His grandfather  Vincent              was a prominent art dealer and a theology graduate from the University of Leiden in       This Vincent had six sons  three of whom became art dealers  and may have been named after his great uncle  a sculptor                         
Van Gogh s mother came from a prosperous family in The Hague              His father was the youngest son of a minister              The two met when Anna s younger sister  Cornelia  married Theodorus s older brother Vincent  Cent   Van Gogh s parents married in May      and moved to Zundert              His brother Theo was born on   May       There was another brother  Cor  and three sisters  Elisabeth  Anna  and Willemina  known as  Wil    In later life  Van Gogh remained in touch only with Willemina and Theo              Theodorus s salary as a minister was modest  but the Church also supplied the family with a house  a maid  two cooks  a gardener  a carriage and horse  his mother Anna instilled in the children a duty to uphold the family s high social position             
Van Gogh was a serious and thoughtful child              He was taught at home by his mother and a governess  and in       was sent to the village school  In       he was placed in a boarding school at Zevenbergen              where he felt abandoned  and he campaigned to come home  Instead  in       his parents sent him to the middle school in Tilburg  where he was also deeply unhappy              His interest in art began at a young age  He was encouraged to draw as a child by his mother              and his early drawings are expressive              but do not approach the intensity of his later work              Constant Cornelis Huijsmans  who had been a successful artist in Paris  taught the students at Tilburg  His philosophy was to reject technique in favour of capturing the impressions of things  particularly nature or common objects  Van Gogh s profound unhappiness seems to have overshadowed the lessons  which had little effect              In March       he abruptly returned home  He later wrote that his youth was  austere and cold  and sterile              
In July       Van Gogh s uncle Cent obtained a position for him at the art dealers Goupil  amp  Cie in The Hague              After completing his training in       he was transferred to Goupil s London branch on Southampton Street  and took lodgings at    Hackford Road  Stockwell              This was a happy time for Van Gogh  he was successful at work and  at     was earning more than his father  Theo s wife  Jo van Gogh Bonger  later remarked that this was the best year of Vincent s life  He became infatuated with his landlady s daughter  Eug nie Loyer  but she rejected him after he confessed his feelings  she was secretly engaged to a former lodger  He grew more isolated and religiously fervent  His father and uncle arranged a transfer to Paris in       where he became resentful of issues such as the degree to which the art dealers commodified art  and he was dismissed a year later             

Van Gogh s home in Cuesmes  while there he decided to become an artist
In April       he returned to England to take unpaid work as a supply teacher in a small boarding school in Ramsgate  When the proprietor moved to Isleworth in Middlesex  Van Gogh went with him                          The arrangement was not successful  he left to become a Methodist minister s assistant              His parents had meanwhile moved to Etten              in      he returned home at Christmas for six months and took work at a bookshop in Dordrecht  He was unhappy in the position  and spent his time doodling or translating passages from the Bible into English  French  and German              He immersed himself in Christianity and became increasingly pious and monastic              According to his flatmate of the time  Paulus van G rlitz  Van Gogh ate frugally  avoiding meat             
To support his religious conviction and his desire to become a pastor  in       the family sent him to live with his uncle Johannes Stricker  a respected theologian  in Amsterdam              Van Gogh prepared for the University of Amsterdam theology entrance examination              he failed the exam and left his uncle s house in July       He undertook  but also failed  a three month course at a Protestant missionary school in Laken  near Brussels             
In January       he took up a post as a missionary at Petit Wasmes             in the working class  coal mining district of Borinage in Belgium  To show support for his impoverished congregation  he gave up his comfortable lodgings at a bakery to a homeless person and moved to a small hut  where he slept on straw              His humble living conditions did not endear him to church authorities  who dismissed him for  undermining the dignity of the priesthood   He then walked the    kilometres          mi  to Brussels              returned briefly to Cuesmes in the Borinage  but he gave in to pressure from his parents to return home to Etten  He stayed there until around March           note        which caused concern and frustration for his parents  His father was especially frustrated and advised that his son be committed to the lunatic asylum in Geel                              note       
Van Gogh returned to Cuesmes in August       where he lodged with a miner until October              He became interested in the people and scenes around him  and he recorded them in drawings after Theo s suggestion that he take up art in earnest  He travelled to Brussels later in the year  to follow Theo s recommendation that he study with the Dutch artist Willem Roelofs  who persuaded him   in spite of his dislike of formal schools of art   to attend the Acad mie Royale des Beaux Arts  He registered at the Acad mie in November       where he studied anatomy and the standard rules of modelling and perspective

Kee Vos Stricker with her son Jan c               
Van Gogh returned to Etten in April      for an extended stay with his parents              He continued to draw  often using his neighbours as subjects  In August       his recently widowed cousin  Cornelia  Kee  Vos Stricker  daughter of his mother s older sister Willemina and Johannes Stricker  arrived for a visit  He was thrilled and took long walks with her  Kee was seven years older than he was and had an eight year old son  Van Gogh surprised everyone by declaring his love to her and proposing marriage              She refused with the words  No  nay  never    nooit  neen  nimmer                After Kee returned to Amsterdam  Van Gogh went to The Hague to try to sell paintings and to meet with his second cousin  Anton Mauve  Mauve was the successful artist Van Gogh longed to be              Mauve invited him to return in a few months and suggested he spend the intervening time working in charcoal and pastels  Van Gogh returned to Etten and followed this advice             
Late in November       Van Gogh wrote a letter to Johannes Stricker  one which he described to Theo as an attack              Within days he left for Amsterdam              Kee would not meet him  and her parents wrote that his  persistence is disgusting               In despair  he held his left hand in the flame of a lamp  with the words   Let me see her for as long as I can keep my hand in the flame                           He did not recall the event well  but later assumed that his uncle had blown out the flame  Kee s father made it clear that her refusal should be heeded and that the two would not marry  largely because of Van Gogh s inability to support himself             
Mauve took Van Gogh on as a student and introduced him to watercolour  which he worked on for the next month before returning home for Christmas              He quarrelled with his father  refusing to attend church  and left for The Hague      note                    In January       Mauve introduced him to painting in oil and lent him money to set up a studio                          Within a month Van Gogh and Mauve fell out  possibly over the viability of drawing from plaster casts              Van Gogh could only afford to hire people from the street as models  a practice of which Mauve seems to have disapproved              In June  Van Gogh suffered a bout of gonorrhoea and spent three weeks in the hospital              Soon after  he first painted in oils              bought with money borrowed from Theo  He liked the medium  and he spread the paint liberally  scraping from the canvas and working back with the brush  He wrote that he was surprised at how good the results were

By March       Mauve appeared to have gone cold towards Van Gogh  and stopped replying to his letters              He had learned of Van Gogh s new domestic arrangement with an alcoholic prostitute  Clasina Maria  Sien  Hoornik              and her young daughter              Van Gogh had met Sien towards the end of January       when she had a five year old daughter and was pregnant  She had previously borne two children who died  but Van Gogh was unaware of this              On   July  she gave birth to a baby boy  Willem              When Van Gogh s father discovered the details of their relationship  he put pressure on his son to abandon Sien and her two children  Vincent at first defied him              and considered moving the family out of the city  but in late       he left Sien and the children             
Poverty may have pushed Sien back into prostitution  the home became less happy and Van Gogh may have felt family life was irreconcilable with his artistic development  Sien gave her daughter to her mother and baby Willem to her brother              Willem remembered visiting Rotterdam when he was about     when an uncle tried to persuade Sien to marry to legitimise the child              He believed Van Gogh was his father  but the timing of his birth makes this unlikely              Sien drowned herself in the River Scheldt in                  
In September       Van Gogh moved to Drenthe in the northern Netherlands  In December  driven by loneliness  he went to live with his parents  then in Nuenen  North Brabant

In Nuenen  Van Gogh focused on painting and drawing  Working outside and very quickly  he completed sketches and paintings of weavers and their cottages  Van Gogh also completed The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen  which was stolen from the Singer Laren in March                               From August       Margot Begemann  a neighbour s daughter ten years his senior  joined him on his forays  she fell in love and he reciprocated  though less enthusiastically  They wanted to marry  but neither side of their families approved  Margot was distraught and took an overdose of strychnine  but survived after Van Gogh rushed her to a nearby hospital              On    March       his father died of a heart attack             
Van Gogh painted several groups of still lifes in                   During his two year stay in Nuenen  he completed numerous drawings and watercolours and nearly     oil paintings  His palette consisted mainly of sombre earth tones  particularly dark brown  and showed no sign of the vivid colours that distinguished his later work             
There was interest from a dealer in Paris early in                   Theo asked Vincent if he had paintings ready to exhibit              In May  Van Gogh responded with his first major work  The Potato Eaters  and a series of  peasant character studies  which were the culmination of several years of work              When he complained that Theo was not making enough effort to sell his paintings in Paris  his brother responded that they were too dark and not in keeping with the bright style of Impressionism              In August his work was publicly exhibited for the first time  in the shop windows of the dealer Leurs in The Hague  One of his young peasant sitters became pregnant in September       Van Gogh was accused of forcing himself upon her  and the village priest forbade parishioners to model for him

He moved to Antwerp that November and rented a room above a paint dealer s shop in the rue des Images  Lange Beeldekensstraat               He lived in poverty and ate poorly  preferring to spend the money Theo sent on painting materials and models  Bread  coffee and tobacco became his staple diet  In February       he wrote to Theo that he could only remember eating six hot meals since the previous May  His teeth became loose and painful              In Antwerp he applied himself to the study of colour theory and spent time in museums particularly studying the work of Peter Paul Rubens and broadened his palette to include carmine  cobalt blue and emerald green  Van Gogh bought Japanese ukiyo e woodcuts in the docklands  later incorporating elements of their style into the background of some of his paintings               He was drinking heavily again               and was hospitalised between February and March                    when he was possibly also treated for syphilis                   note

After his recovery  despite his antipathy towards academic teaching  he took the higher level admission exams at the Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp and  in January       matriculated in painting and drawing  He became ill and run down by overwork  poor diet and excessive smoking               He started to attend drawing classes after plaster models at the Antwerp Academy on    January       He quickly got into trouble with Charles Verlat  the director of the academy and teacher of a painting class  because of his unconventional painting style  Van Gogh had also clashed with the instructor of the drawing class Franz Vinck  Van Gogh finally started to attend the drawing classes after antique plaster models given by Eug ne Siberdt  Soon Siberdt and Van Gogh came into conflict when the latter did not comply with Siberdt s requirement that drawings express the contour and concentrate on the line  When Van Gogh was required to draw the Venus de Milo during a drawing class  he produced the limbless  naked torso of a Flemish peasant woman  Siberdt regarded this as defiance against his artistic guidance and made corrections to Van Gogh s drawing with his crayon so vigorously that he tore the paper  Van Gogh then flew into a violent rage and shouted at Siberdt   You clearly do not know what a young woman is like  God damn it  A woman must have hips  buttocks  a pelvis in which she can carry a baby   According to some accounts  this was the last time Van Gogh attended classes at the academy and he left later for Paris               On    March       which was about a month after the confrontation with Siberdt  the teachers of the academy decided that    students  including Van Gogh  had to repeat a year  The story that Van Gogh was expelled from the academy by Siberdt is therefore unfounded

Van Gogh moved to Paris in March      where he shared Theo s rue Laval apartment in Montmartre and studied at Fernand Cormon s studio  In June the brothers took a larger flat at    rue Lepic               In Paris  Vincent painted portraits of friends and acquaintances  still life paintings  views of Le Moulin de la Galette  scenes in Montmartre  Asni res and along the Seine  In      in Antwerp he had become interested in Japanese ukiyo e woodblock prints and had used them to decorate the walls of his studio  while in Paris he collected hundreds of them  He tried his hand at Japonaiserie  tracing a figure from a reproduction on the cover of the magazine Paris Illustre  The Courtesan or Oiran         after Keisai Eisen  which he then graphically enlarged in a painting              
After seeing the portrait of Adolphe Monticelli at the Galerie Delareybarette  Van Gogh adopted a brighter palette and a bolder attack  particularly in paintings such as his Seascape at Saintes Maries                                   Two years later  Vincent and Theo paid for the publication of a book on Monticelli paintings  and Vincent bought some of Monticelli s works to add to his collection              
Van Gogh learned about Fernand Cormon s atelier from Theo               He worked at the studio in April and May                    where he frequented the circle of the Australian artist John Russell  who painted his portrait in                    Van Gogh also met fellow students  mile Bernard  Louis Anquetin and Henri de Toulouse Lautrec        who painted a portrait of him in pastel  They met at Julien  P re  Tanguy s paint shop                which was  at that time  the only place where Paul C zanne s paintings were displayed   In       two large exhibitions were staged there  showing Pointillism and Neo impressionism for the first time and bringing attention to Georges Seurat and Paul Signac  Theo kept a stock of Impressionist paintings in his gallery on boulevard Montmartre  but Van Gogh was slow to acknowledge the new developments in art              
Conflicts arose between the brothers  At the end of      Theo found living with Vincent to be  almost unbearable                By early       they were again at peace  and Vincent had moved to Asni res  a northwestern suburb of Paris  where he got to know Signac  He adopted elements of Pointillism  a technique in which a multitude of small coloured dots are applied to the canvas so that when seen from a distance they create an optical blend of hues  The style stresses the ability of complementary colours   including blue and orange   to form vibrant contrasts

While in Asni res Van Gogh painted parks  restaurants and the Seine  including Bridges across the Seine at Asni res  In November       Theo and Vincent befriended Paul Gauguin who had just arrived in Paris               Towards the end of the year  Vincent arranged an exhibition alongside Bernard  Anquetin  and probably Toulouse Lautrec  at the Grand Bouillon Restaurant du Chalet     avenue de Clichy  Montmartre  In a contemporary account  Bernard wrote that the exhibition was ahead of anything else in Paris               There  Bernard and Anquetin sold their first paintings  and Van Gogh exchanged work with Gauguin  Discussions on art  artists  and their social situations started during this exhibition  continued and expanded to include visitors to the show  like Camille Pissarro and his son Lucien  Signac and Seurat  In February       feeling worn out from life in Paris  Van Gogh left  having painted more than     paintings during his two years there  Hours before his departure  accompanied by Theo  he paid his only visit to Seurat in his studio

Ill from drink and suffering from smoker s cough  in February       Van Gogh sought refuge in Arles              He seems to have moved with thoughts of founding an art colony  The Danish artist Christian Mourier Petersen was his companion for two months and at first  Arles appeared exotic to Van Gogh  In a letter  he described it as a foreign country   The Zouaves  the brothels  the adorable little Arl sienne going to her First Communion  the priest in his surplice  who looks like a dangerous rhinoceros  the people drinking absinthe  all seem to me creatures from another world               
The time in Arles was one of Van Gogh s more prolific periods  he completed     paintings and more than     drawings and watercolours               He was energised by the local countryside and light  his works from this period are rich in yellow  ultramarine and mauve  They include harvests  wheat fields and general rural landmarks from the area  including The Old Mill         one of seven canvases sent to Pont Aven on   October      in an exchange of works with Paul Gauguin   mile Bernard  Charles Laval and others               
In March       Van Gogh created landscapes using a gridded  perspective frame  and three of those works were shown at the annual exhibition of the Soci t  des Artistes Ind pendants  In April  he was visited by the American artist Dodge MacKnight  who was living nearby at Fontvieille                            
On   May       Van Gogh signed a lease for four rooms at   Place Lamartine  Arles  which he later painted in The Yellow House                The rooms cost    francs per month  unfurnished  they had been uninhabited for months               Because the Yellow House had to be furnished before he could fully move in  Van Gogh moved from the H tel Carrel to the Caf  de la Gare on   May                    He had befriended the Yellow House s proprietors  Joseph and Marie Ginoux  and was able to use it as a studio               Van Gogh wanted a gallery to display his work and started a series of paintings that eventually included Van Gogh s Chair         Bedroom in Arles         The Night Caf          Caf  Terrace at Night  September        Starry Night Over the Rhone         and Still Life  Vase with Twelve Sunflowers         all intended for the decoration for the Yellow House              
Van Gogh wrote that with The Night Caf  he tried  to express the idea that the caf  is a place where one can ruin oneself  go mad  or commit a crime                When he visited Saintes Maries de la Mer in June  he gave lessons to a Zouave second lieutenant   Paul Eug ne Milliet                and painted boats on the sea and the village               MacKnight introduced Van Gogh to Eug ne Boch  a Belgian painter who sometimes stayed in Fontvieille  and the two exchanged visits in July

Paul Gauguin  The Painter of Sunflowers  Portrait of Vincent van Gogh        Van Gogh Museum  Amsterdam
When Gauguin agreed to visit Arles in       Van Gogh hoped for friendship and to realise his idea of an artists  collective  Van Gogh prepared for Gauguin s arrival by painting four versions of Sunflowers in one week                In the hope of living in a studio of our own with Gauguin   he wrote in a letter to Theo   I d like to do a decoration for the studio  Nothing but large Sunflowers                
When Boch visited again  Van Gogh painted a portrait of him  as well as the study The Poet Against a Starry Sky                   note       
In preparation for Gauguin s visit  Van Gogh bought two beds on advice from the station s postal supervisor Joseph Roulin  whose portrait he painted  On    September  he spent his first night in the still sparsely furnished Yellow House               When Gauguin consented to work and live in Arles with him  Van Gogh started to work on the D coration for the Yellow House  probably the most ambitious effort he ever undertook               He completed two chair paintings  Van Gogh s Chair and Gauguin s Chair              
After much pleading from Van Gogh  Gauguin arrived in Arles on    October and  in November  the two painted together  Gauguin depicted Van Gogh in his The Painter of Sunflowers  Van Gogh painted pictures from memory  following Gauguin s suggestion  Among these  imaginative  paintings is Memory of the Garden at Etten                   note        Their first joint outdoor venture was at the Alyscamps  when they produced the pendants Les Alyscamps               The single painting Gauguin completed during his visit was his portrait of Van Gogh              
Van Gogh and Gauguin visited Montpellier in December       where they saw works by Courbet and Delacroix in the Mus e Fabre               Their relationship began to deteriorate  Van Gogh admired Gauguin and wanted to be treated as his equal  but Gauguin was arrogant and domineering  which frustrated Van Gogh  They often quarrelled  Van Gogh increasingly feared that Gauguin was going to desert him  and the situation  which Van Gogh described as one of  excessive tension   rapidly headed towards crisis point

Local newspaper report dated    December      recording Van Gogh s self mutilation             
Portrait of Doctor Rey  January       Pushkin Museum  note written by Dr Rey for novelist Irving Stone with sketches of the damage to Van Gogh s ear
The exact sequence that led to the mutilation of Van Gogh s ear is not known  Gauguin said  fifteen years later  that the night followed several instances of physically threatening behaviour               Their relationship was complex and Theo may have owed money to Gauguin  who suspected the brothers were exploiting him financially               It seems likely that Vincent realised that Gauguin was planning to leave               The following days saw heavy rain  leading to the two men being shut in the Yellow House               Gauguin recalled that Van Gogh followed him after he left for a walk and  rushed towards me  an open razor in his hand                This account is uncorroborated               Gauguin was almost certainly absent from the Yellow House that night  most likely staying in a hotel              
After an altercation on the evening of    December                    Van Gogh returned to his room where he seemingly heard voices and either wholly or in part severed his left ear with a razor     note         causing severe bleeding               He bandaged the wound  wrapped the ear in paper and delivered the package to a woman at a brothel Van Gogh and Gauguin both frequented               Van Gogh was found unconscious the next morning by a policeman and taken to the hospital                            where he was treated by F lix Rey  a young doctor still in training  The ear was brought to the hospital  but Rey did not attempt to reattach it as too much time had passed               Van Gogh researcher and art historian Bernadette Murphy discovered the true identity of the woman named Gabrielle Berlatier               who died in Arles at the age of    in       Her descendants still lived  as of       just outside Arles  Gabrielle  known in her youth as  Gaby   was a    year old cleaning girl at the brothel and other local establishments at the time Van Gogh presented her with his ear                                        
Van Gogh had no recollection of the event  suggesting that he may have suffered an acute mental breakdown               The hospital diagnosis was  acute mania with generalised delirium                and within a few days  the local police ordered that he be placed in hospital care                            Gauguin immediately notified Theo  who  on    December  had proposed marriage to his old friend Andries Bonger s sister Johanna               That evening  Theo rushed to the station to board a night train to Arles  He arrived on Christmas Day and comforted Vincent  who seemed to be semi lucid  That evening  he left Arles for the return trip to Paris              
During the first days of his treatment  Van Gogh repeatedly and unsuccessfully asked for Gauguin  who asked a policeman attending the case to  be kind enough  Monsieur  to awaken this man with great care  and if he asks for me tell him I have left for Paris  the sight of me might prove fatal for him                Gauguin fled Arles  never to see Van Gogh again  They continued to correspond  and in       Gauguin proposed they form a studio in Antwerp  Meanwhile  other visitors to the hospital included Marie Ginoux and Roulin              
Despite a pessimistic diagnosis  Van Gogh recovered and returned to the Yellow House on   January                    He spent the following month between hospital and home  suffering from hallucinations and delusions of poisoning               In March  the police closed his house after a petition by    townspeople  including the Ginoux family  who described him as le fou roux  the redheaded madman                Van Gogh returned to the hospital  Paul Signac visited him twice in March               in April  Van Gogh moved into rooms owned by Rey after floods damaged paintings in his own home               Two months later  he left Arles and voluntarily entered an asylum in Saint R my de Provence  Around this time  he wrote   Sometimes moods of indescribable anguish  sometimes moments when the veil of time and fatality of circumstances seemed to be torn apart for an instant               
Van Gogh gave his      Portrait of Doctor Rey to Rey  The doctor was not fond of the painting and used it to repair a chicken coop  then gave it away               In       the portrait was housed at the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts and estimated to be worth over          million

Saint R my  May             May      
Main article  Saint Paul Asylum  Saint R my  Van Gogh series 
The Starry Night  June       Museum of Modern Art  New York
Van Gogh entered the Saint Paul de Mausole asylum on   May       accompanied by his caregiver  Fr d ric Salles  a Protestant clergyman  Saint Paul was a former monastery in Saint R my  located less than    kilometres          mi  from Arles  and it was run by a former naval doctor  Th ophile Peyron  Van Gogh had two cells with barred windows  one of which he used as a studio               The clinic and its garden became the main subjects of his paintings  He made several studies of the hospital s interiors  such as Vestibule of the Asylum and Saint R my  September        and its gardens  such as Lilacs  May        Some of his works from this time are characterised by swirls  such as The Starry Night  He was allowed short supervised walks  during which time he painted cypresses and olive trees  including Valley with Ploughman Seen from Above  Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background       Cypresses       Cornfield with Cypresses         Country road in Provence by Night         In September       he produced two further versions of Bedroom in Arles and The Gardener              
Limited access to life outside the clinic resulted in a shortage of subject matter  Van Gogh instead worked on interpretations of other artist s paintings  such as Millet s The Sower and Noonday Rest  and variations on his own earlier work  Van Gogh was an admirer of the Realism of Jules Breton  Gustave Courbet and Millet               and he compared his copies to a musician s interpreting Beethoven              
His Prisoners  Round  after Gustave Dor          was painted after an engraving by Gustave Dor               Tralbaut suggests that the face of the prisoner in the centre of the painting looking towards the viewer is Van Gogh himself               Jan Hulsker discounts this              
Between February and April       Van Gogh suffered a severe relapse  Depressed and unable to bring himself to write  he was still able to paint and draw a little during this time               and he later wrote to Theo that he had made a few small canvases  from memory          reminisces of the North                Among these was Two Peasant Women Digging in a Snow Covered Field at Sunset  Hulsker believes that this small group of paintings formed the nucleus of many drawings and study sheets depicting landscapes and figures that Van Gogh worked on during this time  He comments that this short period was the only time that Van Gogh s illness had a significant effect on his work               Van Gogh asked his mother and his brother to send him drawings and rough work he had done in the early     s so he could work on new paintings from his old sketches               Belonging to this period is Sorrowing Old Man   At Eternity s Gate    a colour study Hulsker describes as  another unmistakable remembrance of times long past                             His late paintings show an artist at the height of his abilities  according to the art critic Robert Hughes   longing for concision and grace               
After the birth of his nephew  Van Gogh wrote   I started right away to make a picture for him  to hang in their bedroom  branches of white almond blossom against a blue sky

     Exhibitions and recognition

Albert Aurier praised his work in the Mercure de France in January      and described him as  a genius                In February  Van Gogh painted five versions of L Arl sienne  Madame Ginoux   based on a charcoal sketch Gauguin had produced when she sat for both artists in November                        note         Also in February  Van Gogh was invited by Les XX  a society of avant garde painters in Brussels  to participate in their annual exhibition  At the opening dinner a Les XX member  Henry de Groux  insulted Van Gogh s work  Toulouse Lautrec demanded satisfaction  and Signac declared he would continue to fight for Van Gogh s honour if Lautrec surrendered  De Groux apologised for the slight and left the group              
From    March to    April       Van Gogh was included in the sixth exhibition of the Soci t  des Artistes Ind pendants in the Pavillon de la Ville de Paris on the Champs Elys es  Van Gogh exhibited ten paintings               While the exhibition was on display with the Artistes Ind pendants in Paris  Claude Monet said that Van Gogh s work was the best in the show

In May       Van Gogh left the clinic in Saint R my to move nearer to both Dr Paul Gachet in the Paris suburb of Auvers sur Oise and to Theo  Gachet was an amateur painter and had treated several other artists   Camille Pissarro had recommended him  Van Gogh s first impression was that Gachet was  iller than I am  it seemed to me  or let s say just as much               
The painter Charles Daubigny moved to Auvers in      and in turn drew other artists there  including Camille Corot and Honor  Daumier  In July       Van Gogh completed two paintings of Daubigny s Garden  one of which is likely his final work              

The Church at Auvers        Mus e d Orsay  Paris
During his last weeks at Saint R my  his thoughts returned to  memories of the North                and several of the approximately    oils  painted during as many days in Auvers sur Oise  are reminiscent of northern scenes               In June       he painted several portraits of his doctor  including Portrait of Dr Gachet  and his only etching  In each the emphasis is on Gachet s melancholic disposition               There are other paintings which are probably unfinished  including Thatched Cottages by a Hill              
In July  Van Gogh wrote that he had become absorbed  in the immense plain against the hills  boundless as the sea  delicate yellow                He had first become captivated by the fields in May  when the wheat was young and green  In July  he described to Theo  vast fields of wheat under turbulent skies               
He wrote that they represented his  sadness and extreme loneliness  and that the  canvases will tell you what I cannot say in words  that is  how healthy and invigorating I find the countryside                Wheatfield with Crows  although not his last oil work  is from July      and Hulsker discusses it as being associated with  melancholy and extreme loneliness                Hulsker identifies seven oil paintings from Auvers that follow the completion of Wheatfield with Crows               Hulsker also expressed concern about the number of paintings attributed to Van Gogh from the period              

Death

Article on Van Gogh s death from L  cho Pontoisien    August     
On    July       Sunday   aged     Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a revolver               The shooting may have taken place in the wheat field in which he had been painting  or in a local barn               The bullet was deflected by a rib and passed through his chest without doing apparent damage to internal organs   possibly stopped by his spine  He was able to walk back to the Auberge Ravoux  where he was attended to by two doctors  One of them  Dr Gachet  had served as a war surgeon in the      Franco Prussian War and had extensive knowledge of gunshots  Vincent was possibly attended to during the night by Dr Gachet s son Paul Louis Gachet and the innkeeper  Arthur Ravoux  The following morning  Theo rushed to his brother s side  finding him in good spirits but within hours Vincent s health began to fail  suffering from an infection resulting from the wound  He died in the early hours of Tuesday     July  According to Theo  Vincent s last words were   The sadness will last forever                                                      

Vincent and Theo s graves at Auvers sur Oise Cemetery
Van Gogh was buried on    July  in the municipal cemetery of Auvers sur Oise  The funeral was attended by Theo van Gogh  Andries Bonger  Charles Laval  Lucien Pissarro   mile Bernard  Julien Tanguy and Paul Gachet  among twenty family members  friends and locals  Theo suffered from syphilis  and his health began to decline further after his brother s death  Weak and unable to come to terms with Vincent s absence  he died on    January      at Den Dolder and was buried in Utrecht               In       Johanna van Gogh Bonger had Theo s body exhumed and moved from Utrecht to be re buried alongside Vincent s at Auvers sur Oise              
There have been numerous debates as to the nature of Van Gogh s illness and its effect on his work  and many retrospective diagnoses have been proposed  The consensus is that Van Gogh had an episodic condition with periods of normal functioning               Perry was the first to suggest bipolar disorder in                    and this has been supported by the psychiatrists Hemphill and Blumer                            Biochemist Wilfred Arnold has countered that the symptoms are more consistent with acute intermittent porphyria  noting that the popular link between bipolar disorder and creativity might be spurious               Temporal lobe epilepsy with bouts of depression has also been suggested               Whatever the diagnosis  his condition was likely worsened by malnutrition  overwork  insomnia and alcohol              

Style and works
Artistic development
Starry Night Over the Rh ne        Mus e d Orsay  Paris
Van Gogh drew and painted with watercolours while at school  but only a few examples survive and the authorship of some has been challenged               When he took up art as an adult  he began at an elementary level  In early       his uncle  Cornelis Marinus  owner of a well known gallery of contemporary art in Amsterdam  asked for drawings of The Hague  Van Gogh s work did not live up to expectations  Marinus offered a second commission  specifying the subject matter in detail  but was again disappointed with the result  Van Gogh persevered  he experimented with lighting in his studio using variable shutters and different drawing materials  For more than a year he worked on single figures        highly elaborate studies in black and white      note         which at the time gained him only criticism  Later  they were recognised as early masterpieces              
In August       Theo gave Vincent money to buy materials for working en plein air  Vincent wrote that he could now  go on painting with new vigour                From early       he worked on multi figure compositions  He had some of them photographed  but when his brother remarked that they lacked liveliness and freshness  he destroyed them and turned to oil painting  Van Gogh turned to well known Hague School artists like Weissenbruch and Blommers  and he received technical advice from them as well as from painters like De Bock and van der Weele  both of the Hague School s second generation               He moved to Nuenen after a short period in Drenthe and began work on several large paintings but destroyed most of them  The Potato Eaters and its companion pieces are the only ones to have survived               Following a visit to the Rijksmuseum Van Gogh wrote of his admiration for the quick  economical brushwork of the Dutch Masters  especially Rembrandt and Frans Hals                   note         He was aware many of his faults were due to lack of experience and technical expertise               so in November      he travelled to Antwerp and later Paris to learn and develop his skills              

Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background        Museum of Modern Art  New York
Theo criticised The Potato Eaters for its dark palette  which he thought unsuitable for a modern style               During Van Gogh s stay in Paris between      and       he tried to master a new  lighter palette  His Portrait of P re Tanguy        shows his success with the brighter palette and is evidence of an evolving personal style               Charles Blanc s treatise on colour interested him greatly and led him to work with complementary colours  Van Gogh came to believe that the effect of colour went beyond the descriptive  he said that  colour expresses something in itself                             According to Hughes  Van Gogh perceived colour as having a  psychological and moral weight   as exemplified in the garish reds and greens of The Night Caf   a work he wanted to  express the terrible passions of humanity                Yellow meant the most to him  because it symbolised emotional truth  He used yellow as a symbol for sunlight  life  and God              
Van Gogh strove to be a painter of rural life and nature               during his first summer in Arles he used his new palette to paint landscapes and traditional rural life               His belief that a power existed behind the natural led him to try to capture a sense of that power  or the essence of nature in his art  sometimes through the use of symbols               His renditions of the sower  at first copied from Jean Fran ois Millet  reflect the influence of Thomas Carlyle and Friedrich Nietzsche s thoughts on the heroism of physical labour               as well as Van Gogh s religious beliefs  the sower as Christ sowing life beneath the hot sun               These were themes and motifs he returned to often to rework and develop               His paintings of flowers are filled with symbolism  but rather than use traditional Christian iconography he made up his own  where life is lived under the sun and work is an allegory of life               In Arles  having gained confidence after painting spring blossoms and learning to capture bright sunlight  he was ready to paint The Sower              

Memory of the Garden at Etten        Hermitage Museum  St Petersburg
Van Gogh stayed within what he called the  guise of reality               and was critical of overly stylised works               He wrote afterwards that the abstraction of Starry Night had gone too far and that reality had  receded too far in the background                Hughes describes it as a moment of extreme visionary ecstasy  the stars are in a great whirl  reminiscent of Hokusai s Great Wave  the movement in the heaven above is reflected by the movement of the cypress on the earth below  and the painter s vision is  translated into a thick  emphatic plasma of paint               
Between      and his death in       Van Gogh appears to have been building an oeuvre               a collection that reflected his personal vision and could be commercially successful  He was influenced by Blanc s definition of style  that a true painting required optimal use of colour  perspective and brushstrokes  Van Gogh applied the word  purposeful  to paintings he thought he had mastered  as opposed to those he thought of as studies               He painted many series of studies               most of which were still lifes  many executed as colour experiments or as gifts to friends               The work in Arles contributed considerably to his oeuvre  those he thought the most important from that time were The Sower  Night Cafe  Memory of the Garden in Etten and Starry Night  With their broad brushstrokes  inventive perspectives  colours  contours and designs  these paintings represent the style he sought

Van Gogh s stylistic developments are usually linked to the periods he spent living in different places across Europe  He was inclined to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting conditions  although he maintained a highly individual visual outlook throughout  His evolution as an artist was slow and he was aware of his painterly limitations  Van Gogh moved home often  perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimuli  and through exposure develop his technical skill               Art historian Melissa McQuillan believes the moves also reflect later stylistic changes and that Van Gogh used the moves to avoid conflict  and as a coping mechanism for when the idealistic artist was faced with the realities of his then current situation

Van Gogh said portraiture was his greatest interest   What I m most passionate about  much much more than all the rest in my profession   he wrote in        is the portrait  the modern portrait                It is  the only thing in painting that moves me deeply and that gives me a sense of the infinite                             He wrote to his sister that he wished to paint portraits that would endure  and that he would use colour to capture their emotions and character rather than aiming for photographic realism               Those closest to Van Gogh are mostly absent from his portraits  he rarely painted Theo  van Rappard or Bernard  The portraits of his mother were from photographs              
Van Gogh painted Arles  postmaster Joseph Roulin and his family repeatedly  In five versions of La Berceuse  The Lullaby   Van Gogh painted Augustine Roulin quietly holding a rope that rocks the unseen cradle of her infant daughter  Van Gogh had planned for it to be the central image of a triptych  flanked by paintings of sunflowers

Self portraits
Main article  Portraits of Vincent van Gogh        Self portraits
Self Portrait  September       Mus e d Orsay
Van Gogh created more than    self portraits between      and                        note         They were usually completed in series  such as those painted in Paris in mid       and continued until shortly before his death               Generally the portraits were studies  created during periods when he was reluctant to mix with others or when he lacked models and painted himself                           
Van Gogh s self portraits reflect a high degree of self scrutiny               Often they were intended to mark important periods in his life  for example  the mid      Paris series were painted at the point where he became aware of Claude Monet  Paul C zanne and Signac               In Self Portrait with Grey Felt Hat  heavy strains of paint spread outwards across the canvas  It is one of his most renowned self portraits of that period   with its highly organised rhythmic brushstrokes  and the novel halo derived from the Neo impressionist repertoire was what Van Gogh himself called a  purposeful  canvas               
They contain a wide array of physiognomical representations               Van Gogh s mental and physical condition is usually apparent  he may appear unkempt  unshaven or with a neglected beard  with deeply sunken eyes  a weak jaw  or having lost teeth  Some show him with full lips  a long face or prominent skull  or sharpened  alert features  His hair is sometimes depicted in a vibrant reddish hue and at other times ash coloured              
Van Gogh s self portraits vary stylistically  In those painted after December       the strong contrast of vivid colours highlight the haggard pallor of his skin               Some depict the artist with a beard  others without  He can be seen with bandages in portraits executed just after he mutilated his ear  In only a few does he depict himself as a painter               Those painted in Saint R my show the head from the right  the side opposite his damaged ear  as he painted himself reflected in his mirror

Flowers

Still Life  Vase with Fourteen Sunflowers  August       National Gallery  London
Van Gogh painted several landscapes with flowers  including roses  lilacs  irises  and sunflowers  Some reflect his interests in the language of colour  and also in Japanese ukiyo e               There are two series of dying sunflowers  The first was painted in Paris in      and shows flowers lying on the ground  The second set was completed a year later in Arles and is of bouquets in a vase positioned in early morning light               Both are built from thickly layered paintwork  which  according to the London National Gallery  evokes the  texture of the seed heads               
In these series  Van Gogh was not preoccupied by his usual interest in filling his paintings with subjectivity and emotion  rather  the two series are intended to display his technical skill and working methods to Gauguin               who was about to visit  The      paintings were created during a rare period of optimism for the artist  Vincent wrote to Theo in August      

I m painting with the gusto of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse  which won t surprise you when it s a question of painting large sunflowers          If I carry out this plan there ll be a dozen or so panels  The whole thing will therefore be a symphony in blue and yellow  I work on it all these mornings  from sunrise  Because the flowers wilt quickly and it s a matter of doing the whole thing in one go              
The sunflowers were painted to decorate the walls in anticipation of Gauguin s visit  and Van Gogh placed individual works around the Yellow House s guest room in Arles  Gauguin was deeply impressed and later acquired two of the Paris versions               After Gauguin s departure  Van Gogh imagined the two major versions of the sunflowers as wings of the Berceuse Triptych  and included them in his Les XX in Brussels exhibit  Today the major pieces of the series are among his best known  celebrated for the sickly connotations of the colour yellow and its tie in with the Yellow House  the expressionism of the brush strokes  and their contrast against often dark backgrounds

Cypresses and olives
See also  Olive Trees  Van Gogh series 
Road with Cypress and Star  May       Kr ller M ller Museum  Otterlo
Fifteen canvases depict cypresses  a tree he became fascinated with in Arles               He brought life to the trees  which were traditionally seen as emblematic of death               The series of cypresses he began in Arles featured the trees in the distance  as windbreaks in fields  when he was at Saint R my he brought them to the foreground               Vincent wrote to Theo in May        Cypresses still preoccupy me  I should like to do something with them like my canvases of sunflowers   he went on to say   They are beautiful in line and proportion like an Egyptian obelisk               
In mid       and at his sister Wil s request  Van Gogh painted several smaller versions of Wheat Field with Cypresses               The works are characterised by swirls and densely painted impasto  and include The Starry Night  in which cypresses dominate the foreground               In addition to this  other notable works on cypresses include Cypresses         Cypresses with Two Figures            and Road with Cypress and Star                     
During the last six or seven months of the year       he had also created at least fifteen paintings of olive trees  a subject which he considered as demanding and compelling               Among these works are Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background         about which in a letter to his brother Van Gogh wrote   At last I have a landscape with olives                While in Saint R my  Van Gogh spent time outside the asylum  where he painted trees in the olive groves  In these works  natural life is rendered as gnarled and arthritic as if a personification of the natural world  which are  according to Hughes  filled with  a continuous field of energy of which nature is a manifestation

Orchards
See also  Flowering Orchards
The Flowering Orchards  also the Orchards in Blossom  are among the first groups of work completed after Van Gogh s arrival in Arles in February       The    paintings are optimistic  joyous and visually expressive of the burgeoning spring  They are delicately sensitive and unpopulated  He painted swiftly  and although he brought to this series a version of Impressionism  a strong sense of personal style began to emerge during this period  The transience of the blossoming trees  and the passing of the season  seemed to align with his sense of impermanence and belief in a new beginning in Arles  During the blossoming of the trees that spring  he found  a world of motifs that could not have been more Japanese                Vincent wrote to Theo on    April      that he had    orchards and  one big  painting  of a cherry tree  which I ve spoiled               
During this period Van Gogh mastered the use of light by subjugating shadows and painting the trees as if they are the source of light   almost in a sacred manner               Early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards  including View of Arles  Flowering Orchards               Van Gogh was enthralled by the landscape and vegetation of the south of France  and often visited the farm gardens near Arles  In the vivid light of the Mediterranean climate his palette significantly brightened

Wheat fields
See also  Wheat Fields  Van Gogh series  and The Wheat Field
Wheatfield Under Thunderclouds        Van Gogh Museum  Amsterdam  Netherlands
Van Gogh made several painting excursions during visits to the landscape around Arles  He made paintings of harvests  wheat fields and other rural landmarks of the area  including The Old Mill         a good example of a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields beyond               At various points  Van Gogh painted the view from his window   at The Hague  Antwerp  and Paris  These works culminated in The Wheat Field series  which depicted the view from his cells in the asylum at Saint R my              
Many of the late paintings are sombre but essentially optimistic and  right up to the time of Van Gogh s death  reflect his desire to return to lucid mental health  Yet some of his final works reflect his deepening concerns                            Writing in July       from Auvers  Van Gogh said that he had become absorbed  in the immense plain against the hills  boundless as the sea  delicate yellow               
Van Gogh was captivated by the fields in May when the wheat was young and green  His Wheatfields at Auvers with White House shows a more subdued palette of yellows and blues  which creates a sense of idyllic harmony              
About    July       Van Gogh wrote to Theo of  vast fields of wheat under troubled skies                Wheatfield with Crows shows the artist s state of mind in his final days  Hulsker describes the work as a  doom filled painting with threatening skies and ill omened crows                Its dark palette and heavy brushstrokes convey a sense of menace

Nazi looted art
Main article  Nazi looting of artworks by Vincent van Gogh
During the Nazi period             a great number of artworks by Van Gogh changed hands  many of them looted from Jewish collectors who were forced into exile or murdered  Some of these works have disappeared into private collections  Others have since resurfaced in museums  or at auction  or have been reclaimed  often in high profile lawsuits  by their former owners                            The German Lost Art Foundation still lists dozens of missing Van Goghs              and the American Alliance of Museums lists    Van Goghs on the Nazi Era Provenance Internet Portal              

Notes


  In this Dutch name  the surname is  Van Gogh  not  Gogh  

  The pronunciation of Van Gogh varies in both English and Dutch  Especially in British English it is  v n    x  van GOKH            or  v n    f  van GOF             American dictionaries list  v n   o         van GOH  with a silent gh  as the most common pronunciation             In the dialect of Holland  it is       f ns nt f    x x         with a voiceless v and g  He grew up in Brabant and used Brabant dialect in his writing  his pronunciation was thus likely      v              with a voiced v and palatalised g and gh  see  Hard and soft G in Dutch     In France  where much of his work was produced  it is      v                          

  It has been suggested that being given the same name as his dead elder brother might have had a deep psychological impact on the young artist and that elements of his art  such as the portrayal of pairs of male figures  can be traced back to this             

  Hulsker suggests that van Gogh returned to the Borinage and then back to Etten in this period             

  See Jan Hulsker s speech The Borinage Episode and the Misrepresentation of Vincent van Gogh  Van Gogh Symposium        May                  

   At Christmas I had a rather violent argument with Pa  and feelings ran so high that Pa said it would be better if I left home  Well  it was said so decidedly that I actually left the same day  

  The only evidence for this is from interviews with the grandson of the doctor               For an overall review see Naifeh and Smith              

   Boch s sister Anna              also an artist  purchased The Red Vineyard in                   

  Van Gogh         Letter          Vincent to Theo van Gogh  Arles  Sunday     or Monday     November      I ve been working on two canvases          A reminiscence of our garden at Etten with cabbages  cypresses  dahlias and figures          Gauguin gives me courage to imagine  and the things of the imagination do indeed take on a more mysterious character 

  Theo and his wife  Gachet and his son  and Signac  who saw van Gogh after the bandages were removed  maintained that only the earlobe had been removed               According to Doiteau and Leroy  the diagonal cut removed the lobe and probably a little more               The policeman and Rey both claimed van Gogh severed the entire outer ear               Rey repeated his account in       writing a note for novelist Irving Stone and including a sketch of the line of the incision              

  The version intended for Ginoux is lost  It was an attempt to deliver this painting to her in Arles that precipitated his February relapse              

  Artists working in black and white  e g  for illustrated papers like The Graphic or The Illustrated London News were among van Gogh s favourites              

  Van Gogh         Letter     To Theo van Gogh  Nuenen  on or about Tuesday     October      What particularly struck me when I saw the old Dutch paintings again is that they were usually painted quickly  That these great masters like Hals  Rembrandt  Ruisdael        so many others        as far as possible just put it straight down        and didn t come back to it so very much  And        this  too  please        that if it worked  they left it alone  Above all I admired hands by Rembrandt and Hals        hands that lived  but were not finished in the sense that people want to enforce nowadays          In the winter I m going to explore various things regarding manner that I noticed in the old paintings  I saw a great deal that I needed  But this above all things        what they call        dashing off        you see that s what the old Dutch painters did famously  That        dashing off        with a few brushstrokes  they won t hear of it now         but how true the results are 

  Rembrandt is one of the few major painters to exceed this volume of self portraits  producing over     but he did so over a forty year period              

  Her husband had been the sole support of the family  and Johanna was left with only an apartment in Paris  a few items of furniture  and her brother in law s paintings  which at the time were  looked upon as having no value at all               

  In de      la      Faille s      catalogue each of van Gogh s works was assigned a number  These numbers preceded by the letter  F  are frequently used when referring to a particular painting or drawing               Not all the works listed in the original catalogue are now believed to be authentic works of van Gogh
