Robotic process automation  RPA  is a form of business process automation that is based on software robots  bots  or artificial intelligence  AI  agents             RPA should not be confused with artificial intelligence as it is based on automation technology following a predefined workflow              It is sometimes referred to as software robotics  not to be confused with robot software  
In traditional workflow automation tools  a software developer produces a list of actions to automate a task and interface to the back end system using internal application programming interfaces  APIs  or dedicated scripting language  In contrast  RPA systems develop the action list by watching the user perform that task in the application s graphical user interface  GUI  and then perform the automation by repeating those tasks directly in the GUI  This can lower the barrier to the use of automation in products that might not otherwise feature APIs for this purpose 
RPA tools have strong technical similarities to graphical user interface testing tools  These tools also automate interactions with the GUI  and often do so by repeating a set of demonstration actions performed by a user  RPA tools differ from such systems in that they allow data to be handled in and between multiple applications  for instance  receiving email containing an invoice  extracting the data  and then typing that into a bookkeeping system 


Historic evolution edit 
The typical benefits of robotic automation include reduced cost  increased speed  accuracy  and consistency  improved quality and scalability of production  Automation can also provide extra security  especially for sensitive data and financial services 
As a form of automation  the concept has been around for a long time in the form of screen scraping  so long that to early PC users the reminder of it often blurs with the idea of malware infection             Yet compared to screen scraping  RPA is much more extensible  consisting of API integration into other enterprise applications  connectors into ITSM systems  terminal services and even some types of AI  e g  machine learning  services such as image recognition  It is considered to be a significant technological evolution in the sense that new software platforms are emerging which are sufficiently mature  resilient  scalable and reliable to make this approach viable for use in large enterprises             who would otherwise be reluctant due to perceived risks to quality and reputation  
A principal barrier to the adoption of self service is often technological  it may not always be feasible or economically viable to retrofit new interfaces onto existing systems  Moreover  organisations may wish to layer a variable and configurable set of process rules on top of the system interfaces which may vary according to market offerings and the type of customer  This only adds to the cost and complexity of the technological implementation  Robotic automation software provides a pragmatic means of deploying new services in this situation  where the robots simply mimic the behaviour of humans to perform the back end transcription or processing  The relative affordability of this approach arises from the fact that no new IT transformation or investment is required  instead the software robots simply leverage greater use out of existing IT assets 

Use edit 
The hosting of RPA services also aligns with the metaphor of a software robot  with each robotic instance having its own virtual workstation  much like a human worker  The robot uses keyboard and mouse controls to take actions and execute automations  Normally  all of these actions take place in a virtual environment and not on screen  the robot does not need a physical screen to operate  rather it interprets the screen display electronically  The scalability of modern solutions based on architectures such as these owes much to the advent of virtualization technology  without which the scalability of large deployments would be limited by the available capacity to manage physical hardware and by the associated costs  The implementation of RPA in business enterprises has shown dramatic cost savings when compared to traditional non RPA solutions            
There are however several risks with RPA  Criticism includes risks of stifling innovation and creating a more complex maintenance environment of existing software that now needs to consider the use of graphical user interfaces in a way they weren t intended to be used            

Impact on employment edit 
See also  Technological unemployment and Automation
According to Harvard Business Review  most operations groups adopting RPA have promised their employees that automation would not result in layoffs             Instead  workers have been redeployed to do more interesting work  One academic study highlighted that knowledge workers did not feel threatened by automation  they embraced it and viewed the robots as team mates             The same study highlighted that  rather than resulting in a lower  headcount   the technology was deployed in such a way as to achieve more work and greater productivity with the same number of people 
Conversely  however  some analysts proffer that RPA represents a threat to the business process outsourcing  BPO  industry             The thesis behind this notion is that RPA will enable enterprises to  repatriate  processes from offshore locations into local data centers  with the benefit of this new technology  The effect  if true  will be to create high value jobs for skilled process designers in onshore locations  and within the associated supply chain of IT hardware  data center management  etc   but to decrease the available opportunity to low skilled workers offshore  On the other hand  this discussion appears to be healthy ground for debate as another academic study was at pains to counter the so called  myth  that RPA will bring back many jobs from offshore

Impact on society edit 
Academic studies                         project that RPA  among other technological trends  is expected to drive a new wave of productivity and efficiency gains in the global labour market  Although not directly attributable to RPA alone  Oxford University conjectures that up to     of all jobs might be automated by                  
There are geographic implications to the trend in robotic automation  In the example above where an offshored process is  repatriated  under the control of the client organization  or even displaced by a business process outsourcer  from an offshore location to a data centre  the impact will be a deficit in economic activity to the offshore location and an economic benefit to the originating economy  On this basis  developed economies   with skills and technological infrastructure to develop and support a robotic automation capability   can be expected to achieve a net benefit from the trend 
In a TEDx talk             hosted by University College London  UCL   entrepreneur David Moss explains that digital labour in the form of RPA is likely to revolutionize the cost model of the services industry by driving the price of products and services down  while simultaneously improving the quality of outcomes and creating increased opportunity for the personalization of services 
In a separate TEDx in      talk              Japanese business executive  and former CIO of Barclays bank  Koichi Hasegawa noted that digital robots can be a positive effect on society if we start using a robot with empathy to help every person  He provides a case study of the Japanese insurance companies   Sompo Japan and Aioi   both of whom introduced bots to speed up the process of insurance pay outs in past massive disaster incidents 
Meanwhile  Professor Willcocks  author of the LSE paper             cited above  speaks of increased job satisfaction and intellectual stimulation  characterising the technology as having the ability to  take the robot out of the human               a reference to the notion that robots will take over the mundane and repetitive portions of people s daily workload  leaving them to be used in more interpersonal roles or to concentrate on the remaining  more meaningful  portions of their day 
It was also found in a      study observing the effects of robotization in Europe that  the gender pay gap increased at a rate of      for every    increase in robotization of a given industry             

Unassisted RPA edit 
Unassisted RPA  or RPAAI                          is the next generation of RPA related technologies  Technological advancements around artificial intelligence allow a process to be run on a computer without needing input from a user 

Hyperautomation edit 
Hyperautomation is the application of advanced technologies like RPA  artificial intelligence  machine learning  ML  and process mining to augment workers and automate processes in ways that are significantly more impactful than traditional automation capabilities                                      Hyperautomation is the combination of technologies that allow faster application authorship  like low code and no code  with automation technologies that coordinate different worker types  i e  human and artificial  for intelligent and strategic workflow optimization                         
Gartner s report notes that this trend was kicked off with robotic process automation  RPA   The report notes that   RPA alone is not hyperautomation  Hyperautomation requires a combination of tools to help support replicating pieces of where the human is involved in a task              

Outsourcing edit 
Back office clerical processes outsourced by large organisations   particularly those sent offshore   tend to be simple and transactional in nature  requiring little  if any  analysis or subjective judgement  This would seem to make an ideal starting point for organizations beginning to adopt robotic automation for the back office  Whether client organisations choose to take outsourced processes back  in house  from their business process outsourcing  BPO  providers  thus representing a threat to the future of the BPO business              or whether the BPOs implement such automations on their clients  behalf may well depend on a number of factors 
Conversely however  a BPO provider may seek to effect some form of client lock in by means of automation  By removing cost from a business operation  where the BPO provider is considered to be the owner of the intellectual property and physical implementation of a robotic automation solution  perhaps in terms of hardware  ownership of software licences  etc    the provider can make it very difficult for the client to take a process back  in house  or elect a new BPO provider  This effect occurs as the associated cost savings made through automation would   temporarily at least   have to be reintroduced to the business whilst the technical solution is reimplemented in the new operational context 
The geographically agnostic nature of software means that new business opportunities may arise for those organisations that have a political or regulatory impediment to offshoring or outsourcing  A robotised automation can be hosted in a data centre in any jurisdiction and this has two major consequences for BPO providers  Firstly  for example  a sovereign government may not be willing or legally able to outsource the processing of tax affairs and security administration  On this basis  if robots are compared to a human workforce  this creates a genuinely new opportunity for a  third sourcing  option  after the choices of onshore vs  offshore  Secondly  and conversely  BPO providers have previously relocated outsourced operations to different political and geographic territories in response to changing wage inflation and new labour arbitrage opportunities elsewhere  By contrast  a data centre solution would seem to offer a fixed and predictable cost base that  if sufficiently low in cost on a robot vs  human basis   would seem to eliminate any potential need or desire to continually relocate operational bases 

Limitations of robotic process automation edit 
While robotic process automation has many benefits including cost efficiency and consistency in performance  it also has some limitations  Current RPA solutions demand continual technical support to handle system changes  therefore it lacks the ability to autonomously adapt to new conditions  Because of this limitation  the system sometimes needs manual reconfiguration  which in turn has an effect on efficiency             

Difference between RPA and AI edit 
RPA is based on automation technology following a predefined workflow  and artificial intelligence is data driven and focuses on processing information to make predictions  Therefore  there is a distinct difference between how the two systems operate  AI aims to mimic human intelligence  whereas RPA is focused on reproducing tasks that are typically human directed              Moreover  RPA could also be explained as virtual robots that take over routinized human work  it can identify data by interpreting the underlying tags  RPA  therefore  is based on machine learning  whereas AI utilizes self learning technologies
