The Matrix is a      science fiction action film written and directed by the Wachowskis      a      It is the first installment in the Matrix film series  starring Keanu Reeves  Laurence Fishburne  Carrie Anne Moss  Hugo Weaving  and Joe Pantoliano  It depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside the Matrix  a simulated reality created by intelligent machines  Believing computer hacker Neo to be  the One  prophesied to defeat them  Morpheus recruits him into a rebellion against the machines 
Following the success of Bound         Warner Bros  gave the go ahead for The Matrix after the Wachowskis sent an edit of the film s opening minutes  Action scenes were influenced by anime and martial arts films   particularly fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema   Other influences include Plato s cave and     s Telnet hacker communities  The film popularized terms such as the red pill  and popularised a visual effect known as  bullet time   in which a character s heightened perception is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed 
The Matrix opened in theaters in the United States on March           to widespread acclaim from critics  who praised its innovative visual effects  action sequences  cinematography and entertainment value                        The film was a box office success  grossing over      million on a     million budget  becoming the highest grossing Warner Bros  film of      and the fourth highest grossing film of that year  The film received nominations at the   nd Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects  Best Film Editing  Best Sound and Best Sound Effects Editing  winning all four categories  The film was also the recipient of numerous other accolades  including Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects at the   rd British Academy Film Awards  and the Wachowskis were awarded Best Director and Best Science Fiction Film at the   th Saturn Awards  The Matrix is considered to be among the greatest science fiction films of all time                                    and in       the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being  culturally  historically  and aesthetically significant              
The film s success led to two sequels by the Wachowskis  both released in       The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions  The Matrix franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books  video games and an animated anthology film  The Animatrix  with which the Wachowskis were heavily involved  The franchise has also inspired books and theories expanding on some of the religious and philosophical ideas alluded to in the films  A fourth film  titled The Matrix Resurrections  directed solely by Lana Wachowski was released in

The Agents interrogate Neo about Morpheus but he refuses to cooperate  In response  they seal Neo s mouth shut and implant a robotic device in his abdomen  Neo awakens at home  initially dismissing the encounter as a nightmare until Trinity and her allies arrive  extract the implanted tracker  and bring Neo to Morpheus  their leader  Morpheus offers Neo a choice  a red pill to uncover the truth about the Matrix or a blue pill to forget everything and return to his normal life  Opting for the red pill  Neo s reality distorts  and he awakens submerged in a mechanical pod with invasive cables running throughout his body  Neo witnesses countless inert humans similarly encased and tended to by machines before he is ejected from the facility and rescued by Morpheus aboard the hovercraft  the Nebuchadnezzar 
Morpheus reveals that the year is approximately       In the   st century  humanity lost a war with their artificially intelligent creations  leaving the Earth a devastated ruin  As a last resort  humans blackened the sky to eliminate the machines  access to solar power and  in response  the machines developed farms of artificially grown humans to harness their bioelectric energy  The Matrix is a simulated reality based on human civilization at its peak  designed to keep the subjugated humans oblivious and pacified  The remaining free humans established an underground refuge known as Zion  living a harsh existence on scarce resources  Morpheus and his rebel crew hack into the Matrix to free and recruit others  manipulating the rules of the simulation to gain superhuman physical abilities  Even so  they are outmatched by the overwhelmingly powerful Agents sentient programs protecting the Matrix and dying in the Matrix causes death in the real world  Morpheus liberated Neo because he believes him to be  the One   a prophesied figure destined to dismantle the Matrix and liberate humanity 
The crew enter the Matrix to seek guidance from the Oracle  the prophetic figure who foretold the existence of the One  She implies that Neo is not the One and warns him of an imminent choice between his life and Morpheus s  The crew are ambushed by Agents after being betrayed by Cypher  a disgruntled crew member who wants to be reinserted into the Matrix to enjoy its comforts  Convinced of Neo s importance  Morpheus sacrifices himself to confront Smith  only to be overpowered and captured  Meanwhile  Cypher exits the Matrix and begins forcefully disconnecting the others  killing them  Before Cypher can kill Neo and Trinity  Tank  a subdued crew member  regains consciousness  kills Cypher  and safely extracts the survivors 
Smith interrogates Morpheus to obtain access codes for Zion s mainframe  which would allow them to end the human resistance  Determined to rescue Morpheus  Neo reenters the Matrix with Trinity  They successfully free Morpheus  who escapes the Matrix with Trinity  but Smith intercepts Neo  Gaining confidence in his abilities  Neo fights Smith  demonstrating comparable power and eventually killing him  However  Smith resurrects in a new body and kills Neo

Top to bottom  Keanu Reeves  Laurence Fishburne  and Carrie Anne Moss star in the film as Neo  Morpheus and Trinity respectively 
Keanu Reeves as Neo  A computer programmer  born Thomas A  Anderson  who secretly operates as a hacker named Neo  Reeves described his character as someone who felt that something was wrong  and was searching for Morpheus and the truth to break free              Will Smith turned down the role of Neo to make Wild Wild West  because of skepticism over the film s ambitious bullet time special effects              He later stated he was  not mature enough as an actor  at that time              and that if given the role  he  would have messed it up                           Smith praised Reeves for his portrayal              Nicolas Cage also turned down the part because of  family obligations               Warner Bros  sought Brad Pitt or Val Kilmer for the role              When both declined  Leonardo DiCaprio initially accepted the role  but ultimately turned it down because he did not want to do a visual effects film directly after Titanic              The studio pushed for Reeves  who won the role over Johnny Depp  the Wachowskis  first choice              Lorenzo di Bonaventura stated that the screenplay was also sent to Sandra Bullock  with the suggestion of rewriting Neo as a female             
Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus  A human freed from the Matrix and captain of the Nebuchadnezzar  Fishburne stated that once he read the script  he did not understand why other people found it confusing  However  he doubted if the movie would ever be made  because it was  so smart               The Wachowskis instructed Fishburne to base his performance on the character Morpheus in Neil Gaiman s Sandman comics             
Carrie Anne Moss as Trinity  A human freed by Morpheus  a crewmember of the Nebuchadnezzar  and later Neo s romantic interest  After reading the script  Moss stated that at first  she did not believe she had to do the extreme acrobatic actions as described in the script  She also doubted how the Wachowskis would get to direct a movie with a budget so large  but after spending an hour with them going through the storyboard  she understood why some people would trust them              Moss mentioned that she underwent a three hour physical test during casting  so she knew what to expect subsequently              The role made Moss  who later said   I had no career before  None               Janet Jackson was initially approached for the role but scheduling conflicts prevented her from accepting it                          In an interview  she stated that turning down the role was difficult for her  so she later referenced The Matrix in the  Intro  and  Outro  interludes on her tenth studio album Discipline              Sandra Bullock  who was previously approached for the role of Neo  was also offered the role of Trinity  but she turned it down              Rosie Perez  Salma Hayek and Jada Pinkett Smith  who would later play Niobe in the sequels  auditioned for the role                                     
Joe Pantoliano as Cypher  Another human freed by Morpheus  and a crewmember of the Nebuchadnezzar  but one who regrets taking the red pill and seeks to be returned to the Matrix  later betraying the rebels to Agent Smith  Pantoliano had worked with the Wachowskis prior to appearing in The Matrix  starring in their      film Bound

Production edit 
Development edit 
In       the Wachowskis presented the script for the film Assassins to Warner Bros  Pictures  After Lorenzo di Bonaventura  the president of production of the company at the time  read the script  he decided to buy rights to it and included two more pictures  Bound and The Matrix  in the contract  The first movie the Wachowskis directed  Bound  then became a critical success  Using this momentum  they later asked to direct The Matrix              Reeves said that the Matrix avatar would have been a  different sex than the Zion reality  in the early draft of the script  but the studio was not ready for that version             
In       the Wachowskis pitched the role of Neo to Will Smith  Smith explained on his YouTube channel that the idea was for him to be Neo  while Morpheus was to be played by Val Kilmer  He later explained that he did not quite understand the concept and he turned down the role to instead film Wild Wild West              Madonna also turned down an undisclosed role  a decision she would later regret             
Producer Joel Silver soon joined the project  Although the project had key supporters  including Silver and Di Bonaventura  to influence the company  The Matrix was still a huge investment for Warner Bros   which had to invest     million to create a movie with prominent actors and difficult special effects              The Wachowskis therefore hired underground comic book artists Geof Darrow and Steve Skroce to draw a     page  shot by shot storyboard for the entire film                                      The storyboard eventually earned the studio s approval  and it was decided to film in Australia to make the most of the budget              Soon  The Matrix became a co production of Warner Bros  and Village Roadshow Pictures              According to editor Zach Staenberg on the DVD audio commentary track  the production team sent an edit of the film s first minutes  featuring Trinity s encounter with police and Agents  to Warner executives  and secured Warner s  total support of the movie  from then on             

Pre production edit 
The cast were required to be able to understand and explain The Matrix              French philosopher Jean Baudrillard s Simulacra and Simulation was required reading for most of the principal cast and crew              In early       the Wachowskis had Reeves and Moss read Simulacra and Simulation  Kevin Kelly s Out of Control  The New Biology of Machines  Social Systems  and the Economic World  and Dylan Evans s ideas on evolutionary psychology even before they opened up the script              Eventually  Reeves was able to explain all the philosophical nuances involved              Moss commented that she had difficulty with this process             
The directors had long been admirers of Hong Kong action cinema  so they decided to hire the Chinese martial arts choreographer and film director Yuen Woo ping to work on fight scenes  To prepare for the wire fu  the actors had to train hard for several months              The Wachowskis first scheduled four months for training  beginning in October                   Yuen was optimistic but then began to worry when he realized how unfit the actors were             
Yuen let their body style develop and then worked with each actor s strength  He built on Reeves s diligence  Fishburne s resilience  Weaving s precision and Moss s grace              Yuen designed Moss s moves to suit her deftness and lightness              Prior to the pre production  Reeves underwent a two level fusion of his cervical  neck  spine due to spinal cord compression from a herniated disc   I was falling over in the shower in the morning                He was still recovering by the time of pre production  but he insisted on training  so Yuen let him practice punches and lighter moves  Reeves trained hard and even requested training on days off  However  the surgery still made him unable to kick for two out of four months of training  As a result  Reeves did not kick much in the film                          Weaving had to undergo hip surgery after he sustained an injury during the training process             

Filming edit 
Campbell Street train bridge at the intersection of Elizabeth Street was one of the filming locations in the city of Sydney 
All but a few scenes were filmed at Fox Studios in Sydney  as well as in the city itself  although recognizable landmarks were not included to maintain the impression of a generic American city  The filming helped establish New South Wales as a major film production center                          Filming began in March      and wrapped in August       principal photography took     days              Some filming also occurred at Culver Studios             
Due to Reeves s neck injury  see above   some of the action scenes had to be rescheduled to wait for his full recovery  As a result  the filming began with scenes that did not require much physical exertion                          such as the scene in Thomas Anderson s office  the interrogation room              or the car ride in which Neo is taken to see the Oracle              Locations for these scenes included Martin Place s fountain in Sydney  halfway between it and the adjacent Colonial Building  and the Colonial Building itself              During the scene set on a government building rooftop  the team filmed extra footage of Neo dodging bullets in case the bullet time process did not work  The bullet time fight scene was filmed on the roof of Symantec Corporation building in Kent Street  opposite Sussex Street             
Moss performed the shots featuring Trinity at the beginning of the film and all the wire stunts herself              The rooftop set that Trinity uses to escape from Agent Brown early in the film was left over from the production of Dark City  which has prompted comments due to the thematic similarities of the films              During the rehearsal of the lobby scene  in which Trinity runs on a wall  Moss injured her leg and was ultimately unable to film the shot in one take  She stated that she was under a lot of pressure at the time and was devastated when she realized that she would be unable to do it             
Fishburne later said that while being in Sydney to shoot the film  he experienced a racist vibe and that it felt like America in the     s             
The dojo set was built well before the actual filming  During the filming of these action sequences  there was significant physical contact between the actors  earning them bruises  Reeves s injury and his insufficient training with wires prior to filming meant he was unable to perform the triple kicks satisfactorily and became frustrated with himself  causing the scene to be postponed  The scene was shot successfully a few days later  with Reeves using only three takes  Yuen altered the choreography and made the actors pull their punches in the last sequence of the scene  creating a training feel             
The filmmakers originally planned to shoot the subway scene in an actual subway station  but the complexity of the fight and related wire work required shooting the scene on a set  The set was built around an existing train storage facility  which had real train tracks  Filming the scene when Neo slammed Smith into the ceiling  Chad Stahelski  Reeves s stunt double  sustained several injuries  including broken ribs  knees and a dislocated shoulder  Another stuntman was injured by a hydraulic puller during a shot in which Neo was slammed into a booth              The office building in which Smith interrogated Morpheus was a large set  and the outside view from inside the building was a large  three story high cyclorama  The helicopter was a full scale  light weight mock up suspended by a wire rope operated a tilting mechanism mounted to the studio roofbeams  The helicopter had a real minigun side mounted to it  which was set to cycle at half its regular        rounds per minute  firing rate             
To prepare for the scene in which Neo wakes up in a pod  Reeves lost    pounds         kg  and shaved his whole body to give Neo an emaciated look  The scene in which Neo fell into the sewer system concluded the principal photography              According to The Art of the Matrix  at least one filmed scene and a variety of short pieces of action were omitted from the final cut of the film             

Sound effects and music edit

Dane A  Davis was responsible for creating the sound effects for the film  The fight scene sound effects  such as the whipping sounds of punches  were created using thin metal rods and recording them  then editing the sounds  The sound of the pod containing a human body closing required almost fifty sounds put together             
The film s score  The Matrix  Original Motion Picture Score  was composed by Don Davis                          He noted that mirrors appear frequently in the film  reflections of the blue and red pills are seen in Morpheus s glasses  Neo s capture by Agents is viewed through the rear view mirror of Trinity s motorcycle  Neo observes a broken mirror mending itself  reflections warp as a spoon is bent  the reflection of a helicopter is visible as it approaches a skyscraper  Davis focused on this theme of reflections when creating his score  alternating between sections of the orchestra and attempting to incorporate contrapuntal ideas  Davis  score combines orchestral  choral and synthesizer elements  the balance between these elements varies depending on whether humans or machines are the dominant subject of a given scene             
In addition to Davis  score  The Matrix  Music from the Motion Picture also features music from acts such as Rammstein  Rob Dougan  Rage Against the Machine  Propellerheads  Ministry  Lunatic Calm  Deftones  Monster Magnet  The Prodigy  Rob Zombie  Meat Beat Manifesto and Marilyn Manson                                     

Production design edit 
See also  Matrix digital rain
In the film  the code that composes the Matrix itself is frequently represented as downward flowing green characters              This code uses a custom typeface designed by Simon Whiteley              which includes mirror images of half width kana characters and Western Latin letters and Arabic numerals              In a      interview at CNET  he attributed the design to his wife  who is from Japan  and added   I like to tell everybody that The Matrix s code is made out of Japanese sushi recipes                The color green reflects the green tint commonly used on early monochrome computer monitors               Lynne Cartwright  the Visual Effects Supervisor at Animal Logic  supervised the creation of the film s opening title sequence  as well as the general look of the Matrix code throughout the film  in collaboration with Lindsay Fleay and Justen Marshall              The portrayal resembles the opening credits of the      Japanese cyberpunk film  Ghost in the Shell  which had a strong influence on the Matrix series  It was also used in the subsequent films  on the related website  and in the game The Matrix  Path of Neo  and its drop down effect is reflected in the design of some posters for the Matrix series  The code received the Runner up Award in the      Jesse Garson Award for In film typography or opening credit sequence             
The Matrix     s production designer  Owen Paterson  used methods to distinguish the  real world  and the Matrix in a pervasive way  The production design team generally placed a bias towards the Matrix code s distinctive green color in scenes set within the simulation  whereas there is an emphasis on the color blue during scenes set in the  real world   In addition  the Matrix scenes  sets were slightly more decayed  monolithic and grid like  to convey the cold  logical and artificial nature of that environment  For the  real world   the actors  hair was less styled  their clothing had more textile content  and the cinematographers used longer lenses to soften the backgrounds and emphasize the actors             
The Nebuchadnezzar was designed to have a patched up look  instead of clean  cold and sterile space ship interior sets as used on productions such as Star Trek  The wires were made visible to show the ship s working internals  and each composition was carefully designed to convey the ship as  a marriage between Man and Machine               For the scene when Neo wakes up in the pod connected to the Matrix  the pod was constructed to look dirty  used and sinister  During the testing of a breathing mechanism in the pod  the tester suffered hypothermia in under eight minutes  so the pod had to be heated             
Kym Barrett  costume designer  said that she defined the characters and their environment by their costume              For example  Reeves s office costume was designed for Thomas Anderson to look uncomfortable  disheveled and out of place              Barrett sometimes used three types of fabric for each costume  and also had to consider the practicality of the acting  The actors needed to perform martial art actions in their costume  hang upside down without people seeing up their clothing  and be able to work the wires while strapped into the harnesses              For Trinity  Barrett experimented with how each fabric absorbed and reflected different types of light  and was eventually able to make Trinity s costume mercury like and oil slick to suit the character              For the Agents  their costume was designed to create a secret service  undercover look  resembling the film JFK and classic men in black             
The sunglasses  a staple of the film s aesthetics  were commissioned for the film by designer Richard Walker from sunglasses maker Blinde Design             

Visual effects edit 
The  bullet time  effect was created for the film  A scene would be computer modeled to decide the positioning of the physical cameras  The actor then provided their performance in a chroma key setup  while the cameras were fired in rapid succession  with fractions of a second delay between each shot  The result was combined with CGI backgrounds to create the final effect at        
As for artistic inspiration for bullet time  I would credit Otomo Katsuhiro  who co wrote and directed Akira  which definitely blew me away  along with director Michel Gondry  His music videos experimented with a different type of technique called view morphing and it was just part of the beginning of uncovering the creative approaches toward using still cameras for special effects  Our technique was significantly different because we built it to move around objects that were themselves in motion  and we were also able to create slow motion events that  virtual cameras  could move around rather than the static action in Gondry s music videos with limited camera moves         John Gaeta            
The film is known for popularizing a visual effect             known as  bullet time   which allows a shot to progress in slow motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed                          Bullet time has been described as  a visual analogy for privileged moments of consciousness within the Matrix               and throughout the film  the effect is used to illustrate characters  exertion of control over time and space              The Wachowskis first imagined an action sequence that slowed time while the camera pivoted rapidly around the subjects  and proposed the effect in their screenplay for the film  When John Gaeta read the script  he pleaded with an effects producer at Mass Illusion to let him work on the project  and created a prototype that led to him becoming the film s visual effects supervisor                         
The method used for creating these effects involved a technically expanded version of an old art photography technique known as time slice photography  in which an array of cameras are placed around an object and triggered simultaneously  Each camera captures a still picture  contributing one frame to the video sequence  which creates the effect of  virtual camera movement   the illusion of a viewpoint moving around an object that appears frozen in time             
The bullet time effect is similar but slightly more complicated  incorporating temporal motion so that rather than appearing totally frozen  the scene progresses in slow and variable motion                          The cameras  positions and exposures were previsualized using a  D simulation  Instead of firing the cameras simultaneously  the visual effect team fired the cameras fractions of a second after each other  so that each camera could capture the action as it progressed  creating a super slow motion effect              When the frames were put together  the resulting slow motion effects reached a frame frequency of        per second  as opposed to the normal    frames per second of film              Standard movie cameras were placed at the ends of the array to pick up the normal speed action before and after  Because the cameras circle the subject almost completely in most of the sequences  computer technology was used to edit out the cameras that appeared in the background on the other side              To create backgrounds  Gaeta hired George Borshukov  who created  D models based on the geometry of buildings and used the photographs of the buildings themselves as texture      citation needed     
The photo realistic surroundings generated by this method were incorporated into the bullet time scene              and algorithms based on optical flow were used to interpolate between the still images to produce a fluent dynamic motion                          the computer generated  lead in  and  lead out  slides were filled in between frames in sequence to get an illusion of orbiting the scene              Manex Visual Effects used a cluster farm running the Unix like operating system FreeBSD to render many of the film s visual effects                         
Manex also handled creature effects  such as Sentinels and machines in real world scenes  Animal Logic created the code hallway and the exploding Agent at the end of the film  DFilm managed scenes that required heavy use of digital compositing  such as Neo s jump off a skyscraper and the helicopter crash into a building  The ripple effect in the latter scene was created digitally  but the shot also included practical elements  and months of extensive research were needed to find the correct kind of glass and explosives to use  The scene was shot by colliding a quarter scale helicopter mock up into a glass wall wired to concentric rings of explosives  the explosives were then triggered in sequence from the center outward  to create a wave of exploding glass             
The photogrammetric and image based computer generated background approaches in The Matrix     s bullet time evolved into innovations unveiled in the sequels The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions  The method of using real photographs of buildings as texture for  D models eventually led the visual effect team to digitize all data  such as scenes  characters  motions and expressions  It also led to the development of  Universal Capture   a process which samples and stores facial details and expressions at high resolution  With these highly detailed collected data  the team were able to create virtual cinematography in which characters  locations and events can all be created digitally and viewed through virtual cameras  eliminating the restrictions of real cameras

Critical response edit 
The Matrix was praised by many critics  as well as filmmakers  and authors of science fiction             especially for its  spectacular action  scenes and its  groundbreaking special effects   Some have described The Matrix as one of the best science fiction films of all time                        Entertainment Weekly called The Matrix  the most influential action movie of the generation               There have also been those  including philosopher William Irwin  who have suggested that the film explores significant philosophical and spiritual themes  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes  the film holds an approval rating of     based on     reviews  with an average score of         The site s critical consensus reads   Thanks to the Wachowskis  imaginative vision  The Matrix is a smartly crafted combination of spectacular action and groundbreaking special effects              At Metacritic  which assigns a rating out of     to reviews from mainstream critics  the film received a score of    based on    reviews  indicating  generally favorable reviews              Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of  A   on an A  to F scale               It ranked    rd among critics  and    th among directors  in the      Sight  amp  Sound polls of the greatest films ever made              
Philip Strick commented in Sight  amp  Sound  if the Wachowskis  claim no originality of message  they are startling innovators of method   praising the film s details and its  broadside of astonishing images                Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four  he praised the film s visuals and premise  but disliked the third act s focus on action               Similarly  Time Out praised the  entertainingly ingenious  switches between different realities  Hugo Weaving s  engagingly odd  performance  and the film s cinematography and production design  but concluded   the promising premise is steadily wasted as the film turns into a fairly routine action pic          yet another slice of overlong  high concept hokum               
Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader reviewed the film negatively  criticizing it as  simpleminded fun for roughly the first hour  until the movie becomes overwhelmed by its many sources     There s not much humor to keep it all life size  and by the final stretch it s become bloated  mechanical  and tiresome               
Ian Nathan of Empire described Carrie Anne Moss as  a major find   praised the  surreal visual highs  enabled by the bullet time  or  flo mo   effect  and described the film as  technically mind blowing  style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool   Nathan remarked that although the film s  looney plot  would not stand up to scrutiny  that was not a big flaw because  The Matrix is about pure experience                Maitland McDonagh said in her review for TV Guide  the Wachowskis   through the looking glass plot    manages to work surprisingly well on a number of levels  as a dystopian sci fi thriller  as a brilliant excuse for the film s lavish and hyperkinetic fight scenes  and as a pretty compelling call to the dead above the eyeballs masses to unite and cast off their chains    This dazzling pop allegory is steeped in a dark  pulpy sensibility that transcends nostalgic pastiche and stands firmly on its own merits               
Salon     s reviewer Andrew O Hehir acknowledged that although The Matrix is in his view a fundamentally immature and unoriginal film   It lacks anything like adult emotion    all this pseudo spiritual hokum  along with the over ramped onslaught of special effects some of them quite amazing will hold    year old boys in rapture  not to mention those of us of all ages and genders who still harbor a    year old boy somewhere inside    he concluded   as in Bound  there s an appealing scope and daring to the Wachowskis  work  and their eagerness for more plot twists and more crazy images becomes increasingly infectious  In a limited and profoundly geeky sense  this might be an important and generous film  The Wachowskis have little feeling for character or human interaction  but their passion for movies for making them  watching them  inhabiting their world is pure and deep               
Filmmakers and science fiction creators alike generally took a complimentary perspective of The Matrix  William Gibson  a key figure in cyberpunk fiction  called the film  an innocent delight I hadn t felt in a long time   and stated   Neo is my favourite ever science fiction hero  absolutely                Joss Whedon called the film  my number one  and praised its storytelling  structure and depth  concluding   It works on whatever level you want to bring to it                Darren Aronofsky commented   I walked out of The Matrix          and I was thinking   What kind of science fiction movie can people make now   The Wachowskis basically took all the great sci fi ideas of the   th century and rolled them into a delicious pop culture sandwich that everyone on the planet devoured                M  Night Shyamalan expressed admiration for the Wachowskis  stating   Whatever you think of The Matrix  every shot is there because of the passion they have  You can see they argued it out                 Simon Pegg said that The Matrix provided  the excitement and satisfaction that The Phantom Menace failed to inspire  The Matrix seemed fresh and cool and visually breathtaking  making wonderful  intelligent use of CGI to augment the on screen action  striking a perfect balance of the real and the hyperreal  It was possibly the coolest film I had ever seen                Quentin Tarantino counted The Matrix as one of his twenty favorite movies from      to                    James Cameron called it  one of the most profoundly fresh science fiction films ever made                Christopher Nolan described it as  an incredibly palpable mainstream phenomenon that made people think  Hey  what if this isn t real

Thematic analysis edit 


The Matrix is arguably the ultimate cyberpunk artifact 


 William Gibson

The Matrix draws from and alludes to numerous cinematic and literary works  and concepts from mythology  religion and philosophy  including the ideas of Buddhism  Christianity  Gnosticism  Hinduism and Judaism              

Film and television edit 
The pods in which the machines keep humans have been compared to images in Metropolis  and the work of M  C  Escher               A resemblance to the eerie worlds of Swiss artist H R  Giger was also recognized                            The pods can be seen in Welcome to Paradox Episode    News from D Street  from a      short story              of the same name by Andrew Weiner which aired on September          on the SYFY Channel and has a remarkably similar concept  In this episode the hero is unaware he is living in virtual reality until he is told so by  the code man  who created the simulation and enters it knowingly  The Wachowskis have described Stanley Kubrick s       A Space Odyssey as a formative cinematic influence  and as a major inspiration on the visual style they aimed for when making The Matrix                                         Reviewers have also commented on similarities between The Matrix and other late     s films such as Strange Days  Dark City and The Truman Show      b      The similarity of the film s central concept to a device in the long running series Doctor Who has also been noted  As in the film  the Matrix of that series  introduced in the      serial The Deadly Assassin  is a massive computer system which one enters using a device connecting to the head  allowing users to see representations of the real world and change its laws of physics  but if killed there  they will die in reality               The action scenes of The Matrix were also strongly influenced by live action films such as those of director John Woo               The martial arts sequences were inspired by Fist of Legend  a critically acclaimed      martial arts film starring Jet Li  The fight scenes in Fist of Legend led to the hiring of Yuen as fight choreographer                           
The Wachowskis  approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration for Japanese animation such as Ninja Scroll and Akira               Director Mamoru Oshii s      animated film Ghost in the Shell was a particularly strong influence               producer Joel Silver has stated that the Wachowskis first described their intentions for The Matrix by showing him that anime and saying   We wanna do that for real                             Mitsuhisa Ishikawa of Production I G  which produced Ghost in the Shell  noted that the anime s high quality visuals were a strong source of inspiration for the Wachowskis  He also commented            cyberpunk films are very difficult to describe to a third person  I d imagine that The Matrix is the kind of film that was very difficult to draw up a written proposal for to take to film studios   He stated that since Ghost in the Shell had gained recognition in America  the Wachowskis used it as a  promotional tool               

Literary works edit 
The film makes several references to Lewis Carroll s Alice s Adventures in Wonderland               Comparisons have also been made to Grant Morrison s comic series The Invisibles  with Morrison describing it in      as   it  seemed to me  to be  my own combination of ideas enacted on the screen                Comparisons have also been made between The Matrix and the books of Carlos Castaneda              
The Matrix belongs to the cyberpunk genre of science fiction  and draws from earlier works in the genre such as the      novel Neuromancer by William Gibson               For example  the film s use of the term  Matrix  is adopted from Gibson s novel               though L  P  Davies had already used the term  Matrix  fifteen years earlier for a similar concept in his      novel The White Room   It had been tried in the States some years earlier  but their  matrix  as they called it hadn t been strong enough to hold the fictional character in place                 After watching The Matrix  Gibson commented that the way that the film s creators had drawn from existing cyberpunk works was  exactly the kind of creative cultural osmosis  he had relied upon in his own writing               however  he noted that the film s Gnostic themes distinguished it from Neuromancer  and believed that The Matrix was thematically closer to the work of science fiction author Philip K  Dick  particularly Dick s speculative Exegesis               Other writers have also commented on the similarities between The Matrix and Dick s work                                         one example of such influence is a Philip K  Dick s      conference  in which he stated   We are living in a computer programmed reality  and the only clue we have to it is when some variable is changed  and some alteration in our reality occurs       c     

Philosophy edit 
In The Matrix  a copy of Jean Baudrillard s philosophical work Simulacra and Simulation  which was published in French in       is visible on screen as  the book used to conceal disks                            and Morpheus quotes the phrase  desert of the real  from it                The book was required reading               for the actors prior to filming                           However  Baudrillard himself said that The Matrix misunderstands and distorts his work                            Some interpreters of The Matrix mention Baudrillard s philosophy to support their claim  that the  film  is an allegory for contemporary experience in a heavily commercialized  media driven society  especially in developed countries                The influence of The Matrixial Gaze  the philosophical psychoanalytical concept of Bracha L  Ettinger on the archaic matrixial space that resists the field of simulacra                                          was brought to the public s attention through the writings of art historians such as Griselda Pollock and film theorists such as Heinz Peter Schwerfel                             In addition to Baudrillard and Ettinger  the Wachowskis were also significantly influenced by Kevin Kelly s Out of Control  The New Biology of Machines  Social Systems  and the Economic World  and Dylan Evans s ideas on evolutionary psychology             
Philosopher William Irwin suggests that the idea of the  Matrix    a generated reality invented by malicious machines   is an allusion to Descartes   First Meditation   and his idea of an evil demon  The Meditation hypothesizes that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us               The same premise can be found in Hilary Putnam s brain in a vat scenario proposed in the     s               A connection between the premise of The Matrix and Plato s Allegory of the Cave has also been suggested  The allegory is related to Plato s theory of Forms  which holds that the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses  but rather its quality  and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception             
The philosophy of Immanuel Kant has also been claimed as another influence on the film  and in particular how individuals within the Matrix interact with one another and with the system  Kant states in his Critique of Pure Reason that people come to know and explore our world through synthetic means  language  etc    and thus this makes it rather difficult to discern truth from falsely perceived views  This means people are their own agents of deceit  and so in order for them to know truth  they must choose to openly pursue truth  This idea can be examined in Agent Smith s monologue about the first version of the Matrix  which was designed as a human utopia  a perfect world without suffering and with total happiness  Agent Smith explains that   it was a disaster  No one accepted the program  Entire crops  of people  were lost   The machines had to amend their choice of programming in order to make people subservient to them  and so they conceived the Matrix in the image of the world in       The world in      was far from a utopia  but still humans accepted this over the suffering less utopia  According to William Irwin this is Kantian  because the machines wished to impose a perfect world on humans in an attempt to keep people content  so that they would remain completely submissive to the machines  both consciously and subconsciously  but humans were not easy to make content              

Religion and mythology edit 
Andrew Godoski sees allusions to Christ  including Neo s  virgin birth   his doubt in himself  the prophecy of his coming  along with many other Christian references              Amongst these possible allusions  it is suggested that the name of the character Trinity refers to Christianity s doctrine of the Trinity               It has also been noted that the character Morpheus paraphrases the Chinese Taoist philosopher Zhuangzi when he asks Neo   Have you ever had a dream  Neo  that you were so sure was real  What if you were unable to wake from that dream  How would you know the difference from the real world and the dream world               
Matrixism is a fan based possibly satirical religion created as  the matrix religion  

Transgender themes edit 
Years after the release of The Matrix  both of the Wachowskis came out as transgender women               The red pill has been compared with red estrogen pills               Morpheus s description of the Matrix creating a sense that something is fundamentally wrong   like a splinter in your mind   has been compared to gender dysphoria               In the original script  Switch was a woman in the Matrix and a man in the real world  but this idea was removed              
In a      GLAAD Media Awards speech  Lilly Wachowski said   There s a critical eye being cast back on Lana and I s           sic      work through the lens of our transness  This is a cool thing because it s an excellent reminder that art is never static                In       Lilly said The Matrix was intended as an allegory for gender transition  but that  the corporate world wasn t ready                She said it was  all about the desire for transformation but it was all coming from a closeted point of view   but that she did not know  how present my transness was in the background of my brain  when the Wachowskis were writing it               In an interview with Variety in       Reeves said the idea that the Matrix was an allegory for transgender identity  wasn t introduced to me when we started for production on the films               

Legacy edit 
Filmmaking edit 
Following The Matrix  films made abundant use of slow motion  spinning cameras  and  often  the bullet time effect of a character freezing or slowing down and the camera dollying around them              The ability to slow down time enough to distinguish the motion of bullets was used as a central gameplay mechanic of several video games  including Max Payne  in which the feature was explicitly referred to as  bullet time                             It was also the defining game mechanic of the game Superhot and its sequels  The Matrix     s signature special effect  and other aspects of the film  have been parodied numerous times              in comedy films such as Deuce Bigalow  Male Gigolo                      Scary Movie                      Shrek                      Kung Pow  Enter the Fist                      Lastikman         Marx Reloaded in which the relationship between Neo and Morpheus is represented as an imaginary encounter between Karl Marx and Leon Trotsky                and in video games such as Conker s Bad Fur Day               It also inspired films featuring a black clad hero  a sexy yet deadly heroine  and bullets ripping slowly through the air              these included Charlie s Angels        featuring Cameron Diaz floating through the air while the cameras flo mo around her  Equilibrium         starring Christian Bale  whose character wore long black leather coats like Reeves  Neo               Night Watch         a Russian megahit heavily influenced by The Matrix and directed by Timur Bekmambetov  who later made Wanted         which also features bullets ripping through air  and Inception         which centers on a team of sharply dressed rogues who are able to enter other people s dreams by  wiring in   The original Tron        paved the way for The Matrix  and The Matrix  in turn  inspired Disney to make its own Matrix with a Tron sequel  Tron  Legacy                      Also  the film s lobby shootout sequence was recreated in the      Indian action comedy Awara Paagal Deewana

The Matrix had a strong effect on action filmmaking in Hollywood  The film s incorporation of wire fu techniques  including the involvement of fight choreographer Yuen Woo ping and other personnel with a background in Hong Kong action cinema  affected the approaches to fight scenes taken by some subsequent Hollywood action films               moving them towards more Eastern approaches              The success of The Matrix created high demand for those choreographers and their techniques from other filmmakers  who wanted fights of similar sophistication  for example  wire work was employed in X Men                     and Charlie s Angels                      and Yuen Woo ping s brother Yuen Cheung yan was choreographer on Daredevil                      The Matrix     s Asian approach to action scenes also created an audience for Asian action films such as Crouching Tiger  Hidden Dragon        that they might not otherwise have had              
Chad Stahelski  who had been a stunt double on The Matrix prior to directing Reeves in the John Wick series  acknowledged the film s strong influence on the Wick films               and commented   The Matrix literally changed the industry  The influx of martial arts choreographers and fight coordinators now make more  and are more prevalent and powerful in the industry  than stunt coordinators  The Matrix revolutionized that  Today  action movies want their big sequences designed around the fights               
Carrie Anne Moss asserted that prior to being cast in The Matrix  she had  no career   It launched Moss into international recognition and transformed her career  in a New York Daily News interview  she stated   The Matrix gave me so many opportunities  Everything I ve done since then has been because of that experience  It gave me so much                The film also created one of the most devoted movie fan followings since Star Wars              The combined success of the Matrix trilogy  the Lord of the Rings films and the Star Wars prequels made Hollywood interested in creating trilogies              Stephen Dowling from the BBC noted that The Matrix     s success in taking complex philosophical ideas and presenting them in ways palatable for impressionable minds might be its most influential aspect              

Cultural impact edit 
The Matrix was also influential for its impact on superhero films  John Kenneth Muir in The Encyclopedia of Superheroes on Film and Television called the film a  revolutionary  reimagination of movie visuals  paving the way for the visuals of later superhero films  and credits it with helping to  make comic book superheroes hip  and effectively demonstrating the concept of  faster than a speeding bullet  with its bullet time effect               Adam Sternbergh of Vulture com credits The Matrix with reinventing and setting the template for modern superhero blockbusters  and inspiring the superhero renaissance in the early   st century              

Modern reception edit 
In       The Matrix placed   th in the American Film Institute s      Years       Thrills  list               In       Entertainment Weekly called The Matrix the best science fiction piece of media for the past    years              In       the film was ranked   th on Empire     s reader   actor  and critic voted list of  The     Greatest Movies of All Time                The Matrix was voted as the fourth best science fiction film in the      list Best in Film  The Greatest Movies of Our Time  based on a poll conducted by ABC and People  In       the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being  culturally  historically  and aesthetically significant              

Red pill and blue pill edit 
Main article  Red pill and blue pill
Scene from the      film Total Recall where Dr  Edgemar  Roy Brocksmith  explains that swallowing a red pill is a  symbol of your desire to return to reality 
Historians of film note that the trope of a  red pill  as decisive in a return to reality made its first appearance in the      film Total Recall  which  has a scene where the hero  played by Arnold Schwarzenegger  is asked to swallow a red pill in order to symbolize his desire to return to reality from a dream like fantasy                           
The premise of The Matrix has been repurposed for multiple conspiracy theories and alt right fringe groups  For example  some online men s rights groups use the term  redpill  to mean men realizing that they are supposedly being subjugated by feminism                            The term has been used in discussion forums for right wing topics such as Gamergate  white supremacy  incel subculture and QAnon               As of       the verb  pill  and suffix   pilled  had entered more mainstream use and had come to mean developing a sudden interest in something              

Sequels and adaptations edit 
Main article  The Matrix  franchise 
The film s mainstream success led to the making of two sequels  The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions  both directed by the Wachowskis  These were filmed back to back in one shoot and released on separate dates in                    The first film s introductory tale is succeeded by the story of the impending attack on the human enclave of Zion by a vast machine army                             The sequels also incorporate longer and more ambitious action scenes  as well as improvements in bullet time and other visual effects                           
Also released was The Animatrix  a collection of nine animated short films  many of which were created in the same Japanese animation style              that was a strong influence on the live action trilogy  The Animatrix was overseen and approved by the Wachowskis  who only wrote four of the segments themselves but did not direct any of them  much of the project was developed by notable figures from the world of anime              
In March       Warner Bros  was in early stages of developing a relaunch of the franchise with Zak Penn in talks to write a treatment and interest in getting Michael B  Jordan attached to star  According to The Hollywood Reporter neither the Wachowskis nor Joel Silver were involved with the endeavor  although the studio would like to get at minimum the blessing of the Wachowskis               On August           Warner Bros  Pictures Group chairman Toby Emmerich officially announced that a fourth Matrix film was in the works  with Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne Moss set to reprise their roles as Neo and Trinity  respectively               The Matrix Resurrections was released in theaters and on HBO Max on December          
In September       Danny Boyle was announced to be directing and producing a live immersive dance production of the film  entitled Free Your Mind  which debuted in October      at the Aviva Studios in Manchester  England
