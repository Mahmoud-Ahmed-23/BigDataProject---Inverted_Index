 Psychology     portalvte
Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior                        Its subject matter includes the behavior of humans and nonhumans  both conscious and unconscious phenomena  and mental processes such as thoughts  feelings  and motives  Psychology is an academic discipline of immense scope  crossing the boundaries between the natural and social sciences  Biological psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains  linking the discipline to neuroscience  As social scientists  psychologists aim to understand the behavior of individuals and groups                       
A professional practitioner or researcher involved in the discipline is called a psychologist  Some psychologists can also be classified as behavioral or cognitive scientists  Some psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior  Others explore the physiological and neurobiological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors 
Psychologists are involved in research on perception  cognition  attention  emotion  intelligence  subjective experiences  motivation  brain functioning  and personality  Psychologists  interests extend to interpersonal relationships  psychological resilience  family resilience  and other areas within social psychology  They also consider the unconscious mind             Research psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables  Some  but not all  clinical and counseling psychologists rely on symbolic interpretation 
While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems  it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity  By many accounts  psychology ultimately aims to benefit society                                   Many psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role  practicing psychotherapy in clinical  counseling  or school settings  Other psychologists conduct scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and behavior  Typically the latter group of psychologists work in academic settings  e g   universities  medical schools  or hospitals   Another group of psychologists is employed in industrial and organizational settings             Yet others are involved in work on human development  aging  sports  health  forensic science  education  and the media 


Etymology and definitions
The word psychology derives from the Greek word psyche  for spirit or soul  The latter part of the word psychology derives from         logia  which means  study  or  research               The word psychology was first used in the Renaissance              In its Latin form psychiologia  it was first employed by the Croatian humanist and Latinist Marko Maruli  in his book Psichiologia de ratione animae humanae  Psychology  on the Nature of the Human Soul  in the decade                                   The earliest known reference to the word psychology in English was by Steven Blankaart in      in The Physical Dictionary  The dictionary refers to  Anatomy  which treats the Body  and Psychology  which treats of the Soul              
   psi   the first letter of the Greek word psyche from which the term psychology is derived  is commonly associated with the field of psychology 
In       William James defined psychology as  the science of mental life  both of its phenomena and their conditions               This definition enjoyed widespread currency for decades  However  this meaning was contested  notably by John B  Watson  who in      asserted the methodological behaviorist view of psychology as a purely objective experimental branch of natural science  the theoretical goal of which  is the prediction and control of behavior               Since James defined  psychology   the term more strongly implicates scientific experimentation                          Folk psychology is the understanding of the mental states and behaviors of people held by ordinary people  as contrasted with psychology professionals  understanding             

History
Main article  History of psychology
For a chronological guide  see Timeline of psychology 
The ancient civilizations of Egypt  Greece  China  India  and Persia all engaged in the philosophical study of psychology  In Ancient Egypt the Ebers Papyrus mentioned depression and thought disorders              Historians note that Greek philosophers  including Thales  Plato  and Aristotle  especially in his De Anima treatise               addressed the workings of the mind              As early as the  th century BC  the Greek physician Hippocrates theorized that mental disorders had physical rather than supernatural causes              In     BCE  Plato suggested that the brain is where mental processes take place  and in     BCE Aristotle suggested that it was the heart             
In China  the foundations of psychological thought emerged from the philosophical works of ancient thinkers like Laozi and Confucius  as well as the teachings of Buddhism              This body of knowledge drew insights from introspection  observation  and techniques for focused thinking and behavior  It viewed the universe as comprising physical and mental realms  along with the interplay between the two              Chinese philosophy also emphasized purifying the mind in order to increase virtue and power  An ancient text known as The Yellow Emperor s Classic of Internal Medicine identifies the brain as the nexus of wisdom and sensation  includes theories of personality based on yin yang balance  and analyzes mental disorder in terms of physiological and social disequilibria  Chinese scholarship that focused on the brain advanced during the Qing dynasty with the work of Western educated Fang Yizhi              Liu Zhi              and Wang Qingren              Wang Qingren emphasized the importance of the brain as the center of the nervous system  linked mental disorder with brain diseases  investigated the causes of dreams and insomnia  and advanced a theory of hemispheric lateralization in brain function             
Influenced by Hinduism  Indian philosophy explored distinctions in types of awareness  A central idea of the Upanishads and other Vedic texts that formed the foundations of Hinduism was the distinction between a person s transient mundane self and their eternal  unchanging soul  Divergent Hindu doctrines and Buddhism have challenged this hierarchy of selves  but have all emphasized the importance of reaching higher awareness  Yoga encompasses a range of techniques used in pursuit of this goal  Theosophy  a religion established by Russian American philosopher Helena Blavatsky  drew inspiration from these doctrines during her time in British India                         
Psychology was of interest to Enlightenment thinkers in Europe  In Germany  Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz             applied his principles of calculus to the mind  arguing that mental activity took place on an indivisible continuum  He suggested that the difference between conscious and unconscious awareness is only a matter of degree  Christian Wolff identified psychology as its own science  writing Psychologia Empirica in      and Psychologia Rationalis in       Immanuel Kant advanced the idea of anthropology as a discipline  with psychology an important subdivision  Kant  however  explicitly rejected the idea of an experimental psychology  writing that  the empirical doctrine of the soul can also never approach chemistry even as a systematic art of analysis or experimental doctrine  for in it the manifold of inner observation can be separated only by mere division in thought  and cannot then be held separate and recombined at will  but still less does another thinking subject suffer himself to be experimented upon to suit our purpose   and even observation by itself already changes and displaces the state of the observed object  
In       Ferdinand Ueberwasser             designated himself Professor of Empirical Psychology and Logic and gave lectures on scientific psychology  though these developments were soon overshadowed by the Napoleonic Wars              At the end of the Napoleonic era  Prussian authorities discontinued the Old University of M nster              Having consulted philosophers Hegel and Herbart  however  in      the Prussian state established psychology as a mandatory discipline in its rapidly expanding and highly influential educational system  However  this discipline did not yet embrace experimentation              In England  early psychology involved phrenology and the response to social problems including alcoholism  violence  and the country s crowded  lunatic  asylums             

Beginning of experimental psychology
James McKeen Cattell  the first psychologist in the United States
Wilhelm Wundt  seated   a German psychologist  with colleagues in his psychological laboratory  the first of its kind  c            
One of the dogs used in Russian psychologist Ivan Pavlov s experiment with a surgically implanted cannula to measure saliva  preserved in the Pavlov Museum in Ryazan  Russia
Philosopher John Stuart Mill believed that the human mind was open to scientific investigation  even if the science is in some ways inexact              Mill proposed a  mental chemistry  in which elementary thoughts could combine into ideas of greater complexity              Gustav Fechner began conducting psychophysics research in Leipzig in the     s  He articulated the principle that human perception of a stimulus varies logarithmically according to its intensity                                   The principle became known as the Weber Fechner law  Fechner s      Elements of Psychophysics challenged Kant s negative view with regard to conducting quantitative research on the mind                          Fechner s achievement was to show that  mental processes could not only be given numerical magnitudes  but also that these could be measured by experimental methods               In Heidelberg  Hermann von Helmholtz conducted parallel research on sensory perception  and trained physiologist Wilhelm Wundt  Wundt  in turn  came to Leipzig University  where he established the psychological laboratory that brought experimental psychology to the world  Wundt focused on breaking down mental processes into the most basic components  motivated in part by an analogy to recent advances in chemistry  and its successful investigation of the elements and structure of materials              Paul Flechsig and Emil Kraepelin soon created another influential laboratory at Leipzig  a psychology related lab  that focused more on experimental psychiatry             
James McKeen Cattell  a professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University and the co founder of Psychological Review  was the first professor of psychology in the United States             
The German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus  a researcher at the University of Berlin  was a   th century contributor to the field  He pioneered the experimental study of memory and developed quantitative models of learning and forgetting              In the early   th century  Wolfgang Kohler  Max Wertheimer  and Kurt Koffka co founded the school of Gestalt psychology of Fritz Perls  The approach of Gestalt psychology is based upon the idea that individuals experience things as unified wholes  Rather than reducing thoughts and behavior into smaller component elements  as in structuralism  the Gestaltists maintain that whole of experience is important   and is something else than the sum of its parts  because summing is a meaningless procedure  whereas the whole part relationship is meaningful              
Psychologists in Germany  Denmark  Austria  England  and the United States soon followed Wundt in setting up laboratories              G  Stanley Hall  an American who studied with Wundt  founded a psychology lab that became internationally influential  The lab was located at Johns Hopkins University  Hall  in turn  trained Yujiro Motora  who brought experimental psychology  emphasizing psychophysics  to the Imperial University of Tokyo              Wundt s assistant  Hugo M nsterberg  taught psychology at Harvard to students such as Narendra Nath Sen Gupta who  in       founded a psychology department and laboratory at the University of Calcutta              Wundt s students Walter Dill Scott  Lightner Witmer  and James McKeen Cattell worked on developing tests of mental ability  Cattell  who also studied with eugenicist Francis Galton  went on to found the Psychological Corporation  Witmer focused on the mental testing of children  Scott  on employee selection                                  
Another student of Wundt  the Englishman Edward Titchener  created the psychology program at Cornell University and advanced  structuralist  psychology  The idea behind structuralism was to analyze and classify different aspects of the mind  primarily through the method of introspection              William James  John Dewey  and Harvey Carr advanced the idea of functionalism  an expansive approach to psychology that underlined the Darwinian idea of a behavior s usefulness to the individual  In       James wrote an influential book  The Principles of Psychology  which expanded on the structuralism  He memorably described  stream of consciousness   James s ideas interested many American students in the emerging discipline                                                               Dewey integrated psychology with societal concerns  most notably by promoting progressive education  inculcating moral values in children  and assimilating immigrants                                       
A different strain of experimentalism  with a greater connection to physiology  emerged in South America  under the leadership of Horacio G  Pi ero at the University of Buenos Aires              In Russia  too  researchers placed greater emphasis on the biological basis for psychology  beginning with Ivan Sechenov s      essay   Who Is to Develop Psychology and How   Sechenov advanced the idea of brain reflexes and aggressively promoted a deterministic view of human behavior              The Russian Soviet physiologist Ivan Pavlov discovered in dogs a learning process that was later termed  classical conditioning  and applied the process to human beings             

Consolidation and funding
One of the earliest psychology societies was La Soci t  de Psychologie Physiologique in France  which lasted from      to       The first meeting of the International Congress of Psychology sponsored by the International Union of Psychological Science took place in Paris  in August       amidst the World s Fair celebrating the centennial of the French Revolution  William James was one of three Americans among the     attendees  The American Psychological Association  APA  was founded soon after  in       The International Congress continued to be held at different locations in Europe and with wide international participation  The Sixth Congress  held in Geneva in       included presentations in Russian  Chinese  and Japanese  as well as Esperanto  After a hiatus for World War I  the Seventh Congress met in Oxford  with substantially greater participation from the war victorious Anglo Americans  In       the Congress took place at Yale University in New Haven  Connecticut  attended by hundreds of members of the APA              Tokyo Imperial University led the way in bringing new psychology to the East  New ideas about psychology diffused from Japan into China                         
American psychology gained status upon the U S  s entry into World War I  A standing committee headed by Robert Yerkes administered mental tests   Army Alpha  and  Army Beta   to almost     million soldiers              Subsequently  the Rockefeller family  via the Social Science Research Council  began to provide funding for behavioral research                          Rockefeller charities funded the National Committee on Mental Hygiene  which disseminated the concept of mental illness and lobbied for applying ideas from psychology to child rearing                          Through the Bureau of Social Hygiene and later funding of Alfred Kinsey  Rockefeller foundations helped establish research on sexuality in the U S              Under the influence of the Carnegie funded Eugenics Record Office  the Draper funded Pioneer Fund  and other institutions  the eugenics movement also influenced American psychology  In the     s and     s  eugenics became a standard topic in psychology classes              In contrast to the US  in the UK psychology was met with antagonism by the scientific and medical establishments  and up until       there were only six psychology chairs in universities in England             
During World War II and the Cold War  the U S  military and intelligence agencies established themselves as leading funders of psychology by way of the armed forces and in the new Office of Strategic Services intelligence agency  University of Michigan psychologist Dorwin Cartwright reported that university researchers began large scale propaganda research in            He observed that  the last few months of the war saw a social psychologist become chiefly responsible for determining the week by week propaganda policy for the United States Government   Cartwright also wrote that psychologists had significant roles in managing the domestic economy              The Army rolled out its new General Classification Test to assess the ability of millions of soldiers  The Army also engaged in large scale psychological research of troop morale and mental health              In the     s  the Rockefeller Foundation and Ford Foundation collaborated with the Central Intelligence Agency  CIA  to fund research on psychological warfare              In       public controversy called attention to the Army s Project Camelot  the  Manhattan Project  of social science  an effort which enlisted psychologists and anthropologists to analyze the plans and policies of foreign countries for strategic purposes                         
In Germany after World War I  psychology held institutional power through the military  which was subsequently expanded along with the rest of the military during Nazi Germany              Under the direction of Hermann G ring s cousin Matthias G ring  the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute was renamed the G ring Institute  Freudian psychoanalysts were expelled and persecuted under the anti Jewish policies of the Nazi Party  and all psychologists had to distance themselves from Freud and Adler  founders of psychoanalysis who were also Jewish              The G ring Institute was well financed throughout the war with a mandate to create a  New German Psychotherapy   This psychotherapy aimed to align suitable Germans with the overall goals of the Reich  As described by one physician   Despite the importance of analysis  spiritual guidance and the active cooperation of the patient represent the best way to overcome individual mental problems and to subordinate them to the requirements of the Volk and the Gemeinschaft   Psychologists were to provide Seelenf hrung  lit   soul guidance   the leadership of the mind  to integrate people into the new vision of a German community              Harald Schultz Hencke melded psychology with the Nazi theory of biology and racial origins  criticizing psychoanalysis as a study of the weak and deformed              Johannes Heinrich Schultz  a German psychologist recognized for developing the technique of autogenic training  prominently advocated sterilization and euthanasia of men considered genetically undesirable  and devised techniques for facilitating this process             
After the war  new institutions were created although some psychologists  because of their Nazi affiliation  were discredited  Alexander Mitscherlich founded a prominent applied psychoanalysis journal called Psyche  With funding from the Rockefeller Foundation  Mitscherlich established the first clinical psychosomatic medicine division at Heidelberg University  In       psychology was integrated into the required studies of medical students             
After the Russian Revolution  the Bolsheviks promoted psychology as a way to engineer the  New Man  of socialism  Consequently  university psychology departments trained large numbers of students in psychology  At the completion of training  positions were made available for those students at schools  workplaces  cultural institutions  and in the military  The Russian state emphasized pedology and the study of child development  Lev Vygotsky became prominent in the field of child development              The Bolsheviks also promoted free love and embraced the doctrine of psychoanalysis as an antidote to sexual repression                                                 Although pedology and intelligence testing fell out of favor in       psychology maintained its privileged position as an instrument of the Soviet Union              Stalinist purges took a heavy toll and instilled a climate of fear in the profession  as elsewhere in Soviet society                                   Following World War II  Jewish psychologists past and present  including Lev Vygotsky  A R  Luria  and Aron Zalkind  were denounced  Ivan Pavlov  posthumously  and Stalin himself were celebrated as heroes of Soviet psychology                                                 Soviet academics experienced a degree of liberalization during the Khrushchev Thaw  The topics of cybernetics  linguistics  and genetics became acceptable again  The new field of engineering psychology emerged  The field involved the study of the mental aspects of complex jobs  such as pilot and cosmonaut   Interdisciplinary studies became popular and scholars such as Georgy Shchedrovitsky developed systems theory approaches to human behavior                                     
Twentieth century Chinese psychology originally modeled itself on U S  psychology  with translations from American authors like William James  the establishment of university psychology departments and journals  and the establishment of groups including the Chinese Association of Psychological Testing        and the Chinese Psychological Society         Chinese psychologists were encouraged to focus on education and language learning  Chinese psychologists were drawn to the idea that education would enable modernization  John Dewey  who lectured to Chinese audiences between      and       had a significant influence on psychology in China  Chancellor T sai Yuan p ei introduced him at Peking University as a greater thinker than Confucius  Kuo Zing yang who received a PhD at the University of California  Berkeley  became President of Zhejiang University and popularized behaviorism                                    After the Chinese Communist Party gained control of the country  the Stalinist Soviet Union became the major influence  with Marxism Leninism the leading social doctrine and Pavlovian conditioning the approved means of behavior change  Chinese psychologists elaborated on Lenin s model of a  reflective  consciousness  envisioning an  active consciousness   pinyin      tzu chueh neng tung li  able to transcend material conditions through hard work and ideological struggle  They developed a concept of  recognition   pinyin      jen shih  which referred to the interface between individual perceptions and the socially accepted worldview  failure to correspond with party doctrine was  incorrect recognition                                      Psychology education was centralized under the Chinese Academy of Sciences  supervised by the State Council  In       the academy created a Psychology Research Office  which in      became the Institute of Psychology  Because most leading psychologists were educated in the United States  the first concern of the academy was the re education of these psychologists in the Soviet doctrines  Child psychology and pedagogy for the purpose of a nationally cohesive education remained a central goal of the discipline                                     

Women in psychology
         
Women in the early     s started to make key findings within the world of psychology  In       Anna Freud              the daughter of Sigmund Freud  built on her father s work using different defense mechanisms  denial  repression  and suppression  to psychoanalyze children  She believed that once a child reached the latency period  child analysis could be used as a mode of therapy  She stated it is important focus on the child s environment  support their development  and prevent neurosis  She believed a child should be recognized as their own person with their own right and have each session catered to the child s specific needs  She encouraged drawing  moving freely  and expressing themselves in any way  This helped build a strong therapeutic alliance with child patients  which allows psychologists to observe their normal behavior  She continued her research on the impact of children after family separation  children with socio economically disadvantaged backgrounds  and all stages of child development from infancy to adolescence             
Functional periodicity  the belief women are mentally and physically impaired during menstruation  impacted women s rights because employers were less likely to hire them due to the belief they would be incapable of working for   week a month  Leta Stetter Hollingworth wanted to prove this hypothesis and Edward L  Thorndike s theory  that women have lesser psychological and physical traits than men and were simply mediocre  incorrect  Hollingworth worked to prove differences were not from male genetic superiority  but from culture  She also included the concept of women s impairment during menstruation in her research  She recorded both women and men performances on tasks  cognitive  perceptual  and motor  for three months  No evidence was found of decreased performance due to a woman s menstrual cycle              She also challenged the belief intelligence is inherited and women here are intellectually inferior to men  She stated that women do not reach positions of power due to the societal norms and roles they are assigned  As she states in her article   Variability as related to sex differences in achievement  A Critique               the largest problem women have is the social order that was built due to the assumption women have less interests and abilities than men  To further prove her point  she completed another experiment with infants who have not been influenced by the environment of social norms  like the adult male getting more opportunities than women  She found no difference between infants besides size  After this research proved the original hypothesis wrong  Hollingworth was able to show there is no difference between the physiological and psychological traits of men and women  and women are not impaired during menstruation             
The first half of the     s was filled with new theories and it was a turning point for women s recognition within the field of psychology  In addition to the contributions made by Leta Stetter Hollingworth and Anna Freud  Mary Whiton Calkins invented the paired associates technique of studying memory and developed self psychology              Karen Horney developed the concept of  womb envy  and neurotic needs              Psychoanalyst Melanie Klein impacted developmental psychology with her research of play therapy              These great discoveries and contributions were made during struggles of sexism  discrimination  and little recognition for their work 

         
Women in the second half of the   th century continued to do research that had large scale impacts on the field of psychology  Mary Ainsworth s work centered around attachment theory  Building off fellow psychologist John Bowlby  Ainsworth spent years doing fieldwork to understand the development of mother infant relationships  In doing this field research  Ainsworth developed the Strange Situation Procedure  a laboratory procedure meant to study attachment style by separating and uniting a child with their mother several different times under different circumstances  These field studies are also where she developed her attachment theory and the order of attachment styles  which was a landmark for developmental psychology                          Because of her work  Ainsworth became one of the most cited psychologists of all time              Mamie Phipps Clark was another woman in psychology that changed the field with her research  She was one of the first African Americans to receive a doctoral degree in psychology from Columbia University  along with her husband  Kenneth Clark  Her master s thesis   The Development of Consciousness in Negro Pre School Children   argued that black children s self esteem was negatively impacted by racial discrimination  She and her husband conduced research building off her thesis throughout the     s  These tests  called the doll tests  asked young children to choose between identical dolls whose only difference was race  and they found that the majority of the children preferred the white dolls and attributed positive traits to them  Repeated over and over again  these tests helped to determine the negative effects of racial discrimination and segregation on black children s self image and development  In       this research would help decide the landmark Brown v  Board of Education decision  leading to the end of legal segregation across the nation  Clark went on to be an influential figure in psychology  her work continuing to focus on minority youth             
As the field of psychology developed throughout the latter half of the   th century  women in the field advocated for their voices to be heard and their perspectives to be valued  Second wave feminism did not miss psychology  An outspoken feminist in psychology was Naomi Weisstein  who was an accomplished researcher in psychology and neuroscience  and is perhaps best known for her paper   Kirche  Kuche  Kinder as Scientific Law  Psychology Constructs the Female   Psychology Constructs the Female criticized the field of psychology for centering men and using biology too much to explain gender differences without taking into account social factors              Her work set the stage for further research to be done in social psychology  especially in gender construction              Other women in the field also continued advocating for women in psychology  creating the Association for Women in Psychology to criticize how the field treated women  E  Kitsch Child  Phyllis Chesler  and Dorothy Riddle were some of the founding members of the organization in                              
The latter half of the   th century further diversified the field of psychology  with women of color reaching new milestones  In       Martha Bernal became the first Latina woman to get a Ph D  in psychology  In       Marigold Linton  the first Native American woman to get a Ph D  in psychology  founded the National Indian Education Association  She was also a founding member of the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science  In       The Network of Indian Psychologists was established by Carolyn Attneave  Harriet McAdoo was appointed to the White House Conference on Families in                  

  st century
In the   st century  women have gained greater prominence in psychology  contributing significantly to a wide range of subfields  Many have taken on leadership roles  directed influential research labs  and guided the next generation of psychologists  However  gender disparities remain  especially when it comes to equal pay and representation in senior academic positions              The number of women pursuing education and training in psychological science has reached a record high  In the United States  estimates suggest that women make up about     of undergraduate students and     of graduate students in psychology

In        douard Clapar de and Pierre Bovet created a new applied psychology organization called the International Congress of Psychotechnics Applied to Vocational Guidance  later called the International Congress of Psychotechnics and then the International Association of Applied Psychology              The IAAP is considered the oldest international psychology association              Today  at least    international groups deal with specialized aspects of psychology              In response to male predominance in the field  female psychologists in the U S  formed the National Council of Women Psychologists in       This organization became the International Council of Women Psychologists after World War II and the International Council of Psychologists in       Several associations including the Association of Black Psychologists and the Asian American Psychological Association have arisen to promote the inclusion of non European racial groups in the profession             
The International Union of Psychological Science  IUPsyS  is the world federation of national psychological societies  The IUPsyS was founded in      under the auspices of the United Nations Educational  Cultural and Scientific Organization  UNESCO                           Psychology departments have since proliferated around the world  based primarily on the Euro American model                          Since       the Union has published the International Journal of Psychology              IAAP and IUPsyS agreed in      each to hold a congress every four years  on a staggered basis             
IUPsyS recognizes    national psychology associations and at least    others exist              The American Psychological Association is the oldest and largest              Its membership has increased from       in      to         in the present day              The APA includes    divisions  which since      have steadily proliferated to include more specialties  Some of these divisions  such as the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues and the American Psychology Law Society  began as autonomous groups             
The Interamerican Psychological Society  founded in       aspires to promote psychology across the Western Hemisphere  It holds the Interamerican Congress of Psychology and had       members in year       The European Federation of Professional Psychology Associations  founded in       represents    national associations with a total of         individual members  At least    other international organizations represent psychologists in different regions             
In some places  governments legally regulate who can provide psychological services or represent themselves as a  psychologist               The APA defines a psychologist as someone with a doctoral degree in psychology             

Boundaries
Early practitioners of experimental psychology distinguished themselves from parapsychology  which in the late nineteenth century enjoyed popularity  including the interest of scholars such as William James   Some people considered parapsychology to be part of  psychology   Parapsychology  hypnotism  and psychism were major topics at the early International Congresses  But students of these fields were eventually ostracized  and more or less banished from the Congress in                        Parapsychology persisted for a time at Imperial University in Japan  with publications such as Clairvoyance and Thoughtography by Tomokichi Fukurai  but it was mostly shunned by                  
As a discipline  psychology has long sought to fend off accusations that it is a  soft  science  Philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn s      critique implied psychology overall was in a pre paradigm state  lacking agreement on the type of overarching theory found in mature hard sciences such as chemistry and physics              Because some areas of psychology rely on research methods such as self reports in surveys and questionnaires  critics asserted that psychology is not an objective science  Skeptics have suggested that personality  thinking  and emotion cannot be directly measured and are often inferred from subjective self reports  which may be problematic  Experimental psychologists have devised a variety of ways to indirectly measure these elusive phenomenological entities                                     
Divisions still exist within the field  with some psychologists more oriented towards the unique experiences of individual humans  which cannot be understood only as data points within a larger population  Critics inside and outside the field have argued that mainstream psychology has become increasingly dominated by a  cult of empiricism   which limits the scope of research because investigators restrict themselves to methods derived from the physical sciences                                     Feminist critiques have argued that claims to scientific objectivity obscure the values and agenda of  historically  mostly male researchers              Jean Grimshaw  for example  argues that mainstream psychological research has advanced a patriarchal agenda through its efforts to control behavior

Biological

Psychologists generally consider biology the substrate of thought and feeling  and therefore an important area of study  Behaviorial neuroscience  also known as biological psychology  involves the application of biological principles to the study of physiological and genetic mechanisms underlying behavior in humans and other animals  The allied field of comparative psychology is the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non human animals              A leading question in behavioral neuroscience has been whether and how mental functions are localized in the brain  From Phineas Gage to H M  and Clive Wearing  individual people with mental deficits traceable to physical brain damage have inspired new discoveries in this area              Modern behavioral neuroscience could be said to originate in the     s  when in France Paul Broca traced production of speech to the left frontal gyrus  thereby also demonstrating hemispheric lateralization of brain function  Soon after  Carl Wernicke identified a related area necessary for the understanding of speech                                    
The contemporary field of behavioral neuroscience focuses on the physical basis of behavior  Behaviorial neuroscientists use animal models  often relying on rats  to study the neural  genetic  and cellular mechanisms that underlie behaviors involved in learning  memory  and fear responses              Cognitive neuroscientists  by using neural imaging tools  investigate the neural correlates of psychological processes in humans  Neuropsychologists conduct psychological assessments to determine how an individual s behavior and cognition are related to the brain  The biopsychosocial model is a cross disciplinary  holistic model that concerns the ways in which interrelationships of biological  psychological  and socio environmental factors affect health and behavior             
Evolutionary psychology approaches thought and behavior from a modern evolutionary perspective  This perspective suggests that psychological adaptations evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments  Evolutionary psychologists attempt to find out how human psychological traits are evolved adaptations  the results of natural selection or sexual selection over the course of human evolution             
The history of the biological foundations of psychology includes evidence of racism  The idea of white supremacy and indeed the modern concept of race itself arose during the process of world conquest by Europeans              Carl von Linnaeus s four fold classification of humans classifies Europeans as intelligent and severe  Americans as contented and free  Asians as ritualistic  and Africans as lazy and capricious  Race was also used to justify the construction of socially specific mental disorders such as drapetomania and dysaesthesia aethiopica the behavior of uncooperative African slaves              After the creation of experimental psychology   ethnical psychology  emerged as a subdiscipline  based on the assumption that studying primitive races would provide an important link between animal behavior and the psychology of more evolved humans

A tenet of behavioral research is that a large part of both human and lower animal behavior is learned  A principle associated with behavioral research is that the mechanisms involved in learning apply to humans and non human animals  Behavioral researchers have developed a treatment known as behavior modification  which is used to help individuals replace undesirable behaviors with desirable ones 
Early behavioral researchers studied stimulus response pairings  now known as classical conditioning  They demonstrated that when a biologically potent stimulus  e g   food that elicits salivation  is paired with a previously neutral stimulus  e g   a bell  over several learning trials  the neutral stimulus by itself can come to elicit the response the biologically potent stimulus elicits  Ivan Pavlov known best for inducing dogs to salivate in the presence of a stimulus previously linked with food became a leading figure in the Soviet Union and inspired followers to use his methods on humans              In the United States  Edward Lee Thorndike initiated  connectionist  studies by trapping animals in  puzzle boxes  and rewarding them for escaping  Thorndike wrote in        There can be no moral warrant for studying man s nature unless the study will enable us to control his acts                                       From      to      the American Psychological Association went through a sea change of opinion  away from mentalism and towards  behavioralism   In       John B  Watson coined the term behaviorism for this school of thought                                       Watson s famous Little Albert experiment in      was at first thought to demonstrate that repeated use of upsetting loud noises could instill phobias  aversions to other stimuli  in an infant human                           although such a conclusion was likely an exaggeration               Karl Lashley  a close collaborator with Watson  examined biological manifestations of learning in the brain             
Clark L  Hull  Edwin Guthrie  and others did much to help behaviorism become a widely used paradigm              A new method of  instrumental  or  operant  conditioning added the concepts of reinforcement and punishment to the model of behavior change  Radical behaviorists avoided discussing the inner workings of the mind  especially the unconscious mind  which they considered impossible to assess scientifically               Operant conditioning was first described by Miller and Kanorski and popularized in the U S  by B F  Skinner  who emerged as a leading intellectual of the behaviorist movement                           
Noam Chomsky published an influential critique of radical behaviorism on the grounds that behaviorist principles could not adequately explain the complex mental process of language acquisition and language use                            The review  which was scathing  did much to reduce the status of behaviorism within psychology                                      Martin Seligman and his colleagues discovered that they could condition in dogs a state of  learned helplessness   which was not predicted by the behaviorist approach to psychology                            Edward C  Tolman advanced a hybrid  cognitive behavioral  model  most notably with his      publication discussing the cognitive maps used by rats to guess at the location of food at the end of a maze               Skinner s behaviorism did not die  in part because it generated successful practical applications              
The Association for Behavior Analysis International was founded in      and by      had members from    countries  The field has gained a foothold in Latin America and Japan               Applied behavior analysis is the term used for the application of the principles of operant conditioning to change socially significant behavior  it supersedes the term   behavior modification

Cognitive psychology involves the study of mental processes  including perception  attention  language comprehension and production  memory  and problem solving               Researchers in the field of cognitive psychology are sometimes called cognitivists  They rely on an information processing model of mental functioning  Cognitivist research is informed by functionalism and experimental psychology 
Starting in the     s  the experimental techniques developed by Wundt  James  Ebbinghaus  and others re emerged as experimental psychology became increasingly cognitivist and  eventually  constituted a part of the wider  interdisciplinary cognitive science                            Some called this development the cognitive revolution because it rejected the anti mentalist dogma of behaviorism as well as the strictures of psychoanalysis              
Albert Bandura helped along the transition in psychology from behaviorism to cognitive psychology  Bandura and other social learning theorists advanced the idea of vicarious learning  In other words  they advanced the view that a child can learn by observing the immediate social environment and not necessarily from having been reinforced for enacting a behavior  although they did not rule out the influence of reinforcement on learning a behavior              
Technological advances also renewed interest in mental states and mental representations  English neuroscientist Charles Sherrington and Canadian psychologist Donald O  Hebb used experimental methods to link psychological phenomena to the structure and function of the brain  The rise of computer science  cybernetics  and artificial intelligence underlined the value of comparing information processing in humans and machines 
A popular and representative topic in this area is cognitive bias  or irrational thought  Psychologists  and economists  have classified and described a sizeable catalog of biases which recur frequently in human thought  The availability heuristic  for example  is the tendency to overestimate the importance of something which happens to come readily to mind              
Elements of behaviorism and cognitive psychology were synthesized to form cognitive behavioral therapy  a form of psychotherapy modified from techniques developed by American psychologist Albert Ellis and American psychiatrist Aaron T  Beck 
On a broader level  cognitive science is an interdisciplinary enterprise involving cognitive psychologists  cognitive neuroscientists  linguists  and researchers in artificial intelligence  human computer interaction  and computational neuroscience  The discipline of cognitive science covers cognitive psychology as well as philosophy of mind  computer science  and neuroscience               Computer simulations are sometimes used to model phenomena of interest 

Social

Social psychology is concerned with how behaviors  thoughts  feelings  and the social environment influence human interactions               Social psychologists study such topics as the influence of others on an individual s behavior  e g  conformity  persuasion  and the formation of beliefs  attitudes  and stereotypes about other people  Social cognition fuses elements of social and cognitive psychology for the purpose of understanding how people process  remember  or distort social information  The study of group dynamics involves research on the nature of leadership  organizational communication  and related phenomena  In recent years  social psychologists have become interested in implicit measures  mediational models  and the interaction of person and social factors in accounting for behavior  Some concepts that sociologists have applied to the study of psychiatric disorders  concepts such as the social role  sick role  social class  life events  culture  migration  and total institution  have influenced social psychologists

Psychoanalysis is a collection of theories and therapeutic techniques intended to analyze the unconscious mind and its impact on everyday life  These theories and techniques inform treatments for mental disorders                                         Psychoanalysis originated in the     s  most prominently with the work of Sigmund Freud  Freud s psychoanalytic theory was largely based on interpretive methods  introspection  and clinical observation  It became very well known  largely because it tackled subjects such as sexuality  repression  and the unconscious                                     Freud pioneered the methods of free association and dream interpretation                           
Psychoanalytic theory is not monolithic  Other well known psychoanalytic thinkers who diverged from Freud include Alfred Adler  Carl Jung  Erik Erikson  Melanie Klein  D W  Winnicott  Karen Horney  Erich Fromm  John Bowlby  Freud s daughter Anna Freud  and Harry Stack Sullivan  These individuals ensured that psychoanalysis would evolve into diverse schools of thought  Among these schools are ego psychology  object relations  and interpersonal  Lacanian  and relational psychoanalysis 
Psychologists such as Hans Eysenck and philosophers including Karl Popper sharply criticized psychoanalysis  Popper argued that psychoanalysis was not falsifiable  no claim it made could be proven wrong  and therefore inherently not a scientific discipline               whereas Eysenck advanced the view that psychoanalytic tenets had been contradicted by experimental data  By the end of the   th century  psychology departments in American universities mostly had marginalized Freudian theory  dismissing it as a  desiccated and dead  historical artifact               Researchers such as Ant nio Dam sio  Oliver Sacks  and Joseph LeDoux  and individuals in the emerging field of neuro psychoanalysis have defended some of Freud s ideas on scientific grounds              

Existential humanistic
Main articles  Existential psychology and Humanistic psychology
Psychologist Abraham Maslow in      posited that humans have a hierarchy of needs  and it makes sense to fulfill the basic needs first before higher order needs can be met              
Humanistic psychology  which has been influenced by existentialism and phenomenology               stresses free will and self actualization               It emerged in the     s as a movement within academic psychology  in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis               The humanistic approach seeks to view the whole person  not just fragmented parts of the personality or isolated cognitions               Humanistic psychology also focuses on personal growth  self identity  death  aloneness  and freedom  It emphasizes subjective meaning  the rejection of determinism  and concern for positive growth rather than pathology  Some founders of the humanistic school of thought were American psychologists Abraham Maslow  who formulated a hierarchy of human needs  and Carl Rogers  who created and developed client centered therapy              
Later  positive psychology opened up humanistic themes to scientific study  Positive psychology is the study of factors which contribute to human happiness and well being  focusing more on people who are currently healthy  In       Clinical Psychological Review published a special issue devoted to positive psychological interventions  such as gratitude journaling and the physical expression of gratitude  It is  however  far from clear that positive psychology is effective in making people happier                            Positive psychological interventions have been limited in scope  but their effects are thought to be somewhat better than placebo effects 
The American Association for Humanistic Psychology  formed in       declared 

Humanistic psychology is primarily an orientation toward the whole of psychology rather than a distinct area or school  It stands for respect for the worth of persons  respect for differences of approach  open mindedness as to acceptable methods  and interest in exploration of new aspects of human behavior  As a  third force  in contemporary psychology  it is concerned with topics having little place in existing theories and systems  e g   love  creativity  self  growth  organism  basic need gratification  self actualization  higher values  being  becoming  spontaneity  play  humor  affection  naturalness  warmth  ego transcendence  objectivity  autonomy  responsibility  meaning  fair play  transcendental experience  peak experience  courage  and related concepts              
Existential psychology emphasizes the need to understand a client s total orientation towards the world  Existential psychology is opposed to reductionism  behaviorism  and other methods that objectify the individual               In the     s and     s  influenced by philosophers S ren Kierkegaard and Martin Heidegger  psychoanalytically trained American psychologist Rollo May helped to develop existential psychology  Existential psychotherapy  which follows from existential psychology  is a therapeutic approach that is based on the idea that a person s inner conflict arises from that individual s confrontation with the givens of existence  Swiss psychoanalyst Ludwig Binswanger and American psychologist George Kelly may also be said to belong to the existential school               Existential psychologists tend to differ from more  humanistic  psychologists in the former s relatively neutral view of human nature and relatively positive assessment of anxiety               Existential psychologists emphasized the humanistic themes of death  free will  and meaning  suggesting that meaning can be shaped by myths and narratives  meaning can be deepened by the acceptance of free will  which is requisite to living an authentic life  albeit often with anxiety with regard to death              
Austrian existential psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl drew evidence of meaning s therapeutic power from reflections upon his own internment               He created a variation of existential psychotherapy called logotherapy  a type of existentialist analysis that focuses on a will to meaning  in one s life   as opposed to Adler s Nietzschean doctrine of will to power or Freud s will to pleasure              

Themes
Personality
Main article  Personality psychology
Personality psychology is concerned with enduring patterns of behavior  thought  and emotion  Theories of personality vary across different psychological schools of thought  Each theory carries different assumptions about such features as the role of the unconscious and the importance of childhood experience  According to Freud  personality is based on the dynamic interactions of the id  ego  and super ego               By contrast  trait theorists have developed taxonomies of personality constructs in describing personality in terms of key traits  Trait theorists have often employed statistical data reduction methods  such as factor analysis  Although the number of proposed traits has varied widely  Hans Eysenck s early biologically based model suggests at least three major trait constructs are necessary to describe human personality  extraversion introversion  neuroticism stability  and psychoticism normality  Raymond Cattell empirically derived a theory of    personality factors at the primary factor level and up to eight broader second stratum factors                                                      Since the     s  the Big Five  openness to experience  conscientiousness  extraversion  agreeableness  and neuroticism  emerged as an important trait theory of personality               Dimensional models of personality disorders are receiving increasing support  and a version of dimensional assessment  namely the Alternative DSM   Model for Personality Disorders  has been included in the DSM    However  despite a plethora of research into the various versions of the  Big Five  personality dimensions  it appears necessary to move on from static conceptualizations of personality structure to a more dynamic orientation  acknowledging that personality constructs are subject to learning and change over the lifespan                           
An early example of personality assessment was the Woodworth Personal Data Sheet  constructed during World War I  The popular  although psychometrically inadequate  Myers Briggs Type Indicator              was developed to assess individuals   personality types  according to the personality theories of Carl Jung  The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory  MMPI   despite its name  is more a dimensional measure of psychopathology than a personality measure               California Psychological Inventory contains    personality scales  e g   independence  tolerance                The International Personality Item Pool  which is in the public domain  has become a source of scales that can be used personality assessment              

Unconscious mind
See also  Unconscious mind        Psychology
Study of the unconscious mind  a part of the psyche outside the individual s awareness but that is believed to influence conscious thought and behavior  was a hallmark of early psychology  In one of the first psychology experiments conducted in the United States  C S  Peirce and Joseph Jastrow found in      that research subjects could choose the minutely heavier of two weights even if consciously uncertain of the difference               Freud popularized the concept of the unconscious mind  particularly when he referred to an uncensored intrusion of unconscious thought into one s speech  a Freudian slip  or to his efforts to interpret dreams               His      book The Psychopathology of Everyday Life catalogs hundreds of everyday events that Freud explains in terms of unconscious influence  Pierre Janet advanced the idea of a subconscious mind  which could contain autonomous mental elements unavailable to the direct scrutiny of the subject              
The concept of unconscious processes has remained important in psychology  Cognitive psychologists have used a  filter  model of attention  According to the model  much information processing takes place below the threshold of consciousness  and only certain stimuli  limited by their nature and number  make their way through the filter  Much research has shown that subconscious priming of certain ideas can covertly influence thoughts and behavior               Because of the unreliability of self reporting  a major hurdle in this type of research involves demonstrating that a subject s conscious mind has not perceived a target stimulus  For this reason  some psychologists prefer to distinguish between implicit and explicit memory  In another approach  one can also describe a subliminal stimulus as meeting an objective but not a subjective threshold              
The automaticity model of John Bargh and others involves the ideas of automaticity and unconscious processing in our understanding of social behavior                            although there has been dispute with regard to replication                           
Some experimental data suggest that the brain begins to consider taking actions before the mind becomes aware of them               The influence of unconscious forces on people s choices bears on the philosophical question of free will  John Bargh  Daniel Wegner  and Ellen Langer describe free will as an illusion                                        

Motivation
Main article  Motivation
Some psychologists study motivation or the subject of why people or lower animals initiate a behavior at a particular time  It also involves the study of why humans and lower animals continue or terminate a behavior  Psychologists such as William James initially used the term motivation to refer to intention  in a sense similar to the concept of will in European philosophy  With the steady rise of Darwinian and Freudian thinking  instinct also came to be seen as a primary source of motivation               According to drive theory  the forces of instinct combine into a single source of energy which exerts a constant influence  Psychoanalysis  like biology  regarded these forces as demands originating in the nervous system  Psychoanalysts believed that these forces  especially the sexual instincts  could become entangled and transmuted within the psyche  Classical psychoanalysis conceives of a struggle between the pleasure principle and the reality principle  roughly corresponding to id and ego  Later  in Beyond the Pleasure Principle  Freud introduced the concept of the death drive  a compulsion towards aggression  destruction  and psychic repetition of traumatic events               Meanwhile  behaviorist researchers used simple dichotomous models  pleasure pain  reward punishment  and well established principles such as the idea that a thirsty creature will take pleasure in drinking                            Clark Hull formalized the latter idea with his drive reduction model              
Hunger  thirst  fear  sexual desire  and thermoregulation constitute fundamental motivations in animals               Humans seem to exhibit a more complex set of motivations though theoretically these could be explained as resulting from desires for belonging  positive self image  self consistency  truth  love  and control                           
Motivation can be modulated or manipulated in many different ways  Researchers have found that eating  for example  depends not only on the organism s fundamental need for homeostasis an important factor causing the experience of hunger but also on circadian rhythms  food availability  food palatability  and cost               Abstract motivations are also malleable  as evidenced by such phenomena as goal contagion  the adoption of goals  sometimes unconsciously  based on inferences about the goals of others               Vohs and Baumeister suggest that contrary to the need desire fulfillment cycle of animal instincts  human motivations sometimes obey a  getting begets wanting  rule  the more you get a reward such as self esteem  love  drugs  or money  the more you want it  They suggest that this principle can even apply to food  drink  sex  and sleep              

Development psychology
Main article  Developmental psychologyDevelopmental psychologists engage a child with a book and then make observations based on how the child interacts with the object 
Developmental psychology is the scientific study of how and why the thought processes  emotions  and behaviors of humans change over the course of their lives               Some credit Charles Darwin with conducting the first systematic study within the rubric of developmental psychology  having published in      a short paper detailing the development of innate forms of communication based on his observations of his infant son               The main origins of the discipline  however  are found in the work of Jean Piaget  Like Piaget  developmental psychologists originally focused primarily on the development of cognition from infancy to adolescence  Later  developmental psychology extended itself to the study cognition over the life span  In addition to studying cognition  developmental psychologists have also come to focus on affective  behavioral  moral  social  and neural development 
Developmental psychologists who study children use a number of research methods  For example  they make observations of children in natural settings such as preschools              and engage them in experimental tasks               Such tasks often resemble specially designed games and activities that are both enjoyable for the child and scientifically useful  Developmental researchers have even devised clever methods to study the mental processes of infants               In addition to studying children  developmental psychologists also study aging and processes throughout the life span  including old age               These psychologists draw on the full range of psychological theories to inform their research              

Genes and environment
Main article  Behavioural genetics
All researched psychological traits are influenced by both genes and environment  to varying degrees                            These two sources of influence are often confounded in observational research of individuals and families  An example of this confounding can be shown in the transmission of depression from a depressed mother to her offspring  A theory based on environmental transmission would hold that an offspring  by virtue of their having a problematic rearing environment managed by a depressed mother  is at risk for developing depression  On the other hand  a hereditarian theory would hold that depression risk in an offspring is influenced to some extent by genes passed to the child from the mother  Genes and environment in these simple transmission models are completely confounded  A depressed mother may both carry genes that contribute to depression in her offspring and also create a rearing environment that increases the risk of depression in her child              
Behavioral genetics researchers have employed methodologies that help to disentangle this confound and understand the nature and origins of individual differences in behavior              Traditionally the research has involved twin studies and adoption studies  two designs where genetic and environmental influences can be partially un confounded  More recently  gene focused research has contributed to understanding genetic contributions to the development of psychological traits 
The availability of microarray molecular genetic or genome sequencing technologies allows researchers to measure participant DNA variation directly  and test whether individual genetic variants within genes are associated with psychological traits and psychopathology through methods including genome wide association studies  One goal of such research is similar to that in positional cloning and its success in Huntington s  once a causal gene is discovered biological research can be conducted to understand how that gene influences the phenotype  One major result of genetic association studies is the general finding that psychological traits and psychopathology  as well as complex medical diseases  are highly polygenic                                                                   where a large number  on the order of hundreds to thousands  of genetic variants  each of small effect  contribute to individual differences in the behavioral trait or propensity to the disorder  Active research continues to work toward understanding the genetic and environmental bases of behavior and their interaction

Psychological testing
See also  Psychometrics and social statistics
Francis Galton  a pioneer of the experimental psychology field
Psychological testing has ancient origins  dating as far back as      BC  in the examinations for the Chinese civil service  Written exams began during the Han dynasty      BC   AD       By       the Chinese system required a stratified series of tests  involving essay writing and knowledge of diverse topics  The system was ended in                                           In Europe  mental assessment took a different approach  with theories of physiognomy judgment of character based on the face described by Aristotle in  th century BC Greece  Physiognomy remained current through the Enlightenment  and added the doctrine of phrenology  a study of mind and intelligence based on simple assessment of neuroanatomy                                     
When experimental psychology came to Britain  Francis Galton was a leading practitioner  By virtue of his procedures for measuring reaction time and sensation  he is considered an inventor of modern mental testing  also known as psychometrics                                       James McKeen Cattell  a student of Wundt and Galton  brought the idea of psychological testing to the United States  and in fact coined the term  mental test                                       In       Cattell s student Clark Wissler published discouraging results  suggesting that mental testing of Columbia and Barnard students failed to predict academic performance                                      In response to      orders from the Minister of Public Instruction  One example of an observational study was run by Arthur Bandura  This observational study focused on children who were exposed to an adult exhibiting aggressive behaviors and their reaction to toys versus other children who were not exposed to these stimuli  The result shows that children who had seen the adult acting aggressively towards a toy  in turn  were aggressive towards their own toy when put in a situation that frustrated them               psychologists Alfred Binet and Th odore Simon developed and elaborated a new test of intelligence in            They used a range of questions diverse in their nature and difficulty  Binet and Simon introduced the concept of mental age and referred to the lowest scorers on their test as idiots  Henry H  Goddard put the Binet Simon scale to work and introduced classifications of mental level such as imbecile and feebleminded  In        after Binet s death   Stanford professor Lewis M  Terman modified the Binet Simon scale  renamed the Stanford Binet scale  and introduced the intelligence quotient as a score report                                       Based on his test findings  and reflecting the racism common to that era  Terman concluded that intellectual disability  represents the level of intelligence which is very  very common among Spanish Indians and Mexican families of the Southwest and also among negroes  Their dullness seems to be racial               
Following the Army Alpha and Army Beta tests  which was developed by psychologist Robert Yerkes in      and then used in World War   by industrial and organizational psychologists for large scale employee testing and selection of military personnel               Mental testing also became popular in the U S   where it was applied to schoolchildren  The federally created National Intelligence Test was administered to   million children in the     s  In       the College Entrance Examination Board created the Scholastic Aptitude Test to standardize college admissions                                    The results of intelligence tests were used to argue for segregated schools and economic functions  including the preferential training of Black Americans for manual labor  These practices were criticized by Black intellectuals such a Horace Mann Bond and Allison Davis               Eugenicists used mental testing to justify and organize compulsory sterilization of individuals classified as mentally retarded  now referred to as intellectual disability               In the United States  tens of thousands of men and women were sterilized  Setting a precedent that has never been overturned  the U S  Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of this practice in the      case Buck v  Bell              
Today mental testing is a routine phenomenon for people of all ages in Western societies                                   Modern testing aspires to criteria including standardization of procedure  consistency of results  output of an interpretable score  statistical norms describing population outcomes  and  ideally  effective prediction of behavior and life outcomes outside of testing situations                                     Psychological testing is regularly used in forensic contexts to aid legal judgments and decisions               Developments in psychometrics include work on test and scale reliability and validity               Developments in item response theory               structural equation modeling               and bifactor analysis              have helped in strengthening test and scale construction 

Mental health care
See also  Clinical psychology
The provision of psychological health services is generally called clinical psychology in the U S  Sometimes  however  members of the school psychology and counseling psychology professions engage in practices that resemble that of clinical psychologists  Clinical psychologists typically include people who have graduated from doctoral programs in clinical psychology  In Canada  some of the members of the abovementioned groups usually fall within the larger category of professional psychology  In Canada and the U S   practitioners get bachelor s degrees and doctorates  doctoral students in clinical psychology usually spend one year in a predoctoral internship and one year in postdoctoral internship  In Mexico and most other Latin American and European countries  psychologists do not get bachelor s and doctoral degrees  instead  they take a three year professional course following high school              Clinical psychology is at present the largest specialization within psychology               It includes the study and application of psychology for the purpose of understanding  preventing  and relieving psychological distress  dysfunction  and or mental illness  Clinical psychologists also try to promote subjective well being and personal growth  Central to the practice of clinical psychology are psychological assessment and psychotherapy although clinical psychologists may also engage in research  teaching  consultation  forensic testimony  and program development and administration              
Credit for the first psychology clinic in the United States typically goes to Lightner Witmer  who established his practice in Philadelphia in       Another modern psychotherapist was Morton Prince  an early advocate for the establishment of psychology as a clinical and academic discipline               In the first part of the twentieth century  most mental health care in the United States was performed by psychiatrists  who are medical doctors  Psychology entered the field with its refinements of mental testing  which promised to improve the diagnosis of mental problems  For their part  some psychiatrists became interested in using psychoanalysis and other forms of psychodynamic psychotherapy to understand and treat the mentally ill                          
Psychotherapy as conducted by psychiatrists blurred the distinction between psychiatry and psychology  and this trend continued with the rise of community mental health facilities  Some in the clinical psychology community adopted behavioral therapy  a thoroughly non psychodynamic model that used behaviorist learning theory to change the actions of patients  A key aspect of behavior therapy is empirical evaluation of the treatment s effectiveness  In the     s  cognitive behavior therapy emerged with the work of Albert Ellis and Aaron Beck  Although there are similarities between behavior therapy and cognitive behavior therapy  cognitive behavior therapy required the application of cognitive constructs  Since the     s  the popularity of cognitive behavior therapy among clinical psychologists increased  A key practice in behavioral and cognitive behavioral therapy is exposing patients to things they fear  based on the premise that their responses  fear  panic  anxiety  can be deconditioned              
Mental health care today involves psychologists and social workers in increasing numbers  In       National Institute of Mental Health director Bertram Brown described this shift as a source of  intense competition and role confusion               Graduate programs issuing doctorates in clinical psychology emerged in the     s and underwent rapid increase through the     s  The PhD degree is intended to train practitioners who could also conduct scientific research  The PsyD degree is more exclusively designed to train practitioners             
Some clinical psychologists focus on the clinical management of patients with brain injury  This subspecialty is known as clinical neuropsychology  In many countries  clinical psychology is a regulated mental health profession  The emerging field of disaster psychology  see crisis intervention  involves professionals who respond to large scale traumatic events              
The work performed by clinical psychologists tends to be influenced by various therapeutic approaches  all of which involve a formal relationship between professional and client  usually an individual  couple  family  or small group   Typically  these approaches encourage new ways of thinking  feeling  or behaving  Four major theoretical perspectives are psychodynamic  cognitive behavioral  existential humanistic  and systems or family therapy  There has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches  especially with an increased understanding of issues regarding culture  gender  spirituality  and sexual orientation  With the advent of more robust research findings regarding psychotherapy  there is evidence that most of the major therapies have equal effectiveness  with the key common element being a strong therapeutic alliance                            Because of this  more training programs and psychologists are now adopting an eclectic therapeutic orientation                                                                  
Diagnosis in clinical psychology usually follows the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  DSM                The study of mental illnesses is called abnormal psychology 

Education
Main articles  Educational psychology and School psychology
An item from a cognitive abilities test used in educational psychology
Educational psychology is the study of how humans learn in educational settings  the effectiveness of educational interventions  the psychology of teaching  and the social psychology of schools as organizations  Educational psychologists can be found in preschools  schools of all levels including post secondary institutions  community organizations and learning centers  Government or private research firms  and independent or private consultant               The work of developmental psychologists such as Lev Vygotsky  Jean Piaget  and Jerome Bruner has been influential in creating teaching methods and educational practices  Educational psychology is often included in teacher education programs in places such as North America  Australia  and New Zealand 
School psychology combines principles from educational psychology and clinical psychology to understand and treat students with learning disabilities  to foster the intellectual growth of gifted students  to facilitate prosocial behaviors in adolescents  and otherwise to promote safe  supportive  and effective learning environments  School psychologists are trained in educational and behavioral assessment  intervention  prevention  and consultation  and many have extensive training in research              

Work
See also  Industrial and organizational psychology and Organizational behavior
Industrial and organizational  I O  psychology involves research and practices that apply psychological theories and principles to organizations and individuals  work lives               In the field s beginnings  industrialists brought the nascent field of psychology to bear on the study of scientific management techniques for improving workplace efficiency  The field was at first called economic psychology or business psychology  later  industrial psychology  employment psychology  or psychotechnology               An influential early study examined workers at Western Electric s Hawthorne plant in Cicero  Illinois from      to       Western Electric experimented on factory workers to assess their responses to changes in illumination  breaks  food  and wages  The researchers came to focus on workers  responses to observation itself  and the term Hawthorne effect is now used to describe the fact that people s behavior can change when they think they are being observed               Although the Hawthorne research can be found in psychology textbooks  the research and its findings were weak at best                           
The name industrial and organizational psychology emerged in the     s  In       it became enshrined in the name of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology  Division    of the American Psychological Association               One goal of the discipline is to optimize human potential in the workplace  Personnel psychology is a subfield of I O psychology  Personnel psychologists apply the methods and principles of psychology in selecting and evaluating workers  Another subfield  organizational psychology  examines the effects of work environments and management styles on worker motivation  job satisfaction  and productivity               Most I O psychologists work outside of academia  for private and public organizations and as consultants               A psychology consultant working in business today might expect to provide executives with information and ideas about their industry  their target markets  and the organization of their company                           
Organizational behavior  OB  is an allied field involved in the study of human behavior within organizations               One way to differentiate I O psychology from OB is that I O psychologists train in university psychology departments and OB specialists  in business schools 

Military and intelligence
One role for psychologists in the military has been to evaluate and counsel soldiers and other personnel  In the U S   this function began during World War I  when Robert Yerkes established the School of Military Psychology at Fort Oglethorpe in Georgia  The school provided psychological training for military staff                           Today  U S  Army psychologists perform psychological screening  clinical psychotherapy  suicide prevention  and treatment for post traumatic stress  as well as provide prevention related services  for example  smoking cessation               The United States Army s Mental Health Advisory Teams implement psychological interventions to help combat troops experiencing mental problems                           
Psychologists may also work on a diverse set of campaigns known broadly as psychological warfare  Psychological warfare chiefly involves the use of propaganda to influence enemy soldiers and civilians  This so called black propaganda is designed to seem as if it originates from a source other than the Army               The CIA s MKULTRA program involved more individualized efforts at mind control  involving techniques such as hypnosis  torture  and covert involuntary administration of LSD               The U S  military used the name Psychological Operations  PSYOP  until       when these activities were reclassified as Military Information Support Operations  MISO   part of Information Operations  IO                Psychologists have sometimes been involved in assisting the interrogation and torture of suspects  staining the records of the psychologists involved              

Health  well being  and social change
See also  Health psychology  Social issues  and Occupational health psychology
Social change
An example of the contribution of psychologists to social change involves the research of Kenneth and Mamie Phipps Clark  These two African American psychologists studied segregation s adverse psychological impact on Black children  Their research findings played a role in the desegregation case Brown v  Board of Education                     
The impact of psychology on social change includes the discipline s broad influence on teaching and learning  Research has shown that compared to the  whole word  or  whole language  approach  the phonics approach to reading instruction is more efficacious              

Medical applications
Medical facilities increasingly employ psychologists to perform various roles  One aspect of health psychology is the psychoeducation of patients  instructing them in how to follow a medical regimen  Health psychologists can also educate doctors and conduct research on patient compliance                            Psychologists in the field of public health use a wide variety of interventions to influence human behavior  These range from public relations campaigns and outreach to governmental laws and policies  Psychologists study the composite influence of all these different tools in an effort to influence whole populations of people              

Worker health  safety and wellbeing
Psychologists work with organizations to apply findings from psychological research to improve the health and well being of employees  Some work as external consultants hired by organizations to solve specific problems  whereas others are full time employees of the organization  Applications include conducting surveys to identify issues and designing interventions to make work healthier  Some of the specific health areas include 

Accidents and injuries  A major contribution is the concept of safety climate  which is employee shared perceptions of the behaviors that are encouraged  e g   wearing safety gear  and discouraged  not following safety rules  at work               Organizations with strong safety climates have fewer work accidents and injuries              
Cardiovascular disease  Cardiovascular disease has been related to lack of job control              
Mental health  Exposure to occupational stress is associated with mental health disorder              
Musculoskeletal disorder  These are injuries in bones  nerves and tendons due to overexertion and repetitive strain  They have been linked to job satisfaction and workplace stress              
Physical health symptoms  Occupational stress has been linked to physical symptoms such as digestive distress and headache              
Workplace violence  Violence prevention climate is related to being physically assaulted and psychologically mistreated at work              
Interventions that improve climates are a way to address accidents and violence  Interventions that reduce stress at work or provide employees with tools to better manage it can help in areas where stress is an important component 
Industrial psychology became interested in worker fatigue during World War I  when government ministers in Britain were concerned about the impact of fatigue on workers in munitions factories but not other types of factories                            In the U  K  some interest in worker well being emerged with the efforts of Charles Samuel Myers and his National Institute of Industrial Psychology  NIIP  during the inter War years               In the U  S  during the mid twentieth century industrial psychologist Arthur Kornhauser pioneered the study of occupational mental health  linking industrial working conditions to mental health as well as the spillover of an unsatisfying job into a worker s personal life                            Zickar accumulated evidence to show that  no other industrial psychologist of his era was as devoted to advocating management and labor practices that would improve the lives of working people               

Occupational health psychology
As interest in the worker health expanded toward the end of the twentieth century  the field of occupational health psychology  OHP  emerged  OHP is a branch of psychology that is interdisciplinary                           OHP is concerned with the health and safety of workers                           OHP addresses topic areas such as the impact of occupational stressors on physical and mental health  mistreatment of workers  e g   bullying and violence   work family balance  the impact of involuntary unemployment on physical and mental health  the influence of psychosocial factors on safety and accidents  and interventions designed to improve protect worker health                           OHP grew out of health psychology  industrial and organizational psychology  and occupational medicine               OHP has also been informed by disciplines outside psychology  including industrial engineering  sociology  and economics                           

Research methods
Main articles  Psychological research and List of psychological research methods
Quantitative psychological research lends itself to the statistical testing of hypotheses  Although the field makes abundant use of randomized and controlled experiments in laboratory settings  such research can only assess a limited range of short term phenomena  Some psychologists rely on less rigorously controlled  but more ecologically valid  field experiments as well  Other research psychologists rely on statistical methods to glean knowledge from population data               The statistical methods research psychologists employ include the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient  the analysis of variance  multiple linear regression  logistic regression  structural equation modeling  and hierarchical linear modeling  The measurement and operationalization of important constructs is an essential part of these research designs 
Although this type of psychological research is much less abundant than quantitative research  some psychologists conduct qualitative research  This type of research can involve interviews  questionnaires  and first hand observation               While hypothesis testing is rare  virtually impossible  in qualitative research  qualitative studies can be helpful in theory and hypothesis generation  interpreting seemingly contradictory quantitative findings  and understanding why some interventions fail and others succeed              

Controlled experiments
Main article  Experiment
Flowchart of the four phases  enrollment  intervention allocation  follow up  and data analysis  of a parallel randomized trial of two groups modified from the CONSORT      Statement             
The experimenter  E  orders the teacher  T   the subject of the experiment  to give what the latter believes are painful electric shocks to a learner  L   who is actually an actor and confederate  The subject believes that for each wrong answer  the learner was receiving actual electric shocks  though in reality there were no such punishments  Being separated from the subject  the confederate set up a tape recorder integrated with the electro shock generator  which played pre recorded sounds for each shock level etc              
A true experiment with random assignment of research participants  sometimes called subjects  to rival conditions allows researchers to make strong inferences about causal relationships  When there are large numbers of research participants  the random assignment  also called random allocation  of those participants to rival conditions ensures that the individuals in those conditions will  on average  be similar on most characteristics  including characteristics that went unmeasured  In an experiment  the researcher alters one or more variables of influence  called independent variables  and measures resulting changes in the factors of interest  called dependent variables  Prototypical experimental research is conducted in a laboratory with a carefully controlled environment 
A quasi experiment is a situation in which different conditions are being studied  but random assignment to the different conditions is not possible  Investigators must work with preexisting groups of people  Researchers can use common sense to consider how much the nonrandom assignment threatens the study s validity               For example  in research on the best way to affect reading achievement in the first three grades of school  school administrators may not permit educational psychologists to randomly assign children to phonics and whole language classrooms  in which case the psychologists must work with preexisting classroom assignments  Psychologists will compare the achievement of children attending phonics and whole language classes and  perhaps  statistically adjust for any initial differences in reading level 
Experimental researchers typically use a statistical hypothesis testing model which involves making predictions before conducting the experiment  then assessing how well the data collected are consistent with the predictions  These predictions are likely to originate from one or more abstract scientific hypotheses about how the phenomenon under study actually works              

Other types of studies
Further information  Video recall
Surveys are used in psychology for the purpose of measuring attitudes and traits  monitoring changes in mood  and checking the validity of experimental manipulations  checking research participants  perception of the condition they were assigned to   Psychologists have commonly used paper and pencil surveys  However  surveys are also conducted over the phone or through e mail  Web based surveys are increasingly used to conveniently reach many subjects 
Observational studies are commonly conducted in psychology  In cross sectional observational studies  psychologists collect data at a single point in time  The goal of many cross sectional studies is the assess the extent factors are correlated with each other  By contrast  in longitudinal studies psychologists collect data on the same sample at two or more points in time  Sometimes the purpose of longitudinal research is to study trends across time such as the stability of traits or age related changes in behavior  Because some studies involve endpoints that psychologists cannot ethically study from an experimental standpoint  such as identifying the causes of depression  they conduct longitudinal studies a large group of depression free people  periodically assessing what is happening in the individuals  lives  In this way psychologists have an opportunity to test causal hypotheses regarding conditions that commonly arise in people s lives that put them at risk for depression  Problems that affect longitudinal studies include selective attrition  the type of problem in which bias is introduced when a certain type of research participant disproportionately leaves a study 
One example of an observational study was run by Arthur Bandura  This observational study focused on children who were exposed to an adult exhibiting aggressive behaviors and their reaction to toys versus other children who were not exposed to these stimuli  The result shows that children who had seen the adult acting aggressively towards a toy  in turn  were aggressive towards their own toy when put in a situation that frustrated them              
Exploratory data analysis includes a variety of practices that researchers use to reduce a great many variables to a small number overarching factors  In Peirce s three modes of inference  exploratory data analysis corresponds to abduction               Meta analysis is the technique research psychologists use to integrate results from many studies of the same variables and arriving at a grand average of the findings              

Direct brain observation manipulation
An EEG recording setup
Artificial neural network with two layers  an interconnected group of nodes  akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain
A classic and popular tool used to relate mental and neural activity is the electroencephalogram  EEG   a technique using amplified electrodes on a person s scalp to measure voltage changes in different parts of the brain  Hans Berger  the first researcher to use EEG on an unopened skull  quickly found that brains exhibit signature  brain waves   electric oscillations which correspond to different states of consciousness  Researchers subsequently refined statistical methods for synthesizing the electrode data  and identified unique brain wave patterns such as the delta wave observed during non REM sleep              
Newer functional neuroimaging techniques include functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography  both of which track the flow of blood through the brain  These technologies provide more localized information about activity in the brain and create representations of the brain with widespread appeal  They also provide insight which avoids the classic problems of subjective self reporting  It remains challenging to draw hard conclusions about where in the brain specific thoughts originate or even how usefully such localization corresponds with reality  However  neuroimaging has delivered unmistakable results showing the existence of correlations between mind and brain  Some of these draw on a systemic neural network model rather than a localized function model                                        
Interventions such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and drugs also provide information about brain mind interactions  Psychopharmacology is the study of drug induced mental effects 

Computer simulation
See also  Computational cognition  Graph theory  and Network theory
Computational modeling is a tool used in mathematical psychology and cognitive psychology to simulate behavior               This method has several advantages  Since modern computers process information quickly  simulations can be run in a short time  allowing for high statistical power  Modeling also allows psychologists to visualize hypotheses about the functional organization of mental events that could not be directly observed in a human  Computational neuroscience uses mathematical models to simulate the brain  Another method is symbolic modeling  which represents many mental objects using variables and rules  Other types of modeling include dynamic systems and stochastic modeling 

Animal studies

Animal experiments aid in investigating many aspects of human psychology  including perception  emotion  learning  memory  and thought  to name a few  In the     s  Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to demonstrate classical conditioning  Non human primates  cats  dogs  pigeons  and rats and other rodents are often used in psychological experiments  Ideally  controlled experiments introduce only one independent variable at a time  in order to ascertain its unique effects upon dependent variables  These conditions are approximated best in laboratory settings  In contrast  human environments and genetic backgrounds vary so widely  and depend upon so many factors  that it is difficult to control important variables for human subjects  There are pitfalls  however  in generalizing findings from animal studies to humans through animal models              
Comparative psychology is the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non human animals  especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history  adaptive significance  and development of behavior  Research in this area explores the behavior of many species  from insects to primates  It is closely related to other disciplines that study animal behavior such as ethology               Research in comparative psychology sometimes appears to shed light on human behavior  but some attempts to connect the two have been quite controversial  for example the Sociobiology of E O  Wilson               Animal models are often used to study neural processes related to human behavior  e g  in cognitive neuroscience 

Qualitative research
Phineas P  Gage survived an accident in which a large iron rod was driven completely through his head  destroying much of his brain s left frontal lobe  but the injury altered his personality and behavior              
Qualitative research is often designed to answer questions about the thoughts  feelings  and behaviors of individuals  Qualitative research involving first hand observation can help describe events as they occur  with the goal of capturing the richness of everyday behavior and with the hope of discovering and understanding phenomena that might have been missed if only more cursory examinations are made 
Qualitative psychological research methods include interviews  first hand observation  and participant observation  Creswell        identified five main possibilities for qualitative research  including narrative  phenomenology  ethnography  case study  and grounded theory  Qualitative researchers              sometimes aim to enrich our understanding of symbols  subjective experiences  or social structures  Sometimes hermeneutic and critical aims can give rise to quantitative research  as in Erich Fromm s application of psychological and sociological theories  in his book Escape from Freedom  to understanding why many ordinary Germans supported Hitler              
Just as Jane Goodall studied chimpanzee social and family life by careful observation of chimpanzee behavior in the field  psychologists conduct naturalistic observation of ongoing human social  professional  and family life  Sometimes the participants are aware they are being observed  and other times the participants do not know they are being observed  Strict ethical guidelines must be followed when covert observation is being carried out 

Program evaluation
Program evaluation involves the systematic collection  analysis  and application of information to answer questions about projects  policies and programs  particularly about their effectiveness                            In both the public and private sectors  stakeholders often want to know the extent which the programs they are funding  implementing  voting for  receiving  or objecting to are producing the intended effects  While program evaluation first focuses on effectiveness  important considerations often include how much the program costs per participant  how the program could be improved  whether the program is worthwhile  whether there are better alternatives  if there are unintended outcomes  and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful

Metascience involves the application of scientific methodology to study science itself  The field of metascience has revealed problems in psychological research  Some psychological research has suffered from bias               problematic reproducibility               and misuse of statistics               These findings have led to calls for reform from within and from outside the scientific community              

Confirmation bias
In       statistician Theodore Sterling examined the results of psychological studies and discovered that     of them supported their initial hypotheses  implying possible publication bias                                         Similarly  Fanelli                     found that       of psychiatry psychology studies confirmed the effects they were looking for  and concluded that the odds of this happening  a positive result  was around five times higher than in fields such as space science or geosciences  Fanelli argued that this is because researchers in  softer  sciences have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases 

Replication
Further information  Replication crisis        In psychology
A replication crisis in psychology has emerged  Many notable findings in the field have not been replicated  Some researchers were even accused of publishing fraudulent results                                         Systematic efforts  including efforts by the Reproducibility Project of the Center for Open Science  to assess the extent of the problem found that as many as two thirds of highly publicized findings in psychology failed to be replicated               Reproducibility has generally been stronger in cognitive psychology  in studies and journals  than social psychology              and subfields of differential psychology                            Other subfields of psychology have also been implicated in the replication crisis  including clinical psychology                                         developmental psychology                                         and a field closely related to psychology  educational research                                                                  
Focus on the replication crisis has led to other renewed efforts in the discipline to re test important findings                            In response to concerns about publication bias and data dredging  conducting a large number of statistical tests on a great many variables but restricting reporting to the results that were statistically significant       psychology and medical journals have adopted result blind peer review where studies are accepted not on the basis of their findings and after the studies are completed  but before the studies are conducted and upon the basis of the methodological rigor of their experimental designs and the theoretical justifications for their proposed statistical analysis before data collection or analysis is conducted                            In addition  large scale collaborations among researchers working in multiple labs in different countries have taken place  The collaborators regularly make their data openly available for different researchers to assess               Allen and Mehler              estimated that    per cent of result blind studies have yielded null results  in contrast to an estimated   to    per cent in traditional research 

Misuse of statistics
Further information  Misuse of statistics and Misuse of p values
Some critics view statistical hypothesis testing as misplaced  Psychologist and statistician Jacob Cohen wrote in      that psychologists routinely confuse statistical significance with practical importance  enthusiastically reporting great certainty in unimportant facts               Some psychologists have responded with an increased use of effect size statistics  rather than sole reliance on p values              

WEIRD bias
 WEIRD  redirects here  For other uses  see Weird  disambiguation  
See also  Cultural psychology  Indigenous psychology  Transnational psychology  and Cross cultural psychology
In       Arnett pointed out that most articles in American Psychological Association journals were about U S  populations when U S  citizens are only    of the world s population  He complained that psychologists had no basis for assuming psychological processes to be universal and generalizing research findings to the rest of the global population               In       Henrich  Heine  and Norenzayan reported a bias in conducting psychology studies with participants from  WEIRD    Western  Educated  Industrialized  Rich  and Democratic   societies                            Henrich et al  found that      of psychological samples come from countries with only     of the world s population   p            The article gave examples of results that differ significantly between people from WEIRD and tribal cultures  including the M ller Lyer illusion  Arnett         Altmaier and Hall        and Morgan Consoli et al         view the Western bias in research and theory as a serious problem considering psychologists are increasingly applying psychological principles developed in WEIRD regions in their research  clinical work  and consultation with populations around the world                                         In       Rad  Martingano  and Ginges showed that nearly a decade after Henrich et al  s paper  over     of the samples used in studies published in the journal Psychological Science employed WEIRD samples  Moreover  their analysis showed that several studies did not fully disclose the origin of their samples  the authors offered a set of recommendations to editors and reviewers to reduce WEIRD bias              

STRANGE bias
Similar to the WEIRD bias  starting in       researchers of non human behavior have started to emphasize the need to document the possibility of the STRANGE  Social background  Trappability and self selection  Rearing history  Acclimation and habituation  Natural changes in responsiveness  Genetic makeup  and Experience  bias in study conclusions              

Unscientific mental health training
Some observers perceive a gap between scientific theory and its application in particular  the application of unsupported or unsound clinical practices               Critics say there has been an increase in the number of mental health training programs that do not instill scientific competence               Practices such as  facilitated communication for infantile autism   memory recovery techniques including body work  and other therapies  such as rebirthing and reparenting  may be dubious or even dangerous  despite their popularity               These practices  however  are outside the mainstream practices taught in clinical psychology doctoral programs 

Ethics
Ethical standards in the discipline have changed over time  Some famous past studies are today considered unethical and in violation of established codes  e g   the Canadian Code of Conduct for Research Involving Humans  and the Belmont Report   The American Psychological Association has advanced a set of ethical principles and a code of conduct for the profession              
The most important contemporary standards include informed and voluntary consent  After World War II  the Nuremberg Code was established because of Nazi abuses of experimental subjects  Later  most countries  and scientific journals  adopted the Declaration of Helsinki  In the U S   the National Institutes of Health established the Institutional Review Board in       and in      adopted the National Research Act  HR        All of these measures encouraged researchers to obtain informed consent from human participants in experimental studies  A number of influential but ethically dubious studies led to the establishment of this rule  such studies included the MIT Harvard Fernald School radioisotope studies  the Thalidomide tragedy  the Willowbrook hepatitis study  Stanley Milgram s studies of obedience to authority  and the Stanford Prison Experiment 

Ethics with Humans
The ethics code of the American Psychological Association originated in      as  Ethical Standards of Psychologists   This code has guided the formation of licensing laws in most American states  It has changed multiple times over the decades since its adoption  and contains both aspirational principles and binding ethical standards  
The APA s Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct consists of five General Principles  which are meant to guide psychologists to higher ethical practice where a particular standard does not apply  Those principles are 
A  Beneficence and Nonmaleficence   meaning the psychologists must work to benefit those they work with and  do no harm   This includes awareness of indirect benefits and harms their work might have on others due to personal  social  political  or other factors  
B  Fidelity and Responsibility   an awareness of public trust in the profession and adherence to ethical standards and clarification of roles to preserve that trust  This includes managing conflicts of interest  as well as committing some portion of a psychologist s professional time to low cost or pro bono work  
C  Integrity   upholding honesty and accuracy in all psychological practices  including avoiding misrepresentations and fraud  In situations where psychologists would use deception  i e   certain research   psychologists must consider the necessity  benefits  and harms  and mitigate any harms where possible  
D  Justice   an understanding that psychology must be for everyone s benefit  and that psychologists take special care to avoid unjust practices as a result of biases or limitations of expertise  
E  Respect for People s Rights and Dignity   the preservation of people s rights when working with psychologists  including confidentially  privacy  and autonomy  Psychologists should consider a multitude of factors  including a need for special safeguards for protected populations  e g   minors  incarcerated individuals  and awareness of differences based on numerous factors  including culture  race  age  gender  and socioeconomic status  
In       the APA revised its policies on advertising and referral fees to negotiate the end of an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission  The      incarnation was the first to distinguish between  aspirational  ethical standards and  enforceable  ones  The APA code was further revised in      to prevent the use of the code to justify violating human rights  which was in response to the participation of APA members in interrogations under the administration of United States President George W  Bush               Members of the public have a five year window to file ethics complaints about APA members with the APA ethics committee  members of the APA have a three year window              
The Canadian Psychological Association used the APA code until       when it developed its own code drawing from four similar principles     Respect for the Dignity of Persons and Peoples     Responsible Caring     Integrity in Relationships     Responsibility to Society                            The European Federation of Psychologist s Associations  have adopted a model code using the principles of the Canadian Code  while also drawing from the APA code                           
Universities have ethics committees dedicated to protecting the rights  e g   voluntary nature of participation in the research  privacy  and well being  e g   minimizing distress  of research participants  University ethics committees evaluate proposed research to ensure that researchers protect the rights and well being of participants  an investigator s research project cannot be conducted unless approved by such an ethics committee              
The field of psychology also identifies certain categories of people that require additional or special protection due to particular vulnerabilities  unequal power dynamics  or diminished capacity for informed consent  This list often includes  but is not limited to  children  incarcerated individuals  pregnant women  human fetuses and neonates  institutionalized persons  those with physical or mental disabilities  and the educationally or economically disadvantaged               
Some of the ethical issues considered most important are the requirement to practice only within the area of competence  to maintain confidentiality with the patients  and to avoid sexual relations with them  Another important principle is informed consent  the idea that a patient or research subject must understand and freely choose a procedure they are undergoing               Some of the most common complaints against clinical psychologists include sexual misconduct              and breaches in confidentiality or privacy              
Psychology ethics apply to all types of human contact in a psychologist s professional capacity  including therapy  assessment  teaching  training  work with research subjects  testimony in courts and before government bodies  consulting  and statements to the public or media pertaining to matters of psychology              

Ethics with other animals
Research on other animals is governed by university ethics committees  Research on nonhuman animals cannot proceed without permission of the ethics committee  of the researcher s home institution  Ethical guidelines state that using non human animals for scientific purposes is only acceptable when the harm  physical or psychological  done to animals is outweighed by the benefits of the research               Psychologists can use certain research techniques on animals that could not be used on humans 
Comparative psychologist Harry Harlow drew moral condemnation for isolation experiments on rhesus macaque monkeys at the University of Wisconsin Madison in the     s               The aim of the research was to produce an animal model of clinical depression  Harlow also devised what he called a  rape rack   to which the female isolates were tied in normal monkey mating posture               In       American literary critic Wayne C  Booth wrote that   Harry Harlow and his colleagues go on torturing their nonhuman primates decade after decade  invariably proving what we all knew in advance that social creatures can be destroyed by destroying their social ties   He writes that Harlow made no mention of the criticism of the morality of his work              
Animal research is influential in psychology  while still being debated among academics  The testing of animals for research has led to medical breakthroughs in human medicine  Many psychologists argue animal experimentation is essential for human advancement  but must be regulated by the government to ensure ethicality
