Algorithm that selects actions for intelligent agents
In artificial intelligence  a behavior selection algorithm             or action selection algorithm  is an algorithm that selects appropriate behaviors or actions for one or more intelligent agents  In game artificial intelligence  it selects behaviors or actions for one or more non player characters  Common behavior selection algorithms include 

Finite state machines
Hierarchical finite state machines
Decision trees
Behavior trees
Hierarchical task networks
Hierarchical control systems
Utility systems
Dialogue tree  for selecting what to say

In application programming  run time selection of the behavior of a specific method is referred to as the strategy design pattern
