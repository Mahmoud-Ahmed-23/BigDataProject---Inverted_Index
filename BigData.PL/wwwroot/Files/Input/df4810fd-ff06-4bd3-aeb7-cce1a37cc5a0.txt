A weapon of mass destruction  WMD  is a biological  chemical  radiological  nuclear  or any other weapon that can kill or significantly harm many people or cause great damage to artificial structures  e g   buildings   natural structures  e g   mountains   or the biosphere  The scope and usage of the term has evolved and been disputed  often signifying more politically than technically  Originally coined in reference to aerial bombing with chemical explosives during World War II  it has later come to refer to large scale weaponry of warfare related technologies  such as biological  chemical  radiological  or nuclear warfare 

On July           at Bikini Atoll  the   megaton yield thermonuclear weapon Redwing Tewa was detonated            

Early uses of this term edit 
The first use of the term  weapon of mass destruction  on record is by Cosmo Gordon Lang  Archbishop of Canterbury  in      in reference to the bombing of Guernica  Spain            

Who can think at this present time without a sickening of the heart of the appalling slaughter  the suffering  the manifold misery brought by war to Spain and to China  Who can think without horror of what another widespread war would mean  waged as it would be with all the new weapons of mass destruction            
At the time  nuclear weapons had not been developed fully  Japan conducted research on biological weapons  see Unit                  and chemical weapons had seen wide battlefield use in World War I  Their use was outlawed by the Geneva Protocol of                  Italy used mustard agent against civilians and soldiers in Ethiopia in                    
Following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that ended World War II and during the Cold War  the term came to refer more to non conventional weapons  The application of the term to specifically nuclear and radiological weapons is traced by William Safire to the Russian phrase                                oruzhiye massovogo porazheniya  weapon of mass destruction             
William Safire credits James Goodby  of the Brookings Institution  with tracing what he considers the earliest known English language use soon after the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki  although it is not quite verbatim   a communique from a    November       meeting of Harry Truman  Clement Attlee and Mackenzie King  probably drafted by Vannevar Bush  as Bush claimed in       referred to  weapons adaptable to mass destruction             
Safire says Bernard Baruch used that exact phrase in       in a speech at the United Nations probably written by Herbert Bayard Swope              The phrase found its way into the very first resolution the United Nations General assembly adopted in January      in London  which used the wording  the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other weapons adaptable to mass destruction              The resolution also created the Atomic Energy Commission  predecessor of the International Atomic Energy Agency  IAEA              
An exact use of this term was given in a lecture titled  Atomic Energy as a Contemporary Problem  by J  Robert Oppenheimer  He delivered the lecture to the Foreign Service and the State Department  on    September                  

It is a very far reaching control which would eliminate the rivalry between nations in this field  which would prevent the surreptitious arming of one nation against another  which would provide some cushion of time before atomic attack  and presumably therefore before any attack with weapons of mass destruction  and which would go a long way toward removing atomic energy at least as a source of conflict between the powers             
The term was also used in the introduction to the hugely influential U S  government document known as NSC    written in                  
During a speech at Rice University on    September       President John F  Kennedy spoke of not filling space  with weapons of mass destruction  but with instruments of knowledge and understanding               The following month  during a televised presentation about the Cuban Missile Crisis on    October       Kennedy made reference to  offensive weapons of sudden mass destruction              
An early use of the exact phrase in an international treaty is in the Outer Space Treaty of       but the treaty provides no definition of the phrase              and the treaty also categorically prohibits the stationing of  weapons  and the testing of  any type of weapon  in outer space  in addition to its specific prohibition against placing in orbit  or installing on celestial bodies   any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction  

Evolution of its use edit 
During the Cold War  the term  weapons of mass destruction  was primarily a reference to nuclear weapons  At the time  in the West the euphemism  strategic weapons  was used to refer to the American nuclear arsenal  However  there is no precise definition of the  strategic  category  neither considering range nor yield of the nuclear weapon             
Subsequent to Operation Opera  the destruction of a pre operational nuclear reactor inside Iraq by the Israeli Air Force in       the Israeli prime minister  Menachem Begin  countered criticism by saying that  on no account shall we permit an enemy to develop weapons of mass destruction against the people of Israel   This policy of pre emptive action against real or perceived weapons of mass destruction became known as the Begin Doctrine             
The term  weapons of mass destruction  continued to see periodic use  usually in the context of nuclear arms control  Ronald Reagan used it during the      Reykjav k Summit  when referring to the      Outer Space Treaty              Reagan s successor  George H  W  Bush  used the term in a      speech to the United Nations  primarily in reference to chemical arms             
The end of the Cold War reduced U S  reliance on nuclear weapons as a deterrent  causing it to shift its focus to disarmament  With the      invasion of Kuwait and      Gulf War  Iraq s nuclear  biological  and chemical weapons programs became a particular concern of the first Bush Administration              Following the war  Bill Clinton and other western politicians and media continued to use the term  usually in reference to ongoing attempts to dismantle Iraq s weapons programs             

In early       more than     of the world s        nuclear weapons were owned by Russia and the United States             
After the    September      attacks and the      anthrax attacks in the United States  an increased fear of nonconventional weapons and asymmetric warfare took hold in many countries  The fear reached a crescendo with the      Iraq disarmament crisis and the alleged existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that became the primary justification for the      invasion of Iraq  however  American forces found none in Iraq  They found old stockpiles of chemical munitions including sarin and mustard agents  but all were considered to be unusable because of corrosion or degradation              Iraq  however  declared a chemical weapons stockpile in      which U N  personnel had secured after the      Gulf War  The stockpile contained mainly chemical precursors  but some munitions remained usable             
Because of its prolific use and  worldwide  public profile during this period  the American Dialect Society voted  weapons of mass destruction   and its abbreviation   WMD   the word of the year in                   and in      Lake Superior State University added WMD to its list of terms banished for  Mis use  Over use and General Uselessness   and  as a card that trumps all forms of aggression               
In its criminal complaint against the main suspect of the Boston Marathon bombing of    April       the FBI refers to a pressure cooker improvised bomb as a  weapon of mass destruction              
There have been calls to classify at least some classes of cyber weapons as WMD  in particular those aimed to bring about large scale  physical  destruction  such as by targeting critical infrastructure                                      However  some scholars have objected to classifying cyber weapons as WMD on the grounds that they  cannot  currently  directly injure or kill human beings as efficiently as guns or bombs  or clearly  meet the legal and historical definitions  of WMD                         

Definitions of the term edit 
United States edit 
Strategic definition edit 
The most widely used definition of  weapons of mass destruction  is that of nuclear  biological  or chemical weapons  NBC  although there is no treaty or customary international law that contains an authoritative definition  Instead  international law has been used with respect to the specific categories of weapons within WMD  and not to WMD as a whole  While nuclear  chemical and biological weapons are regarded as the three major types of WMDs              some analysts have argued that radiological materials as well as missile technology and delivery systems such as aircraft and ballistic missiles could be labeled as WMDs as well             
However  there is an argument that nuclear and biological weapons do not belong in the same category as chemical and  dirty bomb  radiological weapons  which have limited destructive potential  and close to none  as far as property is concerned   whereas nuclear and biological weapons have the unique ability to kill large numbers of people with very small amounts of material  and thus could be said to belong in a class by themselves      citation needed     
The NBC definition has also been used in official U S  documents  by the U S  President                          the U S  Central Intelligence Agency              the U S  Department of Defense                          and the U S  Government Accountability Office             
Other documents expand the definition of WMD to also include radiological or conventional weapons  The U S  military refers to WMD as 

Chemical  biological  radiological  or nuclear weapons capable of a high order of destruction or causing mass casualties and exclude the means of transporting or propelling the weapon where such means is a separable and divisible part from the weapon  Also called WMD             
This may also refer to nuclear ICBMs  intercontinental ballistic missiles       citation needed     

Protest in Amsterdam against the deployment of Pershing II missiles in Europe      
The significance of the words separable and divisible part of the weapon is that missiles such as the Pershing II and the SCUD are considered weapons of mass destruction  while aircraft capable of carrying bombloads are not      citation needed     
In       the United Kingdom s Butler Review recognized the  considerable and long standing academic debate about the proper interpretation of the phrase  weapons of mass destruction    The committee set out to avoid the general term but when using it  employed the definition of United Nations Security Council Resolution      which defined the systems which Iraq was required to abandon      citation needed     

 Nuclear weapons or nuclear weapons usable material or any sub systems or components or any research  development  support or manufacturing facilities relating to  nuclear weapons  
Chemical and biological weapons and all stocks of agents and all related subsystems and components and all research  development  support and manufacturing facilities 
Ballistic missiles with a range greater than     kilometres and related major parts  and repair and production facilities              
Chemical weapons expert Gert G  Harigel considers only nuclear weapons true weapons of mass destruction  because  only nuclear weapons are completely indiscriminate by their explosive power  heat radiation and radioactivity  and only they should therefore be called a weapon of mass destruction   He prefers to call chemical and biological weapons  weapons of terror  when aimed against civilians and  weapons of intimidation  for soldiers             
Testimony of one such soldier expresses the same viewpoint              For a period of several months in the winter of            U S  Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz frequently used the term  weapons of mass terror   apparently also recognizing the distinction between the psychological and the physical effects of many things currently falling into the WMD category             
Gustavo Bell Lemus  the Vice President of Colombia  at   July      United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects  quoted the Millennium Report of the UN Secretary General to the General Assembly  in which Kofi Annan said that small arms could be described as WMD because the fatalities they cause  dwarf that of all other weapons systems   and in most years greatly exceed the toll of the atomic bombs that devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki              
An additional condition often implicitly applied to WMD is that the use of the weapons must be strategic  In other words  they would be designed to  have consequences far outweighing the size and effectiveness of the weapons themselves               The strategic nature of WMD also defines their function in the military doctrine of total war as targeting the means a country would use to support and supply its war effort  specifically its population  industry  and natural resources      citation needed     
Within U S  civil defense organizations  the category is now Chemical  Biological  Radiological  Nuclear  and Explosive  CBRNE   which defines WMD as 

    Any explosive  incendiary  poison gas  bomb  grenade  or rocket having a propellant charge of more than four ounces      g   missile having an explosive or incendiary charge of more than one quarter ounce    g   or mine or device similar to the above      Poison gas      Any weapon involving a disease organism      Any weapon that is designed to release radiation at a level dangerous to human life             
Military definition edit 
For the general purposes of national defense              the U S  Code             defines a weapon of mass destruction as 

any weapon or device that is intended  or has the capability  to cause death or serious bodily injury to a significant number of people through the release  dissemination  or impact of 
toxic or poisonous chemicals or their precursors
a disease organism
radiation or radioactivity            
For the purposes of the prevention of weapons proliferation              the U S  Code defines weapons of mass destruction as  chemical  biological  and nuclear weapons  and chemical  biological  and nuclear materials used in the manufacture of such weapons              

Criminal  civilian  definition edit 
For the purposes of U S  criminal law concerning terrorism              weapons of mass destruction are defined as 

any  destructive device  defined as any explosive  incendiary  or poison gas   bomb  grenade  rocket having a propellant charge of more than four ounces  missile having an explosive or incendiary charge of more than one quarter ounce  mine  or device similar to any of the devices described in the preceding clauses            
any weapon that is designed or intended to cause death or serious bodily injury through the release  dissemination  or impact of toxic or poisonous chemicals  or their precursors
any weapon involving a biological agent  toxin  or vector
any weapon that is designed to release radiation or radioactivity at a level dangerous to human life            
The Federal Bureau of Investigation s definition is similar to that presented above from the terrorism statute             

any  destructive device  as defined in Title    USC Section      any explosive  incendiary  or poison gas   bomb  grenade  rocket having a propellant charge of more than four ounces  missile having an explosive or incendiary charge of more than one quarter ounce  mine  or device similar to any of the devices described in the preceding clauses
any weapon designed or intended to cause death or serious bodily injury through the release  dissemination  or impact of toxic or poisonous chemicals or their precursors
any weapon involving a disease organism
any weapon designed to release radiation or radioactivity at a level dangerous to human life
any device or weapon designed or intended to cause death or serious bodily injury by causing a malfunction of or destruction of an aircraft or other vehicle that carries humans or of an aircraft or other vehicle whose malfunction or destruction may cause said aircraft or other vehicle to cause death or serious bodily injury to humans who may be within range of the vector in its course of travel or the travel of its debris 
Indictments and convictions for possession and use of WMD such as truck bombs              pipe bombs              shoe bombs              and cactus needles coated with a biological toxin             have been obtained under    USC     a 
As defined by    USC        a   a Weapon of Mass Destruction is 

 A  any destructive device as defined in section     of the title 
 B  any weapon that is designed or intended to cause death or serious bodily injury through the release  dissemination  or impact of toxic or poisonous chemicals  or their precursors 
 C  any weapon involving a biological agent  toxin  or vector  as those terms are defined in section     of this title   or
 D  any weapon that is designed to release radiation or radioactivity at a level dangerous to human life 
Under the same statute  conspiring  attempting  threatening  or using a Weapon of Mass Destruction may be imprisoned for any term of years or for life  and if resulting in death  be punishable by death or by imprisonment for any terms of years or for life  They can also be asked to pay a maximum fine of                      
The Washington Post reported on    March        Jurors asked the judge in the death penalty trial of Zacarias Moussaoui today to define the term  weapons of mass destruction  and were told it includes airplanes used as missiles   Moussaoui was indicted and tried for conspiracy to both destroy aircraft and use weapons of mass destruction  among others             
The surviving Boston Marathon bombing perpetrator  Dzhokhar Tsarnaev  was charged in June      with the federal offense of  use of a weapon of mass destruction  after he and his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev allegedly placed crude shrapnel bombs  made from pressure cookers packed with ball bearings and nails  near the finish line of the Boston Marathon  He was convicted in April       The bombing resulted in three deaths and at least     injuries

Nuclear weapons use the energy inside of an atom s nucleus to create massive explosions  This goal is achieved through nuclear fission and fusion             
Nuclear fission is when the nucleus of an atom is split into smaller nuclei  This process can be induced by shooting a neutron at the nucleus of an atom  When the neutron is absorbed by the atom  it becomes unstable  causing it to split and release energy              Modern nuclear weapons start this process by detonating chemical explosives around a pit of either uranium     or plutonium     metal              The force from this detonation is directed inwards  causing the pit of uranium or plutonium to compress to a dense point  Once the uranium plutonium is dense enough  neutrons are then injected  This starts a fission chain reaction also known as an atomic explosion             
Nuclear fusion is essentially the opposite of fission  It is the fusing together of nuclei  not the splitting of it  When exposed to extreme pressure and temperature  some lightweight nuclei can fuse together and form heavier nuclei  releasing energy in the process              Fusion weapons  also known as  thermonuclear  or  hydrogen  weapons  use the fission process to initiate fusion  Fusion weapons use the energy released from a fission explosion to fuse hydrogen isotopes together              The energy released from these weapons creates a fireball  which reaches tens of million degrees  A temperature of this magnitude is similar to the temperature found at center of the sun  the sun runs on fusion as well             
The only country to have used a nuclear weapon in war is the United States  which dropped two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II 
At the start of       nine states the United States  Russia  the United Kingdom  France  China  India  Pakistan  the Democratic People s Republic of Korea  North Korea  and Israel together possessed approximately        nuclear weapons  of which      were considered to be potentially operationally available  An estimated      of these warheads were deployed with operational forces  including about      that were kept in a state of high operational alert about     more than the previous year             
South Africa developed a small nuclear arsenal in the     s but disassembled them in the early     s  making it the only country to have fully given up an independently developed nuclear weapons arsenal  Belarus  Kazakhstan  and Ukraine inherited stockpiles of nuclear arms following the break up of the Soviet Union  but relinquished them to the Russian Federation             
Countries where nuclear weapons are deployed through nuclear sharing agreements include Belgium  Germany  Italy  the Netherlands  and Turkey             

Biological weapons edit 
Main articles  Biological warfare and Biological weaponsThe Biological Weapons Convention            The history of biological warfare goes back at least to the Mongol siege of Caffa in      and possibly much farther back to antiquity              It is believed that the Ancient Greeks contaminated their adversaries  wells by placing animal corpses in them                          However  only by the turn of the   th century did advances in microbiology allow for the large scale weaponization of pathogens  During First World War  German military attempted to introduce anthrax into Allied livestock  In Second World War  Japan conducted aerial attacks on China using fleas carrying the bubonic plague              During the   th century  at least nine states have operated offensive biological weapons programs  including Canada                          France                          Iraq           s               Japan      s                    Rhodesia  South Africa                          the Soviet Union      s                    the United Kingdom                          and the United States                          The Japanese biological weapons program  which was run by the secret Imperial Japanese Army Unit     during the Sino Japanese War              became infamous for conducting often fatal human experiments on prisoners and producing biological weapons for combat use              The Soviet Union covertly operated the world s largest  longest  and most sophisticated biological weapons program  in violation of its obligations under international law             
International restrictions on biological warfare began with the      Geneva Protocol  which prohibits the use but not the possession or development of biological and chemical weapons                          Upon ratification of the Geneva Protocol  several countries made reservations regarding its applicability and use in retaliation              Due to these reservations  it was in practice a  no first use  agreement only              The      Biological Weapons Convention  BWC  supplements the Geneva Protocol by prohibiting the development  production  acquisition  transfer  stockpiling  and use of biological weapons              Having entered into force on    March       the BWC was the first multilateral disarmament treaty to ban the production of an entire category of weapons of mass destruction              As of March           states have become party to the treaty             

Chemical weapons edit 
Main article  Chemical warfare
Chemical weapons have been used around the world by various civilizations since ancient times  The oldest reported case of a chemical substance being used as a weapon was in     AD   during the siege of Dura Europos  A mixture of tar and sulfur was used to produce sulfur oxides  which helped take control of the city                          In the industrial era  chemical weapons were used extensively by both sides during World War I  and by the Axis powers during World War II  both in battle and in extermination camp gas chambers  though Allied powers also stockpiled them  
International restrictions on chemical warfare began with the Hague Conventions of      and       and was expanded significantly by the      Geneva Protocol  These treaties prohibited the use of poisons or chemical agents in international warfare  but did not place restrictions on development or weapon stockpiles  Since       the Chemical Weapons Convention  CWC  has expanded restrictions to prohibit any use and development of chemical weapons except for very limited purposes  research  medical  pharmaceutical or protective   As of       a handful of countries have known inventories  and many are in the process of being safely destroyed              Nonetheless  proliferation and use in war zones remains an active concern  most recently the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Civil War

Some commentators classify some or all the uses of nuclear  chemical  or biological weapons during wartime as a war crime  or crime against humanity if widespread  because they kill civilians  who are protected by the laws of war  indiscriminately or are specifically prohibited by international treaties  which have become more comprehensive over time                Proponents of use say that specific uses of such weapons have been necessary for defense or to avoid more deaths in a protracted war               The tactic of terror bombing from aircraft  and generally targeting cities with area bombardment or saturation carpet bombing has also been criticized  defended  and prohibited by treaty in the same way  the destructive effect of conventional saturation bombing is similar to that of a nuclear weapon                                        

United States politics edit 
Due to the potentially indiscriminate effects of WMD  the fear of a WMD attack has shaped political policies and campaigns  fostered social movements  and has been the central theme of many films  Support for different levels of WMD development and control varies nationally and internationally  Yet understanding of the nature of the threats is not high  in part because of imprecise usage of the term by politicians and the media      citation needed     

An atomic bomb blueprint
Fear of WMD  or of threats diminished by the possession of WMD  has long been used to catalyze public support for various WMD policies  They include mobilization of pro  and anti WMD campaigners alike  and generation of popular political support      citation needed      The term WMD may be used as a powerful buzzword              or to generate a culture of fear               It is also used ambiguously  particularly by not distinguishing among the different types of WMD              
A television commercial called Daisy  promoting Democrat Lyndon Johnson s      presidential candidacy  invoked the fear of a nuclear war and was an element in Johnson s subsequent election              
Later  United States  President George W  Bush used the threat of potential WMD in Iraq as justification for the      invasion of Iraq               Broad reference to Iraqi WMD in general was seen as an element of President Bush s arguments               The claim that Iraq possessed Weapons of Mass Destruction  WMD  was a major factor that led to the invasion of Iraq in      by Coalition forces              
Over     munitions containing mustard agent and sarin were discovered throughout Iraq since       they were made in the     s and are no longer usable as originally intended due to corrosion              
The American Heritage Dictionary defines a weapon of mass destruction as   a weapon that can cause widespread destruction or kill large numbers of people  especially a nuclear  chemical  or biological weapon                In other words  it does not have to be nuclear  biological or chemical  NBC   For example  Dzhokhar Tsarnaev  one of the perpetrators of the Boston Marathon bombing  was charged under United States law    U S C      A              for using a weapon of mass destruction              and that was a pressure cooker bomb  In other words  it was a weapon that caused large scale death and destruction  without being an NBC weapon 

Media coverage edit 
In March       the Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland  CISSM  released a report              examining the media s coverage of WMD issues during three separate periods  nuclear weapons tests by India and Pakistan in May       the U S  announcement of evidence of a North Korean nuclear weapons program in October       and revelations about Iran s nuclear program in May       The CISSM report argues that poor coverage resulted less from political bias among the media than from tired journalistic conventions  The report s major findings were that 

   Most media outlets represented WMD as a monolithic menace  failing to adequately distinguish between weapons programs and actual weapons or to address the real differences among chemical  biological  nuclear  and radiological weapons 
   Most journalists accepted the Bush administration s formulation of the  War on Terror  as a campaign against WMD  in contrast to coverage during the Clinton era  when many journalists made careful distinctions between acts of terrorism and the acquisition and use of WMD 
   Many stories stenographically reported the incumbent administration s perspective on WMD  giving too little critical examination of the way officials framed the events  issues  threats  and policy options 

   Too few stories proffered alternative perspectives to official line  a problem exacerbated by the journalistic prioritizing of breaking news stories and the  inverted pyramid  style of storytelling         Susan D  Moeller  Media Coverage of Weapons of Mass Destruction
In a separate study published in                    a group of researchers assessed the effects reports and retractions in the media had on people s memory regarding the search for WMD in Iraq during the      Iraq War  The study focused on populations in two coalition countries  Australia and the United States  and one opposed to the war  Germany   Results showed that U S  citizens generally did not correct initial misconceptions regarding WMD  even following disconfirmation  Australian and German citizens were more responsive to retractions  Dependence on the initial source of information led to a substantial minority of Americans exhibiting false memory that WMD were indeed discovered  while they were not  This led to three conclusions 

The repetition of tentative news stories  even if they are subsequently disconfirmed  can assist in the creation of false memories in a substantial proportion of people 
Once information is published  its subsequent correction does not alter people s beliefs unless they are suspicious about the motives underlying the events the news stories are about 
When people ignore corrections  they do so irrespective of how certain they are that the corrections occurred 
A poll conducted between June and September      asked people whether they thought evidence of WMD had been discovered in Iraq since the war ended  They were also asked which media sources they relied upon  Those who obtained their news primarily from Fox News were three times as likely to believe that evidence of WMD had been discovered in Iraq than those who relied on PBS and NPR for their news  and one third more likely than those who primarily watched CBS

Based on a series of polls taken from June September                   
In       Fox News reported the claims of two Republican lawmakers that WMDs had been found in Iraq               based upon unclassified portions of a report by the National Ground Intelligence Center  Quoting from the report  Senator Rick Santorum said  Since       coalition forces have recovered approximately     weapons munitions which contain degraded mustard or sarin nerve agent   According to David Kay  who appeared before the U S  House Armed Services Committee to discuss these badly corroded munitions  they were leftovers  many years old  improperly stored or destroyed by the Iraqis               Charles Duelfer agreed  stating on NPR s Talk of the Nation   When I was running the ISG   the Iraq Survey Group   we had a couple of them that had been turned in to these IEDs  the improvised explosive devices  But they are local hazards  They are not a major  you know  weapon of mass destruction               
Later  wikileaks would show that WMDs of these kinds continued to be found as the Iraqi occupation continued              
Many news agencies  including Fox News  reported the conclusions of the CIA that  based upon the investigation of the Iraq Survey Group  WMDs are yet to be found in Iraq                           

Public perceptions edit 
Awareness and opinions of WMD have varied during the course of their history  Their threat is a source of unease  security  and pride to different people  The anti WMD movement is embodied most in nuclear disarmament  and led to the formation of the British Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in           citation needed     

Anti nuclear weapons protest march in Oxford      
In order to increase awareness of all kinds of WMD  in      the nuclear physicist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Joseph Rotblat inspired the creation of The WMD Awareness Programme              to provide trustworthy and up to date information on WMD worldwide 
In       the University of New Mexico s Institute for Public Policy released their third report              on U S  perceptions   including the general public  politicians and scientists   of nuclear weapons since the breakup of the Soviet Union  Risks of nuclear conflict  proliferation  and terrorism were seen as substantial              
While maintenance of the U S  nuclear arsenal was considered above average in importance  there was widespread support for a reduction in the stockpile  and very little support for developing and testing new nuclear weapons              
Also in       nuclear weapons became an issue in India s election of March  in relation to political tensions with neighboring Pakistan               Prior to the election the Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP  announced it would  declare India a nuclear weapon state  after coming to power              
BJP won the elections  and on    May  three days after India tested nuclear weapons for the second time  a public opinion poll reported that a majority of Indians favored the country s nuclear build up      citation needed     
On    April       the Program on International Policy Attitudes  PIPA  reported              that U S  citizens showed high levels of concern regarding WMD  and that preventing the spread of nuclear weapons should be  a very important U S  foreign policy goal   accomplished through multilateral arms control rather than the use of military threats      citation needed     
A majority also believed the United States should be more forthcoming with its biological research and its Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty commitment of nuclear arms reduction      citation needed     
A Russian opinion poll conducted on   August      indicated half the population believed new nuclear powers have the right to possess nuclear weapons                   believed the Russian stockpile should be reduced  though not eliminated              

In popular culture edit 
Main article  Weapons of mass destruction in popular culture
Weapons of mass destruction and their related impacts have been a mainstay of popular culture since the beginning of the Cold War  as both political commentary and humorous outlet  The actual phrase  weapons of mass destruction  has been used similarly and as a way to characterise any powerful force or product since the Iraqi weapons crisis in the lead up to the Coalition invasion of Iraq in           citation needed      Science fiction may introduce novel weapons of mass destruction with much greater yields or impact than anything in reality 
The term   Weapon of Mass Destruction   verbatim  is voiced in the American dubbed      anime television show Gigantor  Season    episode    Japan

Radioactive weaponry or hazard symbol edit 
Radioactivity
     ISO radioactivity danger symbol
The international radioactivity symbol  also known as trefoil  first appeared in       at the University of California  Berkeley Radiation Laboratory  At the time  it was rendered as magenta  and was set on a blue background              
It is drawn with a central circle of radius R  the blades having an internal radius of    R and an external radius of  R  and separated from each other by                   It is meant to represent a radiating atom              
The International Atomic Energy Agency found that the trefoil radiation symbol is unintuitive and can be variously interpreted by those uneducated in its meaning  therefore  its role as a hazard warning was compromised as it did not clearly indicate  danger  to many non Westerners and children who encountered it  As a result of research  a new radiation hazard symbol  ISO        was developed in      to be placed near the most dangerous parts of radiation sources featuring a skull  someone running away  and using a red rather than yellow background              
The red background is intended to convey urgent danger  and the sign is intended to be used on equipment where very strong ionizing radiation can be encountered if the device is dismantled or otherwise tampered with  The intended use of the sign is not in a place where the normal user will see it  but in a place where it will be seen by someone who has started to dismantle a radiation emitting device or equipment  The aim of the sign is to warn people such as scrap metal workers to stop work and leave the area              

Biological weaponry or hazard symbol edit 
Biohazard
Developed by Dow Chemical company in the     s for their containment products              
According to Charles Dullin  an environmental health engineer who contributed to its development              

 We wanted something that was memorable but meaningless  so we could educate people as to what it means
