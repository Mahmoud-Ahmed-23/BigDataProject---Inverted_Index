The United States Spacecraft Discovery     a      is a fictional spacecraft appearing in the Space Odyssey series by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C  Clarke  The ship is a nuclear powered interplanetary spaceship  crewed by two men and controlled by the on board computer HAL       The ship is destroyed in the second novel and makes no further appearances 
Kubrick and Clarke developed the original film and novel in parallel  but there were some differences to suit the different media   Kubrick dropped the cooling fins of the ship  fearing they would be interpreted as wings  The itinerary of Discovery in the book is from Earth orbit via gravitational slingshot around Jupiter to Saturn and parking orbit around the moon Iapetus  As producing an accurate depiction of Saturn proved too challenging  Kubrick changed this to the simpler route from Earth to Jupiter 
For the film  Kubrick built an exceptionally large model of the ship so that focus changes did not give away the true small size to the audience   He also built a large  expensive  rotating carousel for the artificial gravity scenes 


Development edit 
Early pre production illustration of Discovery
The spaceship first appears in the film       A Space Odyssey by Stanley Kubrick and the novel of the same name by science fiction author Arthur C  Clarke  The film and novel were developed in parallel in a collaboration between Clarke and Kubrick   Despite this  the novelized and filmed appearances of the craft differ  Clarke based the design on ideas that were  or he believed were  scientifically feasible  He gave the ship a hypothetical thermonuclear propulsion system and added huge cooling fins to radiate away the excess heat produced  In the book  Clarke says the fins  looked like the wings of some vast dragonfly  and that they gave the ship a  fleeting resemblance to an old time sailing ship   In the film  Kubrick removed the fins because he thought that the audience might interpret them as wings giving the spacecraft the ability to fly through an atmosphere      citation needed       
Early in the development of the film  Clarke and Kubrick considered having Discovery powered by an Orion type nuclear pulse propulsion system  Kubrick quickly decided against it  both because showing the ship accelerate by a  putt putt  method might be  too comic  for film  and because it might be seen as him having embraced nuclear weapons after his previous film  Dr  Strangelove            

Carousel edit 
Kubrick spent           a large portion of his    million budget             on the set for the artificial gravity scenes in the carousel  The set was a vertically mounted     short ton          t  circular set    feet          m  in diameter and    feet           m  wide             The entire set could rotate around its axis at up to   miles per hour           km h              The rim of the carousel would move slowly enough to allow the actors to walk around with it as if they were in a hamster wheel  This created the impression that the actors were walking up the walls of the set  while in fact  the actors remained at the bottom  The same technique was used for the Aries Moon shuttle scenes  This was not an entirely new idea  in the      Royal Wedding a similar arrangement allowed Fred Astaire to apparently dance up the walls and along the ceiling of his hotel room            
Clarke believed that the ability to transfer between zero g and artificial gravity areas of a spaceship would be easily learnt by astronauts  and this is how Kubrick portrayed it in the film  However  expert opinion is that this would be somewhat more difficult to achieve  particularly due to the Coriolis force             Long radius centrifuge experiments by the Naval Medical Research Laboratory starting in      kept subjects in a    foot           m  diameter centrifuge complete with living quarters for up to three weeks  The experiments found that the subjects took three to four days to overcome motion sickness and balance issues            

Studio model edit 
Two models for filming were made  one    foot           m  long and one    foot          m  long  The scale of the models  compared to many other productions  was unusually large  This was due to the need to keep the whole ship in focus for the shots  something which could not be done on smaller or tabletop models  With a smaller model  the camera needs to be brought in closer  and the change in focus across the model would betray the true size of the object            
Following the completion of the film  Kubrick ordered both the models and the plans for constructing them destroyed  so that they could not be used on future productions  This presented a problem during preproduction for its      sequel        The Year We Make Contact  The filmmakers were forced to refer to frame blowups of the Discovery from different angles taken from a   mm print of      in order to construct a new model      citation needed     
In addition  a model of the ship s head and a few body segments were used for close up shots of Discovery docked with the Leonov  
A    foot model was used for the primary motion control shots  while a smaller one was used to depict the Discovery tumbling end over end over Io 

Fictional history edit 
Because of the lack of aerodynamic design and its immense size  Discovery was assembled in and launched from orbit  As described in the novel  it was originally intended to survey the Jovian system  but its mission was changed to go to Saturn and investigate the destination of the signal from the black monolith found at the crater Tycho  As a result  the mission became a one way trip to Saturn and its moon Japetus   In the filmed telling  the destination remains Jupiter   After investigating alien artifacts at Saturn and Iapetus  the preliminary plan is for all five members of the crew to enter suspended animation for an indefinite period of time  Eventually  it was intended that the much larger and more powerful Discovery Two  not yet completed  would travel to Japetus and return with everyone in hibernation 

Ship features edit 
In the novel       A Space Odyssey  Discovery is described as being  almost          feet long with a sphere         feet dia             meters and           meters respectively  while       The Year We Make Contact mentions     feet           m   and powered by a nuclear plasma drive  separated by     feet          m  of tankage and structure  from the spherical part of the spaceship where the crew quarters  the computer  flight controls  small auxiliary craft  and instrumentation are located 

      A Space Odyssey   Three of the Discovery One crew in a state of hibernation
The ship s carousel is a spinning band of deck  mounted inside the crew compartment  using centrifugal force to simulate the effects of gravity and is the primary living and work area  The three hibernating astronauts are also located here  The carousel provides Moon level gravity rotating at just over        rpm             The carousel can be stopped and the rotation stored in a flywheel              There is an automated kitchen  developed with the assistance of General Mills   a ship to Earth communications center  and a complete medical section where the astronauts undergo regular automated checkups 
Areas outside the carousel  are micro g environments where the crew members use velcro shoes to attach themselves to the floor  Piloting  navigation  and other tasks take place in these areas  There is also a pod bay  where three one man repair and inspection craft are kept  and the spaceship s primary HAL      mainframe computer 

Communications edit 
Discovery is described as a very large ship that could be handled by only two astronauts  David Bowman and Frank Poole   working    hour alternating shifts  along with the HAL       In the book  IBM predicted that computer development would be advanced to such an extent that the mission could be undertaken with all the astronauts placed in hibernation  It was said to be desired  however  that regular communications be maintained throughout the voyage between the pilot and copilot and mission control back on Earth  During communication  an account is taken of the elapsed time for electromagnetic waves crossing space between the spaceship and the Earth  For example  Poole is depicted watching a pre recorded birthday message from his family  rather than interacting with them in real time  Such a conversation is not possible because messages take anywhere from    to    minutes to transmit between Jupiter and Earth  Naturally  this time would depend on the relative positions of the bodies in the Solar System at any given moment             

The fate of Discovery edit 
After the malfunction of HAL  Bowman deactivated the computer  thus effectively isolating himself on Discovery  In the movie  when the spacecraft arrives at Jupiter  it encounters TMA   s considerably larger  Big Brother    TMA     at the Jupiter Io L  point  The novel is basically the same with Discovery in orbit around Saturn s moon Iapetus instead  In both versions  Bowman leaves Discovery to examine the monolith and is taken inside it  The novel and movie       Odyssey Two follows the       A Space Odyssey movie ending rather than the novel 
After finding out that Discovery     s orbit is failing  a joint Soviet US mission  including Heywood Floyd  travels to Jupiter aboard the spacecraft Alexei Leonov to intercept and board Discovery believing that it harbours many of the answers to the mysteries surrounding the      mission  Leonov docks with Discovery  reactivates the on board systems  and stabilizes its orbit  Hal s creator  Dr  Chandra  is sent to reactivate the HAL      computer and gather any data he can regarding the previous mission 
Later on  an apparition of Dave Bowman appears  warning Floyd that Leonov must leave Jupiter within two days  Floyd asks what will happen at that time  and Bowman replies   Something wonderful   Floyd has difficulty convincing the rest of the crew  at first  but a dark spot on Jupiter begins to form and starts growing  HAL s telescope reveals that the  Great Black Spot  is  in fact  a vast population of monoliths increasing at a geometric rate   The film accelerates the pace from the novel  both shortening Bowman s deadline from fifteen days  and making the spot grow faster  
Initially  it was planned to inject Discovery on an Earth bound trajectory  though it would not arrive for some years   however  when faced with Bowman s warning  the Leonov crew devises a plan to use Discovery as a  booster rocket   enabling them to return to Earth ahead of schedule  but leaving Discovery in an elliptical orbit of Jupiter  The crew worries that HAL will have the same neuroses on discovering that he will be abandoned  and Chandra convinces HAL that the human crew is in danger and must leave 
After detaching itself from Discovery  Leonov makes a hasty exit from the Jupiter system  just in time to witness the Monoliths engulf Jupiter  Through a mechanism that the novel only partially explains  these monoliths increase Jupiter s density until the planet achieves nuclear fusion  becoming a small star  As Leonov leaves Jupiter  Bowman instructs HAL to repeatedly broadcast a message warning travellers not to land on Europa  The new star  which Earth eventually dubs  Lucifer   destroys Discovery  HAL is transformed into the same kind of entity as David Bowman and becomes Bowman s companion
