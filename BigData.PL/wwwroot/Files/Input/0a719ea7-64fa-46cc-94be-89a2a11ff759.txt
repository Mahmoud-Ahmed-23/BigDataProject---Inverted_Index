BEIRUT  The implosion of Libyan leader Moammar Qaddafi       s    year old rule will put a new spring in the step of the Arab revolutions and demonstrate once again that these entrenched autocratic governments are not invincible 
 nbsp 
From the Atlantic coast to Gulf shores  live images on Arab satellite channels of rebels pouring into Tripoli  trampling on pictures of Qaddafi and chanting  quot From alley to alley  door to door  rdquo  taunting the leader with his own threats to hunt down his enemies  will rattle Arab leaders facing similar revolts 
Arab capitals have been enthralled as street protests forced Tunisia       s Zine Al Abidine Ben Ali to flee the country he had ruled for    years and Egypt       s Hosni Mubarak to step down after    years in power and now Qaddafi       s government to decompose 
Arabs who this month have seen Mubarak and his sons appear behind bars and who now see the rule of the longest serving Arab ruler collapsing must wonder what else is possible 
From Syria to Yemen  Arab autocrats who sought to use force and repression to contain pent up popular aspirations and fend off uprisings must have pause for thought after events in Libya 
 quot It is an important development because it shows there are different ways in which Arab regimes will collapse  It just shows once you get a momentum developing and the right combination  ndash  a popular will for change and regional and international support  ndash  no regime can withstand that  quot  said Beirut based Middle East analyst Rami Khouri 
 quot Syria has this combination of a popular uprising with regional and international backing  These authoritarian regimes  even if they are strong  collapse in the end  We have three transitions now  Tunis  Egypt and Libya and more are to follow  quot 
Khouri said a revolt in Bahrain by a Shia majority seeking more rights from the Sunni Al Khalifa ruling family had failed because it lacked regional and international backing 
It is true  experts say  that Qaddafi       s downfall depended crucially on Western military intervention  which evidently is not going to be repeated in Syria or elsewhere  ndash  debt laden Western powers  still deeply involved in Iraq and Afghanistan  have no appetite for new fronts in the Muslim world 
The five month NATO bombing campaign in Libya prevented Qaddafi       s forces from recapturing the rebel city of Benghazi and quelling the revolt that erupted on Feb      which would have been a discouraging reversal for restive Arabs elsewhere 
Persistence pays
 quot It shows that if the protesters  opposition  freedom fighters or rebels in Yemen or in Syria persist they may be able to topple the regime  quot  said Middle East analyst Geoff D  Porter 
 quot People       s views of the Arab spring were formed by Tunisia and Egypt where protests lasted up to a month  They thought Libya will be impossible because it didn       t fit the Tunisia and Egypt model  quot  he said   quot Libya       s protests will encourage and embolden protesters in Syria and Yemen although they miss a big component which is the support of NATO  quot 
Scenes of popular rejoicing in Tripoli after Qaddafi       s forces apparently melted away suggest many in the capital had loathed their leader  but had not previously dared defy him for fear of retribution 
 quot This is another day  a new page in Libya       s history  We are witnessing a new dawn and a new history of freedom  quot  said Mohammed Derah  a Libyan activist in Tripoli 
Anti Qaddafi demonstrations in Tripoli early on in the revolt were forcibly suppressed 
 quot Libya showed that Qaddafi didn       t have the support he claimed he had  One may be able to make the comparison to Syria and Yemen where joining a revolution is a big risk   People  may not support the regime but they wouldn       t risk their lives until rebels show up  quot  Porter said in reference to the paucity of demonstrations in Syrian cities such as Damascus and Aleppo 
Experts said economic and oil sanctions imposed on Qaddafi had played a big role in bringing his forces to their knees and similar actions against Syria could have a similar impact 
Assad  who faces growing international calls to step down over his crackdown on more than five months of protests which UN officials say have cost around       civilian lives  warned the West on Sunday that Syria would not tolerate any outside interference  saying unrest had become more militant 
 quot As for the threat of a military action         any action against Syria will have greater consequences  on those who carry it out   greater than they can tolerate  quot  he said 
No country has proposed any military intervention in Syria  which borders Israel  Lebanon  Iraq  Turkey and Jordan  ndash  and has powerful allies in Shia Iran and Lebanon       s Hezbollah 
 quot Assad is probably afraid he will be in the same camp but he thinks he has different international relations than Qaddafi  who had no friends  Assad has the support of Tehran and Hezbollah and that changes the international community       s calculus  quot  Porter said 
For Khouri  the Libyan rebel success will shake the confidence of rulers such as Assad  who apparently believe their military backed governments are immune to popular discontent 
 quot Assad lives in a world of his own  He doesn       t live in a real world  He is oblivious to the new reality  These dictatorships feel invincible  quot  Khouri said
 quot What we are seeing is that they are not invincible  They are very vulnerable  Most of these regimes have been in power for decades and decades and have reached the end of the line  quot
