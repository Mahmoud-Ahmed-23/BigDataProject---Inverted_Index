In mathematics and physics  a vector space  also called a linear space  is a set whose elements  often called vectors  can be added together and multiplied   scaled   by numbers called scalars  The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements  called vector axioms  Real vector spaces and complex vector spaces are kinds of vector spaces based on different kinds of scalars  real numbers and complex numbers  Scalars can also be  more generally  elements of any field 
Vector spaces generalize Euclidean vectors  which allow modeling of physical quantities  such as forces and velocity  that have not only a magnitude  but also a direction  The concept of vector spaces is fundamental for linear algebra  together with the concept of matrices  which allows computing in vector spaces  This provides a concise and synthetic way for manipulating and studying systems of linear equations 
Vector spaces are characterized by their dimension  which  roughly speaking  specifies the number of independent directions in the space  This means that  for two vector spaces over a given field and with the same dimension  the properties that depend only on the vector space structure are exactly the same  technically the vector spaces are isomorphic   A vector space is finite dimensional if its dimension is a natural number  Otherwise  it is infinite dimensional  and its dimension is an infinite cardinal  Finite dimensional vector spaces occur naturally in geometry and related areas  Infinite dimensional vector spaces occur in many areas of mathematics  For example  polynomial rings are countably infinite dimensional vector spaces  and many function spaces have the cardinality of the continuum as a dimension 
Many vector spaces that are considered in mathematics are also endowed with other structures  This is the case of algebras  which include field extensions  polynomial rings  associative algebras and Lie algebras  This is also the case of topological vector spaces  which include function spaces  inner product spaces  normed spaces  Hilbert spaces and Banach spaces

Definition and basic properties edit 
In this article  vectors are represented in boldface to distinguish them from scalars      nb                  
A vector space over a field F is a non empty set      V together with a binary operation and a binary function that satisfy the eight axioms listed below  In this context  the elements of V are commonly called vectors  and the elements of      F are called scalars            

The binary operation  called vector addition or simply addition assigns to any two vectors      v and w in V a third vector in V which is commonly written as v   w  and called the sum of these two vectors 
The binary function  called scalar multiplication  assigns to any scalar      a in F and any vector      v in V another vector in V  which is denoted      av      nb       
To have a vector space  the eight following axioms must be satisfied for every u  v and w in V  and a and b in F

When the scalar field is the real numbers  the vector space is called a real vector space  and when the scalar field is the complex numbers  the vector space is called a complex vector space             These two cases are the most common ones  but vector spaces with scalars in an arbitrary field F are also commonly considered  Such a vector space is called an F vector space or a vector space over F            
An equivalent definition of a vector space can be given  which is much more concise but less elementary  the first four axioms  related to vector addition  say that a vector space is an abelian group under addition  and the four remaining axioms  related to the scalar multiplication  say that this operation defines a ring homomorphism from the field F into the endomorphism ring of this group            
Subtraction of two vectors can be defined as

  
    
      
        
          v
        
          x     
        
          w
        
         
        
          v
        
         
         
          x     
        
          w
        
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle  mathbf  v    mathbf  w    mathbf  v      mathbf  w     
  

Direct consequences of the axioms include that  for every

Even more concisely  a vector space is a module over a field

      displaystyle a      ldots  a  k  
  
 are called the coefficients of the linear combination            
Linear independence
The elements of a subset G of a F vector space V are said to be linearly independent if no element of G can be written as a linear combination of the other elements of G  Equivalently  they are linearly independent if two linear combinations of elements of G define the same element of V if and only if they have the same coefficients  Also equivalently  they are linearly independent if a linear combination results in the zero vector if and only if all its coefficients are zero            
Linear subspace
A linear subspace or vector subspace W of a vector space V is a non empty subset of V that is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication  that is  the sum of two elements of W and the product of an element of W by a scalar belong to W              This implies that every linear combination of elements of W belongs to W  A linear subspace is a vector space for the induced addition and scalar multiplication  this means that the closure property implies that the axioms of a vector space are satisfied             The closure property also implies that every intersection of linear subspaces is a linear subspace             
Linear span
Given a subset G of a vector space V  the linear span or simply the span of G is the smallest linear subspace of V that contains G  in the sense that it is the intersection of all linear subspaces that contain G  The span of G is also the set of all linear combinations of elements of G  If W is the span of G  one says that G spans or generates W  and that G is a spanning set or a generating set of W             
Basis and dimension
A subset of a vector space is a basis if its elements are linearly independent and span the vector space              Every vector space has at least one basis  or many in general  see Basis  linear algebra         Proof that every vector space has a basis               Moreover  all bases of a vector space have the same cardinality  which is called the dimension of the vector space  see Dimension theorem for vector spaces               This is a fundamental property of vector spaces  which is detailed in the remainder of the section 
Bases are a fundamental tool for the study of vector spaces  especially when the dimension is finite  In the infinite dimensional case  the existence of infinite bases  often called Hamel bases  depends on the axiom of choice  It follows that  in general  no base can be explicitly described              For example  the real numbers form an infinite dimensional vector space over the rational numbers  for which no specific basis is known  
Consider a basis 
  
    
      
         
        
          
            b
          
          
             
          
        
         
        
          
            b
          
          
             
          
        
         
          x

 are called the coordinates of v on the basis  They are also said to be the coefficients of the decomposition of v on the basis  One also says that the n tuple of the coordinates is the coordinate vector of v on the basis  since the set

      displaystyle F  n  
  
 of the n tuples of elements of F is a vector space for componentwise addition and scalar multiplication  whose dimension is n 
The one to one correspondence between vectors and their coordinate vectors maps vector addition to vector addition and scalar multiplication to scalar multiplication  It is thus a vector space isomorphism  which allows translating reasonings and computations on vectors into reasonings and computations on their coordinates             

History edit 
Vector spaces stem from affine geometry  via the introduction of coordinates in the plane or three dimensional space  Around       French mathematicians Ren  Descartes and Pierre de Fermat founded analytic geometry by identifying solutions to an equation of two variables with points on a plane curve              To achieve geometric solutions without using coordinates  Bolzano introduced  in       certain operations on points  lines  and planes  which are predecessors of vectors              M bius        introduced the notion of barycentric coordinates              Bellavitis        introduced an equivalence relation on directed line segments that share the same length and direction which he called equipollence              A Euclidean vector is then an equivalence class of that relation              
Vectors were reconsidered with the presentation of complex numbers by Argand and Hamilton and the inception of quaternions by the latter              They are elements in R  and R   treating them using linear combinations goes back to Laguerre in       who also defined systems of linear equations 
In       Cayley introduced the matrix notation which allows for harmonization and simplification of linear maps  Around the same time  Grassmann studied the barycentric calculus initiated by M bius  He envisaged sets of abstract objects endowed with operations              In his work  the concepts of linear independence and dimension  as well as scalar products are present  Grassmann s      work exceeds the framework of vector spaces as well since his considering multiplication led him to what are today called algebras  Italian mathematician Peano was the first to give the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps in                   although he called them  linear systems               Peano s axiomatization allowed for vector spaces with infinite dimension  but Peano did not develop that theory further  In       Salvatore Pincherle adopted Peano s axioms and made initial inroads into the theory of infinite dimensional vector spaces              
An important development of vector spaces is due to the construction of function spaces by Henri Lebesgue  This was later formalized by Banach and Hilbert  around                   At that time  algebra and the new field of functional analysis began to interact  notably with key concepts such as spaces of p integrable functions and Hilbert spaces             

Examples edit 
Main article  Examples of vector spaces
Arrows in the plane edit 
Vector addition  the sum v   w  black  of the vectors v  blue  and w  red  is shown Scalar multiplication  the multiples  v and  w are shown 
The first example of a vector space consists of arrows in a fixed plane  starting at one fixed point  This is used in physics to describe forces or velocities              Given any two such arrows  v and w  the parallelogram spanned by these two arrows contains one diagonal arrow that starts at the origin  too  This new arrow is called the sum of the two arrows  and is denoted v   w  In the special case of two arrows on the same line  their sum is the arrow on this line whose length is the sum or the difference of the lengths  depending on whether the arrows have the same direction  Another operation that can be done with arrows is scaling  given any positive real number a  the arrow that has the same direction as v  but is dilated or shrunk by multiplying its length by a  is called multiplication of v by a  It is denoted av  When a is negative  av is defined as the arrow pointing in the opposite direction instead             
The following shows a few examples  if a      the resulting vector aw has the same direction as w  but is stretched to the double length of w  the second image   Equivalently   w is the sum w   w  Moreover      v    v has the opposite direction and the same length as v  blue vector pointing down in the second image  

Ordered pairs of numbers edit 
A second key example of a vector space is provided by pairs of real numbers x and y  The order of the components x and y is significant  so such a pair is also called an ordered pair  Such a pair is written as  x  y   The sum of two such pairs and the multiplication of a pair with a number is defined as follows

                  y
                  
                     
                  
                
                 
                 
                 
                
                  x
                  
                     
                  
                
                 
                
                  y
                  
                     
                  
                
                 
              
              
                
                 
                 
                
                  x
                  
                     
                  
                
                 
                
                  x
                  
                     
                  
                
                 
                
                  y
                  
                     
                  
                
                 
                
                  y

The first example above reduces to this example if an arrow is represented by a pair of Cartesian coordinates of its endpoint 

Coordinate space edit 
The simplest example of a vector space over a field F is the field F itself with its addition viewed as vector addition and its multiplication viewed as scalar multiplication  More generally  all n tuples  sequences of length n  

  
    
      
         
        
          a
          
             
          
        
         
        
          a
          
             
          
        
         
          x     
         
        
          a
          
            n
          
        
         
      
    
      displaystyle  a     a      dots  a  n   
  

of elements ai of F form a vector space that is usually denoted Fn and called a coordinate space              
The case n     is the above mentioned simplest example  in which the field F is also regarded as a vector space over itself  The case F   R and n      so R   reduces to the previous example 

Complex numbers and other field extensions edit 
The set of complex numbers C  numbers that can be written in the form x   iy for real numbers x and y where i is the imaginary unit  form a vector space over the reals with the usual addition and multiplication   x   iy     a   ib     x   a    i y   b  and c    x   iy     c   x    i c   y  for real numbers x  y  a  b and c   The various axioms of a vector space follow from the fact that the same rules hold for complex number arithmetic  The example of complex numbers is essentially the same as  that is  it is isomorphic to  the vector space of ordered pairs of real numbers mentioned above  if we think of the complex number x   i y as representing the ordered pair  x  y  in the complex plane then we see that the rules for addition and scalar multiplication correspond exactly to those in the earlier example 
More generally  field extensions provide another class of examples of vector spaces  particularly in algebra and algebraic number theory  a field F containing a smaller field E is an E vector space  by the given multiplication and addition operations of F              For example  the complex numbers are a vector space over R  and the field extension 
  
    
      
        
          Q
        
         
        i
        
          
             
          
        
         
      
    
      displaystyle  mathbf  Q   i  sqrt       
  
 is a vector space over Q   

Function spaces edit

Functions from any fixed set   to a field F also form vector spaces  by performing addition and scalar multiplication pointwise  That is  the sum of two functions f and g is the function 
  
    
      
         
        f
         
        g
         
      
    
      displaystyle  f g  
  
 given by

  
    
      
         
        f
         
        g
         
         
        w
         
         
        f
         
        w
         
         
        g
         
        w
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle  f g  w  f w  g w   
  

and similarly for multiplication  Such function spaces occur in many geometric situations  when   is the real line or an interval  or other subsets of R  Many notions in topology and analysis  such as continuity  integrability or differentiability are well behaved with respect to linearity  sums and scalar multiples of functions possessing such a property still have that property              Therefore  the set of such functions are vector spaces  whose study belongs to functional analysis 

Linear equations edit

Systems of homogeneous linear equations are closely tied to vector spaces              For example  the solutions of

 They form a vector space  sums and scalar multiples of such triples still satisfy the same ratios of the three variables  thus they are solutions  too  Matrices can be used to condense multiple linear equations as above into one vector equation  namely

An isomorphism is a linear map f        V   W such that there exists an inverse map g        W   V  which is a map such that the two possible compositions f   g        W   W and g   f        V   V are identity maps  Equivalently  f is both one to one  injective  and onto  surjective               If there exists an isomorphism between V and W  the two spaces are said to be isomorphic  they are then essentially identical as vector spaces  since all identities holding in V are  via f  transported to similar ones in W  and vice versa via g 

Describing an arrow vector v by its coordinates x and y yields an isomorphism of vector spaces 
For example  the arrows in the plane and the ordered pairs of numbers vector spaces in the introduction above  see        Examples  are isomorphic  a planar arrow v departing at the origin of some  fixed  coordinate system can be expressed as an ordered pair by considering the x  and y component of the arrow  as shown in the image at the right  Conversely  given a pair  x  y   the arrow going by x to the right  or to the left  if x is negative   and y up  down  if y is negative  turns back the arrow v             
Linear maps V   W between two vector spaces form a vector space HomF V  W   also denoted L V  W   or    V  W               The space of linear maps from V to F is called the dual vector space  denoted V               Via the injective natural map V   V    any vector space can be embedded into its bidual  the map is an isomorphism if and only if the space is finite dimensional             
Once a basis of V is chosen  linear maps f        V   W are completely determined by specifying the images of the basis vectors  because any element of V is expressed uniquely as a linear combination of them              If dim V   dim W  a   to   correspondence between fixed bases of V and W gives rise to a linear map that maps any basis element of V to the corresponding basis element of W  It is an isomorphism  by its very definition              Therefore  two vector spaces over a given field are isomorphic if their dimensions agree and vice versa  Another way to express this is that any vector space over a given field is completely classified  up to isomorphism  by its dimension  a single number  In particular  any n dimensional F vector space V is isomorphic to Fn  However  there is no  canonical  or preferred isomorphism  an isomorphism          Fn   V is equivalent to the choice of a basis of V  by mapping the standard basis of Fn to V  via

The determinant det  A  of a square matrix A is a scalar that tells whether the associated map is an isomorphism or not  to be so it is sufficient and necessary that the determinant is nonzero              The linear transformation of Rn corresponding to a real n by n matrix is orientation preserving if and only if its determinant is positive 

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors edit 
Main article  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
Endomorphisms  linear maps f        V   V  are particularly important since in this case vectors v can be compared with their image under f  f v   Any nonzero vector v satisfying  v   f v   where   is a scalar  is called an eigenvector of f with eigenvalue                Equivalently  v is an element of the kernel of the difference f       Id  where Id is the identity map V   V   If V is finite dimensional  this can be rephrased using determinants  f  having eigenvalue   is equivalent to

By spelling out the definition of the determinant  the expression on the left hand side can be seen to be a polynomial function in    called the characteristic polynomial of f              If the field F is large enough to contain a zero of this polynomial  which automatically happens for F algebraically closed  such as F   C  any linear map has at least one eigenvector  The vector space V may or may not possess an eigenbasis  a basis consisting of eigenvectors  This phenomenon is governed by the Jordan canonical form of the map              The set of all eigenvectors corresponding to a particular eigenvalue of f forms a vector space known as the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue  and f  in question

      displaystyle A 
  
  The kernel of this map is the subspace of vectors

  is an abelian category  that is  a corpus of mathematical objects and structure preserving maps between them  a category  that behaves much like the category of abelian groups              Because of this  many statements such as the first isomorphism theorem  also called rank nullity theorem in matrix related terms

Vector spaces with additional structure edit 
From the point of view of linear algebra  vector spaces are completely understood insofar as any vector space over a given field is characterized  up to isomorphism  by its dimension  However  vector spaces per se do not offer a framework to deal with the question crucial to analysis whether a sequence of functions converges to another function  Likewise  linear algebra is not adapted to deal with infinite series  since the addition operation allows only finitely many terms to be added  Therefore  the needs of functional analysis require considering additional structures             
A vector space may be given a partial order

 can be ordered by comparing its vectors componentwise  Ordered vector spaces  for example Riesz spaces  are fundamental to Lebesgue integration  which relies on the ability to express a function as a difference of two positive functions

In contrast to the standard dot product  it is not positive definite

 Singling out the fourth coordinate corresponding to time  as opposed to three space dimensions makes it useful for the mathematical treatment of special relativity  Note that in other conventions time is often written as the first  or  zeroeth  component so that the Lorentz product is written

A way to ensure the existence of limits of certain infinite series is to restrict attention to spaces where any Cauchy sequence has a limit  such a vector space is called complete  Roughly  a vector space is complete provided that it contains all necessary limits  For example  the vector space of polynomials on the unit interval

 can be uniformly approximated by a sequence of polynomials  by the Weierstrass approximation theorem               In contrast  the space of all continuous functions on

Banach and Hilbert spaces are complete topological vector spaces whose topologies are given  respectively  by a norm and an inner product  Their study a key piece of functional analysis focuses on infinite dimensional vector spaces  since all norms on finite dimensional topological vector spaces give rise to the same notion of convergence              The image at the right shows the equivalence of the

      displaystyle  mathbf  R        
  
 as the unit  balls  enclose each other  a sequence converges to zero in one norm if and only if it so does in the other norm  In the infinite dimensional case  however  there will generally be inequivalent topologies  which makes the study of topological vector spaces richer than that of vector spaces without additional data 
From a conceptual point of view  all notions related to topological vector spaces should match the topology  For example  instead of considering all linear maps  also called functionals  
  
    
      
        V
          x

 maps between topological vector spaces are required to be continuous              In particular  the  topological  dual space

 consists of continuous functionals

   The fundamental Hahn Banach theorem is concerned with separating subspaces of appropriate topological vector spaces by continuous functionals

 can be approximated as closely as desired by a polynomial              A similar approximation technique by trigonometric functions is commonly called Fourier expansion  and is much applied in engineering  More generally  and more conceptually  the theorem yields a simple description of what  basic functions   or  in abstract Hilbert spaces  what basic vectors suffice to generate a Hilbert space

 its cardinality is known as the Hilbert space dimension      nb         Not only does the theorem exhibit suitable basis functions as sufficient for approximation purposes  but also together with the Gram Schmidt process  it enables one to construct a basis of orthogonal vectors              Such orthogonal bases are the Hilbert space generalization of the coordinate axes in finite dimensional Euclidean space 
The solutions to various differential equations can be interpreted in terms of Hilbert spaces  For example  a great many fields in physics and engineering lead to such equations  and frequently solutions with particular physical properties are used as basis functions  often orthogonal              As an example from physics  the time dependent Schr dinger equation in quantum mechanics describes the change of physical properties in time by means of a partial differential equation  whose solutions are called wavefunctions              Definite values for physical properties such as energy  or momentum  correspond to eigenvalues of a certain  linear  differential operator and the associated wavefunctions are called eigenstates  The spectral theorem decomposes a linear compact operator acting on functions in terms of these eigenfunctions and their eigenvalues

General vector spaces do not possess a multiplication between vectors  A vector space equipped with an additional bilinear operator defining the multiplication of two vectors is an algebra over a field  or F algebra if the field F is specified              
For example  the set of all polynomials

 forms an algebra known as the polynomial ring  using that the sum of two polynomials is a polynomial  they form a vector space  they form an algebra since the product of two polynomials is again a polynomial  Rings of polynomials  in several variables  and their quotients form the basis of algebraic geometry  because they are rings of functions of algebraic geometric objects             
Another crucial example are Lie algebras  which are neither commutative nor associative  but the failure to be so is limited by the constraints

Properties of certain vector bundles provide information about the underlying topological space  For example  the tangent bundle consists of the collection of tangent spaces parametrized by the points of a differentiable manifold  The tangent bundle of the circle S  is globally isomorphic to S    R  since there is a global nonzero vector field on S       nb         In contrast  by the hairy ball theorem  there is no  tangent  vector field on the   sphere S  which is everywhere nonzero              K theory studies the isomorphism classes of all vector bundles over some topological space              In addition to deepening topological and geometrical insight  it has purely algebraic consequences  such as the classification of finite dimensional real division algebras  R  C  the quaternions H and the octonions O 
The cotangent bundle of a differentiable manifold consists  at every point of the manifold  of the dual of the tangent space  the cotangent space  Sections of that bundle are known as differential one forms 

Modules edit 
Main article  Module
Modules are to rings what vector spaces are to fields  the same axioms  applied to a ring R instead of a field F  yield modules              The theory of modules  compared to that of vector spaces  is complicated by the presence of ring elements that do not have multiplicative inverses  For example  modules need not have bases  as the Z module  that is  abelian group  Z  Z shows  those modules that do  including all vector spaces  are known as free modules  Nevertheless  a vector space can be compactly defined as a module over a ring which is a field  with the elements being called vectors   Some authors use the term vector space to mean modules over a division ring              The algebro geometric interpretation of commutative rings via their spectrum allows the development of concepts such as locally free modules  the algebraic counterpart to vector bundles 

Affine and projective spaces edit 
Main articles  Affine space and Projective space
An affine plane  light blue  in R   It is a two dimensional subspace shifted by a vector x  red   
Roughly  affine spaces are vector spaces whose origins are not specified              More precisely  an affine space is a set with a free transitive vector space action  In particular  a vector space is an affine space over itself  by the map

If W is a vector space  then an affine subspace is a subset of W obtained by translating a linear subspace V by a fixed vector x   W  this space is denoted by x   V  it is a coset of V in W  and consists of all vectors of the form x   v for v   V  An important example is the space of solutions of a system of inhomogeneous linear equations

 in this equation              The space of solutions is the affine subspace x   V where x is a particular solution of the equation  and V is the space of solutions of the homogeneous equation  the nullspace of A  
The set of one dimensional subspaces of a fixed finite dimensional vector space V is known as projective space  it may be used to formalize the idea of parallel lines intersecting at infinity              Grassmannians and flag manifolds generalize this by parametrizing linear subspaces of fixed dimension k and flags of subspaces  respectively 

Notes edit 


  It is also common  especially in physics  to denote vectors with an arrow on top

 It is also common  especially in higher mathematics  to not use any typographical method for distinguishing vectors from other mathematical objects 

  Scalar multiplication is not to be confused with the scalar product  which is an additional operation on some specific vector spaces  called inner product spaces  Scalar multiplication is the multiplication of a vector by a scalar that produces a vector  while the scalar product is a multiplication of two vectors that produces a scalar 

  This axiom is not an associative property  since it refers to two different operations  scalar multiplication and field multiplication  So  it is independent from the associativity of field multiplication  which is assumed by field axioms 

  This is typically the case when a vector space is also considered as an affine space  In this case  a linear subspace contains the zero vector  while an affine subspace does not necessarily contain it 

  Some authors  such as Roman         choose to start with this equivalence relation and derive the concrete shape of

 is not a Hilbert space 

  A basis of a Hilbert space is not the same thing as a basis of a linear algebra  For distinction  a linear algebra basis for a Hilbert space is called a Hamel basis 

  That is  there is a homeomorphism from     U  to V   U which restricts to linear isomorphisms between fibers 

  A line bundle  such as the tangent bundle of S  is trivial if and only if there is a section that vanishes nowhere  see Husemoller         Corollary      The sections of the tangent bundle are just vector fields
