Semantic Scholar is a research tool for scientific literature  It is developed at the Allen Institute for AI and was publicly released in November                  Semantic Scholar uses modern techniques in natural language processing to support the research process  for example by providing automatically generated summaries of scholarly papers             The Semantic Scholar team is actively researching the use of artificial intelligence in natural language processing  machine learning  human computer interaction  and information retrieval            
Semantic Scholar began as a database for the topics of computer science  geoscience  and neuroscience             In       the system began including biomedical literature in its corpus             As of September               update       it includes over     million publications from all fields of science            


Technology edit 
Semantic Scholar provides a one sentence summary of scientific literature  One of its aims was to address the challenge of reading numerous titles and lengthy abstracts on mobile devices             It also seeks to ensure that the three million scientific papers published yearly reach readers  since it is estimated that only half of this literature is ever read            
Artificial intelligence is used to capture the essence of a paper  generating it through an  abstractive  technique             The project uses a combination of machine learning  natural language processing  and machine vision to add a layer of semantic analysis to the traditional methods of citation analysis  and to extract relevant figures  tables  entities  and venues from papers                        
Another key AI powered feature is Research Feeds  an adaptive research recommender that uses AI to quickly learn what papers users care about reading and recommends the latest research to help scholars stay up to date  It uses a state of the art paper embedding model trained using contrastive learning to find papers similar to those in each Library folder             
Semantic Scholar also offers Semantic Reader  an augmented reader with the potential to revolutionize scientific reading by making it more accessible and richly contextual              Semantic Reader provides in line citation cards that allow users to see citations with TLDR  short for Too Long  Didn t Read  automatically generated short summaries as they read and skimming highlights that capture key points of a paper so users can digest faster 
In contrast with Google Scholar and PubMed  Semantic Scholar is designed to highlight the most important and influential elements of a paper              The AI technology is designed to identify hidden connections and links between research topics              Like the previously cited search engines  Semantic Scholar also exploits graph structures  which include the Microsoft Academic Knowledge Graph  Springer Nature s SciGraph  and the Semantic Scholar Corpus  originally a    million papers corpus in computer science  neuroscience and biomedicine                          

Article identifier  edit 
Each paper hosted by Semantic Scholar is assigned a unique identifier called the Semantic Scholar Corpus ID  abbreviated S CID   The following entry is an example 

Liu  Ying  Gayle  Albert A  Wilder Smith  Annelies  Rockl v  Joacim  March         The reproductive number of COVID    is higher compared to SARS coronavirus   Journal of Travel Medicine          doi         jtm taaa     PMID                S CID                
Indexing edit 
Semantic Scholar is free to use and unlike similar search engines  i e  Google Scholar  does not search for material that is behind a paywall                 better      source      needed     
One study compared the index scope of Semantic Scholar to Google Scholar  and found that for the papers cited by secondary studies in computer science  the two indices had comparable coverage  each only missing a handful of the papers             

Number of users and publications edit 
As of January       following a      project that added biomedical papers and topic summaries  the Semantic Scholar corpus included more than    million papers from computer science and biomedicine              In March       Doug Raymond  who developed machine learning initiatives for the Amazon Alexa platform  was hired to lead the Semantic Scholar project              As of August               update       the number of included papers metadata  not the actual PDFs  had grown to more than     million             after the addition of the Microsoft Academic Graph records              In       a partnership between Semantic Scholar and the University of Chicago Press Journals made all articles published under the University of Chicago Press available in the Semantic Scholar corpus              At the end of       Semantic Scholar had indexed     million papers              In       Semantic Scholar reached seven million users per month
