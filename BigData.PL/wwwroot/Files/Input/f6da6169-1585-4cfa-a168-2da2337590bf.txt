Algorithm exhibiting emergent behavior
An emergent algorithm is an algorithm that exhibits emergent behavior   In essence an emergent algorithm implements a set of simple building block behaviors that when combined exhibit more complex behaviors   One example of this is the implementation of fuzzy motion controllers used to adapt robot movement in response to environmental obstacles            
An emergent algorithm has the following characteristics       dubious             discuss     

it achieves predictable global effects
it does not require global visibility
it does not assume any kind of centralized control
it is self stabilizing
Other examples of emergent algorithms and models include cellular automata             artificial neural networks and swarm intelligence systems  ant colony optimization  bees algorithm  etc
