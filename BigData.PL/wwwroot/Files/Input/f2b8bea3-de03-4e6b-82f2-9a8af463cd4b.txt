							Amid a restive time the Middle East is going through  Egypt and France share the same views regarding several issues and crises in the region  including the civil wars in Syria and Libya 
The Syrian issue
In       Egypt and France shared the same view regarding the Syrian crisis  This view focuses on fighting the Islamic State  IS  group  without the opposition forcefullyÂ  excluding Syrian President Bashar Al Assad from the political process  
On the one hand  when he was running for president  French President Emmanuel Macron called for the ouster of Al Assad and to take him to the International Criminal Court  After becoming president  Macron said Al Assad must not be excluded from the political process in Syria  In June       the French president said that  France no longer considered his  Al Assad s  departure a pre condition to resolving the six year old conflict  
However  Egypt  under the presidency of President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi  has long called for a political solution for the Syrian Civil War  stressing that the solution to the crisis has to be in the hands of the Syrian people  In a recent interview with the Portuguese TV in November       Al Sisi said that Egypt supports  national armies in Libya and Syria  and confronting the terror groups 
In October       Egypt s permanent delegate to the Security Council voted for a Russian resolution regarding Syria despite the rejection of Egypt s allies in the Arab Gulf  The resolution called for halting all  offensive actions in Syria  but excluded the Russian raids 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Sameh Shoukry said in an interview with CNN in December      that Egypt supports the Syrian people and has been consulting with the Syrian national opposition  adding that  the Syrian opposition and the Syrian people deserve the opportunity to take matters into their own hands in a peaceful political process  
The Libyan crisis
Regarding the Libyan crisis  France has been involved on the ground since the start of the uprising to the extent of having troops that participated in ousting former Libyan President Muammar Gaddafi in       However  after the escalation of the civil conflict and the rise of militias and radical Islamist groups  France has leaned towards supporting a political situation 
Last July  Macron hosted the two main two main rivals in conflict ridden Libya  Prime Minister Fayez al Sarraj and Leader of the Libyan National Army Khalifa Haftar were the two rivals signed an agreement of cooperation and ceasefire  and agreeing on the demobilisation of fighters and making efforts to integrate them into the Libyan National Army  The main outcome of the meeting was the agreement to hold elections in Libya in spring      
In Egypt  the current government supports having a national army to handle the security of the country  Hence  Egypt has been a vocal supporter of Haftar and has fears of terror groups in the east of Libya on its borders  The Egyptian military is active in the Western Desert to stop the inflow of militants and arms trafficking 
The agreement between al Sarraj and Haftar was welcomed by Egypt  praising the need of a political solution as the only way to resolve the Libyan crisis in order to counter terrorism and save the unity of the Libyan territories
