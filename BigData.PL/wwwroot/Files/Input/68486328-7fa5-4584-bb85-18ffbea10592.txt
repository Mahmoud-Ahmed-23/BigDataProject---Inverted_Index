The police are a constituted body of persons empowered by a state with the aim of enforcing the law and protecting the public order as well as the public itself             This commonly includes ensuring the safety  health  and possessions of citizens  and to prevent crime and civil disorder                        Their lawful powers encompass arrest and the use of force legitimized by the state via the monopoly on violence  The term is most commonly associated with the police forces of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility  Police forces are often defined as being separate from the military and other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors  however  gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing             Police forces are usually public sector services  funded through taxes 
Law enforcement is only part of policing activity             Policing has included an array of activities in different situations  but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order             In some societies  in the late   th and early   th centuries  these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property             Police forces have become ubiquitous and a necessity in complex modern societies  However  their role can sometimes be controversial  as they may be involved to varying degrees in corruption  brutality  and the enforcement of authoritarian rule 
A police force may also be referred to as a police department  police service  constabulary  gendarmerie  crime prevention  protective services  law enforcement agency  civil guard  or civic guard  Members may be referred to as police officers  troopers  sheriffs  constables  rangers  peace officers or civic civil guards  Ireland differs from other English speaking countries by using the Irish language terms Garda  singular  and Garda   plural   for both the national police force and its members  The word police is the most universal and similar terms can be seen in many non English speaking countries            
Numerous slang terms exist for the police  Many slang terms for police officers are decades or centuries old with lost etymologies  One of the oldest  cop  has largely lost its slang connotations and become a common colloquial term used both by the public and police officers to refer to their profession            


Etymology
First attested in English in the early   th century  originally in a range of senses encompassing   public  policy  state  public order   the word police comes from Middle French police   public order  administration  government                in turn from Latin politia              which is the romanization of the Ancient Greek           politeia   citizenship  administration  civil polity               This is derived from        polis   city

Ancient
China
Law enforcement in ancient China was carried out by  prefects  for thousands of years since it developed in both the Chu and Jin kingdoms of the Spring and Autumn period  In Jin  dozens of prefects were spread across the state  each having limited authority and employment period  They were appointed by local magistrates  who reported to higher authorities such as governors  who in turn were appointed by the emperor  and they oversaw the civil administration of their  prefecture   or jurisdiction  Under each prefect were  subprefects  who helped collectively with law enforcement in the area  Some prefects were responsible for handling investigations  much like modern police detectives  Prefects could also be women              Local citizens could report minor judicial offenses against them such as robberies at a local prefectural office  The concept of the  prefecture system  spread to other cultures such as Korea and Japan 

Babylonia
In Babylonia  law enforcement tasks were initially entrusted to individuals with military backgrounds or imperial magnates during the Old Babylonian period  but eventually  law enforcement was delegated to officers known as paq dus  who were present in both cities and rural settlements  A paq du was responsible for investigating petty crimes and carrying out arrests                         

Egypt
In ancient Egypt evidence of law enforcement exists as far back as the Old Kingdom period  There are records of an office known as  Judge Commandant of the Police  dating to the fourth dynasty              During the fifth dynasty at the end of the Old Kingdom period  warriors armed with wooden sticks were tasked with guarding public places such as markets  temples  and parks  and apprehending criminals  They are known to have made use of trained monkeys  baboons  and dogs in guard duties and catching criminals  After the Old Kingdom collapsed  ushering in the First Intermediate Period  it is thought that the same model applied  During this period  Bedouins were hired to guard the borders and protect trade caravans  During the Middle Kingdom period  a professional police force was created with a specific focus on enforcing the law  as opposed to the previous informal arrangement of using warriors as police  The police force was further reformed during the New Kingdom period  Police officers served as interrogators  prosecutors  and court bailiffs  and were responsible for administering punishments handed down by judges  In addition  there were special units of police officers trained as priests who were responsible for guarding temples and tombs and preventing inappropriate behavior at festivals or improper observation of religious rites during services  Other police units were tasked with guarding caravans  guarding border crossings  protecting royal necropolises  guarding slaves at work or during transport  patrolling the Nile River  and guarding administrative buildings  By the Eighteenth Dynasty of the New Kingdom period  an elite desert ranger police force called the Medjay was used to protect valuable areas  especially areas of pharaonic interest like capital cities  royal cemeteries  and the borders of Egypt  Though they are best known for their protection of the royal palaces and tombs in Thebes and the surrounding areas  the Medjay were used throughout Upper and Lower Egypt  Each regional unit had its own captain  The police forces of ancient Egypt did not guard rural communities  which often took care of their own judicial problems by appealing to village elders  but many of them had a constable to enforce state laws                         

Greece
In ancient Greece  publicly owned slaves were used by magistrates as police  In Athens  the Scythian Archers  the            rod bearers    a group of about     Scythian slaves  was used to guard public meetings to keep order and for crowd control  and also assisted with dealing with criminals  handling prisoners  and making arrests  Other duties associated with modern policing  such as investigating crimes  were left to the citizens themselves              Athenian police forces were supervised by the Areopagus  In Sparta  the Ephors were in charge of maintaining public order as judges  and they used Sparta s Hippeis  a     member Royal guard of honor  as their enforcers  There were separate authorities supervising women  children  and agricultural issues  Sparta also had a secret police force called the crypteia to watch the large population of helots  or slaves                         

Rome
In the Roman Empire  the army played a major role in providing security  Roman soldiers detached from their legions and posted among civilians carried out law enforcement tasks              The Praetorian Guard  an elite army unit which was primarily an Imperial bodyguard and intelligence gathering unit  could also act as a riot police force if required  Local watchmen were hired by cities to provide some extra security  Lictors  civil servants whose primary duty was to act as bodyguards to magistrates who held imperium  could carry out arrests and inflict punishments at their magistrate s command   Magistrates such as tresviri capitales  procurators fiscal and quaestors investigated crimes  There was no concept of public prosecution  so victims of crime or their families had to organize and manage the prosecution themselves  Under the reign of Augustus  when the capital had grown to almost one million inhabitants     wards were created  the wards were protected by seven squads of       men called vigiles  who acted as night watchmen and firemen  In addition to firefighting  their duties included apprehending petty criminals  capturing runaway slaves  guarding the baths at night  and stopping disturbances of the peace  As well as the city of Rome  vigiles were also stationed in the harbor cities of Ostia and Portus  Augustus also formed the Urban Cohorts to deal with gangs and civil disturbances in the city of Rome  and as a counterbalance to the Praetorian Guard s enormous power in the city  They were led by the urban prefect  Urban Cohort units were later formed in Roman Carthage and Lugdunum 

India
Law enforcement systems existed in the various kingdoms and empires of ancient India  The Apastamba Dharmasutra prescribes that kings should appoint officers and subordinates in the towns and villages to protect their subjects from crime  Various inscriptions and literature from ancient India suggest that a variety of roles existed for law enforcement officials such as those of a constable  thief catcher  watchman  and detective              In ancient India up to medieval and early modern times  kotwals were in charge of local law enforcement             

Achaemenid  First Persian  Empire
The Achaemenid Empire had well organized police forces  A police force existed in every place of importance  In the cities  each ward was under the command of a Superintendent of Police  known as a Kuipan  Police officers also acted as prosecutors and carried out punishments imposed by the courts  They were required to know the court procedure for prosecuting cases and advancing accusations             

Israel
In ancient Israel and Judah  officials with the responsibility of making declarations to the people  guarding the king s person  supervising public works  and executing the orders of the courts existed in the urban areas  They are repeatedly mentioned in the Hebrew Bible  and this system lasted into the period of Roman rule  The first century Jewish historian Josephus related that every judge had two such officers under his command  Levites were preferred for this role  Cities and towns also had night watchmen  Besides officers of the town  there were officers for every tribe  The temple in Jerusalem had special temple police to guard it  The Talmud mentions various local police officials in the Jewish communities of the Land of Israel and Babylon who supervised economic activity  Their Greek sounding titles suggest that the roles were introduced under Hellenic influence  Most of these officials received their authority from local courts and their salaries were drawn from the town treasury  The Talmud also mentions city watchmen and mounted and armed watchmen in the suburbs             

Africa
In many regions of pre colonial Africa  particularly West and Central Africa  guild like secret societies emerged as law enforcement  In the absence of a court system or written legal code  they carried out police like activities  employing varying degrees of coercion to enforce conformity and deter antisocial behavior              In ancient Ethiopia  armed retainers of the nobility enforced law in the countryside according to the will of their leaders  The Songhai Empire had officials known as assara munidios  or  enforcers   acting as police             

The Americas
Pre Columbian civilizations in the Americas also had organized law enforcement  The city states of the Maya civilization had constables known as tupils              In the Aztec Empire  judges had officers serving under them who were empowered to perform arrests  even of dignitaries              In the Inca Empire  officials called curaca enforced the law among the households they were assigned to oversee  with inspectors known as tokoyrikoq  lit         he who sees all   also stationed throughout the provinces to keep order                         

Post classical
The Santas Hermandades of medieval Spain were formed to protect pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago 
In medieval Spain  Santas Hermandades  or  holy brotherhoods   peacekeeping associations of armed individuals  were a characteristic of municipal life  especially in Castile  As medieval Spanish kings often could not offer adequate protection  protective municipal leagues began to emerge in the twelfth century against banditry and other rural criminals  and against the lawless nobility or to support one or another claimant to a crown 
These organizations were intended to be temporary  but became a long standing fixture of Spain  The first recorded case of the formation of an hermandad occurred when the towns and the peasantry of the north united to police the pilgrim road to Santiago de Compostela in Galicia  and protect the pilgrims against robber knights 
Throughout the Middle Ages such alliances were frequently formed by combinations of towns to protect the roads connecting them  and were occasionally extended to political purposes  Among the most powerful was the league of North Castilian and Basque ports  the Hermandad de las marismas  Toledo  Talavera  and Villarreal 
As one of their first acts after end of the War of the Castilian Succession in       Ferdinand      II of Aragon and Isabella      I of Castile established the centrally organized and efficient Holy Brotherhood as a national police force  They adapted an existing brotherhood to the purpose of a general police acting under officials appointed by themselves  and endowed with great powers of summary jurisdiction even in capital cases  The original brotherhoods continued to serve as modest local police units until their final suppression in      
The Vehmic courts of Germany provided some policing in the absence of strong state institutions  Such courts had a chairman who presided over a session and lay judges who passed judgement and carried out law enforcement tasks  Among the responsibilities that lay judges had were giving formal warnings to known troublemakers  issuing warrants  and carrying out executions 
In the medieval Islamic Caliphates  police were known as Shurta  Bodies termed Shurta existed perhaps as early as the Caliphate of Uthman  The Shurta is known to have existed in the Abbasid and Umayyad Caliphates  Their primary roles were to act as police and internal security forces but they could also be used for other duties such as customs and tax enforcement  rubbish collection  and acting as bodyguards for governors  From the   th century  the importance of the Shurta declined as the army assumed internal security tasks while cities became more autonomous and handled their own policing needs locally  such as by hiring watchmen  In addition  officials called muhtasibs were responsible for supervising bazaars and economic activity in general in the medieval Islamic world 
In France during the Middle Ages  there were two Great Officers of the Crown of France with police responsibilities  The Marshal of France and the Grand Constable of France  The military policing responsibilities of the Marshal of France were delegated to the Marshal s provost  whose force was known as the Marshalcy because its authority ultimately derived from the Marshal  The marshalcy dates back to the Hundred Years  War  and some historians trace it back to the early   th century  Another organisation  the Constabulary  Old French  Conn tablie   was under the command of the Constable of France  The constabulary was regularised as a military body in       Under Francis      I  reigned             the Mar chauss e was merged with the constabulary  The resulting force was also known as the Mar chauss e  or  formally  the Constabulary and Marshalcy of France 
In late medieval Italian cities  police forces were known as berovierri  Individually  their members were known as birri  Subordinate to the city s podest   the berovierri were responsible for guarding the cities and their suburbs  patrolling  and the pursuit and arrest of criminals  They were typically hired on short term contracts  usually six months  Detailed records from medieval Bologna show that birri had a chain of command  with constables and sergeants managing lower ranking birri  that they wore uniforms  that they were housed together with other employees of the podest  together with a number of servants including cooks and stable keepers  that their parentage and places of origin were meticulously recorded  and that most were not native to Bologna  with many coming from outside Italy                         
The English system of maintaining public order since the Norman conquest was a private system of tithings known as the mutual pledge system  This system was introduced under Alfred the Great  Communities were divided into groups of ten families called tithings  each of which was overseen by a chief tithingman  Every household head was responsible for the good behavior of his own family and the good behavior of other members of his tithing  Every male aged    and over was required to participate in a tithing  Members of tithings were responsible for raising  hue and cry  upon witnessing or learning of a crime  and the men of his tithing were responsible for capturing the criminal  The person the tithing captured would then be brought before the chief tithingman  who would determine guilt or innocence and punishment  All members of the criminal s tithing would be responsible for paying the fine  A group of ten tithings was known as a  hundred  and every hundred was overseen by an official known as a reeve  Hundreds ensured that if a criminal escaped to a neighboring village  he could be captured and returned to his village  If a criminal was not apprehended  then the entire hundred could be fined  The hundreds were governed by administrative divisions known as shires  the rough equivalent of a modern county  which were overseen by an official known as a shire reeve  from which the term sheriff evolved  The shire reeve had the power of posse comitatus  meaning he could gather the men of his shire to pursue a criminal              Following the Norman conquest of England in       the tithing system was tightened with the frankpledge system  By the end of the   th century  the office of constable developed  Constables had the same responsibilities as chief tithingmen and additionally as royal officers  The constable was elected by his parish every year  Eventually  constables became the first  police  official to be tax supported  In urban areas  watchmen were tasked with keeping order and enforcing nighttime curfew  Watchmen guarded the town gates at night  patrolled the streets  arrested those on the streets at night without good reason  and also acted as firefighters  Eventually the office of justice of the peace was established  with a justice of the peace overseeing constables                          There was also a system of investigative  juries  
The Assize of Arms of       which required the appointment of constables to summon men to arms  quell breaches of the peace  and to deliver offenders to the sheriff or reeve  is cited as one of the earliest antecedents of the English police              The Statute of Winchester of      is also cited as the primary legislation regulating the policing of the country between the Norman Conquest and the Metropolitan Police Act                              
From about       private watchmen were funded by private individuals and organisations to carry out police functions  They were later nicknamed  Charlies   probably after the reigning monarch King Charles      II  Thief takers were also rewarded for catching thieves and returning the stolen property  They were private individuals usually hired by crime victims 
The earliest English use of the word police seems to have been the term Polles mentioned in the book The Second Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England published in                  

Early modern
The first example of a statutory police force in the world was probably the High Constables of Edinburgh  formed in      to police the streets of Edinburgh  then part of the Kingdom of Scotland  The constables  of whom half were merchants and half were craftsmen  were charged with enforcing    regulations relating to curfews  weapons  and theft              At that time  maintenance of public order in Scotland was mainly done by clan chiefs and feudal lords  The first centrally organised and uniformed police force was created by the government of King Louis      XIV in      to police the city of Paris  then the largest city in Europe  The royal edict  registered by the Parlement of Paris on March           created the office of lieutenant g n ral de police   lieutenant general of police    who was to be the head of the new Paris police force  and defined the task of the police as  ensuring the peace and quiet of the public and of private individuals  purging the city of what may cause disturbances  procuring abundance  and having each and everyone live according to their station and their duties  

Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie  founder of the Prefecture of Police  the first uniformed police force in the world
This office was first held by Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie  who had    commissaires de police   police commissioners   under his authority  In       these commissioners were assisted by inspecteurs de police   police inspectors    The city of Paris was divided into    districts policed by the commissaires  each assigned to a particular district and assisted by a growing bureaucracy  The scheme of the Paris police force was extended to the rest of France by a royal edict of October       resulting in the creation of lieutenants general of police in all large French cities and towns 
After the French Revolution  Napol on I reorganized the police in Paris and other cities with more than       inhabitants on February           as the Prefecture of Police  On March           a government decree created the first uniformed police in France  known as sergents de ville   city sergeants    which the Paris Prefecture of Police s website claims were the first uniformed policemen in the world             
In feudal Japan  samurai warriors were charged with enforcing the law among commoners  Some Samurai acted as magistrates called Machi bugy   who acted as judges  prosecutors  and as chief of police  Beneath them were other Samurai serving as yoriki  or assistant magistrates  who conducted criminal investigations  and beneath them were Samurai serving as d shin  who were responsible for patrolling the streets  keeping the peace  and making arrests when necessary  The yoriki were responsible for managing the d shin  Yoriki and d shin were typically drawn from low ranking samurai families  Assisting the d shin were the komono  non Samurai ch nin who went on patrol with them and provided assistance  the okappiki  non Samurai from the lowest outcast class  often former criminals  who worked for them as informers and spies  and g yokiki or meakashi  ch nin  often former criminals  who were hired by local residents and merchants to work as police assistants in a particular neighborhood  This system typically did not apply to the Samurai themselves  Samurai clans were expected to resolve disputes among each other through negotiation  or when that failed through duels  Only rarely did Samurai bring their disputes to a magistrate or answer to police                                     
In Joseon era Korea  the Podocheong emerged as a police force with the power to arrest and punish criminals  Established in      as a temporary organization  its role solidified into a permanent one 
In Sweden  local governments were responsible for law and order by way of a royal decree issued by Magnus      III in the   th century  The cities financed and organized groups of watchmen who patrolled the streets  In the late     s in Stockholm  patrol duties were in large part taken over by a special corps of salaried city guards  The city guard was organized  uniformed and armed like a military unit and was responsible for interventions against various crimes and the arrest of suspected criminals  These guards were assisted by the military  fire patrolmen  and a civilian unit that did not wear a uniform  but instead wore a small badge around the neck  The civilian unit monitored compliance with city ordinances relating to e g  sanitation issues  traffic and taxes  In rural areas  the King s bailiffs were responsible for law and order until the establishment of counties in the     s                         
Up to the early   th century  the level of state involvement in law enforcement in Britain was low  Although some law enforcement officials existed in the form of constables and watchmen  there was no organized police force  A professional police force like the one already present in France would have been ill suited to Britain  which saw examples such as the French one as a threat to the people s liberty and balanced constitution in favor of an arbitrary and tyrannical government  Law enforcement was mostly up to the private citizens  who had the right and duty to prosecute crimes in which they were involved or in which they were not  At the cry of  murder   or  stop thief   everyone was entitled and obliged to join the pursuit  Once the criminal had been apprehended  the parish constables and night watchmen  who were the only public figures provided by the state and who were typically part time and local  would make the arrest              As a result  the state set a reward to encourage citizens to arrest and prosecute offenders  The first of such rewards was established in      of the amount of     for the conviction of a highwayman and in the following years it was extended to burglars  coiners and other forms of offense  The reward was to be increased in      when  after the end of the War of the Spanish Succession and the consequent rise of criminal offenses  the government offered      for the conviction of a highwayman  Although the offer of such a reward was conceived as an incentive for the victims of an offense to proceed to the prosecution and to bring criminals to justice  the efforts of the government also increased the number of private thief takers  Thief takers became infamously known not so much for what they were supposed to do  catching real criminals and prosecuting them  as for  setting themselves up as intermediaries between victims and their attackers  extracting payments for the return of stolen goods and using the threat of prosecution to keep offenders in thrall   Some of them  such as Jonathan Wild  became infamous at the time for staging robberies in order to receive the reward                         
In       George II began paying some London and Middlesex watchmen with tax monies  beginning the shift to government control  In       Judge Henry Fielding began organizing a force of quasi professional constables known as the Bow Street Runners  The Bow Street Runners are considered to have been Britain s first dedicated police force  They represented a formalization and regularization of existing policing methods  similar to the unofficial  thief takers   What made them different was their formal attachment to the Bow Street magistrates  office  and payment by the magistrate with funds from the central government  They worked out of Fielding s office and court at No    Bow Street  and did not patrol but served writs and arrested offenders on the authority of the magistrates  travelling nationwide to apprehend criminals  Fielding wanted to regulate and legalize law enforcement activities due to the high rate of corruption and mistaken or malicious arrests seen with the system that depended mainly on private citizens and state rewards for law enforcement  Henry Fielding s work was carried on by his brother  Justice John Fielding  who succeeded him as magistrate in the Bow Street office  Under John Fielding  the institution of the Bow Street Runners gained more and more recognition from the government  although the force was only funded intermittently in the years that followed  In       the Bow Street Horse Patrol was established to combat highway robbery  funded by a government grant  The Bow Street Runners served as the guiding principle for the way that policing developed over the next    years  Bow Street was a manifestation of the move towards increasing professionalisation and state control of street life  beginning in London 
The Macdaniel affair  a      British political scandal in which a group of thief takers was found to be falsely prosecuting innocent men in order to collect reward money from bounties              added further impetus for a publicly salaried police force that did not depend on rewards  Nonetheless  In       there were privately financed police units in no fewer than    parishes within a    mile radius of London 
The word police was borrowed from French into the English language in the   th century  but for a long time it applied only to French and continental European police forces  The word  and the concept of police itself  were  disliked as a symbol of foreign oppression               Before the   th century  the first use of the word police recorded in government documents in the United Kingdom was the appointment of Commissioners of Police for Scotland in      and the creation of the Marine Police in      

Modern
Scotland and Ireland
Following early police forces established in      and      in Glasgow  Scotland  the Glasgow authorities successfully petitioned the government to pass the Glasgow Police Act establishing the City of Glasgow Police in                   Other Scottish towns soon followed suit and set up their own police forces through acts of parliament              In Ireland  the Irish Constabulary Act      marked the beginning of the Royal Irish Constabulary  The act established a force in each barony with chief constables and inspectors general under the control of the civil administration at Dublin Castle  By      this force numbered over       men 

London
Patrick Colquhoun  founder of the Thames River Police
In       Patrick Colquhoun was able to persuade the West Indies merchants who operated at the Pool of London on the River Thames to establish a police force at the docks to prevent rampant theft that was causing annual estimated losses of          worth of cargo in imports alone              The idea of a police  as it then existed in France  was considered as a potentially undesirable foreign import  In building the case for the police in the face of England s firm anti police sentiment  Colquhoun framed the political rationale on economic indicators to show that a police dedicated to crime prevention was  perfectly congenial to the principle of the British constitution   Moreover  he went so far as to praise the French system  which had reached  the greatest degree of perfection  in his estimation

With the initial investment of         the new force the Marine Police began with about    men charged with policing        workers in the river trades  of whom Colquhoun claimed        were known criminals and  on the game   The force was part funded by the London Society of West India Planters and Merchants  The force was a success after its first year  and his men had  established their worth by saving          worth of cargo and by the rescuing of several lives   Word of this success spread quickly  and the government passed the Depredations on the Thames Act      on    July       establishing a fully funded police force the Thames River Police together with new laws including police powers  now the oldest police force in the world  Colquhoun published a book on the experiment  The Commerce and Policing of the River Thames  It found receptive audiences far outside London  and inspired similar forces in other cities  notably  New York City  Dublin  and Sydney             
Colquhoun s utilitarian approach to the problem   using a cost benefit argument to obtain support from businesses standing to benefit   allowed him to achieve what Henry and John Fielding failed for their Bow Street detectives  Unlike the stipendiary system at Bow Street  the river police were full time  salaried officers prohibited from taking private fees              His other contribution was the concept of preventive policing  his police were to act as a highly visible deterrent to crime by their permanent presence on the Thames

London was fast reaching a size unprecedented in world history  due to the onset of the Industrial Revolution              It became clear that the locally maintained system of volunteer constables and  watchmen  was ineffective  both in detecting and preventing crime  A parliamentary committee was appointed to investigate the system of policing in London  Upon Sir Robert Peel being appointed as Home Secretary in       he established a second and more effective committee  and acted upon its findings 
Royal assent to the Metropolitan Police Act      was given             and the Metropolitan Police Service was established on September           in London                          Peel  widely regarded as the father of modern policing              was heavily influenced by the social and legal philosophy of Jeremy Bentham  who called for a strong and centralised  but politically neutral  police force for the maintenance of social order  for the protection of people from crime and to act as a visible deterrent to urban crime and disorder              Peel decided to standardise the police force as an official paid profession  to organise it in a civilian fashion  and to make it answerable to the public

Due to public fears concerning the deployment of the military in domestic matters  Peel organised the force along civilian lines  rather than paramilitary  To appear neutral  the uniform was deliberately manufactured in blue  rather than red which was then a military colour  along with the officers being armed only with a wooden truncheon and a rattle             to signal the need for assistance  Along with this  police ranks did not include military titles  with the exception of Sergeant 
To distance the new police force from the initial public view of it as a new tool of government repression  Peel publicised the so called Peelian principles  which set down basic guidelines for ethical policing                         

Whether the police are effective is not measured on the number of arrests but on the deterrence of crime 
Above all else  an effective authority figure knows trust and accountability are paramount  Hence  Peel s most often quoted principle that  The police are the public and the public are the police

The Metropolitan Police Act      created a modern police force by limiting the purview of the force and its powers and envisioning it as merely an organ of the judicial system  Their job was apolitical  to maintain the peace and apprehend criminals for the courts to process according to the law              This was very different from the  continental model  of the police force that had been developed in France  where the police force worked within the parameters of the absolutist state as an extension of the authority of the monarch and functioned as part of the governing state 
In       the Metropolitan Police were issued with the distinctive custodian helmet  and in      they switched to the use of whistles that could be heard from much further away                          The Metropolitan Police became a model for the police forces in many countries  including the United States and most of the British Empire                          Bobbies can still be found in many parts of the Commonwealth of Nations

In Australia  organized law enforcement emerged soon after British colonization began in       The first law enforcement organizations were the Night Watch and Row Boat Guard  which were formed in      to police Sydney  Their ranks were drawn from well behaved convicts deported to Australia  The Night Watch was replaced by the Sydney Foot Police in       In New South Wales  rural law enforcement officials were appointed by local justices of the peace during the early to mid   th century and were referred to as  bench police  or  benchers   A mounted police force was formed in                  
The first police force having centralised command as well as jurisdiction over an entire colony was the South Australia Police  formed in      under Henry Inman  However  whilst the New South Wales Police Force was established in       it was made up from a large number of policing and military units operating within the then Colony of New South Wales and traces its links back to the Royal Marines  The passing of the Police Regulation Act of      essentially tightly regulated and centralised all of the police forces operating throughout the Colony of New South Wales 
Each Australian state and territory maintain its own police force  while the Australian Federal Police enforces laws at the federal level  The New South Wales Police Force remains the largest police force in Australia in terms of personnel and physical resources  It is also the only police force that requires its recruits to undertake university studies at the recruit level and has the recruit pay for their own education

Modern policing influenced by the British model of policing established in      based on the Peelian principles began emerging in the United States in the mid   th century  replacing previous law enforcement systems based primarily on night watch organizations              Cities began establishing organized  publicly funded  full time professional police services  In Boston  a day police consisting of six officers under the command of the city marshal was established in      to supplement the city s night watch  This paved the way for the establishment of the Boston Police Department in                               In New York City  law enforcement up to the     s was handled by a night watch as well as     city marshals     municipal police officers  and    constables  In       the New York City Police Department was established              In Philadelphia  the first police officers to patrol the city in daytime were employed in      as a supplement to the night watch system  leading to the establishment of the Philadelphia Police Department in                  
In the American Old West  law enforcement was carried out by local sheriffs  rangers  constables  and federal marshals  There were also town marshals responsible for serving civil and criminal warrants  maintaining the jails  and carrying out arrests for petty crime                          
In addition to federal  state  and local forces  some special districts have been formed to provide extra police protection in designated areas  These districts may be known as neighborhood improvement districts  crime prevention districts  or security districts              
In       San Francisco supervisors approved a policy allowing municipal police  San Francisco Police Department  to use robots for various law enforcement and emergency operations  permitting their employment as a deadly force option in cases where the  risk of life to members of the public or officers is imminent and outweighs any other force option available to SFPD                This policy has been criticized by groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the ACLU  who have argued that  killer robots will not make San Francisco better  and  police might even bring armed robots to a protest                            

Development of theory
Michel Foucault wrote that the contemporary concept of police as a paid and funded functionary of the state was developed by German and French legal scholars and practitioners in public administration and statistics in the   th and early   th centuries  most notably with Nicolas Delamare s Trait  de la Police   Treatise on the Police    first published in       The German Polizeiwissenschaft  Science of Police  first theorized by Philipp von H rnigk  a   th century Austrian political economist and civil servant  and much more famously by Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi  who produced an important theoretical work known as Cameral science on the formulation of police               Foucault cites Magdalene Humpert author of Bibliographie der Kameralwissenschaften        in which the author makes note of a substantial bibliography was produced of over       pieces of the practice of Polizeiwissenschaft  However  this may be a mistranslation of Foucault s own work since the actual source of Magdalene Humpert states over        items were produced from the   th century dates ranging from      to                                
As conceptualized by the Polizeiwissenschaft  according to Foucault the police had an administrative  economic and social duty   procuring abundance    It was in charge of demographic concerns     vague      and needed to be incorporated within the western political philosophy system of raison d  tat and therefore giving the superficial appearance of empowering the population  and unwittingly supervising the population   which  according to mercantilist theory  was to be the main strength of the state  Thus  its functions largely overreached simple law enforcement activities and included public health concerns  urban planning  which was important because of the miasma theory of disease  thus  cemeteries were moved out of town  etc    and surveillance of prices              

Jeremy Bentham  philosopher who advocated for the establishment of preventive police forces and influenced the reforms of Sir Robert Peel
The concept of preventive policing  or policing to deter crime from taking place  gained influence in the late   th century  Police Magistrate John Fielding  head of the Bow Street Runners  argued that     it is much better to prevent even one man from being a rogue than apprehending and bringing forty to justice               
The Utilitarian philosopher  Jeremy Bentham  promoted the views of Italian Marquis Cesare Beccaria  and disseminated a translated version of  Essay on Crime in Punishment   Bentham espoused the guiding principle of  the greatest good for the greatest number  

It is better to prevent crimes than to punish them  This is the chief aim of every good system of legislation  which is the art of leading men to the greatest possible happiness or to the least possible misery  according to calculation of all the goods and evils of life              
Patrick Colquhoun s influential work  A Treatise on the Police of the Metropolis        was heavily influenced by Benthamite thought  Colquhoun s Thames River Police was founded on these principles  and in contrast to the Bow Street Runners  acted as a deterrent by their continual presence on the riverfront  in addition to being able to intervene if they spotted a crime in progress              
Edwin Chadwick s      article   Preventive police  in the London Review               argued that prevention ought to be the primary concern of a police body  which was not the case in practice  The reason  argued Chadwick  was that  A preventive police would act more immediately by placing difficulties in obtaining the objects of temptation   In contrast to a deterrent of punishment  a preventive police force would deter criminality by making crime cost ineffective    crime doesn t pay   In the second draft of his      Police Act  the  object  of the new Metropolitan Police  was changed by Robert Peel to the  principal object   which was the  prevention of crime                Later historians would attribute the perception of England s  appearance of orderliness and love of public order  to the preventive principle entrenched in Peel s police system              
Development of modern police forces around the world was contemporary to the formation of the state  later defined by sociologist Max Weber as achieving a  monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force  and which was primarily exercised by the police and the military  Marxist theory situates the development of the modern state as part of the rise of capitalism  in which the police are one component of the bourgeoisie s repressive apparatus for subjugating the working class  By contrast  the Peelian principles argue that  the power of the police     is dependent on public approval of their existence  actions and behavior   a philosophy known as policing by consent 

Personnel and organization
Police forces include both preventive  uniformed  police and detectives  Terminology varies from country to country  Police functions include protecting life and property  enforcing criminal law  criminal investigations  regulating traffic  crowd control  public safety duties  civil defense  emergency management  searching for missing persons  lost property and other duties concerned with public order  Regardless of size  police forces are generally organized as a hierarchy with multiple ranks  The exact structures and the names of rank vary considerably by country 

Uniformed
See also  Uniform        PoliceUniformed police officers of the West Midlands Police
The police who wear uniforms make up the majority of a police service s personnel  Their main duty is to respond to calls for service  When not responding to these calls  they do work aimed at preventing crime  such as patrols  The uniformed police are known by varying names such as preventive police  the uniform branch division  administrative police  order police  the patrol bureau division  or patrol  In Australia and the United Kingdom  patrol personnel are also known as  general duties  officers               Atypically  Brazil s preventive police are known as Military Police              
As stated by the name  uniformed police wear uniforms  They perform functions that require an immediate recognition of an officer s legal authority and a potential need for force  Most commonly this means intervening to stop a crime in progress and securing the scene of a crime that has already happened  Besides dealing with crime  these officers may also manage and monitor traffic  carry out community policing duties  maintain order at public events or carry out searches for missing people  in       the latter accounted for     of police time in the United Kingdom                As most of these duties must be available as a      service  uniformed police are required to do shift work 

Detectives

Police detectives are responsible for investigations and detective work  Detectives may be called Investigations Police  Judiciary Judicial Police  or Criminal Police  In the United Kingdom  they are often referred to by the name of their department  the Criminal Investigation Department  Detectives typically make up roughly        of a police service s personnel 
Detectives  in contrast to uniformed police  typically wear business styled attire in bureaucratic and investigative functions  where a uniformed presence would be either a distraction or intimidating but a need to establish police authority still exists   Plainclothes  officers dress in attire consistent with that worn by the general public for purposes of blending in 
In some cases  police are assigned to work  undercover   where they conceal their police identity to investigate crimes  such as organized crime or narcotics crime  that are unsolvable by other means  In some cases  this type of policing shares aspects with espionage 
The relationship between detective and uniformed branches varies by country  In the United States  there is high variation within the country itself  Many American police departments require detectives to spend some time on temporary assignments in the patrol division      citation needed                   The argument is that rotating officers helps the detectives to better understand the uniformed officers  work  to promote cross training in a wider variety of skills  and prevent  cliques  that can contribute to corruption or other unethical behavior      citation needed      Conversely  some countries regard detective work as being an entirely separate profession  with detectives working in separate agencies and recruited without having to serve in uniform  A common compromise in English speaking countries is that most detectives are recruited from the uniformed branch  but once qualified they tend to spend the rest of their careers in the detective branch 
Another point of variation is whether detectives have extra status  In some forces  such as the New York Police Department and Philadelphia Police Department  a regular detective holds a higher rank than a regular police officer  In others  such as British police and Canadian police  a regular detective has equal status with regular uniformed officers  Officers still have to take exams to move to the detective branch  but the move is regarded as being a specialization  rather than a promotion 

Volunteers and auxiliary
Police services often include part time or volunteer officers  some of whom have other jobs outside policing  These may be paid positions or entirely volunteer  These are known by a variety of names  such as reserves  auxiliary police or special constables 
Other volunteer organizations work with the police and perform some of their duties  Groups in the U S  including the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program  Community Emergency Response Team  and the Boy Scouts Police Explorers provide training  traffic and crowd control  disaster response  and other policing duties  In the U S   the Volunteers in Police Service program assists over         volunteers in almost       programs               Volunteers may also work on the support staff  Examples of these schemes are Volunteers in Police Service in the US  Police Support Volunteers in the UK and Volunteers in Policing in New South Wales 

Specialized

Specialized preventive and detective groups  or Specialist Investigation Departments  exist within many law enforcement organizations either for dealing with particular types of crime  such as traffic law enforcement  K  use of police dogs  crash investigation  homicide  or fraud  or for situations requiring specialized skills  such as underwater search  aviation  explosive disposal   bomb squad    and computer crime 
Most larger jurisdictions employ police tactical units  specially selected and trained paramilitary units with specialized equipment  weapons  and training  for the purposes of dealing with particularly violent situations beyond the capability of a patrol officer response  including standoffs  counterterrorism  and rescue operations 
In counterinsurgency type campaigns  select and specially trained units of police armed and equipped as light infantry have been designated as police field forces who perform paramilitary type patrols and ambushes whilst retaining their police powers in areas that were highly dangerous              
Because their situational mandate typically focuses on removing innocent bystanders from dangerous people and dangerous situations  not violent resolution  they are often equipped with non lethal tactical tools like chemical agents  stun grenades  and rubber bullets  The Specialist Firearms Command  MO                 of the Metropolitan Police in London is a group of armed police used in dangerous situations including hostage taking  armed robbery assault and terrorism 

Administrative duties
Police may have administrative duties that are not directly related to enforcing the law  such as issuing firearms licenses  The extent that police have these functions varies among countries  with police in France  Germany  and other continental European countries handling such tasks to a greater extent than British counterparts

Religious
Main article  Religious police
Some jurisdictions with religious laws may have dedicated religious police to enforce said laws  These religious police forces  which may operate either as a unit of a wider police force or as an independent agency  may only have jurisdiction over members of said religion  or they may have the ability to enforce religious customs nationwide regardless of individual religious beliefs 
Religious police may enforce social norms  gender roles  dress codes  and dietary laws per religious doctrine and laws  and may also prohibit practices that run contrary to said doctrine  such as atheism  proselytism  homosexuality  socialization between different genders  business operations during religious periods or events such as salah or the Sabbath  or the sale and possession of  offending material  ranging from pornography to foreign media                           
Forms of religious law enforcement were relatively common in historical religious civilizations  but eventually declined in favor of religious tolerance and pluralism  One of the most common forms of religious police in the modern world are Islamic religious police  which enforce the application of Sharia  Islamic religious law   As of       there are eight Islamic countries that maintain Islamic religious police  Afghanistan  Iran  Iraq  Mauritania  Pakistan  Saudi Arabia  Sudan  and Yemen              
Some forms of religious police may not enforce religious law  but rather suppress religion or religious extremism  This is often done for ideological reasons  for example  communist states such as China and Vietnam have historically suppressed and tightly controlled religions such as Christianity 

Secret
Main article  Secret police
Secret police organizations are typically used to suppress dissidents for engaging in non politically correct communications and activities  which are deemed counter productive to what the state and related establishment promote  Secret police interventions to stop such activities are often illegal  and are designed to debilitate  in various ways  the people targeted in order to limit or stop outright their ability to act in a non politically correct manner               The methods employed may involve spying  various acts of deception  intimidation  framing  false imprisonment  false incarceration under mental health legislation  and physical violence               Countries widely reported to use secret police organizations include China               The Ministry of State Security  and North Korea  The Ministry of State Security               

By country
Main article  Law enforcement by country
Hungarian  Estonian  Dutch  and Polish police cars in     
Police forces are usually organized and funded by some level of government  The level of government responsible for policing varies from place to place  and may be at the national  regional or local level  Some countries have police forces that serve the same territory  with their jurisdiction depending on the type of crime or other circumstances  Other countries  such as Austria  Chile  Israel  New Zealand  the Philippines  South Africa and Sweden  have a single national police force              
In some places with multiple national police forces  one common arrangement is to have a civilian police force and a paramilitary gendarmerie  such as the Police Nationale and National Gendarmerie in France               The French policing system spread to other countries through the Napoleonic Wars              and the French colonial empire                            Another example is the Polic a Nacional and Guardia Civil in Spain  In both France and Spain  the civilian force polices urban areas and the paramilitary force polices rural areas  Italy has a similar arrangement with the Polizia di Stato and Carabinieri  though their jurisdictions overlap more  Some countries have separate agencies for uniformed police and detectives  such as the Military Police and Civil Police in Brazil and the Carabineros and Investigations Police in Chile 
Other countries have sub national police forces  but for the most part their jurisdictions do not overlap  In many countries  especially federations  there may be two or more tiers of police force  each serving different levels of government and enforcing different subsets of the law  In Australia and Germany  the majority of policing is carried out by state  i e  provincial  police forces  which are supplemented by a federal police force  Though not a federation  the United Kingdom has a similar arrangement  where policing is primarily the responsibility of a regional police force and specialist units exist at the national level  In Canada  the Royal Canadian Mounted Police  RCMP  are the federal police  while municipalities can decide whether to run a local police service or to contract local policing duties to a larger one  Most urban areas have a local police service  while most rural areas contract it to the RCMP  or to the provincial police in Ontario and Quebec 
The United States has a highly decentralized and fragmented system of law enforcement  with over        state and local law enforcement agencies               These agencies include local police  county law enforcement  often in the form of a sheriff s office  or county police   state police and federal law enforcement agencies  Federal agencies  such as the FBI  only have jurisdiction over federal crimes or those that involve more than one state  Other federal agencies have jurisdiction over a specific type of crime  Examples include the Federal Protective Service  which patrols and protects government buildings  the Postal Inspection Service  which protect United States Postal Service facilities  vehicles and items  the Park Police  which protect national parks  and Amtrak Police  which patrol Amtrak stations and trains  There are also some government agencies and uniformed services that perform police functions in addition to other duties  such as the Coast Guard 

International
United Nations Police members in Goma  Democratic Republic of the Congo
Most countries are members of the International Criminal Police Organization  Interpol   established to detect and fight transnational crime and provide for international co operation and co ordination of other police activities  such as notifying relatives of the death of foreign nationals  Interpol does not conduct investigations or arrests by itself  but only serves as a central point for information on crime  suspects and criminals  Political crimes are excluded from its competencies 
The terms international policing  transnational policing  and or global policing began to be used from the early     s onwards to describe forms of policing that transcended the boundaries of the sovereign nation state                            These terms refer in variable ways to practices and forms for policing that  in some sense  transcend national borders  This includes a variety of practices  but international police cooperation  criminal intelligence exchange between police agencies working in different nation states  and police development aid to weak  failed or failing states are the three types that have received the most scholarly attention 
Historical studies reveal that policing agents have undertaken a variety of cross border police missions for many years               For example  in the   th century a number of European policing agencies undertook cross border surveillance because of concerns about anarchist agitators and other political radicals  A notable example of this was the occasional surveillance by Prussian police of Karl Marx during the years he remained resident in London  The interests of public police agencies in cross border co operation in the control of political radicalism and ordinary law crime were primarily initiated in Europe  which eventually led to the establishment of Interpol before World War II  There are also many interesting examples of cross border policing under private auspices and by municipal police forces that date back to the   th century               It has been established that modern policing has transgressed national boundaries from time to time almost from its inception  It is also generally agreed that in the post Cold War era this type of practice became more significant and frequent              
Few empirical works on the practices of inter transnational information and intelligence sharing have been undertaken  A notable exception is James Sheptycki s study of police cooperation in the English Channel region               which provides a systematic content analysis of information exchange files and a description of how these transnational information and intelligence exchanges are transformed into police casework  The study showed that transnational police information sharing was routinized in the cross Channel region from      on the basis of agreements directly between the police agencies and without any formal agreement between the countries concerned  By       with the signing of the Schengen Treaty  which formalized aspects of police information exchange across the territory of the European Union  there were worries that much  if not all  of this intelligence sharing was opaque  raising questions about the efficacy of the accountability mechanisms governing police information sharing in Europe              
Studies of this kind outside of Europe are even rarer  so it is difficult to make generalizations  but one small scale study that compared transnational police information and intelligence sharing practices at specific cross border locations in North America and Europe confirmed that the low visibility of police information and intelligence sharing was a common feature               Intelligence led policing is now common practice in most advanced countries              and it is likely that police intelligence sharing and information exchange has a common morphology around the world               James Sheptycki has analyzed the effects of the new information technologies on the organization of policing intelligence and suggests that a number of  organizational pathologies  have arisen that make the functioning of security intelligence processes in transnational policing deeply problematic  He argues that transnational police information circuits help to  compose the panic scenes of the security control society                The paradoxical effect is that  the harder policing agencies work to produce security  the greater are feelings of insecurity 
Police development aid to weak  failed or failing states is another form of transnational policing that has garnered attention  This form of transnational policing plays an increasingly important role in United Nations peacekeeping and this looks set to grow in the years ahead  especially as the international community seeks to develop the rule of law and reform security institutions in states recovering from conflict               With transnational police development aid the imbalances of power between donors and recipients are stark and there are questions about the applicability and transportability of policing models between jurisdictions              
One topic concerns making transnational policing institutions democratically accountable               According to the Global Accountability Report for       Interpol had the lowest scores in its category  IGOs   coming in tenth with a score of     on overall accountability capabilities              

Overseas policing
See also  Chinese police overseas service stations
A police force may establish its presence in a foreign country with or without the permission of the host state  In the case of China and the ruling Communist Party  this has involved setting up unofficial police service stations around the world  and using coercive means to influence the behaviour of members of the Chinese diaspora and especially those who hold Chinese citizenship  Political dissidents have been harassed and intimidated in a form of transnational repression and convinced to return to China               Many of these actions were illegal in the states where they occurred  Such police stations have been established in dozens of countries around the world               with some  such as the UK              and the US               forcing them to close 

Equipment
Weapons

In many jurisdictions  police officers carry firearms  primarily handguns  in the normal course of their duties  In the United Kingdom  except Northern Ireland   Iceland  Ireland  New Zealand  Norway  and Malta  with the exception of specialist units  officers do not carry firearms as a matter of course  New Zealand and Norwegian police carry firearms in their vehicles  but not on their duty belts  and must obtain authorization before the weapons can be removed from the vehicle unless their life or the life of others are in danger              
Police often have specialized units for handling armed offenders or dangerous situations where combat is likely  such as police tactical units or authorised firearms officers  In some jurisdictions  depending on the circumstances  police can call on the military for assistance  as military aid to the civil power is an aspect of many armed forces  Perhaps the most high profile example of this was in       when the British Army s Special Air Service was deployed to resolve the Iranian Embassy siege on behalf of the Metropolitan Police 
They can also be armed with  non lethal   more accurately known as  less than lethal  or  less lethal  given that they can still be deadly               weaponry  particularly for riot control  or to inflict pain against a resistant suspect to force them to surrender without lethally wounding them  Non lethal weapons include batons  tear gas  riot control agents  rubber bullets  riot shields  water cannons  and electroshock weapons  Police officers typically carry handcuffs to restrain suspects 
The use of firearms or deadly force is typically a last resort only to be used when necessary to save the lives of others or themselves  though some jurisdictions  such as Brazil  allow its use against fleeing felons and escaped convicts  Police officers in the United States are generally allowed to use deadly force if they believe their life is in danger  a policy that has been criticized for being vague               South African police have a  shoot to kill  policy  which allows officers to use deadly force against any person who poses a significant threat to them               With the country having one of the highest rates of violent crime  President Jacob Zuma stated that South Africa needs to handle crime differently from other countries              

Communications
Modern police forces make extensive use of two way radio communications equipment  carried both on the person and installed in vehicles  to coordinate their work  share information  and get help quickly  Vehicle installed mobile data terminals enhance the ability of police communications  enabling easier dispatching of calls  criminal background checks on persons of interest to be completed in a matter of seconds  and updating officers  daily activity log and other required reports  on a real time basis  Other common pieces of police equipment include flashlights  whistles  police notebooks  and  ticket books  or citations  Some police departments have developed advanced computerized data display and communication systems to bring real time data to officers  one example being the NYPD s Domain Awareness System 

Vehicles
Main article  Police transport
New South Wales Police Force vehicles outside a police station in Eastwood  Sydney
Police vehicles are used for detaining  patrolling  and transporting over wide areas that an officer could not effectively cover otherwise  The average police car used for standard patrol is a four door sedan  SUV  or CUV  often modified by the manufacturer or police force s fleet services to provide better performance  Pickup trucks  off road vehicles  and vans are often used in utility roles  though in some jurisdictions or situations  such as those where dirt roads are common  off roading is required  or the nature of the officer s assignment necessitates it   they may be used as standard patrol cars  Sports cars are typically not used by police due to cost and maintenance issues  though those that are used are typically only assigned to traffic enforcement or community policing  and are rarely  if ever  assigned to standard patrol or authorized to respond to dangerous calls  such as armed calls or pursuits  where the likelihood of the vehicle being damaged or destroyed is high  Police vehicles are usually marked with appropriate symbols and equipped with sirens and flashing emergency lights to make others aware of police presence or response  in most jurisdictions  police vehicles with their sirens and emergency lights on have right of way in traffic  while in other jurisdictions  emergency lights may be kept on while patrolling to ensure ease of visibility  Unmarked or undercover police vehicles are used primarily for traffic enforcement or apprehending criminals without alerting them to their presence  The use of unmarked police vehicles for traffic enforcement is controversial  with the state of New York banning this practice in      on the grounds that it endangered motorists who might be pulled over by police impersonators              
Motorcycles  having historically been a mainstay in police fleets  are commonly used  particularly in locations that a car may not be able to reach  to control potential public order situations involving meetings of motorcyclists  and often in police escorts where motorcycle police officers can quickly clear a path for escorted vehicles  Bicycle patrols are used in some areas  often downtown areas or parks  because they allow for wider and faster area coverage than officers on foot  Bicycles are also commonly used by riot police to create makeshift barricades against protesters              
Police aviation consists of helicopters and fixed wing aircraft  while police watercraft tend to consist of RHIBs  motorboats  and patrol boats  SWAT vehicles are used by police tactical units  and often consist of four wheeled armored personnel carriers used to transport tactical teams while providing armored cover  equipment storage space  or makeshift battering ram capabilities  these vehicles are typically not armed and do not patrol and are only used to transport  Mobile command posts may also be used by some police forces to establish identifiable command centers at the scene of major situations 
Police cars may contain issued long guns  ammunition for issued weapons  less lethal weaponry  riot control equipment  traffic cones  road flares  physical barricades or barricade tape  fire extinguishers               first aid kits  or defibrillators              

Strategies
Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department officers outside a k ban  small police station  in Roppongi  Tokyo  K ban allow police to establish a permanent police presence and offer police station services across a wide area  while taking up minimal space 
The advent of the police car  two way radio  and telephone in the early   th century transformed policing into a reactive strategy that focused on responding to calls for service away from their beat               With this transformation  police command and control became more centralized 
In the United States  August Vollmer introduced other reforms  including education requirements for police officers               O W  Wilson  a student of Vollmer  helped reduce corruption and introduce professionalism in Wichita  Kansas  and later in the Chicago Police Department               Strategies employed by O W  Wilson included rotating officers from community to community to reduce their vulnerability to corruption  establishing of a non partisan police board to help govern the police force  a strict merit system for promotions within the department  and an aggressive recruiting drive with higher police salaries to attract professionally qualified officers               During the professionalism era of policing  law enforcement agencies concentrated on dealing with felonies and other serious crime and conducting visible car patrols in between  rather than broader focus on crime prevention              
The Kansas City Preventive Patrol study in the early     s showed flaws in using visible car patrols for crime prevention  It found that aimless car patrols did little to deter crime and often went unnoticed by the public  Patrol officers in cars had insufficient contact and interaction with the community  leading to a social rift between the two               In the     s and     s  many law enforcement agencies began to adopt community policing strategies  and others adopted problem oriented policing 
Broken windows  policing was another  related approach introduced in the     s by James Q  Wilson and George L  Kelling  who suggested that police should pay greater attention to minor  quality of life  offenses and disorderly conduct  The concept behind this method is simple  broken windows  graffiti  and other physical destruction or degradation of property create an environment in which crime and disorder is more likely  The presence of broken windows and graffiti sends a message that authorities do not care and are not trying to correct problems in these areas  Therefore  correcting these small problems prevents more serious criminal activity               The theory was popularised in the early     s by police chief William J  Bratton and New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani  It was emulated in     s in Kazakhstan through zero tolerance policing  Yet it failed to produce meaningful results in this country because citizens distrusted police while state leaders preferred police loyalty over police good behavior              
Building upon these earlier models  intelligence led policing has also become an important strategy  Intelligence led policing and problem oriented policing are complementary strategies  both of which involve systematic use of information               Although it still lacks a universally accepted definition  the crux of intelligence led policing is an emphasis on the collection and analysis of information to guide police operations  rather than the reverse              
A related development is evidence based policing  In a similar vein to evidence based policy  evidence based policing is the use of controlled experiments to find which methods of policing are more effective  Leading advocates of evidence based policing include the criminologist Lawrence W  Sherman and philanthropist Jerry Lee  Findings from controlled experiments include the Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment               evidence that patrols deter crime if they are concentrated in crime hotspots              and that restricting police powers to shoot suspects does not cause an increase in crime or violence against police officers               Use of experiments to assess the usefulness of strategies has been endorsed by many police services and institutions  including the U S  Police Foundation and the UK College of Policing 

Power restrictions
Los Angeles Police Department officers arresting suspects during a traffic stop
In many nations  criminal procedure law has been developed to regulate officers  discretion  so that they do not arbitrarily or unjustly exercise their powers of arrest  search and seizure  and use of force  In the United States  Miranda v  Arizona led to the widespread use of Miranda warnings or constitutional warnings 
In Miranda the court created safeguards against self incriminating statements made after an arrest  The court held that  The prosecution may not use statements  whether exculpatory or inculpatory  stemming from questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way  unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the Fifth Amendment s privilege against self incrimination              
Police in the United States are also prohibited from holding criminal suspects for more than a reasonable amount of time  usually       hours  before arraignment  using torture  abuse or physical threats to extract confessions  using excessive force to effect an arrest  and searching suspects  bodies or their homes without a warrant obtained upon a showing of probable cause  The four exceptions to the constitutional requirement of a search warrant are 

Consent
Search incident to arrest
Motor vehicle searches
Exigent circumstances
In Terry v  Ohio        the court divided seizure into two parts  the investigatory stop and arrest  The court further held that during an investigatory stop a police officer s search    is  confined to what  is  minimally necessary to determine whether  a suspect  is armed  and the intrusion  which  is  made for the sole purpose of protecting himself and others nearby   is  confined to ascertaining the presence of weapons   U S  Supreme Court   Before Terry  every police encounter constituted an arrest  giving the police officer the full range of search authority  Search authority during a Terry stop  investigatory stop  is limited to weapons only              
Using deception for confessions is permitted  but not coercion  There are exceptions or exigent circumstances such as an articulated need to disarm a suspect or searching a suspect who has already been arrested  Search Incident to an Arrest   The Posse Comitatus Act severely restricts the use of the military for police activity  giving added importance to police SWAT units 
British police officers are governed by similar rules  such as those introduced to England and Wales under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act       PACE   but generally have greater powers  They may  for example  legally search any suspect who has been arrested  or their vehicles  home or business premises  without a warrant  and may seize anything they find in a search as evidence 
All police officers in the United Kingdom  whatever their actual rank  are  constables  in terms of their legal position  This means that a newly appointed constable has the same arrest powers as a Chief Constable or Commissioner  However  certain higher ranks have additional powers to authorize certain aspects of police operations  such as a power to authorize a search of a suspect s house  section    PACE in England and Wales  by an officer of the rank of Inspector  or the power to authorize a suspect s detention beyond    hours by a Superintendent 

Conduct  accountability and public confidence
Main article  Police accountability

Police services commonly include units for investigating crimes committed by the police themselves  These units are typically called internal affairs or inspectorate general units  In some countries separate organizations outside the police exist for such purposes  such as the British Independent Office for Police Conduct  However  due to American laws around qualified immunity  it has become increasingly difficult to investigate and charge police misconduct and crimes              
Likewise  some state and local jurisdictions  for example  Springfield  Illinois              have similar outside review organizations  The Police Service of Northern Ireland is investigated by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland  an external agency set up as a result of the Patten report into policing the province  In the Republic of Ireland  the Garda S och na is investigated by Fiosr    the Office of the Police Ombudsman  a body founded as Garda S och na Ombudsman Commission to replace the Garda Complaints Board in May       and reorganised under its new title in      
The Special Investigations Unit of Ontario  Canada  is one of only a few civilian agencies around the world responsible for investigating circumstances involving police and others that have resulted in a death  serious injury  or allegations of sexual assault  The agency has made allegations of insufficient cooperation from various police services hindering their investigations              
In Hong Kong  any allegations of corruption within the police are investigated by the Independent Commission Against Corruption and the Independent Police Complaints Council  two agencies which are independent of the police force 
Police body cameras are often worn by police officers to record their interactions with the public and each other  providing audiovisual recorded evidence for review in the event an officer or agency s actions are investigated              

Use of force

Main article  Police misconduct
Police forces also find themselves under criticism for their use of force  particularly deadly force               Specifically  tension increases when a police officer of one ethnic group harms or kills a suspect of another one               In the United States  such events occasionally spark protests and accusations of racism against police and allegations that police departments practice racial profiling  Similar incidents have also happened in other countries 
In the United States since the     s  concern over such issues has increasingly weighed upon law enforcement agencies  courts and legislatures at every level of government  Incidents such as the      Watts riots  the videotaped      beating by LAPD officers of Rodney King  and the riot following their acquittal have been suggested by some people to be evidence that U S  police are dangerously lacking in appropriate controls 
The fact that this trend has occurred contemporaneously with the rise of the civil rights movement  the  War on Drugs   and a precipitous rise in violent crime from the     s to the     s has made questions surrounding the role  administration and scope of police authority increasingly complicated              
Police departments and the local governments that oversee them in some jurisdictions have attempted to mitigate some of these issues through community outreach programs and community policing to make the police more accessible to the concerns of local communities  by working to increase hiring diversity  by updating training of police in their responsibilities to the community and under the law  and by increased oversight within the department or by civilian commissions 
In cases in which such measures have been lacking or absent  civil lawsuits have been brought by the United States Department of Justice against local law enforcement agencies  authorized under the      Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act  This has compelled local departments to make organizational changes  enter into consent decree settlements to adopt such measures  and submit to oversight by the Justice Department              
In May       a global movement to increase scrutiny of police violence grew in popularity  starting in Minneapolis  Minnesota with the murder of George Floyd  Calls for defunding of the police and full abolition of the police gained larger support in the United States as more criticized systemic racism in policing              
Critics also argue that sometimes this abuse of force or power can extend to police officer civilian life as well  For example  critics note that women in around     of police officer families have experienced domestic violence              and that police officers are convicted of misdemeanors and felonies at a rate of more than six times higher than concealed carry weapon permit holders              

Protection of individuals
The Supreme Court of the United States has consistently ruled that law enforcement officers in the U S  have no duty to protect any individual  only to enforce the law in general  This is despite the motto of many police departments in the U S  being a variation of  protect and serve   regardless  many departments generally expect their officers to protect individuals  The first case to make such a ruling was South v  State of Maryland in                    and the most recent was Town of Castle Rock v  Gonzales in                   
In contrast  the police are entitled to protect private rights in some jurisdictions  To ensure that the police would not interfere in the regular competencies of the courts of law  some police acts require that the police may only interfere in such cases where protection from courts cannot be obtained in time  and where  without interference of the police  the realization of the private right would be impeded               This would  for example  allow police to establish a restaurant guest s identity and forward it to the innkeeper in a case where the guest cannot pay the bill at nighttime because his wallet had just been stolen from the restaurant table 
In addition  there are federal law enforcement agencies in the United States whose mission includes providing protection for executives such as the president and accompanying family members  visiting foreign dignitaries  and other high ranking individuals                   better      source      needed      Such agencies include the U S  Secret Service and the U S  Park Police
