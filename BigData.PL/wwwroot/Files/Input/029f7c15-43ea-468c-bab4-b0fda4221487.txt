Authoritarianism is a political system characterized by the rejection of political plurality  the use of strong central power to preserve the political status quo  and reductions in democracy  separation of powers  and the rule of law                        Authoritarian regimes may be either autocratic or oligarchic and may be based upon the rule of a party or the military                        States that have a blurred boundary between democracy and authoritarianism have some times been characterized as  hybrid democracies    hybrid regimes  or  competitive authoritarian  states                                  
The political scientist Juan Linz  in an influential                 work  An Authoritarian Regime  Spain  defined authoritarianism as possessing four qualities 

Limited political pluralism  which is achieved with constraints on the legislature  political parties and interest groups 
Political legitimacy based on appeals to emotion and identification of the regime as a necessary evil to combat  easily recognizable societal problems  such as underdevelopment or insurgency  
Minimal political mobilization  and suppression of anti regime activities 
Ill defined executive powers  often vague and shifting  used to extend the power of the executive                        
Minimally defined  an authoritarian government lacks free and competitive direct elections to legislatures  free and competitive direct or indirect elections for executives  or both                                                  Broadly defined  authoritarian states include countries that lack human rights such as freedom of religion  or countries in which the government and the opposition do not alternate in power at least once following free elections              Authoritarian states might contain nominally democratic institutions such as political parties  legislatures and elections which are managed to entrench authoritarian rule and can feature fraudulent  non competitive elections             
Since       the share of authoritarian states in the international political system increased until the mid     s but declined from then until the year                   Prior to       dictatorships typically began with a coup and replaced a pre existing authoritarian regime              Since       dictatorships are most likely to begin through democratic backsliding whereby a democratically elected leader established an authoritarian regime             
Authoritarian states usually result in worse health outcomes  a weaker economy and more corruption than in more democratic nations 


Characteristics
Authoritarianism is characterized by highly concentrated and centralized government power maintained by political repression and the exclusion of potential or supposed challengers by armed force  It uses political parties and mass organizations to mobilize people around the goals of the regime              Adam Przeworski has theorized that  authoritarian equilibrium rests mainly on lies  fear and economic prosperity              
Authoritarianism also tends to embrace the informal and unregulated exercise of political power  a leadership that is  self appointed and even if elected cannot be displaced by citizens  free choice among competitors   the arbitrary deprivation of civil liberties and little tolerance for meaningful opposition              A range of social controls also attempt to stifle civil society while political stability is maintained by control over and support of the armed forces  a bureaucracy staffed by the regime and creation of allegiance through various means of socialization and indoctrination              Pippa Norris and Ronald Inglehart identify authoritarianism in politicians and political parties by looking for values of security  conformity  and obedience             
Authoritarianism is marked by  indefinite political tenure  of the ruler or ruling party  often in a one party state  or other authority              The transition from an authoritarian system to a more democratic form of government is referred to as democratization             

Constitutions in authoritarian regimes
Authoritarian regimes often adopt  the institutional trappings  of democracies such as constitutions              Constitutions in authoritarian states may serve a variety of roles  including  operating manual   describing how the government is to function    billboard   signal of regime s intent    blueprint   outline of future regime plans   and  window dressing   material designed to obfuscate  such as provisions setting forth freedoms that are not honored in practice               Authoritarian constitutions may help legitimize  strengthen  and consolidate regimes              An authoritarian constitution  that successfully coordinates government action and defines popular expectations can also help consolidate the regime s grip on power by inhibiting re coordination on a different set of arrangements               Unlike democratic constitutions  authoritarian constitutions do not set direct limits on executive authority  however  in some cases such documents may function as ways for elites to protect their own property rights or constrain autocrats  behavior             
The Soviet Russia Constitution of       the first charter of the new Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic  RSFSR   was described by Vladimir Lenin as a  revolutionary  document  It was  he said  unlike any constitution drafted by a nation state              The concept of  authoritarian constitutionalism  has been developed by legal scholar Mark Tushnet              Tushnet distinguishes authoritarian constitutionalist regimes from  liberal constitutionalist  regimes   the sort familiar in the modern West  with core commitments to human rights and self governance implemented by means of varying institutional devices   and from purely authoritarian regimes  which reject the idea of human rights or constraints on leaders  power               He describes authoritarian constitutionalist regimes as     authoritarian dominant party states that     impose sanctions  such as libel judgments  against  but do not arbitrarily arrest  political dissidents      permit  reasonably open discussion and criticism of its policies       hold  reasonably free and fair elections   without systemic intimidation  but  with close attention to such matters as the drawing of election districts and the creation of party lists to ensure as best it can that it will prevail                  and by a substantial margin       reflect at least occasional responsiveness to public opinion  and     create  mechanisms to ensure that the amount of dissent does not exceed the level it regards as desirable   Tushnet cites Singapore as an example of an authoritarian constitutionalist state  and connects the concept to that of hybrid regimes             

Economy
Scholars such as Seymour Lipset              Carles Boix  Susan Stokes              Dietrich Rueschemeyer  Evelyne Stephens and John Stephens             argue that economic development increases the likelihood of democratization  Adam Przeworski and Fernando Limongi argue that while economic development makes democracies less likely to turn authoritarian  there is insufficient evidence to conclude that development causes democratization  turning an authoritarian state into a democracy              
Eva Bellin argues that under certain circumstances the bourgeoise and labor are more likely to favor democratization  but less so under other circumstances              Economic development can boost public support for authoritarian regimes in the short to medium term             
According to Michael Albertus  most land reform programs tend to be implemented by authoritarian regimes that subsequently withhold property rights from the beneficiaries of the land reform  Authoritarian regimes do so to gain coercive leverage over rural populations             

Institutions
Authoritarian regimes typically incorporate similar political institutions to that of democratic regimes  such as legislatures and judiciaries  although they may serve different purposes  Democratic regimes are marked by institutions that are essential to economic development and individual freedom  including representative legislatures and competitive political parties                          Most authoritarian regimes embrace these political structures  but use it in a way that reinforces their power              Authoritarian legislatures  for example  are forums through which leaders may enhance their bases of support  share power  and monitor elites              Additionally  authoritarian party systems are extremely unstable and unconducive to party development  largely due to monopolistic patterns of authority              Judiciaries may be present in authoritarian states where they serve to repress political challengers  institutionalize punishment  and undermine the rule of law             
Democratic and authoritarian arguably differ most prominently in their elections  Democratic elections are generally inclusive  competitive  and fair              In most instances  the elected leader is appointed to act on behalf of the general will  Authoritarian elections  on the other hand  are frequently subject to fraud and extreme constraints on the participation of opposing parties              Autocratic leaders employ tactics like murdering political opposition and paying election monitors to ensure victory                          The proportion of authoritarian regimes with elections and support parties has risen in recent years              This is largely due to the increasing popularity of democracies and electoral autocracies  leading authoritarian regimes to imitate democratic regimes in hopes of receiving foreign aid and dodging criticism                          Flawed elections also give authoritarians a controlled way to monitor public sentiment             
According to a      study  most party led dictatorships regularly hold popular elections  Prior to the     s  most of these elections had no alternative parties or candidates for voters to choose  Since the end of the Cold War  about two thirds of elections in authoritarian systems allow for some opposition  but the elections are structured in a way to heavily favor the incumbent authoritarian regime              In       almost half of all authoritarian systems had multi party governments              Cabinet appointments by an authoritarian regime to outsiders can consolidate their rule by dividing the opposition and co opting outsiders             
Hindrances to free and fair elections in authoritarian systems may include             

Control of the media by the authoritarian incumbents 
Interference with opposition campaigning 
Electoral fraud 
Violence against opposition 
Large scale spending by the state in favor of the incumbents 
Permitting of some parties  but not others 
Prohibitions on opposition parties  but not independent candidates 
Allowing competition between candidates within the incumbent party  but not those who are not in the incumbent party 
Interactions with other elites and the masses
The foundations of stable authoritarian rule are that the authoritarian prevents contestation from the masses and other elites  The authoritarian regime may use co optation or repression  or carrots and sticks  to prevent revolts                          Authoritarian rule entails a balancing act whereby the ruler has to maintain the support of other elites  frequently through the distribution of state and societal resources  and the support of the public  through distribution of the same resources   the authoritarian rule is at risk if the balancing act is lopsided  as it risks a coup by the elites or an uprising by the mass public                         

Manipulation of information
Main articles  Political censorship and Propaganda
According to a      study by Sergei Guriev and Daniel Treisman  authoritarian regimes have over time become less reliant on violence and mass repression to maintain control  The study shows instead that authoritarians have increasingly resorted to manipulation of information as a means of control  Authoritarians increasingly seek to create an appearance of good performance  conceal state repression  and imitate democracy             
While authoritarian regimes invest considerably in propaganda out of a belief that it enhances regime survival  scholars have offered mixed views as to whether propaganda is effective             

Systemic weakness and resilience
Andrew J  Nathan notes that  regime theory holds that authoritarian systems are inherently fragile because of weak legitimacy  overreliance on coercion  over centralization of decision making  and the predominance of personal power over institutional norms      Few authoritarian regimes                  be they communist  fascist  corporatist  or personalist                  have managed to conduct orderly  peaceful  timely  and stable successions              
Political scientist Theodore M  Vestal writes that authoritarian political systems may be weakened through inadequate responsiveness to either popular or elite demands and that the authoritarian tendency to respond to challenges by exerting tighter control  instead of by adapting  may compromise the legitimacy of an authoritarian state and lead to its collapse             
One exception to this general trend is the endurance of the authoritarian rule of the Chinese Communist Party which has been unusually resilient among authoritarian regimes  Nathan posits that this can be attributed to four factors such as      the increasingly norm bound nature of its succession politics        the increase in meritocratic as opposed to factional considerations in the promotion of political elites        the differentiation and functional specialization of institutions within the regime   and      the establishment of institutions for political participation and appeal that strengthen the CCP s legitimacy among the public at large              
Some scholars have challenged notions that authoritarian states are inherently brittle systems that require repression and propaganda to make people comply with the authoritarian regime  Adam Przeworski has challenged this  noting that while authoritarian regimes do take actions that serve to enhance regime survival  they also engage in mundane everyday governance and their subjects do not hold a posture towards the regime at all moments of their life  He writes   People in autocracies do not incessantly live under the shadow of dramatic historical events  they lead everyday routine lives               Similarly  Thomas Pepinsky has challenged the common mental image of an authoritarian state as one of grim totalitarianism  desperate hardship  strict censorship  and dictatorial orders of murder  torture and disappearances  He writes   life in authoritarian states is mostly boring and tolerable              

Violence
Yale University political scientist Milan Svolik argues that violence is a common characteristic of authoritarian systems  Violence tends to be common in authoritarian states because of a lack of independent third parties empowered to settle disputes between the dictator  regime allies  regime soldiers and the masses             
Authoritarians may resort to measures referred to as coup proofing  structures that make it hard for any small group to seize power   Coup proofing strategies include strategically placing family  ethnic  and religious groups in the military  creating of an armed force parallel to the regular military  and developing multiple internal security agencies with overlapping jurisdiction that constantly monitor one another              Research shows that some coup proofing strategies reduce the risk of coups occurring                         and reduce the likelihood of mass protests              However  coup proofing reduces military effectiveness                                                  and limits the rents that an incumbent can extract              A      study shows that the implementation of succession rules reduce the occurrence of coup attempts              Succession rules are believed to hamper coordination efforts among coup plotters by assuaging elites who have more to gain by patience than by plotting              According to political scientists Curtis Bell and Jonathan Powell  coup attempts in neighboring countries lead to greater coup proofing and coup related repression in a region              A      study finds that countries  coup proofing strategies are heavily influenced by other countries with similar histories              A      study in the Journal of Peace Research found that leaders who survive coup attempts and respond by purging known and potential rivals are likely to have longer tenures as leaders              A      study in Conflict Management and Peace Science found that personalist dictatorships are more likely to take coup proofing measures than other authoritarian regimes  the authors argue that this is because  personalists are characterized by weak institutions and narrow support bases  a lack of unifying ideologies and informal links to the ruler              
According to a      study  personalist dictatorships are more repressive than other forms of dictatorship             

Typologies
According to Yale professor Juan Jos  Linz there a three main types of political regimes today  democracies 
totalitarian regimes and  sitting between these two  authoritarian regimes  with hybrid regimes                          
According to University of Michigan professor Dan Slater  modern forms of authoritarianism are fundamentally dissimilar from historical forms of nondemocratic rule  He links modern authoritarianism to the era of mass politics  which began with the French Revolution             

Similar terms
An authoritarian regime has  a concentration of power in a leader or an elite not constitutionally responsible to the people               Unlike totalitarian states  they will allow social and economic institutions not under governmental control              and tend to rely on passive mass acceptance rather than active popular support             
An Autocracy is a state government in which one person possesses  unlimited power  
A Totalitarian state is  based on subordination of the individual to the state and strict control of all aspects of the life and productive capacity of the nation especially by coercive measures  such as censorship and terrorism                and are ruled by a single ruling party made up of loyal supporters              Unlike autocracies  which  seek only to gain absolute political power and to outlaw opposition               totalitarian states are characterized by an official ideology  which  seek only to gain absolute political power and to outlaw opposition               and  seek to dominate every aspect of everyone s life as a prelude to world domination              
A Fascist state is autocratic and based on a political philosophy movement   such as that of the Fascisti of pre WWII Italy   that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader  severe economic and social regimentation  and forcible suppression of opposition              
Authoritarian personality is the personality type treating authority figures with obedience  A study found evidence for both left wing and right wing authoritarianism             
Subtypes
Several subtypes of authoritarian regimes have been identified by Linz and others              Linz identified the two most basic subtypes as traditional authoritarian regimes and bureaucratic military authoritarian regimes 

Traditional authoritarian regimes are those  in which the ruling authority  generally a single person   is maintained in power  through a combination of appeals to traditional legitimacy  patron client ties and repression  which is carried out by an apparatus bound to the ruling authority through personal loyalties   An example is Ethiopia under Haile Selassie I             Honoring South Korean President Park Chung hee in Army Parade at Armed Forces Day on   October     
Bureaucratic military authoritarian regimes are those  governed by a coalition of military officers and technocrats who act pragmatically  rather than ideologically  within the limits of their bureaucratic mentality               Mark J  Gasiorowski suggests that it is best to distinguish  simple military authoritarian regimes  from  bureaucratic authoritarian regimes  in which  a powerful group of technocrats uses the state apparatus to try to rationalize and develop the economy  such South Korea under Park Chung hee             
According to Barbara Geddes  there are seven typologies of authoritarian regimes  dominant party regimes  military regime  personalist regimes  monarchies  oligarchic regimes  indirect military regimes  or hybrids of the first three             
Subtypes of authoritarian regimes identified by Linz are corporatist or organic statistic  racial and ethnic  democracy  and post totalitarian             

Corporatist authoritarian regimes  are those in which corporatism institutions are used extensively by the state to coopt and demobilize powerful interest groups   This type has been studied most extensively in Latin America             
Racial and ethnic  democracies  are those in which  certain racial or ethnic groups enjoy full democratic rights while others are largely or entirely denied those rights   such as in South Africa under apartheid             
Post totalitarian authoritarian regimes are those in which totalitarian institutions  such as the party  secret police and state controlled mass media              remain  but where  ideological orthodoxy has declined in favor of routinization  repression has declined  the state s top leadership is less personalized and more secure  and the level of mass mobilization has declined substantially               Examples include the Russian Federation and Soviet Eastern Bloc states in the mid     s              The post Mao Zedong People s Republic of China was viewed as post totalitarian in the     s and early     s  with a limited degree of increase in pluralism and civil society                          however  in the     s  particularly after Xi Jinping succeeded as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and rose to power in       Chinese state repression sharply increased  aided by digital control and mass surveillance

Authoritarian regimes are also sometimes subcategorized by whether they are more personalistic or populist                  additional citation s  needed      Personalistic authoritarian regimes are characterized by arbitrary rule and authority exercised  mainly through patronage networks and coercion rather than through institutions and formal rules               Personalistic authoritarian regimes have been seen in post colonial Africa  By contrast  populist authoritarian regimes  are mobilizational regimes in which a strong  charismatic  manipulative leader rules through a coalition involving key lower class groups               Examples include Argentina under Juan Per n              Russia under Vladimir Putin  Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser             and Venezuela under Hugo Ch vez and Nicol s Maduro                         
A typology of authoritarian regimes by political scientists Brian Lai and Dan Slater includes four categories 

machine  oligarchic party dictatorships  
bossism  autocratic party dictatorships  
juntas  oligarchic military dictatorships   and
strongman  autocratic military dictatorships             
Lai and Slater argue that single party regimes are better than military regimes at developing institutions  e g  mass mobilization  patronage networks and coordination of elites  that are effective at continuing the regime s incumbency and diminishing domestic challengers  Lai and Slater also argue that military regimes more often initiate military conflicts or undertake other  desperate measures  to maintain control as compared to single party regimes                       
John Duckitt suggests a link between authoritarianism and collectivism  asserting that both stand in opposition to individualism              Duckitt writes that both authoritarianism and collectivism submerge individual rights and goals to group goals  expectations and conformities             
According to Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way  authoritarian regimes that are created in social revolutions are far more durable than other kinds of authoritarian regimes

V Dem Democracy Indices for      with blue more democratic and brown more authoritarian
Authoritarianism and democracy are not necessarily fundamental opposites and may be thought of as poles at opposite ends of a scale  so that it is possible for some democracies to possess authoritarian elements  and for an authoritarian system to have democratic elements                  unreliable source                                   verification needed      Authoritarian regimes may also be partly responsive to citizen grievances  although this is generally only regarding grievances that do not undermine the stability of the regime                           An illiberal democracy  or procedural democracy  is distinguished from liberal democracy  or substantive democracy  in that illiberal democracies lack features such as the rule of law  protections for minority groups  an independent judiciary and the real separation of powers                                                     
A further distinction that liberal democracies have rarely made war with one another  research has extended the theory and finds that more democratic countries tend to have few wars  sometimes called militarized interstate disputes  causing fewer battle deaths with one another and that democracies have far fewer civil wars                           
Research shows that the democratic nations have much less democide or murder by government  Those were also moderately developed nations before applying liberal democratic policies               Research by the World Bank suggests that political institutions are extremely important in determining the prevalence of corruption and that parliamentary systems  political stability and freedom of the press are all associated with lower corruption              
A      study by economist Alberto Abadie has concluded that terrorism is most common in nations with intermediate political freedom  The nations with the least terrorism are the most and least democratic nations  and that  transitions from an authoritarian regime to a democracy may be accompanied by temporary increases in terrorism                Studies in      and      similarly found a nonlinear relationship between political freedom and terrorism  with the most terrorist attacks occurring in partial democracies and the fewest in  strict autocracies and full fledged democracies                A      study by Amichai Magen demonstrated that liberal democracies and polyarchies not only suffer fewer terrorist attacks as compared to other regime types  but also suffer fewer casualties in terrorist attacks as compared to other regime types  which may be attributed to higher quality democracies  responsiveness to their citizens  demands  including  the desire for physical safety   resulting in  investment in intelligence  infrastructure protection  first responders  social resilience  and specialized medical care  which averts casualties               Magen also stated that terrorism in closed autocracies sharply increased starting in                   
Within national democratic governments  there may be subnational authoritarian enclaves  A prominent examples of this includes the Southern United States after Reconstruction  as well as areas of contemporary Argentina and Mexico                           

Competitive authoritarian regimes
Another type of authoritarian regime is the competitive authoritarian regime  a type of civilian regime that arose in the post Cold War era  In a competitive authoritarian regime   formal democratic institutions exist and are widely viewed as the primary means of gaining power  but     incumbents  abuse of the state places them at a significant advantage vis   vis their opponents                             The term was coined by Steven Levitsky and Lucan A  Way in their      book of the same name to discuss a type of hybrid regime that emerged during and after the Cold War                           
Competitive authoritarian regimes differ from fully authoritarian regimes in that elections are regularly held  the opposition can openly operate without a high risk of exile or imprisonment and  democratic procedures are sufficiently meaningful for opposition groups to take them seriously as arenas through which to contest for power                Competitive authoritarian regimes lack one or more of the three characteristics of democracies such as free elections  i e  elections untainted by substantial fraud or voter intimidation   protection of civil liberties  i e  the freedom of speech  press and association  and an even playing field  in terms of access to resources  the media and legal recourse               

Authoritarianism and fascism
Authoritarianism is considered a core concept of fascism                                                     and scholars agree that a fascist regime is foremost an authoritarian form of government  although not all authoritarian regimes are fascist  While authoritarianism is a defining characteristic of fascism  scholars argue that more distinguishing traits are needed to make an authoritarian regime fascist                                                                                                                      

Authoritarian socialism
These paragraphs are an excerpt from Authoritarian socialism  edit 
Authoritarian socialism  or socialism from above               is an economic and political system supporting some form of socialist economics while rejecting political pluralism  As a term  it represents a set of economic political systems describing themselves as  socialist  and rejecting the liberal democratic concepts of multi party politics  freedom of assembly  habeas corpus  and freedom of expression  either due to fear of counter revolution or as a means to socialist ends  Journalists and scholars have characterised  several countries  most notably the Soviet Union  China  Cuba  and their allies  as authoritarian socialist states

Multiple scholars have identified a form of libertarian authoritarianism emerging in the early   st century  Wendy Brown describes it as emerging from neoliberalism  opposing both democracy and public institutions while defining freedom in terms of speech and actions that promote homophobia  white supremacy and male privilege                            Other scholars have connected it to QAnon              and to the Argentinian Presidency of Javier Milei              
Carolin Amlinger and Oliver Nachtwey  in Offended Freedom  The Rise of Libertarian Authoritarianism  describe libertarian authoritarianism as arising from a backlash to government efforts to contain the COVID    pandemic and  more broadly  against the increasing complexity of the world  ultimately leading to hostility towards democracy                            Writing in Jacobin and New Statesman  Amlinger and Nachtwey define libertarian authoritarians as those who believe in the abolition of the democratic state on the basis of its restrictions on individual freedoms  and  consider the democratic state itself  the authorities and their regulations  to be invasive and harmful   they described the fundamental basis of libertarian authoritarianism to be based in  post truth politics   and that in the late modern era  believers validate their opinions  with proto scientific evidence  rumours  conspiracy theories and fake news   They describe neoliberalism as an additional factor contributing towards the recent rise of the ideology                            Individuals they identify as modern adherents to the ideology include Peter Thiel  Elon Musk  and Javier Milei  having merged their libertarianism with their  authoritarian tendencies                            

Authoritarianism and totalitarianism
Benito Mussolini  the founder of Italian fascism  called his regime the  Totalitarian State    Everything in the State  nothing outside the State  nothing against the State               
Totalitarianism is a label used by various political scientists to characterize the most tyrannical strain of authoritarian systems  in which the ruling elite  often subservient to a dictator  exert near total control of the social  political  economic  cultural and religious aspects of society in the territories under its governance              
Linz distinguished new forms of authoritarianism from personalistic dictatorships and totalitarian states  taking Francoist Spain as an example  Unlike personalistic dictatorships  new forms of authoritarianism have institutionalized representation of a variety of actors  in Spain s case  including the military  the Catholic Church  Falange  monarchists  technocrats and others   Unlike totalitarian states  the regime relies on passive mass acceptance rather than popular support              According to Juan Linz the distinction between an authoritarian regime and a totalitarian one is that an authoritarian regime seeks to suffocate politics and political mobilization while totalitarianism seeks to control and use them              Authoritarianism primarily differs from totalitarianism in that social and economic institutions exist that are not under governmental control  Building on the work of Yale political scientist Juan Linz  Paul C  Sondrol of the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs has examined the characteristics of authoritarian and totalitarian dictators and organized them in a chart

Sondrol argues that while both authoritarianism and totalitarianism are forms of autocracy  they differ in three key dichotomies 

    Unlike their bland and generally unpopular authoritarian brethren  totalitarian dictators develop a charismatic  mystique  and a mass based  pseudo democratic interdependence with their followers via the conscious manipulation of a prophetic image 
    Concomitant role conceptions differentiate totalitarians from authoritarians  Authoritarians view themselves as individual beings largely content to control and often maintain the status quo  Totalitarian self conceptions are largely teleological  The tyrant is less a person than an indispensable function to guide and reshape the universe 

    Consequently  the utilisation of power for personal aggrandizement is more evident among authoritarians than totalitarians  Lacking the binding appeal of ideology  authoritarians support their rule by a mixture of instilling fear and granting rewards to loyal collaborators  engendering a kleptocracy             
Kim Il Sung  founder of North Korea  established an authoritarian regime which was modeled after other totalitarian countries              
Compared to totalitarianism   the authoritarian state still maintains a certain distinction between state and society  It is only concerned with political power and as long as that is not contested it gives society a certain degree of liberty  Totalitarianism  on the other hand  invades private life and asphyxiates it                Another distinction is that  authoritarianism is not animated by utopian ideals in the way totalitarianism is  It does not attempt to change the world and human nature                Carl Joachim Friedrich writes that  a totalist ideology  a party reinforced by a secret police  and monopoly control of     industrial mass society  are the three features of totalitarian regimes that distinguish them from other autocracies              
Greg Yudin  a professor of political philosophy at the Moscow School of Social and Economic Sciences  argues  political passivity and civic disengagement  are  key features  of authoritarianism  while totalitarianism relies on  mass mobilization  terror and homogeneity of beliefs               

Economic effects
In       Dani Rodrik wrote that democracies outperform autocracies in terms of long term economic growth  economic stability  adjustments to external economic shocks  human capital investment  and economic equality               A      study by Daron Acemoglu  Suresh Naidu  Pascual Restrepo  and James A  Robinson found that democracy increases GDP per capita by about    percent over the long term               According to Amartya Sen  no functioning liberal democracy has ever suffered a large scale famine               Studies suggest that several health indicators  life expectancy and infant and maternal mortality  have a stronger and more significant association with democracy than they have with GDP per capita  size of the public sector or income inequality               States that undergo democratic backsliding are more likely to face downgrades in their sovereign bond ratings              
One of the few areas that some scholars have theorized that autocracies may have an advantage  is in industrialization               In the   th century  Seymour Martin Lipset argued that low income authoritarian regimes have certain technocratic  efficiency enhancing advantages  over low income democracies that gives authoritarian regimes an advantage in economic development               By contrast  Morton H  Halperin  Joseph T  Siegle and Michael M  Weinstein        argue that democracies  realize superior development performance  over authoritarianism  pointing out that poor democracies are more likely to have steadier economic growth and less likely to experience economic and humanitarian catastrophes  such as refugee crises  than authoritarian regimes  that civil liberties in democracies act as a curb on corruption and misuse of resources  and that democracies are more adaptable than authoritarian regimes              

Military effects
According to Allan C  Stam and Dan Reiter  liberal democracies have an advantage in battlefield performance over non democracies and illiberal democracies               They argue that this democratic advantage is derived from the fact that democratic soldiers fight harder  democratic states tend to ally together in war  and democracies can employ more economic resources towards combat               Due to elevated fears against military coups against authoritarian regimes  authoritarian regimes may also put loyalists in the military  This may reduce military effectiveness as loyalty is prioritized over experience when filling key positions within the military                                                       However  critics argue that democracy itself makes little difference in war and that some other factors  such as overall power  determine whether a country would achieve victory or face defeat  In some cases  such as the Vietnam War  democracy may even have contributed to defeat                                                      Jasen Castillo argues that autocratic states may in certain circumstances have an advantage over democracies  for example  authoritarian regimes may have ideologies that require unconditional loyalty  which may contribute to military cohesion              
According to Democratic peace theory  fully functioning democracies are less likely to go to war with each other  No similar advantage has been found with authoritarian regimes              

Historical trends
Pre World War II
Authoritarian rule before World War II includes short lived dictatorships and has been claimed to be understudied              

Post World War II anti authoritarianism
Main article  Anti authoritarianism
Both World War II  ending in       and the Cold War  ending in       resulted in the replacement of authoritarian regimes by either democratic regimes or regimes that were less authoritarian 
World War II saw the defeat of the Axis powers by the Allied powers  All the Axis powers  Nazi Germany  Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan  had totalitarian or authoritarian governments  and two of the three were replaced by governments based on democratic constitutions  The Allied powers were an alliance of Democratic states and  later  the Communist Soviet Union  At least in Western Europe the initial post war era embraced pluralism and freedom of expression in areas that had been under control of authoritarian regimes  The memory of fascism and Nazism was denigrated  The new Federal Republic of Germany banned its expression  In reaction to the centralism of the Nazi state  the new constitution of West Germany  Federal Republic of Germany  exercised  separation of powers  and placed  law enforcement firmly in the hands  of the sixteen L nder or states of the republic  not with the federal German government  at least not at first              
Culturally there was also a strong sense of anti authoritarianism based on anti fascism in Western Europe  This was attributed to the active resistance from occupation and to fears arising from the development of superpowers               Anti authoritarianism also became associated with countercultural and bohemian movements such as the Beat Generation in the     s               the hippies in the     s              and punks in the     s              
In South America  Argentina  Bolivia  Brazil  Paraguay  Chile and Uruguay moved away from dictatorships to democracy between      and                   
With the fall of the Berlin Wall in      and the Soviet Union in       the other authoritarian totalitarian  half  of the Allied Powers of World War II collapsed  This led not so much to revolt against authority in general  but to the belief that authoritarian states  and state control of economies  were outdated               The idea that  liberal democracy was the final form toward which all political striving was directed               became very popular in Western countries and was celebrated in Francis Fukuyama s book The End of History and the Last Man               According to Charles H  Fairbanks Jr    all the new states that stumbled out of the ruins of the Soviet bloc  except Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan  seemed indeed to be moving towards democracy in the early     s  as were the countries of East Central Europe and the Balkans              
In December       the Arab Spring arose in response to unrest over economic stagnation but also in opposition to oppressive authoritarian regimes  first in Tunisia  and spreading to Libya  Egypt  Yemen  Syria  Bahrain and elsewhere  Regimes were toppled in Tunisia  Libya  Egypt and partially in Yemen while other countries saw riots  civil wars or insurgencies  Most Arab Spring revolutions failed to lead to enduring democratization  In the decade following the Arab Spring  of the countries in which an autocracy was toppled in the Arab spring  only Tunisia had become a genuine democracy  Egypt backslid to return to a military run authoritarian state  while Libya  Syria and Yemen experienced devastating civil wars                           

  st century
Since       observers noted what some have called a  democratic recession                             although some such as Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way have disputed that there was a significant democratic decline before                    In       the Freedom House declared that from      to           countries  around the world showed  a net decline  in  political rights and civil liberties  while  only     experienced  a net improvement                Its      report marked the fourteenth consecutive year of declining scores               By       all countries marked as  not free  by Freedom House had also developed practices of transnational repression  aiming to police and control dissent beyond state borders

Writing in       American political journalist David Frum stated   The hopeful world of the very late   th century                  the world of NAFTA and an expanding NATO  of the World Wide Web     and liberal interventionism  of the global spread of democracy under leaders such as V clav Havel and Nelson Mandela                  now looks battered and delusive               
Michael Ignatieff wrote that Fukuyama s idea of liberalism vanquishing authoritarianism  now looks like a quaint artifact of a vanished unipolar moment               and Fukuyama himself expressed concern               By       only one Arab Spring uprising  that in Tunisia  resulted in a transition to constitutional democratic governance              and a  resurgence of authoritarianism and Islamic extremism  in the region              was dubbed the Arab Winter                                                                  
Various explanations have been offered for the new spread of authoritarianism  They include the downside of globalization  and the subsequent rise of populism and neo nationalism               and the success of the Beijing Consensus  i e  the authoritarian model of the People s Republic of China               In countries such as the United States  factors blamed for the growth of authoritarianism include the financial crisis of           and slower real wage growth                  unreliable source       as well as social media s elimination of so called  gatekeepers  of knowledge   the equivalent of disintermediation in economics   so that a large fraction of the population considers to be opinion what were once  viewed as verifiable facts    including everything from the danger of global warming to the preventing the spread of disease through vaccination   and considers to be fact what are actually only unproven fringe opinions              

In United States politics  white supremacist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan  neo Nazi skinheads  and adherents of the Christian Identity  ideology have long operated as a loose network  In the internet age  far right extremists throughout the U S  and much of the West have consolidated further into a movement known as the Alt Right  which has inspired numerous terrorist attacks while at the same time increasing the mainstream appeal of white supremacism               According to Azani et al               The current resurgence of far right ideology may be explained by a variety of factors  primarily  the strategic adjustment of white supremacists to soften overtly racist rhetoric in order to appeal to a wider audience  This new discourse attempts to normalize white supremacy  developing intellectual and theoretical foundations for racism based on the notion that the white race is at risk of eradication  threatened by the growing population of immigrants and people of colour  The pre existing  offensive white supremacist  fascist and neo Nazi ideas that drove the white power movement of the twentieth century were thus rebranded through a new innocuous defensive frame of white victimhood  As such  the new strategy of racist rhetoric has allowed the movement to co opt mainstream political debates surrounding immigration and globalization  drawing large audiences through a deliberate obfuscation of the underlying ideology Far right extremism has played a key role in promoting the Great Replacement and White genocide conspiracy theories  and an  acceleration  of racial conflict through violent means such as assassinations  murders  terrorist attacks  and societal collapse in order to achieve the building of a white ethnostate               While many contemporary extreme far right groups eschew the hierarchical structure of other authoritarian political organizations  they often explicitly promote cultural authoritarianism alongside xenophobia  racism  antisemitism  homophobia and misogyny  as well as authoritarian government interventions against perceived societal problems              
Contemporary
There is no one consensus definition of authoritarianism  but several annual measurements are attempted  including Freedom House s annual Freedom in the World report  Some countries such as Venezuela  among others  that are currently or historically recognized as authoritarian did not become authoritarian upon taking power or fluctuated between an authoritarian  flawed democracy  and hybrid regime due to periods of democratic backsliding or democratization  Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia are often regarded as the most infamous examples of  totalitarian  systems  Some countries such as China and various fascist regimes have also been characterized as totalitarian  with some periods being depicted as more authoritarian  or totalitarian  than others 
States characterized as authoritarian are typically not rated as democracies by The Economist Democracy Index or as  free  by Freedom House s Freedom in the World index  and do not reach a high score on V Dem Democracy Indices  Contemporary examples of totalitarian states include North Korea  officially  the Democratic People s Republic of Korea
