							Deputy of Ismailia endowment directorate Magdy Badran referred a preacher for investigation  The preacher had criticised the governor of Ismailia and health officials in the governorate during his Friday sermon  local media reported 
The preacher criticised the aforementioned officials  clarifying that they failed to save his mother s life and depicted their performance as a failure  He also urged the officials to pay attention to health affairs as much as they do        to the football national team        
Badran said in a statement that they will follow all legal procedures against the preacher  saying that        a mosque is not a place for resolving disputes  but it is a place to spread moderate Islam  and every preacher should be committed to the unified sermon decided on by the Ministry of Religious Endowments        
The endowment directorate noted that the preacher drifted away from the topic of the Friday sermon 
This was not the first case of a preacher facing investigations for not sticking to the unified sermon  The ministry announced on    July that it would hand out unified topics for Friday prayers 
Last week  another preacher in Suez was suspended after praising the Egyptian goalkeeper Essam El Hadary s performance during the African Cup of Nations  AFCON  matches and calling on the youth to take his achievements as an example  This issue triggered criticism and raised questions on the country s statements about their efforts to spread moderate Islam 
The decision to unify sermons        topics previously sparked controversy in the country and was met by criticism from some of Al Azhar s top clerics  who believed that it did not value their knowledge and studies  will impact their credibility and creativity  and will distort the connection between an imam and his listeners
