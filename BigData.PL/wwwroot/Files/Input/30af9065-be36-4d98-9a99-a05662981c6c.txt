							Flensburg  in northern Germany  near the border to Denmark  is known for its Scandinavian flair  It       s less well known for the rum that has been produced here for centuries  What a pity         it       s very good indeed  quot Nicht schnacken  Kopf in Nacken  quot  says Malte to me as I stand in the port watching the ships  It means roughly   quot No talking  drink up  quot  and it      s a common north German toast  He pours rum into a small glass and holds it out to me  It tastes sweet and spicy  and it      s really warming  When the glass is empty  he announces we need a refill 
   year old Malte used to go to sea as a sailor  Now he stands on the quay with a bottle and fishing rod and catches herring  We walk to Johannsen      s Rumhaus  one of the last traditional distilleries in Flensburg  Its company shop on Marienstrasse is said to have the best rum blend   quot Blend quot  doesn      t sound very good  but this tastes good  and it has a long history behind it  in      Germans began to import rum from islands in the Caribbean  and in Flensburg good money could be earned from it  But soon it was being taxed according to quantity  so from then on the sailors were forced to deliver a concentrate so the producers could sell as much as before  To do so they had to thin the rum  to make the imported liquor with its    percent alcohol content drinkable  it was thinned with water and blended with grain alcohol  That process has survived to this day  and the spicy taste of the blend is now better than its reputation might suggest 
Once a Danish colony
Flensburg is the only German city with a genuine rum tradition  It used to belong to Denmark  and Denmark had colonies  the Danish West Indies  consisting of the islands St  Thomas  St  John and St  Croix in the Caribbean  The ships brought the valuable tipple in large casks to the port of Flensburg  which was larger and more important than that of Copenhagen at the time  What flourished in the   th century was interrupted by war a hundred years later  The city was ceded by Denmark to Prussia and Austria  In that way  the Flensburg distilleries lost their rum suppliers  They needed an equivalent replacement  so they started going to Jamaica to fill the gap  
Matures in casks for up to    years
Martin Johannsen      s great great grandfather lived through all that  Martin is the fourth generation of his family to run the oldest rum house in the city  Behind the small shop in the Marienburg  a medieval merchants       warehouse in the old town  the spicy scent of rum wafts from dark storerooms  mixed with the fine aromas of vanilla and smoky wood  The delivery from the Caribbean comes once a year  two to three thousand liters at a time  With a winch on the storehouse   the containers are hauled up and their contents transferred to oak casks  When it arrives  the rum has a maturation period of between five and seven years in the tropical climate of Jamaica behind it  Actually it      s already mellow and flavorful  but for a Flensburg rum it      s not yet good enough  the young man explains  It has to mature for twelve to fourteen years before it can be bottled   
Well preserved old town 
On the way back to the port  Malte and I take a detour through Oluf Samson Gang  Although the narrow lane is no longer what it once was  it is a reminder of the times when the sailors traded their earnings for nights of sinful pleasure  In the late nineteen sixties     women were working as prostitutes in Flensburg      s red light district  Just under four years ago  the last two closed their establishments  in buildings parts of which dated from the   th century  and which have now been restored  It was high time to spruce up these historical properties  especially when the facade of House Number   collapsed  providing a  quot spectacular quot  scene for passers by  Apart from such minor incidents  Flensburg is structurally in good shape  because the city sustained only minimal damage during World War II  The market square  city gate and churches are in good condition  
More and more students move here 
The city with        residents also became known because of Beate Uhse  who opened the world      s first sex shop here in       It was called the  quot Institute for Marital Hygiene quot  and its inventory included contraceptives  lingerie  erotic toys and books  
From time immemorial  Flensburg has attracted adventurers  free spirits  sailors  boat builders and students  who like to live in the still affordable courtyards in the city center  The yards contain skate shops  tailoring and alterations studios  galleries and discos  Occasionally  from the open windows  the sounds of Santiano can be heard  a band all of whose members come from Flensburg and whose music mixes rock with folk and sea shanties  Their songs are full of joie de vivre  unbridled yearning and wild dreams  The song  quot Es gibt nur Wasser  There      s Only Water  quot  is very popular here because one of its lyrics translates as  quot We need rum  rum  rum         or we      ll die of thirst  quot   quot That      s not quite true  quot  Malte adds   quot There      s also the famous Flensburg beer  But for me  there      s nothing better than good rum  quot
