Alpha synuclein  aSyn  is a protein that in humans is encoded by the SNCA gene             It is a neuronal protein involved in the regulation of synaptic vesicle trafficking and the release of neurotransmitters                       
Alpha synuclein is abundant in the brain  with smaller amounts present in the heart  muscles  and other tissues  Within the brain  it is primarily localized to the axon terminals of presynaptic neurons             There  it interacts with phospholipids            and other proteins                                    Presynaptic terminals release neurotransmitters from specialized compartments called synaptic vesicles  a process essential for neuronal communication and normal brain function            
In Parkinson s disease and related synucleinopathies  abnormal  insoluble forms of alpha synuclein accumulate within neurons as inclusions known as Lewy bodies             
Mutations in the SNCA gene are linked to familial forms of Parkinson s disease  During the process of seeded nucleation  alpha synuclein adopts a cross beta sheet structure characteristic of amyloid fibrils             
The human alpha synuclein protein consists of     amino acids                                      A fragment of alpha synuclein  known as the non amyloid beta component  NAC  of Alzheimer s disease amyloid  was initially isolated from an amyloid rich brain fraction and shown to derive from a precursor protein named NACP              NACP was subsequently identified as the human homologue of synuclein from the electric ray genus Torpedo  leading to its renaming as human alpha synuclein             


Tissue expression edit 
Alpha synuclein is a synuclein protein primarily found in neural tissue  making up as much as one percent of all proteins in the cytosol of brain cells              It is expressed highly in neurons within the frontal cortex  hippocampus  striatum  and olfactory bulb              but can also be found in the non neuronal glial cells              In melanocytes  SNCA protein expression may be regulated by microphthalmia associated transcription factor  MITF              
It has been established that alpha synuclein is extensively localized in the nucleus of mammalian brain neurons  suggesting a role of alpha synuclein in the nucleus              Synuclein is however found predominantly in the presynaptic termini  in both free or membrane bound forms              with roughly     of synuclein being membrane bound at any moment in neurons             
It has also been shown that alpha synuclein is localized in neuronal mitochondria                          Alpha synuclein is highly expressed in the mitochondria in olfactory bulb  hippocampus  striatum and thalamus  where the cytosolic alpha synuclein is also rich  However  the cerebral cortex and cerebellum are
two exceptions  which contain rich cytosolic alpha synuclein but very low levels of mitochondrial alpha synuclein  It has been shown that alpha synuclein is localized in the inner membrane of mitochondria  and that the inhibitory effect of alpha synuclein on complex I activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain is dose dependent  Thus  it is suggested that alpha synuclein in mitochondria is differentially expressed in different brain regions and the background levels of mitochondrial alpha synuclein may be a potential factor affecting mitochondrial function and predisposing some neurons to degeneration             
At least three isoforms of synuclein are produced through alternative splicing              The majority form of the protein  and the one most investigated  is the full length protein of     amino acids  Other isoforms are alpha synuclein      which lacks residues       due to loss of exon    and alpha synuclein                  which lacks residues         due to loss of exon               

In the enteric nervous system  ENS  edit 
First characterisations of aSyn aggregates in the ENS of PD patients has been performed on autopsied specimens in the late     s              It is yet unknown if the microbiome changes associated with PD are consequential to the illness process or main pathophysiology  or both             
Individuals diagnosed with various synucleinopathies often display constipation and other GI dysfunctions years prior to the onset of movement dysfunction             
Alpha synuclein potentially connects the gut brain axis in Parkinson s disease patients  Common inherited Parkinson disease is associated with mutations in the alpha synuclein  SNCA  gene  In the process of seeded nucleation  alpha synuclein acquires a cross sheet structure similar to other amyloids             
The Enterobacteriaceae  which are quite common in the human gut  can create curli  which are functional amyloid proteins  The unfolded amyloid CsgA  which is secreted by bacteria and later aggregates extracellularly to create biofilms  mediates adherence to epithelial cells  and aids in bacteriophage defense  forms the curli fibers  Oral injection of curli producing bacteria can also boost formation and aggregation of the amyloid protein Syn in old rats and nematodes  Host inflammation responses in the intestinal tract and periphery are modulated by curli exposure  Studies in biochemistry show that endogenous  bacterial chaperones of curli are capable of briefly interacting with Syn and controlling its aggregation             
The clinical and pathological findings support the hypothesis that aSyn disease in PD occurs via a gut brain pathway  For early diagnosis and early management in the phase of creation and propagation of aSyn  it is therefore of utmost importance to identify pathogenic aSyn in the digestive system  for example  by gastrointestinal tract  GIT  biopsies             
According to a growing body of research  intestinal dysbiosis may be a major factor in the development of Parkinson s disease by encouraging intestinal permeability  gastrointestinal inflammation  and the aggregation and spread of asyn             
Not just the CNS but other peripheral tissues  such as the GIT  have physiological aSyn expression as well as its phosphorylated variants              As suggested by Borghammer and Van Den Berge         one approach is to recognise the possibility of PD subtypes with various aSyn propagation methods  including either a peripheral nervous system  PNS  first or a CNS first route             
While the GI tract has been linked to other neurological disorders such autism spectrum disorder  depression  anxiety  and Alzheimer s disease  protein aggregation and or inflammation in the gut represent a new topic of investigation in synucleinopathies             

Structure edit 
Alpha synuclein in solution is considered to be an intrinsically disordered protein  i e  it lacks a single stable  D structure                          As of       an increasing number of reports suggest  however  the presence of partial structures or mostly structured oligomeric states in the solution structure of alpha synuclein even in the absence of lipids  This trend is also supported by a large number of single molecule  optical tweezers  measurements on single copies of monomeric alpha synuclein as well as covalently enforced dimers or tetramers of alpha synuclein             
Alpha synuclein is specifically upregulated in a discrete population of presynaptic terminals of the brain during a period of acquisition related synaptic rearrangement              It has been shown that alpha synuclein significantly interacts with tubulin              and that alpha synuclein may have activity as a potential microtubule associated protein  like tau              Evidence suggests that alpha synuclein functions as a molecular chaperone in the formation of SNARE complexes                        In particular  it simultaneously binds to phospholipids of the plasma membrane via its N terminus domain and to synaptobrevin   via its C terminus domain  with increased importance during synaptic activity              Indeed  there is growing evidence that alpha synuclein is involved in the functioning of the neuronal Golgi apparatus and vesicle trafficking             
Apparently  alpha synuclein is essential for normal development of the cognitive functions  Knock out mice with the targeted inactivation of the expression of alpha synuclein show impaired spatial learning and working memory             

Interaction with lipid membranes edit 
Experimental evidence has been collected on the interaction of alpha synuclein with membrane and its involvement with membrane composition and turnover  Yeast genome screening has found that several genes that deal with lipid metabolism and mitochondrial fusion play a role in alpha synuclein toxicity                          Conversely  alpha synuclein expression levels can affect the viscosity and the relative amount of fatty acids in the lipid bilayer             
Alpha synuclein is known to directly bind to lipid membranes  associating with the negatively charged surfaces of phospholipids              Alpha synuclein forms an extended helical structure on small unilamellar vesicles              A preferential binding to small vesicles has been found              The binding of alpha synuclein to lipid membranes has complex effects on the latter  altering the bilayer structure and leading to the formation of small vesicles              Alpha synuclein has been shown to bend membranes of negatively charged phospholipid vesicles and form tubules from large lipid vesicles              Using cryo EM it was shown that these are micellar tubes of           nm diameter              Alpha synuclein has also been shown to form lipid disc like particles similar to apolipoproteins              EPR studies have shown that the structure of alpha synuclein is dependent on the binding surface              The protein adopts a broken helical conformation on lipoprotein particles while it forms an extended helical structure on lipid vesicles and membrane tubes              Studies have also suggested a possible antioxidant activity of alpha synuclein in the membrane              

Photomicrographs of regions of substantia nigra in a patient showing Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in various magnifications  Membrane interaction of alpha synuclein modulates or affects its rate of aggregation              The membrane mediated modulation of aggregation is very similar to that observed for other amyloid proteins such as IAPP and abeta              Aggregated states of alpha synuclein permeate the membrane of lipid vesicles              They are formed upon interaction with peroxidation prone polyunsaturated fatty acids  PUFA  but not with monounsaturated fatty acids             and the binding of lipid autoxidation promoting transition metals such as iron or copper provokes oligomerization of alpha synuclein              The aggregated alpha synuclein has a specific activity for peroxidized lipids and induces lipid autoxidation in PUFA rich membranes of both neurons and astrocytes  decreasing resistance to apoptosis              Lipid autoxidation is inhibited if the cells are pre incubated with isotope reinforced PUFAs  D PUFA              
Function edit 
Although the function of alpha synuclein is not well understood  studies suggest that it plays a role in restricting the mobility of synaptic vesicles  consequently attenuating synaptic vesicle recycling and neurotransmitter release                                                                                     An alternate view is that alpha synuclein binds to VAMP   a synaptobrevin  and stabilizes SNARE complexes                                                              though recent studies indicate that alpha synuclein VAMP  binding is critical for alpha synuclein mediated attenuation of synaptic vesicle recycling  connecting the two seemingly divergent views             It may also help regulate the release of dopamine  a type of neurotransmitter that is critical for controlling the start and stop of voluntary and involuntary movements            
Alpha synuclein modulates DNA repair processes  including repair of double strand breaks  DSBs               DNA damage response markers co localize with alpha synuclein to form discrete foci in human cells and mouse brain  Depletion of alpha synuclein in human cells causes increased introduction of DNA DSBs after exposure to bleomycin and reduced ability to repair these DSBs  In addition  alpha synuclein knockout mice display a higher level of DSBs  and this problem can be alleviated by transgenic reintroduction of human alpha synuclein  Alpha synuclein promotes the DSB repair pathway referred to as non homologous end joining              The DNA repair function of alpha synuclein appears to be compromised in Lewy body inclusion bearing neurons  and this may trigger cell death 

Proneurogenic function of alpha synuclein edit 
In some neurodegenerative diseases  alpha synuclein produces insoluble inclusion bodies  These diseases  known as synucleinopathies  are connected with either higher levels of normal alpha synuclein or its mutant variants              The normal physiological role of Snca  however  has not yet been thoroughly explained  In fact  physiological Snca has been demonstrated to have a neuroprotective impact by inhibiting apoptosis induced by several types of apoptotic stimuli  or by regulating the expression of proteins involved in apoptotic pathways 
Recently it has been demonstrated that up regulation of alpha synuclein in the dentate gyrus   a neurogenic niche where new neurons are generated throughout life  activates stem cells  in a model of premature neural aging  This model shows reduced expression of alpha synuclein and reduced proliferation of stem cells  as is physiologically observed during aging  Exogenous alpha synuclein in the dentate gyrus is able to rescue this defect  Moreover  alpha synuclein also boosts the proliferation of dentate gyrus progenitor neural cells in wild type young mice  Thus  alpha synuclein represents an effector for neural stem and progenitor cell activation             
Similarly  alpha synuclein has been found to be required to maintain stem cells of the SVZ  subventricular zone  i e   another neurogenic niche  in a cycling state             

Sequence edit 
Alpha synuclein primary structure is usually divided in three distinct domains 

Residues       An amphipathic N terminal region dominated by four    residue repeats including the consensus sequence KTKEGV  This sequence has a structural alpha helix propensity similar to apolipoproteins binding domains              It is a highly conserved terminal that interacts with acidic lipid membranes  and all the discovered point mutations of the SNCA gene are located within this terminal             
Residues        A central hydrophobic region which includes the non amyloid   component  NAC  region  involved in protein aggregation              This domain is unique to alpha synuclein among the synuclein family             
Residues         a highly acidic and proline rich region which has no distinct structural propensity  This domain plays an important role in the function  solubility and interaction of alpha synuclein with other proteins                         
Autoproteolytic activity edit 
The use of high resolution ion mobility mass spectrometry  IMS MS  on HPLC purified alpha synuclein in vitro has shown alpha synuclein to be autoproteolytic  self proteolytic   generating a variety of small molecular weight fragments upon incubation              The            kDa protein was found to generate numerous smaller fragments  including            kDa  amino acids         and            kDa          fragments formed through C  and N terminal truncation and a      kDa C terminal fragment           The           kDa fragment  which contains the majority of the NAC region  aggregated considerably faster than full length alpha synuclein  It is possible that these autoproteolytic products play a role as intermediates or cofactors in the aggregation of alpha synuclein in vivo 

Clinical significance edit 
Positive   Synuclein staining of a Lewy body from a patient who had Parkinson s disease 
Alpha synuclein  having no single  well defined tertiary structure  is an intrinsically disordered protein                          with a pI value of                  which  under certain pathological conditions  can misfold in a way that exposes its core hydrophobic residues to the intracellular milieu  thus providing the opportunity for hydrophobic interactions to occur with a similar  equally exposed protein              This could lead to self assembly and subsequent aggregation into large  insoluble fibrils known as amyloids              The conversion of soluble alpha synuclein into highly ordered  cross   sheet  fibrillar structures does not  as previously thought  follow a two step mechanism  rather  occurs through a series of transient  soluble oligomeric intermediates                          In       two groups published their findings that unmutated   synuclein forms a stably folded tetramer that resists aggregation  asserting that this folded tetramer represented the relevant in vivo structure in cells                          thereby relieving alpha synuclein of its disordered status  Proponents of the tetramer hypothesis argued that in vivo cross linking in bacteria  primary neurons and human erythroleukemia cells confirmed the presence of labile  tetrameric species                                      However  despite numerous in cell NMR reports demonstrating that alpha synuclein is indeed monomeric and disordered in intact E  coli cells                                                                                                  it is still a matter of debate in the field despite an ever growing mountain of conflicting reports                                      Nevertheless  alpha synuclein aggregates to form insoluble fibrils in pathological conditions characterized by Lewy bodies  such as Parkinson s disease  dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy                          These disorders are known as synucleinopathies  In vitro models of synucleinopathies revealed that aggregation of alpha synuclein may lead to various cellular disorders including microtubule impairment  synaptic and mitochondrial dysfunctions  oxidative stress as well as dysregulation of Calcium signaling  proteasomal and lysosomal pathway              Alpha synuclein is the primary structural component of Lewy body fibrils  Occasionally  Lewy bodies contain tau protein               however  alpha synuclein and tau constitute two distinctive subsets of filaments in the same inclusion bodies               Alpha synuclein pathology is also found in both sporadic and familial cases with Alzheimer s disease              
The aggregation mechanism of alpha synuclein is uncertain  There is evidence of a structured intermediate rich in beta structure that can be the precursor of aggregation and  ultimately  Lewy bodies               A single molecule study in      suggests alpha synuclein exists as a mix of unstructured  alpha helix  and beta sheet rich conformers in equilibrium  Mutations or buffer conditions known to improve aggregation strongly increase the population of the beta conformer  thus suggesting this could be a conformation related to pathogenic aggregation               One theory is that the majority of alpha synuclein aggregates are located in the presynapse as smaller deposits which causes synaptic dysfunction               Among the strategies for treating synucleinopathies are compounds that inhibit aggregation of alpha synuclein  It has been shown that the small molecule cuminaldehyde inhibits fibrillation of alpha synuclein              
The Epstein Barr virus has been implicated in these disorders              
In rare cases of familial forms of Parkinson s disease  there is a mutation in the gene coding for alpha synuclein  Five point mutations have been identified thus far  A  T               A  P               E  K               H  Q               and G  D               however  in total  nineteen mutations in the SNCA gene have been associated with parkinsonism  A  T  A  S  A  E  A  V  E  A  V  A  T  M  L I  V  D  M   I  P   S  M T  G  A  E  Q  and A  G              
It has been reported that some mutations influence the initiation and amplification steps of the aggregation process                            Genomic duplication and triplication of the gene appear to be a rare cause of Parkinson s disease in other lineages  although more common than point mutations                            Hence certain mutations of alpha synuclein may cause it to form amyloid like fibrils that contribute to Parkinson s disease  Over expression of human wild type or A  T mutant alpha synuclein in primates drives deposition of alpha synuclein in the ventral midbrain  degeneration of the dopaminergic system and impaired motor performance               Although the accumulation and aggregation of alpha synuclein in most Parkinson s disease patients primarily result from posttranscriptional mechanisms  targeting its production remains a potential therapeutic approach               Research indicates that microRNA   and the naturally occurring small molecule quercetin can reduce alpha synuclein levels under experimental conditions              
Certain sections of the alpha synuclein protein may play a role in the tauopathies                                        
A prion form of the protein alpha synuclein may be a causal agent for the disease multiple system atrophy                                        

Events in   synuclein toxicity              Self replicating  prion like  amyloid assemblies of alpha synuclein have been described that are invisible to the amyloid dye Thioflavin T and that can acutely spread in neurons in vitro and in vivo               This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources     in this section  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed    November        Learn how and when to remove this message 
Antibodies against alpha synuclein have replaced antibodies against ubiquitin as the gold standard for immunostaining of Lewy bodies               The central panel in the figure to the right shows the major pathway for protein aggregation  Monomeric   synuclein is natively unfolded in solution but can also bind to membranes in an   helical form  It seems likely that these two species exist in equilibrium within the cell  although this is unproven  From in vitro work  it is clear that unfolded monomer can aggregate first into small oligomeric species that can be stabilized by   sheet like interactions and then into higher molecular weight insoluble fibrils  In a cellular context  there is some evidence that the presence of lipids can promote oligomer formation    synuclein can also form annular  pore like structures that interact with membranes  The deposition of   synuclein into pathological structures such as Lewy bodies is probably a late event that occurs in some neurons  On the left hand side are some of the known modifiers of this process  Electrical activity in neurons changes the association of   synuclein with vesicles and may also stimulate polo like kinase    PLK    which has been shown to phosphorylate   synuclein at Ser     Other kinases have also been proposed to be involved  As well as phosphorylation  truncation through proteases such as calpains  and nitration  probably through nitric oxide  NO  or other reactive nitrogen species that are present during inflammation  all modify synuclein such that it has a higher tendency to aggregate  The addition of ubiquitin  shown as a black spot  to Lewy bodies is probably a secondary process to deposition  On the right are some of the proposed cellular targets for   synuclein mediated toxicity  which include  from top to bottom  ER golgi transport  synaptic vesicles  mitochondria and lysosomes and other proteolytic machinery  In each of these cases  it is proposed that   synuclein has detrimental effects  listed below each arrow  although at this time it is not clear if any of these are either necessary or sufficient for toxicity in neurons
