Regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence  AI   It is part of the broader regulation of algorithms                        The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions worldwide  including for international organizations without direct enforcement power like the IEEE or the OECD            
Since       numerous AI ethics guidelines have been published in order to maintain social control over the technology             Regulation is deemed necessary to both foster AI innovation and manage associated risks 
Furthermore  organizations deploying AI have a central role to play in creating and implementing trustworthy AI  adhering to established principles  and taking accountability for mitigating risks            
Regulating AI through mechanisms such as review boards can also be seen as social means to approach the AI control problem                       


Background edit 
According to Stanford University s      AI Index  the annual number of bills mentioning  artificial intelligence  passed in     surveyed countries jumped from one in      to    in                            
In       Elon Musk called for regulation of AI development              According to NPR  the Tesla CEO was  clearly not thrilled  to be advocating for government scrutiny that could impact his own industry  but believed the risks of going completely without oversight are high   Normally the way regulations are set up is when a bunch of bad things happen  there s a public outcry  and after many years a regulatory agency is set up to regulate that industry  It takes forever  That  in the past  has been bad but not something which represented a fundamental risk to the existence of civilization               In response  some politicians expressed skepticism about the wisdom of regulating a technology that is still in development              Responding both to Musk and to February      proposals by European Union lawmakers to regulate AI and robotics  Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has argued that AI is in its infancy and that it is too early to regulate the technology              Many tech companies oppose the harsh regulation of AI and  While some of the companies have said they welcome rules around A I   they have also argued against tough regulations akin to those being created in Europe               Instead of trying to regulate the technology itself  some scholars suggested developing common norms including requirements for the testing and transparency of algorithms  possibly in combination with some form of warranty             
In a      Ipsos survey  attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country      of Chinese citizens  but only     of Americans  agreed that  products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks              A      Reuters Ipsos poll found that     of Americans agree  and     disagree  that AI poses risks to humanity              In a      Fox News poll      of Americans thought it  very important   and an additional     thought it  somewhat important   for the federal government to regulate AI  versus     responding  not very important  and    responding  not at all important                          

Perspectives edit 
The regulation of artificial intelligences is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI              Regulation is now generally considered necessary to both encourage AI and manage associated risks                                      Public administration and policy considerations generally focus on the technical and economic implications and on trustworthy and human centered AI systems              although regulation of artificial superintelligences is also considered              The basic approach to regulation focuses on the risks and biases of machine learning algorithms  at the level of the input data  algorithm testing  and decision model  It also focuses on the explainability of the outputs             
There have been both hard law and soft law proposals to regulate AI              Some legal scholars have noted that hard law approaches to AI regulation have substantial challenges                          Among the challenges  AI technology is rapidly evolving leading to a  pacing problem  where traditional laws and regulations often cannot keep up with emerging applications and their associated risks and benefits                          Similarly  the diversity of AI applications challenges existing regulatory agencies  which often have limited jurisdictional scope              As an alternative  some legal scholars argue that soft law approaches to AI regulation are promising because soft laws can be adapted more flexibly to meet the needs of emerging and evolving AI technology and nascent applications                          However  soft law approaches often lack substantial enforcement potential                         
Cason Schmit  Megan Doerr  and Jennifer Wagner proposed the creation of a quasi governmental regulator by leveraging intellectual property rights  i e   copyleft licensing  in certain AI objects  i e   AI models and training datasets  and delegating enforcement rights to a designated enforcement entity              They argue that AI can be licensed under terms that require adherence to specified ethical practices and codes of conduct   e g   soft law principles              
Prominent youth organizations focused on AI  namely Encode Justice  have also issued comprehensive agendas calling for more stringent AI regulations and public private partnerships                         
AI regulation could derive from basic principles  A      Berkman Klein Center for Internet  amp  Society meta review of existing sets of principles  such as the Asilomar Principles and the Beijing Principles  identified eight such basic principles  privacy  accountability  safety and security  transparency and explainability  fairness and non discrimination  human control of technology  professional responsibility  and respect for human values              AI law and regulations have been divided into three main topics  namely governance of autonomous intelligence systems  responsibility and accountability for the systems  and privacy and safety issues              A public administration approach sees a relationship between AI law and regulation  the ethics of AI  and  AI society   defined as workforce substitution and transformation  social acceptance and trust in AI  and the transformation of human to machine interaction              The development of public sector strategies for management and regulation of AI is deemed necessary at the local  national              and international levels             and in a variety of fields  from public service management             and accountability             to law enforcement                          healthcare  especially the concept of a Human Guarantee                                                               the financial sector              robotics                          autonomous vehicles              the military             and national security              and international law                         
Henry Kissinger  Eric Schmidt  and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November      entitled  Being Human in an Age of AI   calling for a government commission to regulate AI             

As a response to the AI control problem edit 
Main article  AI control problem
Regulation of AI can be seen as positive social means to manage the AI control problem  the need to ensure long term beneficial AI   with other social responses such as doing nothing or banning being seen as impractical  and approaches such as enhancing human capabilities through transhumanism techniques like brain computer interfaces being seen as potentially complementary                         Regulation of research into artificial general intelligence  AGI  focuses on the role of review boards  from university or corporation to international levels  and on encouraging research into AI safety              together with the possibility of differential intellectual progress  prioritizing protective strategies over risky strategies in AI development  or conducting international mass surveillance to perform AGI arms control             For instance  the  AGI Nanny  is a proposed strategy  potentially under the control of humanity  for preventing the creation of a dangerous superintelligence as well as for addressing other major threats to human well being  such as subversion of the global financial system  until a true superintelligence can be safely created  It entails the creation of a smarter than human  but not superintelligent  AGI system connected to a large surveillance network  with the goal of monitoring humanity and protecting it from danger             Regulation of conscious  ethically aware AGIs focuses on how to integrate them with existing human society and can be divided into considerations of their legal standing and of their moral rights             Regulation of AI has been seen as restrictive  with a risk of preventing the development of AGI             

Global guidance edit 
Organizations polled largely agree that companies developing foundation models will be responsible for associated risks  rather than those using it   and that global governance is required to address risks from generative AI             
The development of a global governance board to regulate AI development was suggested at least as early as                   In December       Canada and France announced plans for a G  backed International Panel on Artificial Intelligence  modeled on the International Panel on Climate Change  to study the global effects of AI on people and economies and to steer AI development              In       the Panel was renamed the Global Partnership on AI                         
The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence  GPAI  was launched in June       stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values  to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology  as outlined in the OECD Principles on Artificial Intelligence                     The    founding members of the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence are Australia  Canada  the European Union  France  Germany  India  Italy  Japan  the Republic of Korea  Mexico  New Zealand  Singapore  Slovenia  the United States and the UK  In       the GPAI has    members              The GPAI Secretariat is hosted by the OECD in Paris  France  GPAI s mandate covers four themes  two of which are supported by the International Centre of Expertise in Montr al for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence  namely  responsible AI and data governance  A corresponding centre of excellence in Paris will support the other two themes on the future of work  and on innovation and commercialization  GPAI also investigated how AI can be leveraged to respond to the COVID    pandemic             
The OECD AI Principles             were adopted in May       and the G   AI Principles in June                                           In September      the World Economic Forum issued ten  AI Government Procurement Guidelines               In February       the European Union published its draft strategy paper for promoting and regulating AI             
At the United Nations  UN   several entities have begun to promote and discuss aspects of AI regulation and policy  including the UNICRI Centre for AI and Robotics              In partnership with INTERPOL  UNICRI s Centre issued the report AI and Robotics for Law Enforcement in April                  and the follow up report Towards Responsible AI Innovation in May                   At UNESCO s Scientific   th session in November       the organization commenced a two year process to achieve a  global standard setting instrument on ethics of artificial intelligence   In pursuit of this goal  UNESCO forums and conferences on AI were held to gather stakeholder views  A draft text of a Recommendation on the Ethics of AI of the UNESCO Ad Hoc Expert Group was issued in September      and included a call for legislative gaps to be filled              UNESCO tabled the international instrument on the ethics of AI for adoption at its General Conference in November                   this was subsequently adopted              While the UN is making progress with the global management of AI  its institutional and legal capability to manage the AGI existential risk is more limited             
An initiative of International Telecommunication Union  ITU  in partnership with    UN sister agencies  AI for Good is a global platform which aims to identify practical applications of AI to advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and scale those solutions for global impact  It is an action oriented  global  amp  inclusive United Nations platform fostering development of AI to positively impact health  climate  gender  inclusive prosperity  sustainable infrastructure  and other global development priorities      citation needed     
Recent research has indicated that countries will also begin to use artificial intelligence as a tool for national cyberdefense  AI is a new factor in the cyber arms industry  as it can be used for defense purposes  Therefore  academics urge that nations should establish regulations for the use of AI  similar to how there are regulations for other military industries             

Regional and national regulation edit 
Timeline of strategies  action plans and policy papers setting defining national  regional and international approaches to AI            
The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in regional and national jurisdictions globally  for example in the European Union             and Russia              Since early       many national  regional and international authorities have begun adopting strategies  actions plans and policy papers on AI                          These documents cover a wide range of topics such as regulation and governance  as well as industrial strategy  research  talent and infrastructure                         
Different countries have approached the problem in different ways  Regarding the three largest economies  it has been said that  the United States is following a market driven approach  China is advancing a state driven approach  and the EU is pursuing a rights driven approach              

Australia edit 
In October       the Australian Computer Society  Business Council of Australia  Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry  Ai Group  aka Australian Industry Group   Council of Small Business Organisations Australia  and Tech Council of Australia jointly published an open letter calling for a national approach to AI strategy              The letter backs the federal government establishing a whole of government AI taskforce

On September           the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies approved the Brazilian Legal Framework for Artificial Intelligence  Marco Legal da Intelig ncia Artificial  in regulatory efforts for the development and usage of AI technologies and to further stimulate research and innovation in AI solutions aimed at ethics  culture  justice  fairness  and accountability  This    article bill outlines objectives including missions to contribute to the elaboration of ethical principles  promote sustained investments in research  and remove barriers to innovation  Specifically  in article    the bill emphasizes the avoidance of discriminatory AI solutions  plurality  and respect for human rights  Furthermore  this act emphasizes the importance of the equality principle in deliberate decision making algorithms  especially for highly diverse and multiethnic societies like that of Brazil 
When the bill was first released to the public  it faced substantial criticism  alarming the government for critical provisions  The underlying issue is that this bill fails to thoroughly and carefully address accountability  transparency  and inclusivity principles  Article VI establishes subjective liability  meaning any individual that is damaged by an AI system and is wishing to receive compensation must specify the stakeholder and prove that there was a mistake in the machine s life cycle  Scholars emphasize that it is out of legal order to assign an individual responsible for proving algorithmic errors given the high degree of autonomy  unpredictability  and complexity of AI systems  This also drew attention to the currently occurring issues with face recognition systems in Brazil leading to unjust arrests by the police  which would then imply that when this bill is adopted  individuals would have to prove and justify these machine errors 
The main controversy of this draft bill was directed to three proposed principles  First  the non discrimination principle  suggests that AI must be developed and used in a way that merely mitigates the possibility of abusive and discriminatory practices  Secondly  the pursuit of neutrality principle lists recommendations for stakeholders to mitigate biases  however  with no obligation to achieve this goal  Lastly  the transparency principle states that a system s transparency is only necessary when there is a high risk of violating fundamental rights  As easily observed  the Brazilian Legal Framework for Artificial Intelligence lacks binding and obligatory clauses and is rather filled with relaxed guidelines  In fact  experts emphasize that this bill may even make accountability for AI discriminatory biases even harder to achieve  Compared to the EU s proposal of extensive risk based regulations  the Brazilian Bill has    articles proposing vague and generic recommendations 
Compared to the multistakeholder participation approach taken previously in the     s when drafting the Brazilian Internet Bill of Rights  Marco Civil da Internet  the Brazilian Bill is assessed to significantly lack perspective  Multistakeholderism  more commonly referred to as Multistakeholder Governance  is defined as the practice of bringing multiple stakeholders to participate in dialogue  decision making  and implementation of responses to jointly perceived problems  In the context of regulatory AI  this multistakeholder perspective captures the trade offs and varying perspectives of different stakeholders with specific interests  which helps maintain transparency and broader efficacy  On the contrary  the legislative proposal for AI regulation did not follow a similar multistakeholder approach 
Future steps may include  expanding upon the multistakeholder perspective  There has been a growing concern about the inapplicability of the framework of the bill  which highlights that the one shoe fits all solution may not be suitable for the regulation of AI and calls for subjective and adaptive provisions 

Canada edit 
The Pan Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy        is supported by federal funding of Can      million with the objectives of increasing the number of outstanding AI researchers and skilled graduates in Canada  establishing nodes of scientific excellence at the three major AI centres  developing  global thought leadership  on the economic  ethical  policy and legal implications of AI advances and supporting a national research community working on AI              The Canada CIFAR AI Chairs Program is the cornerstone of the strategy  It benefits from funding of Can      million over five years to attract and retain world renowned AI researchers              The federal government appointed an Advisory Council on AI in May      with a focus on examining how to build on Canada s strengths to ensure that AI advancements reflect Canadian values  such as human rights  transparency and openness  The Advisory Council on AI has established a working group on extracting commercial value from Canadian owned AI and data analytics              In       the federal government and Government of Quebec announced the opening of the International Centre of Expertise in Montr al for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence  which will advance the cause of responsible development of AI              In June       the government of Canada started a second phase of the Pan Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy              In November       Canada has introduced the Digital Charter Implementation Act  Bill C      which proposes three acts that have been described as a holistic package of legislation for trust and privacy  the Consumer Privacy Protection Act  the Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal Act  and the Artificial Intelligence  amp  Data Act  AIDA                          

Morocco edit 
In Morocco  a new legislative proposal has been put forward by a coalition of political parties in Parliament to establish the National Agency for Artificial Intelligence  AI   This agency is intended to regulate AI technologies  enhance collaboration with international entities in the field  and increase public awareness of both the possibilities and risks associated with AI             

China edit 
Further information  Artificial intelligence industry in China
The regulation of AI in China is mainly governed by the State Council of the People s Republic of China s July          A Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan   State Council Document No       in which the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council of the PRC urged the governing bodies of China to promote the development of AI up to       Regulation of the issues of ethical and legal support for the development of AI is accelerating  and policy ensures state control of Chinese companies and over valuable data  including storage of data on Chinese users within the country and the mandatory use of People s Republic of China s national standards for AI  including over big data  cloud computing  and industrial software                                      In       China published ethical guidelines for the use of AI in China which state that researchers must ensure that AI abides by shared human values  is always under human control  and is not endangering public safety              In       China introduced Interim Measures for the Management of Generative AI Services             

Council of Europe edit 
The Council of Europe  CoE  is an international organization that promotes human rights  democracy and the rule of law  It comprises    member states  including all    Signatories of the European Union s      Declaration of Cooperation on Artificial Intelligence  The CoE has created a common legal space in which the members have a legal obligation to guarantee rights as set out in the European Convention on Human Rights  Specifically in relation to AI   The Council of Europe s aim is to identify intersecting areas between AI and our standards on human rights  democracy and rule of law  and to develop relevant standard setting or capacity building solutions   The large number of relevant documents identified by the CoE include guidelines  charters  papers  reports and strategies              The authoring bodies of these AI regulation documents are not confined to one sector of society and include organizations  companies  bodies and nation states             
In       the Council of Europe initiated a process to assess the need for legally binding regulation of AI  focusing specifically on its implications for human rights and democratic values  Negotiations on a treaty began in September       involving the    member states of the Council of Europe  as well as Argentina  Australia  Canada  Costa Rica  the Holy See  Israel  Japan  Mexico  Peru  the United States of America  and Uruguay  as well as the European Union  On    May       the  Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights  Democracy and the Rule of Law  was adopted  It was opened for signature on   September       Although developed by a European organisation  the treaty is open for accession by states from other parts of the world  The first ten signatories were  Andorra  Georgia  Iceland  Norway  Moldova  San Marino  the United Kingdom  Israel  the United States  and the European Union                         

European Union edit 
Main article  Artificial Intelligence Act
The EU is one of the largest jurisdictions in the world and plays an active role in the global regulation of digital technology through the GDPR              Digital Services Act  and the Digital Markets Act                          For AI in particular  the Artificial intelligence Act is regarded in      as the most far reaching regulation of AI worldwide                         
Most European Union  EU  countries have their own national strategies towards regulating AI  but these are largely convergent              The European Union is guided by a European Strategy on Artificial Intelligence              supported by a High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence                          In April       the European Commission published its Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence  AI               following this with its Policy and investment recommendations for trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in June                   The EU Commission s High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence carries out work on Trustworthy AI  and the Commission has issued reports on the Safety and Liability Aspects of AI and on the Ethics of Automated Vehicles  In       the EU Commission sought views on a proposal for AI specific legislation  and that process is ongoing             
On February          the European Commission published its White Paper on Artificial Intelligence   A European approach to excellence and trust                          The White Paper consists of two main building blocks  an  ecosystem of excellence  and a  ecosystem of trust   The  ecosystem of trust  outlines the EU s approach for a regulatory framework for AI  In its proposed approach  the Commission distinguishes AI applications based on whether they are  high risk  or not  Only high risk AI applications should be in the scope of a future EU regulatory framework  An AI application is considered high risk if it operates in a risky sector  such as healthcare  transport or energy  and is  used in such a manner that significant risks are likely to arise   For high risk AI applications  the requirements are mainly about the         training data    data and record keeping    information to be provided    robustness and accuracy   and  human oversight   There are also requirements specific to certain usages such as remote biometric identification  AI applications that do not qualify as  high risk  could be governed by a voluntary labeling scheme  As regards compliance and enforcement  the Commission considers prior conformity assessments which could include  procedures for testing  inspection or certification  and or  checks of the algorithms and of the data sets used in the development phase   A European governance structure on AI in the form of a framework for cooperation of national competent authorities could facilitate the implementation of the regulatory framework             
A January      draft was leaked online on April                        before the Commission presented their official  Proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence  a week later               Shortly after  the Artificial Intelligence Act  also known as the AI Act  was formally proposed on this basis               This proposal includes a refinement of the      risk based approach with  this time    risk categories   minimal    limited    high  and  unacceptable                The proposal has been severely critiqued in the public debate  Academics have expressed concerns about various unclear elements in the proposal   such as the broad definition of what constitutes AI   and feared unintended legal implications  especially for vulnerable groups such as patients and migrants                            The risk category  general purpose AI  was added to the AI Act to account for versatile models like ChatGPT  which did not fit the application based regulation framework               Unlike for other risk categories  general purpose AI models can be regulated based on their capabilities  not just their uses  Weaker general purpose AI models are subject transparency requirements  while those considered to pose  systemic risks   notably those trained using computational capabilities exceeding      FLOPS  must also undergo a thorough evaluation process               A subsequent version of the AI Act was finally adopted in May                    The AI Act will be progressively enforced               Recognition of emotions and real time remote biometric identification will be prohibited  with some exemptions  such as for law enforcement              
The European Union s AI Act has created a regulatory framework with significant implications globally  This legislation introduces a risk based approach to categorizing AI systems  focusing on high risk applications like healthcare  education  and public safety               It requires organizations to ensure transparency  data governance  and human oversight in their AI solutions  While this aims to foster ethical AI use  the stringent requirements could increase compliance costs and delay technology deployment  impacting innovation driven industries      citation needed     
Observers have expressed concerns about the multiplication of legislative proposals under the von der Leyen Commission  The speed of the legislative initiatives is partially led by political ambitions of the EU and could put at risk the digital rights of the European citizens  including rights to privacy               especially in the face of uncertain guarantees of data protection through cyber security              Among the stated guiding principles in the variety of legislative proposals in the area of AI under the von der Leyen Commission are the objectives of strategic autonomy              and the concept of digital sovereignty               On May           the European Court of Auditors published a report stating that EU measures were not well coordinated with those of EU countries  that the monitoring of investments was not systematic  and that stronger governance was needed              

Germany edit 
In November                    DIN  DKE and the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy published the first edition of the  German Standardization Roadmap for Artificial Intelligence   NRM KI  and presented it to the public at the Digital Summit of the Federal Government of Germany               NRM KI describes requirements to future regulations and standards in the context of AI  The implementation of the recommendations for action is intended to help to strengthen the German economy and science in the international competition in the field of artificial intelligence and create innovation friendly conditions for this emerging technology  The first edition is a     page long document written by     experts  The second edition of the NRM KI was published to coincide with the German government s Digital Summit on December                       DIN coordinated more than     participating experts from a wide range of fields from science  industry  civil society and the public sector  The second edition is a     page long document 
On the one hand  NRM KI covers the focus topics in terms of applications  e g  medicine  mobility  energy  amp  environment  financial services  industrial automation  and fundamental issues  e g  AI classification  security  certifiability  socio technical systems  ethics                On the other hand  it provides an overview of the central terms in the field of AI and its environment across a wide range of interest groups and information sources  In total  the document covers     standardisation needs and provides six central recommendations for action              

G  edit 
On    October       members of the G  subscribe to eleven guiding principles for the design  production and implementation of advanced artificial intelligence systems  as well as a voluntary Code of Conduct for artificial intelligence developers in the context of the Hiroshima Process              
The agreement receives the applause of Ursula von der Leyen who finds in it the principles of the AI Directive  currently being finalized 

Israel edit 
On October           pursuant to government resolution     of August       the Israeli Ministry of Innovation  Science and Technology released its  Principles of Policy  Regulation and Ethics in AI  white paper for public consultation               By December       the Ministry of Innovation and the Ministry of Justice published a joint AI regulation and ethics policy paper  outlining several AI ethical principles and a set of recommendations including opting for sector based regulation  a risk based approach  preference for  soft  regulatory tools and maintaining consistency with existing global regulatory approaches to AI

In October       the Italian privacy authority approved a regulation that provides three principles for therapeutic decisions taken by automated systems  transparency of decision making processes  human supervision of automated decisions and algorithmic non discrimination              

New Zealand edit 
As of July               update       no AI specific legislation exists  but AI usage is regulated by existing laws  including the Privacy Act  the Human Rights Act  the Fair Trading Act and the Harmful Digital Communications Act              
In       the New Zealand Government sponsored a World Economic Forum pilot project titled  Reimagining Regulation for the Age of AI   aimed at creating regulatory frameworks around AI               The same year  the Privacy Act was updated to regulate the use of New Zealanders  personal information in AI               In       the Privacy Commissioner released guidance on using AI in accordance with information privacy principles               In February       the Attorney General and Technology Minister announced the formation of a Parliamentary cross party AI caucus  and that framework for the Government s use of AI was being developed  She also announced that no extra regulation was planned at that stage              

Philippines edit 
In       a bill was filed in the Philippine House of Representatives which proposed the establishment of the Artificial Intelligence Development Authority  AIDA  which would oversee the development and research of artificial intelligence  AIDA was also proposed to be a watchdog against crimes using AI              
The Commission on Elections has also considered in      the ban of using AI and deepfake for campaigning  They look to implement regulations that would apply as early as for the      general elections              

Spain edit 
In       the Spanish Ministry of Science  Innovation and Universities approved an R amp D Strategy on Artificial Intelligence              This section is an excerpt from Spanish Agency for the Supervision of Artificial Intelligence   History  edit 
With the formation of the second government of Pedro S nchez in January       the areas related to new technologies that  since       were in the Ministry of Economy  were strengthened  Thus  in      the Secretariat of State for Digitalization and Artificial Intelligence  SEDIA  was created               From this higher body  following the recommendations made by the R amp D Strategy on Artificial Intelligence of                    the National Artificial Intelligence Strategy        was developed  which already provided for actions concerning the governance of artificial intelligence and the ethical standards that should govern its use  This project was also included within the Recovery  Transformation and Resilience Plan        
During                    the Government revealed that these ideas would be developed through a new government agency  and the General State Budget for      authorized its creation and allocated five million euros for its development              
The Council of Ministers  at its meeting on    September       began the process for the election of the AESIA headquarters                               Spanish provinces presented candidatures  with the Government opting for A Coru a  which proposed the La Terraza building              

On    August       the Government approved the internal regulations of the Agency               With this  Spain became the first European country with an agency dedicated to the supervision of AI  anticipating the entry into force of the future European Regulation on Artificial Intelligence               which establishes the need for Member States to have with a supervisory authority in this matter 
Switzerland edit 
Switzerland currently has no specific AI legislation  but on    February       the Federal Council announced plans to ratify the Council of Europe s AI Convention and incorporate it into Swiss law  A draft bill and implementation plan are to be prepared by the end of       The approach includes sector specific regulation  limited cross sector rules  such as data protection  and non binding measures such as industry agreements  The goals are to support innovation  protect fundamental rights  and build public trust in AI              

United Kingdom edit 
The UK supported the application and development of AI in business via the Digital Economy Strategy                        introduced at the beginning of      by Innovate UK as part of the UK Digital Strategy               In the public sector  the Department for Digital  Culture  Media and Sport advised on data ethics and the Alan Turing Institute provided guidance on responsible design and implementation of AI systems                            In terms of cyber security  in      the National Cyber Security Centre has issued guidance on  Intelligent Security Tools                            The following year  the UK published its    year National AI Strategy               which describes actions to assess long term AI risks  including AGI related catastrophic risks              
In March       the UK released the white paper A pro innovation approach to AI regulation               This white paper presents general AI principles  but leaves significant flexibility to existing regulators in how they adapt these principles to specific areas such as transport or financial markets               In November       the UK hosted the first AI safety summit  with the prime minister Rishi Sunak aiming to position the UK as a leader in AI safety regulation                            During the summit  the UK created an AI Safety Institute  as an evolution of the Frontier AI Taskforce led by Ian Hogarth  The institute was notably assigned the responsibility of advancing the safety evaluations of the world s most advanced AI models  also called frontier AI models              
The UK government indicated its reluctance to legislate early  arguing that it may reduce the sector s growth and that laws might be rendered obselete by further technological progress              

United States edit 

Discussions on regulation of AI in the United States have included topics such as the timeliness of regulating AI  the nature of the federal regulatory framework to govern and promote AI  including what agency should lead  the regulatory and governing powers of that agency  and how to update regulations in the face of rapidly changing technology  as well as the roles of state governments and courts              

          edit 
As early as       the Obama administration had begun to focus on the risks and regulations for artificial intelligence  In a report titled Preparing For the Future of Artificial Intelligence               the National Science and Technology Council set a precedent to allow researchers to continue to develop new AI technologies with few restrictions  It is stated within the report that  the approach to regulation of AI enabled products to protect public safety should be informed by assessment of the aspects of risk                    These risks would be the principal reason to create any form of regulation  granted that any existing regulation would not apply to AI technology 

          edit 
The first main report was the National Strategic Research and Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence               On August           Section      of the Fiscal Year      John S  McCain National Defense Authorization Act  P L           established the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence  to consider the methods and means necessary to advance the development of artificial intelligence  machine learning  and associated technologies to comprehensively address the national security and defense needs of the United States                Steering on regulating security related AI is provided by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence               The Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act  S       is a proposed bill that would establish a federal initiative designed to accelerate research and development on AI for  inter alia  the economic and national security of the United States                           
On January          following an Executive Order on Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence               the White House s Office of Science and Technology Policy released a draft Guidance for Regulation of Artificial Intelligence Applications               which includes ten principles for United States agencies when deciding whether and how to regulate AI               In response  the National Institute of Standards and Technology has released a position paper               and the Defense Innovation Board has issued recommendations on the ethical use of AI              A year later  the administration called for comments on regulation in another draft of its Guidance for Regulation of Artificial Intelligence Applications              
Other specific agencies working on the regulation of AI include the Food and Drug Administration              which has created pathways to regulate the incorporation of AI in medical imaging              National Science and Technology Council also published the National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan               which received public scrutiny and recommendations to further improve it towards enabling Trustworthy AI              

          edit 
In March       the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence released their final report               In the report  they stated that  Advances in AI  including the mastery of more general AI capabilities along one or more dimensions  will likely provide new capabilities and applications  Some of these advances could lead to inflection points or leaps in capabilities  Such advances may also introduce new concerns and risks and the need for new policies  recommendations  and technical advances to assure that systems are aligned with goals and values  including safety  robustness and trustworthiness  The US should monitor advances in AI and make necessary investments in technology and give attention to policy so as to ensure that AI systems and their uses align with our goals and values  
In June       Senators Rob Portman and Gary Peters introduced the Global Catastrophic Risk Mitigation Act  The bipartisan bill  would also help counter the risk of artificial intelligence    from being abused in ways that may pose a catastrophic risk                             On October          President Joe Biden unveiled a new AI Bill of Rights               which outlines five protections Americans should have in the AI age     Safe and Effective Systems     Algorithmic Discrimination Protection    Data Privacy     Notice and Explanation  and    Human Alternatives  Consideration  and Fallback  The Bill was introduced in October      by the Office of Science and Technology Policy  OSTP   a US government department that advises the president on science and technology              

     edit 
In January       the New York City Bias Audit Law  Local Law                   was enacted by the NYC Council in November       Originally due to come into effect on   January       the enforcement date for Local Law     has been pushed back due to the high volume of comments received during the public hearing on the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection s  DCWP  proposed rules to clarify the requirements of the legislation  It eventually became effective on July                       From this date  the companies that are operating and hiring in New York City are prohibited from using automated tools to hire candidates or promote employees  unless the tools have been independently audited for bias 

President Biden meeting on Artificial Intelligence  AI  with Senators in the Oval Office in      In July       the Biden Harris Administration secured voluntary commitments from seven companies   Amazon  Anthropic  Google  Inflection  Meta  Microsoft  and OpenAI   to manage the risks associated with AI  The companies committed to ensure AI products undergo both internal and external security testing before public release  to share information on the management of AI risks with the industry  governments  civil society  and academia  to prioritize cybersecurity and protect proprietary AI system components  to develop mechanisms to inform users when content is AI generated  such as watermarking  to publicly report on their AI systems  capabilities  limitations  and areas of use  to prioritize research on societal risks posed by AI  including bias  discrimination  and privacy concerns  and to develop AI systems to address societal challenges  ranging from cancer prevention to climate change mitigation  In September       eight additional companies   Adobe  Cohere  IBM  Nvidia  Palantir  Salesforce  Scale AI  and Stability AI   subscribed to these voluntary commitments                           
The Biden administration  in October      signaled that they would release an executive order leveraging the federal government s purchasing power to shape AI regulations  hinting at a proactive governmental stance in regulating AI technologies               On October           President Biden released this Executive Order on Safe  Secure  and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence  The Executive Order addresses a variety of issues  such as focusing on standards for critical infrastructure  AI enhanced cybersecurity  and federally funded biological synthesis projects              
The Executive Order provides the authority to various agencies and departments of the US government  including the Energy and Defense departments  to apply existing consumer protection laws to AI development              
The Executive Order builds on the Administration s earlier agreements with AI companies to instate new initiatives to  red team  or stress test AI dual use foundation models  especially those that have the potential to pose security risks  with data and results shared with the federal government 
The Executive Order also recognizes AI s social challenges  and calls for companies building AI dual use foundation models to be wary of these societal problems  For example  the Executive Order states that AI should not  worsen job quality   and should not  cause labor force disruptions   Additionally  Biden s Executive Order mandates that AI must  advance equity and civil rights   and cannot disadvantage marginalized groups               It also called for foundation models to include  watermarks  to help the public discern between human and AI generated content  which has raised controversy and criticism from deepfake detection researchers              

     edit 
In February       Senator Scott Wiener introduced the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act to the California legislature  The bill drew heavily on the Biden executive order               It had the goal of reducing catastrophic risks by mandating safety tests for the most powerful AI models  If passed  the bill would have also established a publicly funded cloud computing cluster in California               On September     Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed the bill  It is considered unlikely that the legislature will override the governor s veto with a two thirds vote from both houses              
On March           the State of Tennessee enacted legislation called the ELVIS Act  aimed specifically at audio deepfakes  and voice cloning               This legislation was the first enacted legislation in the nation aimed at regulating AI simulation of image  voice and likeness                The bill passed unanimously in the Tennessee House of Representatives and Senate               This legislation s success was hoped by its supporters to inspire similar actions in other states  contributing to a unified approach to copyright and privacy in the digital age  and to reinforce the importance of safeguarding artists  rights against unauthorized use of their voices and likenesses                           
On March           Utah Governor Spencer Cox signed the S B      Artificial Intelligence Policy Act   This legislation goes into effect on May          It establishes liability  notably for companies that don t disclose their use of generative AI when required by state consumer protection laws  or when users commit criminal offense using generative AI  It also creates the Office of Artificial Intelligence Policy and the Artificial Intelligence Learning Laboratory Program                           

     edit 
In January       President Trump repealed the Biden executive order  This action reflects President Trump s preference for deregulating AI in support of innovation over safeguarding risks              

Regulation of fully autonomous weapons edit 
Main article  Lethal autonomous weapon
Legal questions related to lethal autonomous weapons systems  LAWS   in particular compliance with the laws of armed conflict  have been under discussion at the United Nations since       within the context of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons               Notably  informal meetings of experts took place in            and      and a Group of Governmental Experts  GGE  was appointed to further deliberate on the issue in       A set of guiding principles on LAWS affirmed by the GGE on LAWS were adopted in                   
In       China published a position paper questioning the adequacy of existing international law to address the eventuality of fully autonomous weapons  becoming the first permanent member of the U N  Security Council to broach the issue              and leading to proposals for global regulation               The possibility of a moratorium or preemptive ban of the development and use of LAWS has also been raised on several occasions by other national delegations to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons and is strongly advocated for by the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots   a coalition of non governmental organizations               The US government maintains that current international humanitarian law is capable of regulating the development or use of LAWS               The Congressional Research Service indicated in      that the US doesn t have LAWS in its inventory  but that its policy doesn t prohibit the development and employment of it
