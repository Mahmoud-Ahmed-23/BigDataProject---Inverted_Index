In this exclusive interview  Jamal Soliman reflects on his artistic philosophy  milestones in his career  and the challenges he has faced  He opens up about his experience in the recent series        Ahl El Khataya                The People of Sins          his collaboration with director Raouf Abdel Aziz  the future of Arab drama  and his views on art       s evolving role in society 
 nbsp 
Following your acclaimed performance in        El Tawoos         how did your collaboration with Raouf Abdel Aziz evolve in        Ahl El Khataya        
Working with Raouf Abdel Aziz has always been a rewarding experience  Our first collaboration was in        El Tawoos                which received widespread acclaim  With        Ahl El Khataya         our work matured further  The series merges elements of reality and fantasy a style Raouf is particularly fond of and  thankfully  it resonated strongly with audiences  Raouf brings a visionary perspective and a unique visual language to his work  His talent as a director of photography elevates every scene  making our collaboration artistically fulfilling  I truly hope we work together again in the future 
How did you approach the character of Noah in        Ahl El Khataya        
For me  building a character begins with imagination and a deep dive into the world the character inhabits  I always consult closely with the director to develop a nuanced portrayal  In        El Tawoos         I studied real life lawyers  For        Ahl El Khataya         I focused on the lives of tradesmen and merchants  Noah is a man from the countryside who has adapted to city life  carrying within him a profound internal struggle between good and evil  I ve encountered many such individuals in my daily life  and their stories greatly influenced my interpretation of Noah 

What core message does        Ahl El Khataya        aim to deliver 
At its heart  the series explores the eternal conflict between good and evil  and how our experiences shape us  Noah  as the eldest brother  confronts both personal and familial challenges  The narrative raises questions about how economic and social pressures influence our decisions  while still emphasizing that we are responsible for our choices  The message is clear  while life is filled with challenges  we must hold fast to our moral values 
How do you assess the current state of Syrian drama 
Syrian drama has suffered greatly due to the conflict and societal fragmentation  Yet many Syrian artists have persisted  continuing to create work that reflects both the pain and the hope of our people  I m optimistic  With more space for creative freedom and proper investment in the cultural sector  Syrian drama will undoubtedly return stronger  deeper  and more impactful 
What are your thoughts on the broader landscape of Arab drama 
The greatest challenge facing Arab drama today is the lack of mature scripts  It s not a matter of talent there are many skilled writers but of rushed production schedules and commercial priorities  Writers need time and space to develop their narratives  We need a shift in production values  one that prioritizes artistic quality over quick returns  Production must serve the story not the other way around 
Can you share any upcoming projects 
Yes  I m currently preparing for a new feature film  the details of which I ll reveal soon  In addition  we re set to begin filming a new series titled        Journey to the Well         This project carries a philosophical and humanistic tone  and I believe it will resonate strongly with audiences 

How do you maintain a balance between your career and personal life 
Striking that balance is essential  While my work demands focus and dedication  I always make time for my family and moments of solitude  These quiet times help me recharge and stay grounded  In fact  my personal life often serves as a source of inspiration  fueling my creativity 
You       ve worked in both Syrian and Egyptian cinema  How do you compare your experiences 
Egyptian cinema holds a unique place in the Arab world  My work in films like        Leilet El Baby Doll        with Mahmoud Abdel Aziz and        El Kahen        with Hussein Fahmy was incredibly enriching  Cinema presents a distinct challenge it requires concise  intense storytelling  whereas television drama allows for deeper character development  Both formats are rewarding  and I value the ability to move between them 
What is your take on the current state of Arab social drama 
There s been notable progress  More works are engaging with real societal issues poverty  education  injustice  However  we still need scripts that delve deeper  that avoid superficial treatment of complex problems  Art can spark meaningful change  but only when the message is clear  sincere  and thoughtfully crafted 
Do you believe art has a responsibility to raise social awareness 
Absolutely  Art is one of the most powerful tools for shaping public consciousness  It brings difficult conversations into the spotlight and challenges prevailing norms  While entertainment is important  art must also reflect truth and inspire change  That s when it becomes truly meaningful 
How do you see the impact of technology and digital streaming on the Arab art industry 
Digital platforms have transformed the industry  They allow artists to reach audiences directly  breaking traditional barriers  But with this opportunity comes the responsibility to maintain high standards  Competition is fierce  and audiences are more discerning  To stand out  we must focus on substance  not just style 
What challenges must Arab drama overcome to thrive in the future 
We need better storytelling  Many productions still rely on outdated formulas  We must nurture bold  innovative writers and support production models that value creativity over volume  If we can overcome these hurdles  Arab drama has the potential to compete on the global stage 
Do you foresee a revival of artistic production in Syria 
Yes  I believe the potential is there  Despite the hardships  many artists are working tirelessly to keep Syrian art alive  If we invest in culture  protect freedom of expression  and create the right conditions  Syrian drama will not only recover it will flourish with renewed strength and maturity
