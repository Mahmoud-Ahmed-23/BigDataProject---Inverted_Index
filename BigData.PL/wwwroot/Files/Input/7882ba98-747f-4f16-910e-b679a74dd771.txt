Jeopardy  is an American television game show created by Merv Griffin  The show is a quiz competition that reverses the traditional question and answer format of many quiz shows  Rather than being given questions  contestants are instead given general knowledge clues in the form of answers and they must identify the person  place  thing  or idea that the clue describes  phrasing each response in the form of a question            
The original daytime version debuted on NBC on March           and aired until January          A nighttime syndicated edition aired weekly from September      to September       and a revival  The All New Jeopardy   ran on NBC from October      to March      on weekdays  The syndicated show familiar to modern viewers and aired daily  currently by Sony Pictures Television     c       premiered on September          
Art Fleming served as host for all versions of the show between      and       Don Pardo served as announcer until       and John Harlan announced for the           season  The daily syndicated version premiered in      with Alex Trebek as host and Johnny Gilbert as announcer  Trebek hosted until his death  with his last episode airing January          after over    years in the role  Following his death  a variety of guest hosts completed the season            beginning with record holding former contestant Ken Jennings  each hosting for a few weeks before passing the role on to someone else  Then executive producer Mike Richards initially assumed the position of permanent host in September       but relinquished the role within a week             Mayim Bialik and Jennings served as permanent rotating hosts of the syndicated series until December       when Jennings became the sole syndicated host             While Bialik was originally arranged to host additional primetime specials on ABC  and spin offs  the announcement of Jeopardy  Masters in      meant these duties were shared as well  Following Bialik s withdrawal in part of supporting writers and actors due to the      Hollywood labor disputes  Jennings assumed hosting duties for all forms of media 
Currently in its   st season  Jeopardy  is one of the longest running game shows of all time  The show has consistently enjoyed a wide viewership and received many accolades from professional television critics  With over       episodes aired             the daily syndicated version of Jeopardy  has won a record    Emmy Awards as well as a Peabody Award  In       the program was ranked No     on TV Guide     s list of the    greatest shows in American television history  Jeopardy  has also gained a worldwide following with regional adaptations in many other countries 


Gameplay edit 
 Double Jeopardy   redirects here  For other uses  see Double Jeopardy 
Each game of Jeopardy  features three contestants competing in three rounds  Jeopardy   Double Jeopardy   and Final Jeopardy             In each round  contestants are presented trivia clues phrased as answers  to which they must respond in the form of a question that correctly identifies whatever the clue is describing             For example  instead of asking   Who is the only U S  President to marry in the White House   and the answer being  Grover Cleveland   the clue is  He is the only U S  president to marry in the White House  and the contestant would respond by asking  Who is Grover Cleveland             

The layout of the Jeopardy  game board since November           showing the dollar values used in the first round  in the second round  the values are doubled   Categories at the top of the board vary between each round and episode 
The Jeopardy  and Double Jeopardy  rounds each feature game boards consisting of six categories with five clues each  The clues are valued by dollar amounts from lowest to highest  ostensibly by difficulty             The values of the clues increased over time  with those in the Double Jeopardy  round always being double the range of the Jeopardy  round             On the original Jeopardy  series  clue values in the first round ranged from     to     in the Jeopardy  round and     to      in Double Jeopardy             On The All New Jeopardy   they ranged from     to      and     to       The      series  clue values originally ranged from      to      in Jeopardy  and      to        in Double Jeopardy             These ranges were increased to             and              respectively  on November                     
Gameplay begins when the returning champion selects a clue by indicating its category and dollar value  The two  or if there is no returning champion  three  challengers participate in a random draw prior to taping to determine contestant order  and if there is no returning champion  the contestant who drew the first lectern starts  The underlying clue is revealed and read aloud by the host  after which any contestant may ring in using a lock out device  The first contestant to successfully ring in is prompted to respond to the clue by stating a question containing the correct answer to the clue  Any grammatically coherent question with the correct answer within it counts as a correct response              If the contestant responds correctly  its dollar value is added to the contestant s score  and they may select a new clue from the board  An incorrect response or failure to respond within five seconds deducts the clue s value from the contestant s score and allows the other contestants the opportunity to ring in and respond  If the response is not technically incorrect but otherwise judged too vague  the contestant is given additional time to provide a more specific response             Whenever none of the contestants ring in and respond correctly  the host gives the correct response  and the player who selected the previous clue chooses the next clue              Gameplay continues until the board is cleared or the round s time length expires  which is typically indicated by a beeping sound 
The contestant who has the lowest score selects the first clue to start the Double Jeopardy  round              Since       if there is a tie for the contestant with the lowest score  the contestant with the last correct question among the tied players selects first             
A  Daily Double  clue is hidden behind one clue in the Jeopardy  round  and two in Double Jeopardy             The name and inspiration were taken from a horse racing term              Daily Double clues with a sound or video component are known as  Audio Daily Doubles  or  Video Daily Doubles   respectively  Before the clue is revealed  the contestant who has selected the Daily Double must declare a wager  from a minimum of    to a maximum of their entire score  known as a  true Daily Double   or the highest clue value available in the round  whichever is greater                          Only the contestant who chooses the Daily Double is allowed to answer  A correct response adds the value of the wager to the contestant s score while an incorrect response or failure to provide a response deducts the same value  Whether the contestant responds correctly or not  they choose the next clue             
During the Jeopardy  round  contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response in the form of a question  although the host will remind them to watch their phrasing in future responses  In the Double Jeopardy  round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy  round  the phrasing rule is followed more strictly  with a response only able to be ruled as correct if it is phrased properly in question form  A contestant who initially does not phrase a response in the form of a question must re phrase it before the host rules against them             
Contestants are encouraged to select the clues in order from lowest to highest value  as the clues are sometimes written in each category to flow from one to the next  Deviating from this is known as the  Forrest Bounce               a strategy in which contestants randomly pick clues to confuse opponents that was first used in      by Chuck Forrest  who won over         in his initial run as champion  Trebek expressed that this strategy not only annoyed him but also the staff  since it disrupts the rhythm that develops when revealing the clues and increases the potential for error              Another strategy used by some contestants is to play all of the higher valued clues first and build up a substantial lead  starting at the bottom of the board  This strategy was regularly used by James Holzhauer during his winning streak between April and June                              
From the premiere of the original Jeopardy  until the end of the         syndicated season  contestants were allowed to ring in as soon as the clue was revealed  Since September       contestants are required to wait until the clue is read before ringing in  To accommodate the rule change  lights were added to the game board  unseen by home viewers  to signify when it is permissible for contestants to signal              Attempting to signal before the light goes on locks the contestant out for half of a second              The change was made to allow the home audience to play along more easily and to keep an extremely fast contestant from potentially dominating the game  In pre      episodes  a sound accompanied a contestant ringing in  According to Trebek  the sound was eliminated because it was  distracting to the viewers  and presented a problem when contestants rang in while Trebek was still reading the clue              Contestants who are visually impaired or blind are given a card with the category names printed in Braille before each round begins                         
To ensure fairness in competition and accuracy in scores  the judges double check their own rulings throughout each episode  If it is determined at any point that a previous response was wrongly ruled correct or incorrect during the taping of an episode  the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity  typically either at the start of the next round segment or immediately after a Daily Double is found  with the host providing any necessary explanation regarding the changes  If an error that may have affected the result is not discovered until after taping of an episode is completed  the affected contestants are invited back to compete on a future show complying with federal quiz show regulations             
Contestants who finish Double Jeopardy  with zero dollars or a negative score are automatically eliminated from the game at that point and awarded a consolation prize  On at least one episode hosted by Art Fleming  all three contestants finished Double Jeopardy  with zero dollars or less  and as a result  no Final Jeopardy  round was played              This rule is still in place for the syndicated version              although staff has suggested that it is not set in stone and they may decide to display the clue for home viewers  play if such a situation were ever to occur             

Final Jeopardy  edit 
 Final Jeopardy   redirects here  For other uses  see Final Jeopardy 
The Final Jeopardy  round features a single clue that  according to Answers in the Form of Questions  typically requires a two step thought process to answer  At the end of the Double Jeopardy  round  the host announces the Final Jeopardy  category and a commercial break follows  Contestants who finish Double Jeopardy  with less than    do not participate in this round  During the break  partitions are placed between the contestant lecterns  and each contestant makes a final wager  they may wager any amount of their earnings  but may not wager certain numbers with connotations that are deemed inappropriate              Contestants write their wagers using a light pen on an electronic display on their lectern within a time limit of five minutes  during which they also phrase the question  which is pre written during the wager              After the break  the Final Jeopardy  clue is revealed and read by the host  The contestants have    seconds to write their responses on the electronic display  while the show s  Think   music plays  If either the display or the pen malfunctions  contestants can manually write their responses and wagers using an index card and marker  although the index card has the required phrasing pre printed on each side   Who What    Visually impaired or blind contestants typically type their responses and wagers with a computer keyboard                         
Contestants  responses are revealed in order of their pre Final Jeopardy  scores from lowest to highest  Once a correct response is revealed the host confirms it  Otherwise  the host reveals the correct response if all contestants responded incorrectly  A correct response adds the amount of the contestant s wager to their score  A miss  failure to respond  insufficiently specific response  misspelling that affects the pronunciation of the answer  or failure to phrase the response as a question  even if correct  deducts it             
The contestant with the highest score at the end of the round is that day s winner  If there is a tie for second place  consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy  round  If all three contestants finish with zero dollars  no one returns as champion for the next show  and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy  round  the two contestants who were first and second receive the second place prize  and the contestant in third receives the third place prize  In tournament play  if the game requires a winner  the standard tiebreaker will be used 
Various researchers have studied Final Jeopardy  wagering strategies  If the leader s score is more than twice the second place contestant s score  a situation known as a  runaway game    the leader can guarantee victory by making a sufficiently small wager                                    Otherwise  according to Jeopardy  College Champion Keith Williams  the leader usually wagers an amount that would be a dollar greater than twice the second place contestant s score  guaranteeing a win with a correct response              Writing about Jeopardy  wagering in the     s  mathematicians George Gilbert and Rhonda Hatcher said that  most players wager aggressively                                    

Winnings edit 
The top scorer in each game is paid their winnings in cash and returns to play in the next match  Non winners receive consolation prizes instead of their winnings in the game  Since May           consolation prizes have been awarded in cash        for second place contestants and        for third place contestants              Since travel and lodging are generally not provided for contestants  cash consolation prizes offset these costs  Production covers the cost of travel for returning champions and players invited back because of errors who must make multiple trips to Los Angeles  Production also covers the cost of travel if a tournament travels  does not stay in Los Angeles  on the second week              Starting in Season     according to the official podcast in August       as a result of inflation  consolation prizes were raised        each to        for second and        for third 
During Art Fleming s hosting run  all three contestants received their winnings in cash where applicable  This was changed at the start of Trebek s hosting run to avoid the problem of contestants who stopped participating in the game  or avoided wagering in Final Jeopardy   rather than risk losing the money they had already won  This also allowed the increase to clue values since only one contestant s score is paid instead of three              From      to       non winning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise  which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration  Since       a presenting sponsor has provided cash prizes to the losing contestants             

Returning champions edit 
The winner of each episode returns to compete against two new contestants on the next episode  Originally  a contestant who won five consecutive days retired undefeated and was guaranteed a spot in the Tournament of Champions  The five day limit was eliminated September                     
In rare instances  contestants tie for first place  The rules related to ties have changed over time  Since November                       ties for first place following Final Jeopardy  are broken with a tie breaker clue  resulting in only one champion being named  keeping their winnings  and returning to compete in the next show  The tied contestants are given the category and read the single clue  and the first contestant to buzz in must give the correct question  A contestant cannot win by default if the opponent gives an incorrect question or forgets to phrase the response as a question  even if correct   The contestant must give a correct question to win the game  If neither player gives the correct question  another clue is given              Previously  if two or all three contestants tied for first place  they were declared  co champions   and each retained his or her winnings and  unless one was a five time champion who retired prior to       returned on the following episode  A tie occurred on the January           episode when Arthur Chu  leading at the end of Double Jeopardy   wagered to tie challenger Carolyn Collins rather than winning  Chu followed Jeopardy  College Champion Keith Williams s advice to wager for the tie to increase the leader s chances of winning                          A three way  non zero  tie for first place has only occurred once on the syndicated version hosted by Trebek  on March           when Scott Weiss  Jamey Kirby  and Anders Martinson all ended the game with                                  Until March                                  no regular game had ended in a tie breaker 
If no contestant finishes Final Jeopardy  with a positive total  there is no winner and three new contestants compete on the next episode  This has happened on several episodes  including the second episode hosted by Trebek                                                  A winner unable to return as champion because of a change in personal circumstances                  for example  illness or a job offer                  may be allowed to appear as a co champion  now a rare occurrence since the co champion rule was disestablished in early Season     in a later episode                                      If a light pen failure occurs during the Final Jeopardy  round  extra time is given  and the round could have an outcome on the game  officials have the right to declare co champions with both affected players being paid their scores             

Variations for tournament play edit 
Throughout each season  Jeopardy  features various special tournaments for particular groups  as named in  Tournaments and other events  below   Each year at the Tournament of Champions  the players who had won the most games and money in the previous season come back to compete against each other for a large cash prize  Tournaments generally feature    contestants and run for    consecutive episodes  They generally take place across three rounds  the quarterfinal round  five games   the semifinal round  three games   and the final round  two games  
The first five episodes  the quarterfinals  feature three new contestants each day  Other than in the Tournament of Champions  the quarterfinals are unseeded and contestants participate in a random draw to determine playing order and lectern positions over the course of the five games  The Tournament of Champions is seeded based on total winnings in regular games to determine playing order and lectern positions  with the top five players occupying the champion s lectern for the quarterfinal games  Since the removal of the five game limit in       in the unlikely case of a tie in total winnings between two Tournament of Champions players  the player who won the most games receives the higher seed  If still tied  seeding is determined by comparing the tied players  previous aggregate scores 
The winners of the five quarterfinal games and the four highest scoring non winners   wild cards   advance to the semifinals  which run for three days  The semifinals are seeded with the quarterfinal winners being seeded     based on their quarterfinal scores  and the wild cards being seeded      The winners of the quarterfinal games with the three highest scores occupy the champion s lectern for the semifinals  The winners of the three semifinal games advance to play in a two game final match  in which the scores from both games are combined to determine the overall standings  This format has been used since the first Tournament of Champions in      and was devised by Trebek himself             
To prevent later contestants from playing to beat the earlier wild card scores instead of playing to win  contestants are  completely isolated from the studio until it is their time to compete              
If none of the contestants in a standard    player tournament format quarterfinal end with a positive score  no contestant automatically qualifies from that game  and an additional wild card contestant advances instead              This occurred in the quarterfinals of the      Seniors Tournament and the semifinals of the      Teen Tournament  where the rule was in effect during the semifinals  but after that tournament the rule has changed for semifinals and finals             
As the players are not isolated during the semifinals the way they are during the quarterfinals  show officials discovered a flaw after the      Teen Tournament  because the triple zero loss happened in the second semifinal that allowed the third semifinal of the      Teen Tournament to be played differently from the first  which was played before the triple zero loss    Starting with the      Tournament of Champions  semifinal games  like the two game finals  must have a winner  Players who participate in Final Jeopardy  will participate in the standard tie breaker  regardless of the score being zero or a positive score  Similarly  if all three players have a zero score at the end of a two game match  a normal tournament finals format will proceed to a tie breaker  In a tournament format where a player must win multiple games to win the tournament  such as the      Greatest of All Time or      Tournament of Champions  or in the quarterfinals of tournaments without wild cards where a player must win the game to advance     or    players   the tie breaker will be used regardless of the score being zero or positive for players to win the game and either advance to the next round or receive the point towards winning the tournament  This was confirmed by Ken Jennings in a post match interview posted on the show s website during the Season    Champions Wildcard Tournament             
In the standard tournament finals format  contestants who finish Double Jeopardy  with a zero dollars or negative score on either day do not play Final Jeopardy  that day  Their score for that leg is recorded as zero dollars 

Conception and development edit 
Logo for the original  Jeopardy              
In a      Associated Press profile released shortly before the original Jeopardy  series premiered  Merv Griffin offered the following account of how he created the quiz show 

My wife Julann just came up with the idea one day when we were in a plane bringing us back to New York City from Duluth  I was mulling over game show ideas  when she noted that there had not been a successful  question and answer  game on the air since the quiz show scandals  Why not do a switch  and give the answers to the contestant and let them come up with the question  She fired a couple of answers to me          and the question of course was  How many feet in a mile   Another was     Wistful Vista   that was Fibber and Mollie McGee s address  I loved the idea  went straight to NBC with the idea  and they bought it without even looking at a pilot show                         

Griffin s first conception of the game used a board comprising ten categories with ten clues each  but after finding that this board could not easily be shown on camera  he reduced it to two rounds of thirty clues each  with five clues in each of six categories              He originally intended requiring grammatically correct phrasing  e g   only accepting  Who is     for a person   but after finding that grammatical correction slowed the game down  he decided to accept any correct response that was in question form              Griffin discarded his initial title of What s the Question  when skeptical network executive Ed Vane rejected his original concept of the game  claiming   It doesn t have enough jeopardies                          
The format of giving contestants the answers and requiring the questions had previously been used by the Gil Fates hosted program CBS Television Quiz  which aired from July      until May

Art Fleming was the original host of the show throughout both NBC runs and its brief weekly syndicated run  between      and       Alex Trebek served as host of the daily syndicated version from its premiere in      until his death in                   except when he switched places with Wheel of Fortune host Pat Sajak as an April Fool s joke on April                     
Trebek was still serving as host  having taped his last episode on October           for an intended Christmas Day broadcast  when contingency plans were made for him to miss the next taping  scheduled for November             In a New York magazine interview from       then consulting producer and former contestant Ken Jennings noted supervising producers Lisa Broffman and Rocky Schmidt had named him interim host for that taping and remembered his last conversation with Trebek days before rehearsal was to commence              In Sony Pictures Television s official Jeopardy  podcast in       Broffman noted the rehearsal for Jennings was scheduled November          but canceled when Schmidt gave staff the news that Trebek had died that day             
At the time of Trebek s death  producers publicly declined to discuss any plans to introduce his successor while stating that they had enough new episodes with Trebek as host to run through Christmas Day              On November          the first episode to air after Trebek s death  executive producer Mike Richards paid tribute to Trebek  after a few seconds of silence where the lights on the Jeopardy  set  which had been set up for Jennings to host before Trebek s death  slowly dimmed              That episode  as well as subsequent episodes that aired after Trebek s death  included a dedication screen at the end of the credits through the remainder of the season              To compensate for concerns over pre emptions caused by holiday week specials and sports  SPT postponed the air dates of Trebek s final week  the episodes scheduled for the week of December       were moved to January            Before Trebek s final episodes  reruns of episodes in which he recorded clues on location were shown from December           to January

Production edit 
The daily syndicated version of Jeopardy  is produced by Sony Pictures Television  previously known as Columbia TriStar Television  the successor company to original producer Merv Griffin Enterprises                The copyright holder is Jeopardy Productions  which  like SPT  operates as a subsidiary of Sony Pictures Entertainment               The rights to distribute the program worldwide are owned by CBS Media Ventures      f      which absorbed original distributor King World Productions in                    However  in November       CBS was sued by Sony  alleging that the company was engaging in preferential treatment of CBS owned programming that prevented it from meeting its obligations to maximize the value of Wheel and Jeopardy  on the syndication market  The company cited the bundling of lower rated CBS shows with Wheel and Jeopardy   such as The Drew Barrymore Show and Hot Bench   prioritizing the clearance of its wholly owned shows  such as Entertainment Tonight  on the highest rated stations in markets at the expense of the game shows  and laying off their dedicated marketing teams during layoffs associated with the CBS Viacom merger  Furthermore  a secondary charge was that CBS had given preferential treatment to their Australian network in offering a new Australian revival of Wheel to their own network   Sony argued that the cutbacks had  kneecapped its ability to meet its contractual obligations                Litigation continues to this day  and affects all Sony programming with the network

The best known theme song on Jeopardy  is  Think    originally composed by Griffin under the title  A Time for Tony   as a lullaby for his son                Think   has always been used for the    second period in Final Jeopardy  when the contestants write down their responses  and since the syndicated version debuted in       a rendition of that tune has been used as the main theme song                Think   has become so popular that it has been used in many different contexts  from sporting events to weddings                its    second countdown has become synonymous with any deadline pressure                Griffin estimated that the use of  Think   had earned him royalties of over          million throughout his lifetime                Think   led Griffin to win the Broadcast Music  Inc   BMI  President s Award in                    and during GSN s      Game Show Awards special  it was named  Best Game Show Theme Song                In       the main theme  later rearranged in       and Final Jeopardy   Think   cue were rearranged by Steve Kaplan  who served as music director until his December      death               Then in       the Jeopardy  music package was rearranged again  this time by Chris Bell Music  amp  Sound Design               A fully synthesized version of the main theme  which is based on the      arrangement  was composed by Bleeding Fingers Music and has been used since

In       Fleming expressed dissatisfaction with the daily syndicated Jeopardy  series in an essay published in Sports Illustrated  He confessed that he only watched the Trebek version infrequently only for a handful of questions and criticized this iteration mainly for its Hollywood setting  Fleming believed that in contrast to New Yorkers who Fleming considered being more intelligent and authentic  moving the show to Hollywood brought both an unrealistic glamour and a dumbing down of the program that he disdained  He also disliked the decision to not award losing contestants their cash earnings  believing the parting gifts offered instead were cheap  and expressed surprise that what he considered a parlor game had transformed into such a national phenomenon under Trebek               In television interviews  Fleming expressed similar sentiments while also noting that he approved of Trebek s approach to hosting  that Fleming and Trebek were personal friends and that  despite the modern show s flaws  it was still one of the best television shows              
Jeopardy      s answer and question format has become widely entrenched  Fleming observed that other game shows had contestants phrasing their answers in question form  leading hosts to remind them that they are not competing on Jeopardy
