English Heritage blue plaque at    Bracknell Gardens  Hampstead  London  commemorating Aldous  his brother Julian  and his father Leonard
Huxley was born in Godalming  Surrey  England  on    July                               He was the third son of the writer and schoolmaster Leonard Huxley  who edited The Cornhill Magazine              and his first wife  Julia Arnold  who founded Prior s Field School  Julia was the niece of poet and critic Matthew Arnold and the sister of Mrs Humphry Ward  Julia named him Aldous after a character in one of her sister s novels              Aldous was the grandson of Thomas Henry Huxley  the zoologist  agnostic  and controversialist who had often been called  Darwin s Bulldog   His brother Julian Huxley and half brother Andrew Huxley also became outstanding biologists  Aldous had another brother  Noel Trevenen Huxley              who took his own life after a period of clinical depression             
As a child  Huxley s nickname was  Ogie   diminutive for  Ogre               He was described by his brother  Julian  as someone who frequently contemplated  the strangeness of things               According to his cousin and contemporary Gervas Huxley  he had an early interest in drawing             
Huxley s education began in his father s well equipped botanical laboratory  after which he enrolled at Hillside School near Godalming                          He was taught there by his own mother for several years until she became terminally ill  After Hillside he went on to Eton College  His mother died in       when he was     his father later remarried   He contracted the eye disease keratitis punctata in       this  left  him  practically blind for two to three years              and  ended his early dreams of becoming a doctor               In October       Huxley entered Balliol College  Oxford  where he studied English literature              He volunteered for the British Army in January       for the Great War  however  he was rejected on health grounds  being half blind in one eye              His eyesight later partly recovered  He edited Oxford Poetry in       and in June of that year graduated BA with first class honours              His brother Julian wrote 

I believe his blindness was a blessing in disguise  For one thing  it put paid to his idea of taking up medicine as a career          His uniqueness lay in his universalism  He was able to take all knowledge for his province             
Following his years at Balliol  Huxley  being financially indebted to his father  decided to find employment  He taught French for a year at Eton College  where Eric Blair  who was to take the pen name George Orwell  and Steven Runciman were among his pupils  He was mainly remembered as being an incompetent schoolmaster unable to keep order in class  Nevertheless  Blair and others spoke highly of his excellent command of language             
Huxley also worked for a time during the     s at Brunner and Mond  an advanced chemical plant in Billingham in County Durham  northeast England  According to an introduction to his science fiction novel Brave New World         the experience he had there of  an ordered universe in a world of planless incoherence  was an important source for the novel             

Career edit

Huxley completed his first  unpublished  novel at the age of    and began writing seriously in his early twenties  establishing himself as a successful writer and social satirist  His first published novels were social satires  Crome Yellow         Antic Hay         Those Barren Leaves         and Point Counter Point         Brave New World        was his fifth novel and first dystopian work  In the     s  he was also a contributor to Vanity Fair and British Vogue magazines

Bloomsbury Group members  July        Left to right  Lady Ottoline Morrell  age      Maria Nys  age      who would become Mrs Huxley  Lytton Strachey  age      Duncan Grant  age      and Vanessa Bell  age    
During the First World War  Huxley spent much of his time at Garsington Manor near Oxford  home of Lady Ottoline Morrell  working as a farm labourer  While at the Manor  he met several Bloomsbury Group figures  including Bertrand Russell  Alfred North Whitehead              and Clive Bell  Later  in Crome Yellow         he caricatured the Garsington lifestyle  Jobs were very scarce  but in       John Middleton Murry was reorganising the Athenaeum and invited Huxley to join the staff  He accepted immediately  and quickly married the Belgian refugee Maria Nys              also at Garsington              They lived with their young son in Italy part of the time during the     s  where Huxley would visit his friend D  H  Lawrence  Following Lawrence s death in       he and Maria were present at his death in Provence   Huxley edited Lawrence s letters                     Very early in       in London  Huxley met Gerald Heard  a writer and broadcaster  philosopher and interpreter of contemporary science  Heard was nearly five years older than Huxley  and introduced him to a variety of profound ideas  subtle interconnections  and various emerging spiritual and psychotherapy methods             
Works of this period included novels about the dehumanising aspects of scientific progress   his magnum opus Brave New World   and on pacifist themes  Eyeless in Gaza               In Brave New World  set in a dystopian London  Huxley portrays a society operating on the principles of mass production and Pavlovian conditioning              Huxley was strongly influenced by F  Matthias Alexander  on whom he based a character in Eyeless in Gaza

During this period  Huxley began to write and edit non fiction works on pacifist issues  including Ends and Means         An Encyclopedia of Pacifism  and Pacifism and Philosophy  and was an active member of the Peace Pledge Union  PPU              

Life in the United States edit 
In       Huxley moved to Hollywood with his wife Maria  son Matthew Huxley  and friend Gerald Heard  Cyril Connolly wrote  of the two intellectuals  Huxley and Heard  in the late     s   all European avenues had been exhausted in the search for a way forward   politics  art  science   pitching them both toward the US in                    Huxley lived in the U S   mainly southern California                                      until his death  and for a time in Taos  New Mexico  where he wrote Ends and Means         The book contains tracts on war              inequality              religion             and ethics             
Heard introduced Huxley to Vedanta  Upanishad centered philosophy   meditation  and vegetarianism through the principle of ahimsa  In       Huxley befriended Jiddu Krishnamurti  whose teachings he greatly admired  Huxley and Krishnamurti entered into an enduring exchange  sometimes edging on debate  over many years  with Krishnamurti representing the more rarefied  detached  ivory tower perspective and Huxley  with his pragmatic concerns  the more socially and historically informed position  Huxley wrote a foreword to Krishnamurti s quintessential statement  The First and Last Freedom                    
Huxley and Heard became Vedantists in the group formed around Hindu Swami Prabhavananda  and subsequently introduced Christopher Isherwood to the circle  Not long afterwards  Huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas  The Perennial Philosophy  which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world                         
Huxley became a close friend of Remsen Bird  president of Occidental College  He spent much time at the college in the Eagle Rock neighbourhood of Los Angeles  The college appears as  Tarzana College  in his satirical novel After Many a Summer         The novel won Huxley a British literary award  the      James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction              Huxley also incorporated Bird into the novel             
During this period  Huxley earned a substantial income as a Hollywood screenwriter  Christopher Isherwood  in his autobiography My Guru and His Disciple  states that Huxley earned more than        per week  approximately                     in      dollars  as a screenwriter  and that he used much of it to transport Jewish and left wing writer and artist refugees from Hitler s Germany to the US              In March       Huxley s friend Anita Loos  a novelist and screenwriter  put him in touch with Metro Goldwyn Mayer  MGM   which hired him for Madame Curie which was originally to star Greta Garbo and be directed by George Cukor   Eventually  the film was completed by MGM in      with a different director and cast   Huxley received screen credit for Pride and Prejudice        and was paid for his work on a number of other films  including Jane Eyre         He was commissioned by Walt Disney in      to write a script based on Alice s Adventures in Wonderland and the biography of the story s author  Lewis Carroll  The script was not used  however             
Huxley wrote an introduction to the posthumous publication of J  D  Unwin s      book Hopousia or The Sexual and Economic Foundations of a New Society             
On    October       Huxley wrote to George Orwell  author of Nineteen Eighty Four  congratulating him on  how fine and how profoundly important the book is   In his letter  he predicted 

  Within the next generation I believe that the world s leaders will discover that infant conditioning and narcohypnosis are more efficient  as instruments of government  than clubs and prisons  and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and kicking them into obedience              
In       Huxley and Maria applied for United States citizenship and presented themselves for examination  When Huxley refused to bear arms for the U S  and would not state that his objections were based on religious ideals  the only excuse allowed under the McCarran Act  the judge had to adjourn the proceedings                          He withdrew his application  Nevertheless  he remained in the U S  In       Huxley turned down an offer to be made a Knight Bachelor by the Macmillan government without giving a reason  his brother Julian had been knighted in       while his brother Andrew would be knighted in                  
In the fall semester of      Huxley was invited by Professor Huston Smith to be the Carnegie Visiting professor of humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  MIT               As part of the MIT centennial program of events organised by the Department of Humanities  Huxley presented a series of lectures titled   What a Piece of Work is a Man  which concerned history  language  and art             
Robert S  de Ropp  scientist  humanitarian  and author   who had spent time with Huxley in England in the     s  connected with him again in the U S  in the early     s and wrote that  the enormous intellect  the beautifully modulated voice  the gentle objectivity  all were unchanged  He was one of the most highly civilized human beings I had ever met              

Late in life perspectives edit 
Biographer Harold H  Watts wrote that Huxley s writings in the  final and extended period of his life  are  the work of a man who is meditating on the central problems of many modern men               Huxley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the developed world might make for itself  From these  he made some warnings in his writings and talks  In a      televised interview conducted by journalist Mike Wallace  Huxley outlined several major concerns  the difficulties and dangers of world overpopulation  the tendency towards distinctly hierarchical social organisation  the crucial importance of evaluating the use of technology in mass societies susceptible to persuasion  the tendency to promote modern politicians to a naive public as well marketed commodities              In a December      letter to brother Julian  summarizing a paper he had presented in Santa Barbara  he wrote   What I said was that if we didn t pretty quickly start thinking of human problems in ecological terms rather than in terms of power politics we should very soon be in a bad way              
Huxley s engagement with Eastern wisdom traditions was entirely compatible with a strong appreciation of modern science  Biographer Milton Birnbaum wrote that Huxley  ended by embracing both science and Eastern religion               In his last book  Literature and Science  Huxley wrote that  The ethical and philosophical implications of modern science are more Buddhist than Christian                  In  A Philosopher s Visionary Prediction   published one month before he died  Huxley endorsed training in general semantics and  the nonverbal world of culturally uncontaminated consciousness   writing that  We must learn how to be mentally silent  we must cultivate the art of pure receptivity      T he individual must learn to decondition himself  must be able to cut holes in the fence of verbalized symbols that hems him in              

Spiritual views edit 
See also  Spiritual but not religious
For much of his life  Huxley described himself as agnostic  a word coined by his grandfather Thomas Henry Huxley  a scientist who championed the scientific method and was a major supporter of Darwin s theories  This is the definition he gave    it is wrong for a man to say that he is certain of the objective truth of any proposition unless he can produce evidence which logically justifies that certainty               Aldous Huxley s agnosticism  together with his speculative propensity  made it difficult for him fully embrace any form of institutionalised religion              Over the last    years of his life  he accepted and wrote about concepts found in Vedanta and was a leading advocate of the Perennial Philosophy  which holds that the same metaphysical truths are found in all the major religions of the world                                     
In the     s  Huxley was skeptical of religion   Earlier in his career he had rejected mysticism  often poking fun at it in his novels                    Gerald Heard became an influential friend of Huxley  and since the mid     s had been exploring Vedanta              as a way of understanding individual human life and the individual s relationship to the universe  Heard and Huxley both saw the political implications of Vedanta  which could help bring about peace  specifically that there is an underlying reality that all humans and the universe are a part of  In the     s  Huxley and Gerald Heard both became active in the effort to avoid another world war  writing essays and eventually publicly speaking in support of the Peace Pledge Union  But  they remained frustrated by the conflicting goals of the political left   some favoring pacifism  as did Huxley and Heard   while other wanting to take up arms against fascism in the Spanish Civil War             
After joining the PPU  Huxley expressed his frustration with politics in a letter from         the thing finally resolves itself into a religious problem   an uncomfortable fact which one must be prepared to face and which I have come during the last year to find it easier to face               Huxley and Heard turned their attention to addressing the big problems of the world through transforming the individual         a forest is only as green as the individual trees of the forest is green                    This was the genesis of the Human Potential Movement  that gained traction in the     s                         
In the late     s  Huxley and Heard immigrated to the United States  and beginning in      and continuing until his death in       Huxley had an extensive association with the Vedanta Society of Southern California  founded and headed by Swami Prabhavananda  Together with Gerald Heard  Christopher Isherwood and other followers  he was initiated by the Swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices              From      until       Huxley contributed    articles to Vedanta and the West  published by the society  He also served on the editorial board with Isherwood  Heard  and playwright John Van Druten from      through      
In      The Gospel of Ramakrishna was published by the Ramakrishna Vivekananda Center in New York  The book was translated by Swami Nikhilananda  with help from Joseph Campbell and Margaret Woodrow Wilson  daughter of US president Woodrow Wilson  Aldous Huxley wrote in the foreword      a book unique  so far as my knowledge goes  in the literature of hagiography  Never have the small events of a contemplative s daily life been described with such a wealth of intimate detail  Never have the casual and unstudied utterances of a great religious teacher been set down with so minute a fidelity                          
In       Huxley wrote the introduction to the Bhagavad Gita   The Song of God              translated by Swami Prabhavananda and Christopher Isherwood  which was published by the Vedanta Society of Southern California  As an advocate of the perennial philosophy  Huxley was drawn to the Gita  as he explained in the Introduction  written during WWII  when it was still not clear who would win 

The Bhagavad Gita is perhaps the most systematic scriptural statement of the Perennial Philosophy  To a world at war  a world that  because it lacks the intellectual and spiritual prerequisites to peace  can only hope to patch up some kind of precarious armed truce  it stands pointing  clearly and unmistakably  to the only road of escape from the self imposed necessity of self destruction             
As a means of personally realizing the  divine Reality   he described a  Minimum Working Hypothesis  in the Introduction to Swami Prabhavananda s and Christopher Isherwood s translation of the Bhagavad Gita and in a free standing essay in Vedanta and the West              a publication of Vedanta Press  This is the outline  that Huxley elaborates on in the article 

For those of us who are not congenitally the members of an organized church  who have found that humanism and nature worship are not enough  who are not content to remain in the darkness of ignorance  the squalor of vice or the other squalor of respectability  the minimum working hypothesis would seem to run to about this 
That there is a Godhead  Ground  Brahman  Clear Light of the Void  which is the unmanifested principle of all manifestations 
That the Ground is at once transcendent and immanent 
That it is possible for human beings to love  know and  from virtually  to become actually identical with the divine Ground 
That to achieve this unitive knowledge of the Godhead is the final end and purpose of human existence 

That there is a Law or Dharma which must be obeyed  a Tao or Way which must be followed  if men are to achieve their final end             
For Huxley  one of the attractive features of Vedanta is that it provided a historic and established philosophy and practice that embraced the Perennial Philosophy  that there is a commonality of experiences across all the mystical branches of the world s religions              Huxley wrote in the introduction of his book The Perennial Philosophy 

The Perennial Philosophy is primarily concerned with the one  divine Reality substantial to the manifold world of things and lives and minds  But the nature of this one Reality is such that it cannot be directly and immediately apprehended except by those who have chosen to fulfill certain conditions  making themselves loving  pure in heart  and poor in spirit             
Huxley also occasionally lectured at the Hollywood and Santa Barbara Vedanta temples  Two of those lectures have been released on CD  Knowledge and Understanding and Who Are We  from      
Many of Huxley s contemporaries and critics were disappointed by Huxley s turn to mysticism              Isherwood describes in his diary how he had to explain the criticism to Huxley s widow  Laura 

  December           a few weeks after Aldous Huxley s death  The publisher had suggested John Lehmann should write the biography  Laura  Huxley  asked me what I thought of the idea  so I had to tell her that John disbelieves in  and is aggressive toward  the metaphysical beliefs that Aldous held  All he would describe would be a clever young intellectual who later was corrupted by Hollywood and went astray after spooks             
Psychedelic drug use and mystical experiences edit 
See also  The Doors of Perception
In early       Huxley had his first experience with the psychedelic drug mescaline  Huxley had initiated a correspondence with Doctor Humphry Osmond  a British psychiatrist then employed in a Canadian institution  and eventually asked him to supply a dose of mescaline  Osmond obliged and supervised Huxley s session in southern California  After the publication of The Doors of Perception  in which he recounted this experience  Huxley and Swami Prabhavananda disagreed about the meaning and importance of the psychedelic drug experience  which may have caused the relationship to cool  but Huxley continued to write articles for the society s journal  lecture at the temple  and attend social functions  Huxley later had an experience on mescaline that he considered more profound than those detailed in The Doors of Perception 
Huxley wrote that  The mystical experience is doubly valuable  it is valuable because it gives the experiencer a better understanding of himself and the world and because it may help him to lead a less self centered and more creative life              
Having tried LSD in the     s  he became an advisor to Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert in their early     s research work with psychedelic drugs at Harvard  Personality differences led Huxley to distance himself from Leary  when Huxley grew concerned that Leary had become too keen on indiscriminately promoting the drugs                         

Eyesight edit 
Huxley  age     in       his right eye affected by keratitis  which he had contracted in     
Differing accounts exist about the details of the quality of Huxley s eyesight at specific points in his life  Circa       Huxley encountered the Bates method  in which he was instructed by Margaret Darst Corbett  In       Huxley relocated from Hollywood to a    acre          ha  ranchito in the high desert hamlet of Llano  California  in northern Los Angeles County  Huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the Bates method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern American desert  He reported that  for the first time in more than    years  he was able to read without glasses and without strain  He even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch  He wrote a book about his experiences with the Bates method  The Art of Seeing  which was published in       U S          UK   The book contained some generally disputed theories  and its publication created a growing degree of popular controversy about Huxley s eyesight             

It was  and is  widely believed that Huxley was nearly blind since the illness in his teens  despite the partial recovery that had enabled him to study at Oxford  For example  some ten years after publication of The Art of Seeing  in       Bennett Cerf was present when Huxley spoke at a Hollywood banquet  wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty  Then suddenly he faltered and the disturbing truth became obvious  He wasn t reading his address at all  He had learned it by heart  To refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes  When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn t read it  and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him  It was an agonising moment             
Brazilian author Jo o Ubaldo Ribeiro  who as a young journalist spent several evenings in the Huxleys  company in the late     s  wrote that Huxley had said to him  with a wry smile   I can hardly see at all  And I don t give a damn  really              

On the other hand  Huxley s second wife Laura later emphasised in her biographical account  This Timeless Moment   One of the great achievements of his life  that of having regained his sight   After revealing a letter she wrote to the Los Angeles Times disclaiming the label of Huxley as a  poor fellow who can hardly see  by Walter C  Alvarez  she tempered her statement  Although I feel it was an injustice to treat Aldous as though he were blind  it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision  For instance  although Aldous did not wear glasses  he would quite often use a magnifying lens              Laura Huxley proceeded to elaborate a few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to Huxley s vision  Her account  in this respect  agrees with the following sample of Huxley s own words from The Art of Seeing  The most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism  or any part of the organism  is that it is not constant  but highly variable              Nevertheless  the topic of Huxley s eyesight has continued to endure similar  significant controversy             
American popular science author Steven Johnson  in his book Mind Wide Open  quotes Huxley about his difficulties with visual encoding  I am and  for as long as I can remember  I have always been a poor visualizer  Words  even the pregnant words of poets  do not evoke pictures in my mind  No hypnagogic visions greet me on the verge of sleep  When I recall something  the memory does not present itself to me as a vividly seen event or object  By an effort of the will  I can evoke a not very vivid image of what happened yesterday afternoon                                 
Personal life edit 
Huxley married on    July                  Maria Nys     September           February        a Belgian epidemiologist from Bellem              a village near Aalter  he met at Garsington  Oxfordshire  in       They had one child  Matthew Huxley     April           February        who had a career as an author  anthropologist  and prominent epidemiologist              In       Maria Huxley died of cancer             
In       Huxley married Laura Archera              also an author  as well as a violinist and psychotherapist              She wrote This Timeless Moment  a biography of Huxley  She told the story of their marriage through Mary Ann Braubach s      documentary  Huxley on Huxley             
Huxley was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer in       in the years that followed  with his health deteriorating  he wrote the utopian novel Island               and gave lectures on  Human Potentialities  both at the UCSF Medical Center and at the Esalen Institute  These lectures were fundamental to the beginning of the Human Potential Movement             
Huxley was a close friend of Jiddu Krishnamurti and Rosalind Rajagopal  and was involved in the creation of the Happy Valley School  now Besant Hill School  of Happy Valley  in Ojai  California 
The most substantial collection of Huxley s few remaining papers  following the destruction of most in the      Bel Air Fire  is at the Library of the University of California  Los Angeles               Some are also at the Stanford University Libraries              
On   April      Huxley was informed he was elected Companion of Literature by the Royal Society of Literature  the senior literary organisation in Britain  and he accepted the title via letter on    April                    The correspondence between Huxley and the society is kept at the Cambridge University Library               The society invited Huxley to appear at a banquet and give a lecture at Somerset House  London  in June       Huxley wrote a draft of the speech he intended to give at the society  however  his deteriorating health meant he was not able to attend              

Death edit 
In       Huxley was diagnosed with oral cancer and for the next three years his health steadily declined  On   November       less than three weeks before Huxley s death  author Christopher Isherwood  a friend of    years  visited in Cedars Sinai Hospital and wrote his impressions 

I came away with the picture of a great noble vessel sinking quietly into the deep  many of its delicate marvelous mechanisms still in perfect order  all its lights still shining              
At home on his deathbed  unable to speak owing to cancer that had metastasized  Huxley made a written request to his wife Laura for  LSD       g  intramuscular   According to her account of his death              in This Timeless Moment  she obliged with an injection at            a m  and a second dose an hour later  Huxley died aged     at           p m  PST on    November                   
Media coverage of Huxley s death  along with that of fellow British author C  S  Lewis  was overshadowed by the assassination of John F  Kennedy on the same day  less than seven hours before Huxley s death               In a      article for New York magazine titled  The Eclipsed Celebrity Death Club   Christopher Bonanos wrote 

The championship trophy for badly timed death  though  goes to a pair of British writers  Aldous Huxley  the author of Brave New World  died the same day as C  S  Lewis  who wrote the Chronicles of Narnia series  Unfortunately for both of their legacies  that day was November           just as John Kennedy s motorcade passed the Texas School Book Depository  Huxley  at least  made it interesting  At his request  his wife shot him up with LSD a couple of hours before the end  and he tripped his way out of this world              
This coincidence served as the basis for Peter Kreeft s book Between Heaven and Hell  A Dialog Somewhere Beyond Death with John F  Kennedy  C  S  Lewis   amp  Aldous Huxley  which imagines a conversation among the three men taking place in Purgatory following their deaths  The main theme of the book is a philosophical debate on the nature and identity of Jesus Christ               
Huxley s memorial service took place in London in December       it was led by his elder brother Julian  On    October                    his ashes were interred in the family grave at the Watts Cemetery  home of the Watts Mortuary Chapel in Compton  Guildford  Surrey  England              
Huxley had been a long time friend of Russian composer Igor Stravinsky  who dedicated his last orchestral composition to Huxley  What became Variations  Aldous Huxley in memoriam was begun in July       completed in October       and premiered by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra on    April

In       Huxley was one of six British writers commemorated on a series of UK postage stamps issued by Royal Mail to celebrate British science fiction               One classic science fiction novel from each author was depicted  with Brave New World chosen to represent Huxley
