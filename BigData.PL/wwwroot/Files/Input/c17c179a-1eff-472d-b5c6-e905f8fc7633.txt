            JavaScript

    import React from      react      

function App    
    return  
         lt div gt 
             lt h  gt Hello World lt  h  gt 
         lt  div gt 
      
 

export default App 

In this example import React from  react   Imports the React library to use React features in the component function App            Defines a React functional component called App return          The return statement renders HTML like code  JSX  inside the component  lt div gt  lt h  gt Hello World lt  h  gt  lt  div gt   Displays a div element containing a heading  h   with the text  Hello World  export default App  Exports the App component so it can be used in other files Why Learn React React  the popular JavaScript library  offers several exciting reasons for developers to learn it
