Qwen  also called Tongyi Qianwen  Chinese            is a family of large language models developed by Alibaba Cloud  In July       it was ranked as the top Chinese language model in some benchmarks and third globally behind the top models of Anthropic and OpenAI            

Models edit 
Alibaba first launched a beta of Qwen in April      under the name Tongyi Qianwen             The model s architecture was based on the Llama architecture developed by Meta AI                        It was publicly released in September      after receiving approval from the Chinese government             In December      it released its   B and    B models as open source  while Qwen  B was open sourced in August                       
In June      Alibaba launched Qwen   and in September it released some of its models as open source  while keeping its most advanced models proprietary                        Qwen   contains both dense and sparse models             
In November       QwQ   B Preview  a model focusing on reasoning similar to OpenAI s o   was released under the Apache     License  although only the weights were released  not the dataset or training method                          QwQ has a   K token context length and performs better than o  on some benchmarks             
The Qwen VL series is a line of visual language models that  combines a vision transformer with a LLM                         Alibaba released Qwen  VL with variants of   billion and   billion parameters                                     
In January       Qwen    VL was released with variants of           and    billion parameters              All models except the   B variant are licensed under the Apache     license              Qwen VL Max is Alibaba s flagship vision model as of      and is sold by Alibaba Cloud at a cost of US         per thousand input tokens             
Alibaba has released several other model types such as Qwen Audio and Qwen  Math               In total  it has released more than     open source models  with its models having been downloaded more than    million times                         Fine tuned versions of Qwen have been developed by enthusiasts  such as  Liberated Qwen   developed by San Francisco based Abacus AI  which is a version that responds to any user request without content restrictions             
In January       Alibaba launched Qwen     Max  According to a blog post from Alibaba  Qwen     Max outperforms other foundation models such as GPT  o  DeepSeek V   and Llama        B in key benchmarks                          In February       Alibaba announced on their official X account that the     Max model would be open sourced  however it has not been released             
On March          Alibaba launched Qwen    VL   B Instruct as a successor to the Qwen    VL model  It was released under the Apache     license                         
On March           Qwen    Omni  B was released under the Apache     license and made available through chat qwen ai  as well as platforms like Hugging Face  GitHub  and ModelScope              The Qwen    Omni model accepts text  images  videos  and audio as input and can generate both text and audio as output  allowing it to be used for real time voice chatting  similar to OpenAI s GPT  o             
On April           the Qwen   model family was released              with all models licensed under the Apache     license  The Qwen   model family includes both dense     B     B   B   B    B  and   B parameters  and sparse models    B with  B activated parameters     B with   B activated parameters   They were trained on    trillion tokens in     languages and dialects              All models except the    B     B  and  B variants have a    K token context window  Like OpenAI s o  and QwQ   B  the Qwen   models support reasoning  which can be enabled or disabled through the tokenizer  The Qwen   models are available through chat qwen ai and are open sourced on Hugging Face and ModelScope
