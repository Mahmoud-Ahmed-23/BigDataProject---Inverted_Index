Integration of telepresence with sexual activity
Teledildonics  also known as cyberdildonics  is the name coined for virtual sex encounters using networked electronic sex toys to mimic and extend human sexual interaction  The term became known after technology critic and writer Howard Rheingold used it in his      book Virtual Reality             In the publication  Rheingold made futuristic conclusions and summaries surrounding technology and used the term  teledildonics  to refer to remote sexual activity using technology             Nowadays  the term is commonly used to describe remote sex  or  at least  remote mutual masturbation   where tactile sensations are communicated over a remote connection between the participants  The term can also refer to the integration of telepresence with sexual activity that these interfaces make possible and can be used in conjunction or interchangeably with sex technology  The term has also been used less accurately  since there s no  tele   element  to refer to robotic sex  i e   computer controlled sex toys that aim to substitute for or improve upon sex with a human partner                        Nowadays  it is commonly used to refer to Bluetooth enabled sex toys      citation needed     


Background edit 
Teledildonics is commonly used to describe Bluetooth enabled sex toys  many of which have entered the market in the last decade  As well as being open to a remote connection for control  some toys can also be connected with corresponding devices to deliver synchronized movements between couples and remote partners  Teledildonics have also been used within the adult industry to create  immersive  webcam shows  whereby users control the vibrations of the webcammers sex toy             Some media outlets have reported on  teldildonic  technology used by long distance couples in order to maintain sexual relations            
As well as offering remote functions  many teledildonic toys can be synchronized with pornography movies  Synchronization of porn with teledildonic or Bluetooth toys actions are controlled by means of a previously written script  A report in      suggested that teledildonics  along with text and email and webcams  can be used to  wind each other up to fever pitch during the working day  as a prelude to sex with a human during the evening hours             New technologies can help people establish  emotional connections  via the web             Indeed  teledildonics technology has already been integrated with adult online webcam services and certain sex toys             such as OhMiBod  Lovense  and We Vibe                         One Dutch manufacturer  KIIROO  offers a two way connection between both female and male sex toys             

History edit 
The term was coined as early as      by Ted Nelson in his book Computer Lib Dream Machines  The idea of virtual sex has been prominent in literature  fiction and popular culture  and promoters of these devices have claimed since the     s they are the  next big thing  in cybersex technology              At the time Howard Rhinegold started using this term in     s  there were already many enthusiasts seeking to explore the power of technology  sex and intimacy  A report in the Chicago Tribune in      suggested that teledildonics was  the virtual reality technology that may one day allow people wearing special bodysuits  headgear and gloves to engage in tactile sexual relations from separate  remote locations via computers connected to phone lines               It was the same year that the Cyber SM suit was released by Stahl Stensile  which featured on the cover of FutureSex  a     s San Francisco based magazine that focused on the emergence of teledildonics              Some products have been shown at the Museum of Sex in New York City             and there was an exhibition about Stensile s Cyber SM suit in      
The responses to teledildonics have been mixed  however  the dominant concern has centered on the separation of personal intimacy and embodied presence  In the words of one early text on the subject             

Indeed  pushing at the cultural technical limits of the integrity fragmentation contradiction can  in the short term  supercharge the disembodied body with  sensual   transgressive ambiguity  For example   teledildonics   computer simulated  sexual arousal by wearing plugged in bodysuits  may never become widely practised  but it certainly provokes interest as a risque possibility      T echno sex contributes to hollowing out the corporeal taken for grantedness of which  paradoxically  it depends 
Patent issues edit 
Many companies experimenting in the field have been hit with patent lawsuits                          In particular  U S  Patent No            titled  Method and device for interactive virtual control of sexual aids using digital computer networks              effectively claimed priority over the entire field of controlling sex toys via the Internet                                                 
At the      South by Southwest Festival  virtual reality entrepreneur Ela Darling asserted that patent holders were preventing the production of teledildonic technology             
The patent expired in August       lowering the barrier of entry to the field
