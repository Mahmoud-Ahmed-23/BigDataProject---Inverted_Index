Cyberwarfare is the use of cyber attacks against an enemy state  causing comparable harm to actual warfare and or disrupting vital computer systems             Some intended outcomes could be espionage  sabotage  propaganda  manipulation or economic warfare 
There is significant debate among experts regarding the definition of cyberwarfare  and even if such a thing exists             One view is that the term is a misnomer since no cyber attacks to date could be described as a war             An alternative view is that it is a suitable label for cyber attacks which cause physical damage to people and objects in the real world            
Many countries  including the United States  United Kingdom  Russia  China  Israel  Iran  and North Korea                                              have active cyber capabilities for offensive and defensive operations  As states explore the use of cyber operations and combine capabilities  the likelihood of physical confrontation and violence playing out as a result of  or part of  a cyber operation is increased  However  meeting the scale and protracted nature of war is unlikely  thus ambiguity remains            
The first instance of kinetic military action used in response to a cyber attack resulting in the loss of human life was observed on   May       when the Israel Defense Forces targeted and destroyed a building associated with an ongoing cyber attack                         


Definition edit 
There is ongoing debate over how cyberwarfare should be defined and no absolute definition is widely agreed upon                         While the majority of scholars  militaries  and governments use definitions that refer to state and state sponsored actors                                     other definitions may include non state actors  such as terrorist groups  companies  political or ideological extremist groups  hacktivists  and transnational criminal organizations depending on the context of the work                         
Examples of definitions proposed by experts in the field are as follows 

 Cyberwarfare  is used in a broad context to denote interstate use of technological force within computer networks in which information is stored  shared  or communicated online            Raymond Charles Parks and David P  Duggan focused on analyzing cyberwarfare in terms of computer networks and pointed out that  Cyberwarfare is a combination of computer network attack and defense and special technical operations               According to this perspective  the notion of cyber warfare brings a new paradigm into military doctrine  Paulo Shakarian and colleagues put forward the following definition of  cyber war  in       drawing on Clausewitz s definition of war   War is the continuation of politics by other means              Cyber war is an extension of policy by actions taken in cyber space by state or nonstate actors that constitute a serious threat to a nation s security or are conducted in response to a perceived threat against a nation s security 
Taddeo offered the following definition in      

The warfare grounded on certain uses of ICTs within an offensive or defensive military strategy endorsed by a state and aiming at the immediate disruption or control of the enemy s resources  and which is waged within the informational environment  with agents and targets ranging both on the physical and non physical domains and whose level of violence may vary upon circumstances             
Robinson et al  proposed in      that the intent of the attacker dictates whether an attack is warfare or not  defining cyber warfare as  the use of cyber attacks with a warfare like intent              
In       the former US National Coordinator for Security  Infrastructure Protection and Counter terrorism  Richard A  Clarke  defined cyberwarfare as  actions by a nation state to penetrate another nation s computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption               The target s own cyber physical infrastructure may be used by the adversary in case of a cyber conflict  thus weaponizing it             

Controversy of term edit 
There is debate on whether the term  cyber warfare  is accurate  In       Eugene Kaspersky  founder of Kaspersky Lab  concluded that  cyberterrorism  is a more accurate term than  cyberwar   He states that  with today s attacks  you are clueless about who did it or when they will strike again  It s not cyber war  but cyberterrorism               Howard Schmidt  former Cyber Security Coordinator in the Obama administration  said that  there is no cyberwar    I think that is a terrible metaphor and I think that is a terrible concept  There are no winners in that environment              
Some experts take issue with the possible consequences linked to the warfare goal  In       Ron Deibert  of Canada s Citizen Lab  warned of a  militarization of cyberspace   as militaristic responses may not be appropriate              However  to date  even serious cyber attacks that have disrupted large parts of a nation s electrical grid          customers  Ukraine        or affected access to medical care  thus endangering life  UK National Health Service  WannaCry        have not led to military action             
In       Oxford academic Lucas Kello proposed a new term   Unpeace   to denote highly damaging cyber actions whose non violent effects do not rise to the level of traditional war  Such actions are neither warlike nor peace like  Although they are non violent  and thus not acts of war  their damaging effects on the economy and society may be greater than those of some armed attacks                          This term is closely related to the concept of the  grey zone   which came to prominence in       describing hostile actions that fall below the traditional threshold of war              But as Kello explained  technological unpeace differs from the grey zone as the term is commonly used in that unpeace by definition is never overtly violent or fatal  whereas some grey zone actions are violent  even if they are not acts of war             

Cyberwarfare vs  cyber war edit 
The term  cyberwarfare  is distinct from the term  cyber war   Cyberwarfare includes techniques  tactics and procedures that may be involved in a cyber war  but the term does not imply scale  protraction or violence  which are typically associated with the term  war   which inherently refers to a large scale action  typically over a protracted period of time  and may include objectives seeking to utilize violence or the aim to kill             A cyber war could accurately describe a protracted period of back and forth cyber attacks  including in combination with traditional military action  between warring states  To date  no such action is known to have occurred  Instead  armed forces have responded with tit for tat military cyber actions  For example  in June       the United States launched a cyber attack against Iranian weapons systems in retaliation to the shooting down of a US drone in the Strait of Hormuz                         

Cyberwarfare and cyber sanctions edit 
In addition to retaliatory digital attacks  countries can respond to cyber attacks with cyber sanctions  Sometimes  it is not easy to detect the attacker  but suspicions may focus on a particular country or group of countries  In these cases  unilateral and multilateral economic sanctions can be used instead of cyberwarfare  For example  the United States has frequently imposed economic sanctions related to cyber attacks  Two Executive Orders issued during the Obama administration  EO            of                  and EO            of                               specifically focused on the implementation of the cyber sanctions  Subsequent US presidents have issued similar Executive Orders  The US Congress has also imposed cyber sanctions in response to cyberwarfare  For example  the Iran Cyber Sanctions Act of      imposes sanctions on specific individuals responsible for cyber attacks

Types of warfare edit 
Cyber warfare can present a multitude of threats towards a nation  At the most basic level  cyber attacks can be used to support traditional warfare  For example  tampering with the operation of air defenses via cyber means in order to facilitate an air attack              Aside from these  hard  threats  cyber warfare can also contribute towards  soft  threats such as espionage and propaganda 
Eugene Kaspersky  founder of Kaspersky Lab  equates large scale cyber weapons  such as Flame and NetTraveler which his company discovered  to biological weapons  claiming that in an interconnected world  they have the potential to be equally destructive                         

Espionage edit 
PRISM  a clandestine surveillance program under which the NSA collects user data from companies like Facebook and Google 
Traditional espionage is not an act of war  nor is cyber espionage  and both are generally assumed to be ongoing between major powers              Despite this assumption  some incidents can cause serious tensions between nations  and are often described as  attacks   For example             

Massive spying by the US on many countries  revealed by Edward Snowden 
After the NSA s spying on Germany s Chancellor Angela Merkel was revealed  the Chancellor compared the NSA with the Stasi             
The NSA recording nearly every cell phone conversation in the Bahamas  without the Bahamian government s permission  and similar programs in Kenya  the Philippines  Mexico and Afghanistan                         
The  Titan Rain  probes of American defense contractors computer systems since                  
The Office of Personnel Management data breach  in the US  widely attributed to China                         
The security firm Area   published details of a breach that compromised one of the European Union s diplomatic communication channels for three years             
Out of all cyber attacks      of them are espionage based             

Sabotage edit 
Computers and satellites that coordinate other activities are vulnerable components of a system and could lead to the disruption of equipment  Compromise of military systems  such as C ISTAR components that are responsible for orders and communications could lead to their interception or malicious replacement  Power  water  fuel  communications  and transportation infrastructure all may be vulnerable to disruption  According to Clarke  the civilian realm is also at risk  noting that the security breaches have already gone beyond stolen credit card numbers  and that potential targets can also include the electric power grid  trains  or the stock market             
In mid July       security experts discovered a malicious software program called Stuxnet that had infiltrated factory computers and had spread to plants around the world  It is considered  the first attack on critical industrial infrastructure that sits at the foundation of modern economies   notes The New York Times             
Stuxnet  while extremely effective in delaying Iran s nuclear program for the development of nuclear weaponry  came at a high cost  For the first time  it became clear that not only could cyber weapons be defensive but they could be offensive  The large decentralization and scale of cyberspace makes it extremely difficult to direct from a policy perspective  Non state actors can play as large a part in the cyberwar space as state actors  which leads to dangerous  sometimes disastrous  consequences  Small groups of highly skilled malware developers are able to as effectively impact global politics and cyber warfare as large governmental agencies  A major aspect of this ability lies in the willingness of these groups to share their exploits and developments on the web as a form of arms proliferation  This allows lesser hackers to become more proficient in creating the large scale attacks that once only a small handful were skillful enough to manage  In addition  thriving black markets for these kinds of cyber weapons are buying and selling these cyber capabilities to the highest bidder without regard for consequences                         

Denial of service attack edit 
Main article  Denial of service attack
In computing  a denial of service attack  DoS attack  or distributed denial of service attack  DDoS attack  is an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users  Perpetrators of DoS attacks typically target sites or services hosted on high profile web servers such as banks  credit card payment gateways  and even root nameservers  DoS attacks often leverage internet connected devices with vulnerable security measures to carry out these large scale attacks              DoS attacks may not be limited to computer based methods  as strategic physical attacks against infrastructure can be just as devastating  For example  cutting undersea communication cables may severely cripple some regions and countries with regards to their information warfare ability             

An electrical substation in the United Kingdom
Electrical power grid edit 
The federal government of the United States admits that the electric power grid is susceptible to cyberwarfare                          The United States Department of Homeland Security works with industries to identify vulnerabilities and to help industries enhance the security of control system networks  The federal government is also working to ensure that security is built in as the next generation of  smart grid  networks are developed              In April       reports surfaced that China and Russia had infiltrated the U S  electrical grid and left behind software programs that could be used to disrupt the system  according to current and former national security officials              The North American Electric Reliability Corporation  NERC  has issued a public notice that warns that the electrical grid is not adequately protected from cyber attack              China denies intruding into the U S  electrical grid              One countermeasure would be to disconnect the power grid from the Internet and run the net with droop speed control only              Massive power outages caused by a cyber attack could disrupt the economy  distract from a simultaneous military attack  or create a national trauma             
Iranian hackers  possibly Iranian Cyber Army pushed a massive power outage for    hours in    of    provinces of Turkey  impacting    million people  Istanbul and Ankara were among the places suffering blackout             
Howard Schmidt  former Cyber Security Coordinator of the US  commented on those possibilities             

It s possible that hackers have gotten into administrative computer systems of utility companies  but says those aren t linked to the equipment controlling the grid  at least not in developed countries   Schmidt  has never heard that the grid itself has been hacked 
In June       Russia said that its electrical grid has been under cyber attack by the United States  The New York Times reported that American hackers from the United States Cyber Command planted malware potentially capable of disrupting the Russian electrical grid             

Propaganda edit 
Cyber propaganda is an effort to control information in whatever form it takes  and influence public opinion              It is a form of psychological warfare  except it uses social media  fake news websites and other digital means              In       Sir Nicholas Carter  Chief of the General Staff of the British Army stated that this kind of attack from actors such as Russia  is a form of system warfare that seeks to de legitimize the political and social system on which our military strength is based              
Jowell and O Donnell        state that  propaganda is the deliberate  systematic attempt to shape perceptions  manipulate cognitions  and direct behavior to achieve a response that furthers the desired intent of the propagandist   p           The internet is the most important means of communication today  People can convey their messages quickly across to a huge audience  and this can open a window for evil  Terrorist organizations can exploit this and may use this medium to brainwash people  It has been suggested that restricted media coverage of terrorist attacks would in turn decrease the number of terrorist attacks that occur afterwards             

Economic disruption edit 
In       the WannaCry and Petya  NotPetya  cyber attacks  masquerading as ransomware  caused large scale disruptions in Ukraine as well as to the U K  s National Health Service  pharmaceutical giant Merck  Maersk shipping company and other organizations around the world                                      These attacks are also categorized as cybercrimes  specifically financial crime because they negatively affect a company or group             

Surprise cyber attack edit 
The idea of a  cyber Pearl Harbor  has been debated by scholars  drawing an analogy to the historical act of war                          Others have used  cyber       to draw attention to the nontraditional  asymmetric  or irregular aspect of cyber action against a state                         

Motivations edit 
There are a number of reasons nations undertake offensive cyber operations  Sandro Gaycken           de       a cyber security expert and adviser to NATO  advocates that states take cyber warfare seriously as they are viewed as an attractive activity by many nations  in times of war and peace  Offensive cyber operations offer a large variety of cheap and risk free options to weaken other countries and strengthen their own positions  Considered from a long term  geostrategic perspective  cyber offensive operations can cripple whole economies  change political views  agitate conflicts within or among states  reduce their military efficiency and equalize the capacities of high tech nations to that of low tech nations  and use access to their critical infrastructures to blackmail them             

Military edit 
With the emergence of cyber as a substantial threat to national and global security  cyber war  warfare and or attacks also became a domain of interest and purpose for the military             
In the U S   General Keith B  Alexander  first head of USCYBERCOM  told the Senate Armed Services Committee that computer network warfare is evolving so rapidly that there is a  mismatch between our technical capabilities to conduct operations and the governing laws and policies  Cyber Command is the newest global combatant and its sole mission is cyberspace  outside the traditional battlefields of land  sea  air and space   It will attempt to find and  when necessary  neutralize cyberattacks and to defend military computer networks             
Alexander sketched out the broad battlefield envisioned for the computer warfare command  listing the kind of targets that his new headquarters could be ordered to attack  including  traditional battlefield prizes   command and control systems at military headquarters  air defense networks and weapons systems that require computers to operate              
One cyber warfare scenario  Cyber ShockWave  which was wargamed on the cabinet level by former administration officials  raised issues ranging from the National Guard to the power grid to the limits of statutory authority                                                 
The distributed nature of internet based attacks means that it is difficult to determine motivation and attacking party  meaning that it is unclear when a specific act should be considered an act of war             
Examples of cyberwarfare driven by political motivations can be found worldwide  In       Russia began a cyber attack on the Georgian government website  which was carried out along with Georgian military operations in South Ossetia  In       Chinese  nationalist hackers  attacked CNN as it reported on Chinese repression on Tibet              Hackers from Armenia and Azerbaijan have actively participated in cyberwarfare as part of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict  with Azerbaijani hackers targeting Armenian websites and posting Ilham Aliyev s statements                         
Jobs in cyberwarfare have become increasingly popular in the military  All four branches of the United States military actively recruit for cyber warfare positions             
In a      study on the use of military cyber operations during the Russo Ukrainian War  Frederik A  H  Pedersen and Jeppe T  Jacobsen concluded that cyber operations in warfare may only be impactful on the tactical and operational levels in a war s beginning  when cyber and non cyber operations can be aligned and complex cyber weapons can be prepared before war breaks out  as well as cumulatively on a strategic level              

Civil edit 
Potential targets in internet sabotage include all aspects of the Internet from the backbones of the web  to the internet service providers  to the varying types of data communication mediums and network equipment  This would include  web servers  enterprise information systems  client server systems  communication links  network equipment  and the desktops and laptops in businesses and homes  Electrical grids  financial networks  and telecommunications systems are also deemed vulnerable  especially due to current trends in computerization and automation             

Hacktivism edit 
Politically motivated hacktivism involves the subversive use of computers and computer networks to promote an agenda  and can potentially extend to attacks  theft and virtual sabotage that could be seen as cyberwarfare   or mistaken for it             
Hacktivists use their knowledge and software tools to gain unauthorized access to computer systems they seek to manipulate or damage not for material gain or to cause widespread destruction  but to draw attention to their cause through well publicized disruptions of select targets  Anonymous and other hacktivist groups are often portrayed in the media as cyber terrorists  wreaking havoc by hacking websites  posting sensitive information about their victims  and threatening further attacks if their demands are not met  However  hacktivism is more than that  Actors are politically motivated to change the world  through the use of fundamentalism  Groups like Anonymous  however  have divided opinion with their methods             

Income generation edit 
Cyber attacks  including ransomware  can be used to generate income  States can use these techniques to generate significant sources of income  which can evade sanctions and perhaps while simultaneously harming adversaries  depending on targets   This tactic was observed in August      when it was revealed North Korea had generated    billion to fund its weapons program  avoiding the blanket of sanctions levied by the United States  United Nations and the European Union                         

Private sector edit 
Further information  Cyber arms industry and Market for zero day exploits
Computer hacking represents a modern threat in ongoing global conflicts and industrial espionage and as such is presumed to widely occur              It is typical that this type of crime is underreported to the extent they are known  According to McAfee s George Kurtz  corporations around the world face millions of cyberattacks a day   Most of these attacks don t gain any media attention or lead to strong political statements by victims               This type of crime is usually financially motivated             

Non profit research edit 
But not all those who engage in cyberwarfare do so for financial or ideological reasons  There are institutes and companies like the University of Cincinnati             or the Kaspersky Security Lab which engage in cyberwarfare so as to better understand the field through actions like the researching and publishing of new security threats             

Preparedness edit 
A number of countries conduct exercise to increase preparedness and explore the strategy  tactics and operations involved in conducting and defending against cyber attacks against hostile states  this is typically done in the form of war games             
The Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence  CCDCE   part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO   have conducted a yearly war game called Locked Shields since      designed to test readiness and improve skills  strategy tactics and operational decision making of participating national organizations                          Locked Shields      saw      participants from    countries compete in a red team vs  blue team exercise  The war game involved a fictional country  Berylia  which was  experiencing a deteriorating security situation  where a number of hostile events coincide with coordinated cyber attacks against a major civilian internet service provider and maritime surveillance system  The attacks caused severe disruptions in the power generation and distribution   G communication systems  maritime surveillance  water purification plant and other critical infrastructure components   CCDCE describe the aim of the exercise was to  maintain the operation of various systems under intense pressure  the strategic part addresses the capability to understand the impact of decisions made at the strategic and policy level                           Ultimately  France was the winner of Locked Shields                   
The European Union conducts cyber war game scenarios with member states and foreign partner states to improve readiness  skills and observe how strategic and tactical decisions may affect the scenario              
As well as war games which serve a broader purpose to explore options and improve skills  cyber war games are targeted at preparing for specific threats  In      the Sunday Times reported the UK government was conducting cyber war games which could  blackout Moscow                             These types of war games move beyond defensive preparedness  as previously described above and onto preparing offensive capabilities which can be used as deterrence  or for  war

Iran has been both victim and perpetrator of several cyberwarfare operations  Iran is considered an emerging military power in the field              

Flag of Cyber Police  FATA  of Islamic Republic of Iran
In September       Iran was attacked by the Stuxnet worm  thought to specifically target its Natanz nuclear enrichment facility  It was a     kilobyte computer worm that infected at least    industrial sites in Iran  including the Natanz uranium enrichment plant  Although the official authors of Stuxnet haven t been officially identified  Stuxnet is believed to be developed and deployed by the United States and Israel               The worm is said to be the most advanced piece of malware ever discovered and significantly increases the profile of cyberwarfare                           
Iranian Cyber Police department  FATA  was dismissed one year after its creation in      because of the arrest and death of Sattar Behesti  a blogger  in the custody of FATA  Since then  the main responsible institution for the cyberwarfare in Iran is the  Cyber Defense Command  operating under the Joint Staff of Iranian Armed Forces 
The Iranian state sponsored group MuddyWater is active since at least      and is responsible for many cyber attacks on various sectors              

Israel edit 
In the      war against Hezbollah  Israel alleges that cyber warfare was part of the conflict  where the Israel Defense Forces  IDF  intelligence estimates several countries in the Middle East used Russian hackers and scientists to operate on their behalf  As a result  Israel attached growing importance to cyber tactics  and became  along with the U S   France and a couple of other nations  involved in cyber war planning  Many international high tech companies are now locating research and development operations in Israel  where local hires are often veterans of the IDF s elite computer units               Richard A  Clarke adds that  our Israeli friends have learned a thing or two from the programs we have been working on for more than two decades                                  
In September       Israel carried out an airstrike on a suspected nuclear reactor              in Syria dubbed Operation Orchard  U S  industry and military sources speculated that the Israelis may have used cyberwarfare to allow their planes to pass undetected by radar into Syria                           
Following US President Donald Trump s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal in May       cyber warfare units in the United States and Israel monitoring internet traffic out of Iran noted a surge in retaliatory cyber attacks from Iran  Security firms warned that Iranian hackers were sending emails containing malware to diplomats who work in the foreign affairs offices of US allies and employees at telecommunications companies  trying to infiltrate their computer systems              

Saudi Arabia edit 
On    August      at       am local time  the Shamoon virus began destroying over        computer systems  rendering them inoperable  The virus used to target the Saudi government by causing destruction to the state owned national oil company Saudi Aramco  The attackers posted a pastie on PasteBin com hours prior to the wiper logic bomb occurring  citing oppression and the Al Saud regime as a reason behind the attack               Pastie announcing attack against Saudi Aramco by a group called Cutting Sword of Justice The attack was well staged according to Chris Kubecka  a former security advisor to Saudi Aramco after the attack and group leader of security for Aramco Overseas               It was an unnamed Saudi Aramco employee on the Information Technology team which opened a malicious phishing email  allowing initial entry into the computer network around mid                   
Shamoon   attack timeline against Saudi Aramco
Kubecka also detailed in her Black Hat USA talk Saudi Aramco placed the majority of their security budget on the ICS control network  leaving the business network at risk for a major incident               The virus has been noted to have behavior differing from other malware attacks  due to the destructive nature and the cost of the attack and recovery  US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called the attack a  Cyber Pearl Harbor                Shamoon can spread from an infected machine to other computers on the network  Once a system is infected  the virus continues to compile a list of files from specific locations on the system  upload them to the attacker  and erase them  Finally the virus overwrites the master boot record of the infected computer  making it unusable                            The virus has been used for cyber warfare against the national oil companies Saudi Aramco and Qatar s RasGas                                                     
Saudi Aramco announced the attack on their Facebook page and went offline again until a company statement was issued on    August       The statement falsely reported normal business was resumed on    August       However a Middle Eastern journalist leaked photographs taken on   September      showing kilometers of petrol trucks unable to be loaded due to backed business systems still inoperable  

Tanker trucks unable to be loaded with gasoline due to Shamoon attacks
On    August      the same attackers behind Shamoon posted another pastie on PasteBin com  taunting Saudi Aramco with proof they still retained access to the company network  The post contained the username and password on security and network equipment and the new password for the CEO Khalid Al  Falih              The attackers also referenced a portion of the Shamoon malware as further proof in the pastie              
According to Kubecka  in order to restore operations  Saudi Aramco used its large private fleet of aircraft and available funds to purchase much of the world s hard drives  driving the price up  New hard drives were required as quickly as possible so oil prices were not affected by speculation  By   September      gasoline resources were dwindling for the public of Saudi Arabia    days after the    August attack  RasGas was also affected by a different variant  crippling them in a similar manner              

Qatar edit 
In March      American Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy filed a lawsuit against Qatar  alleging that Qatar s government stole and leaked his emails in order to discredit him because he was viewed  as an impediment to their plan to improve the country s standing in Washington                In May       the lawsuit named Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani  brother of the Emir of Qatar  and his associate Ahmed Al Rumaihi  as allegedly orchestrating Qatar s cyber warfare campaign against Broidy               Further litigation revealed that the same cybercriminals who targeted Broidy had targeted as many as       other individuals  some of whom are also  well known enemies of Qatar  such as senior officials of the U A E   Egypt  Saudi Arabia  and Bahrain  While these hackers almost always obscured their location  some of their activity was traced to a telecommunication network in Qatar              

United Arab Emirates edit 
The United Arab Emirates has launched several cyber attacks in the past targeting dissidents  Ahmed Mansoor  an Emirati citizen  was jailed for sharing his thoughts on Facebook and Twitter               He was given the code name Egret under the state led covert project called Raven  which spied on top political opponents  dissidents  and journalists  Project Raven deployed a secret hacking tool called Karma  to spy without requiring the target to engage with any web links              
In September       three of the former American intelligence officers  Marc Baier  Ryan Adams  and Daniel Gericke  admitted to assisting the UAE in hacking crimes by providing them with advanced technology and violating US laws  Under a three year deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department  the three defendants also agreed to pay nearly      million in fines to evade prison sentences  The court documents revealed that the Emirates hacked into the computers and mobile phones of dissidents  activists  and journalists  They also attempted to break into the systems of the US and rest of the world

Cyberwarfare in the United States is a part of the American military strategy of proactive cyber defence and the use of cyberwarfare as a platform for attack               The new United States military strategy makes explicit that a cyberattack is casus belli just as a traditional act of war              
U S  government security expert Richard A  Clarke  in his book Cyber War  May        had defined  cyberwarfare  as  actions by a nation state to penetrate another nation s computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption                                   The Economist describes cyberspace as  the fifth domain of warfare                and William J  Lynn  U S  Deputy Secretary of Defense  states that  as a doctrinal matter  the Pentagon has formally recognized cyberspace as a new domain in warfare        which  has become just as critical to military operations as land  sea  air  and space               
When Russia was still a part of the Soviet Union in       a portion of a Trans Siberia pipeline within its territory exploded               allegedly due to a Trojan Horse computer malware implanted in the pirated Canadian software by the Central Intelligence Agency  The malware caused the SCADA system running the pipeline to malfunction  The  Farewell Dossier  provided information on this attack  and wrote that compromised computer chips would become a part of Soviet military equipment  flawed turbines would be placed in the gas pipeline  and defective plans would disrupt the output of chemical plants and a tractor factory  This caused the  most monumental nonnuclear explosion and fire ever seen from space   However  the Soviet Union did not blame the United States for the attack              
In       president Barack Obama declared America s digital infrastructure to be a  strategic national asset   and in May      the Pentagon set up its new U S  Cyber Command  USCYBERCOM   headed by General Keith B  Alexander  director of the National Security Agency  NSA   to defend American military networks and attack other countries  systems  The EU has set up ENISA  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  which is headed by Prof  Udo Helmbrecht and there are now further plans to significantly expand ENISA s capabilities  The United Kingdom has also set up a cyber security and  operations centre  based in Government Communications Headquarters  GCHQ   the British equivalent of the NSA  In the U S  however  Cyber Command is only set up to protect the military  whereas the government and corporate infrastructures are primarily the responsibility respectively of the Department of Homeland Security and private companies              
On    June       United States Senator Joe Lieberman  I CT  introduced a bill called  Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act of                     which he co wrote with Senator Susan Collins  R ME  and Senator Thomas Carper  D DE   If signed into law  this controversial bill  which the American media dubbed the  Kill switch bill   would grant the president emergency powers over parts of the Internet  However  all three co authors of the bill issued a statement that instead  the bill   narrowed  existing broad presidential authority to take over telecommunications networks               
In August       the U S  for the first time warned publicly about the Chinese military s use of civilian computer experts in clandestine cyber attacks aimed at American companies and government agencies  The Pentagon also pointed to an alleged China based computer spying network dubbed GhostNet which was revealed in a      research report

Economic sanctions are the most frequently used the foreign policy instruments by the United States today              Thus  it is not surprising to see that economic sanctions are also used as counter policies against cyberattacks  According to Onder         economic sanctions are also information gathering mechanisms for the sanctioning states about the capabilities of the sanctioned states              
In March       WikiLeaks published more than       documents on the CIA  The confidential documents  codenamed Vault   and dated from      to       include details on CIA s software capabilities  such as the ability to compromise cars  smart TVs               web browsers  including Google Chrome  Microsoft Edge  Mozilla Firefox  and Opera Software ASA                                          and the operating systems of most smartphones  including Apple s iOS and Google s Android   as well as other operating systems such as Microsoft Windows  macOS  and Linux

A cyber mercenary is a non state actor that carries out cyber attacks for Nation states for hire  State actors can use the cyber mercenaries as a front to try and distance themselves from the attack with plausible deniability              

Cyberpeace edit 
See also  Cyberweapon        Control and disarmament
The rise of cyber as a warfighting domain has led to efforts to determine how cyberspace can be used to foster peace   For example  the German civil rights panel FIfF runs a campaign for cyberpeace   for the control of cyberweapons and surveillance technology and against the militarization of cyberspace and the development and stockpiling of offensive exploits and malware               Measures for cyberpeace include policymakers developing new rules and norms for warfare  individuals and organizations building new tools and secure infrastructures  promoting open source  the establishment of cyber security centers  auditing of critical infrastructure cybersecurity  obligations to disclose vulnerabilities  disarmament  defensive security strategies  decentralization  education and widely applying relevant tools and infrastructures  encryption and other cyberdefenses                           
The topics of cyber peacekeeping                           and cyber peacemaking              have also been studied by researchers  as a way to restore and strengthen peace in the aftermath of both cyber and traditional warfare              

Cyber counterintelligence edit 
Cyber counter intelligence are measures to identify  penetrate  or neutralize foreign operations that use cyber means as the primary tradecraft methodology  as well as foreign intelligence service collection efforts that use traditional methods to gauge cyber capabilities and intentions              

On   April       The Pentagon announced they spent more than           million in the last six months responding to and repairing damage from cyber attacks and other computer network problems              
On   April       U S  lawmakers pushed for the appointment of a White House cyber security  czar  to dramatically escalate U S  defenses against cyber attacks  crafting proposals that would empower the government to set and enforce security standards for private industry for the first time              
On   February       the White House announced that it will conduct a review of the country s cyber security to ensure that the Federal government of the United States cyber security initiatives are appropriately integrated  resourced and coordinated with the United States Congress and the private sector              
In the wake of the      cyberwar waged against Estonia  NATO established the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence  CCD CoE  in Tallinn  Estonia  in order to enhance the organization s cyber defence capability  The center was formally established on    May       and it received full accreditation by NATO and attained the status of International Military Organization on    October                    Since Estonia has led international efforts to fight cybercrime  the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation says it will permanently base a computer crime expert in Estonia in      to help fight international threats against computer systems              
In       the Department of Defense released an updated cyber strategy memorandum detailing the present and future tactics deployed in the service of defense against cyberwarfare   In this memorandum  three cybermissions are laid out   The first cybermission seeks to arm and maintain existing capabilities in the area of cyberspace  the second cybermission focuses on prevention of cyberwarfare  and the third cybermission includes strategies for retaliation and preemption  as distinguished from prevention               
One of the hardest issues in cyber counterintelligence is the problem of cyber attribution  Unlike conventional warfare  figuring out who is behind an attack can be very difficult              

Doubts about existence edit 
In October      the Journal of Strategic Studies  a leading journal in that field  published an article by Thomas Rid   Cyber War Will Not Take Place  which argued that all politically motivated cyber attacks are merely sophisticated versions of sabotage  espionage  or subversion   and that it is unlikely that cyber war will occur in the future              

Legal perspective edit 
NIST  a cybersecurity framework  was published in      in the US              
The Tallinn Manual  published in       is an academic  non binding study on how international law  in particular the jus ad bellum and international humanitarian law  apply to cyber conflicts and cyber warfare  It was written at the invitation of the Tallinn based NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence by an international group of approximately twenty experts between      and                   
The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation  members of which include China and Russia  defines cyberwar to include dissemination of information  harmful to the spiritual  moral and cultural spheres of other states   In September       these countries proposed to the UN Secretary General a document called  International code of conduct for information security               
In contrast  the United approach focuses on physical and economic damage and injury  putting political concerns under freedom of speech  This difference of opinion has led to reluctance in the West to pursue global cyber arms control agreements               However  American General Keith B  Alexander did endorse talks with Russia over a proposal to limit military attacks in cyberspace               In June       Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin agreed to install a secure Cyberwar Hotline providing  a direct secure voice communications line between the US cybersecurity coordinator and the Russian deputy secretary of the security council  should there be a need to directly manage a crisis situation arising from an ICT security incident   White House quote               
A Ukrainian international law scholar  Alexander Merezhko  has developed a project called the International Convention on Prohibition of Cyberwar in Internet  According to this project  cyberwar is defined as the use of Internet and related technological means by one state against the political  economic  technological and information sovereignty and independence of another state  Professor Merezhko s project suggests that the Internet ought to remain free from warfare tactics and be treated as an international landmark  He states that the Internet  cyberspace  is a  common heritage of mankind               
On the February      RSA Conference Microsoft president Brad Smith suggested global rules   a  Digital Geneva Convention    for cyber attacks that  ban the nation state hacking of all the civilian aspects of our economic and political infrastructures   He also stated that an independent organization could investigate and publicly disclose evidence that attributes nation state attacks to specific countries  Furthermore  he said that the technology sector should collectively and neutrally work together to protect Internet users and pledge to remain neutral in conflict and not aid governments in offensive activity and to adopt a coordinated disclosure process for software and hardware vulnerabilities                            A fact binding body has also been proposed to regulate cyber operations
