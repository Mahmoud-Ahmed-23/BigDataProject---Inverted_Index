							CAIRO  Two landmines south of the resort town of Dahab exploded  killing three Egyptians and severely wounding two others  amid warnings from local and international human rights groups concerning Egypt       s landmine problem and their constant calls for immediate aid to end it 
Egypt was declared by Landmine Monitor  LM  in late      as        one of the most mine infested countries in the world   The country has been reported to have approximately    million landmines and unexploded ordnances  UXOs  on its territory  The presence of landmines hinders significant agricultural and construction projects  making it difficult to establish industrial cities in many areas with strategic significance 
Government reports  however  claim the number has been reduced to    million in the past few years 
In the latest incident in the Sinai Peninsula Monday  two police officers were among the dead  while two soldiers were wounded and instantly transferred to the nearby resort Sharm El Sheikh for treatment 
According to an Associated Press report  police said one of the mines went off as a bulldozer was trying to dig a tunnel to lay a gas pipeline  The driver of the bulldozer  Ibrahim Khadir Al Sabky  was killed instantly according to the report  Initial reports said that the second explosion happened during the clearing of an area believed to have been infested with mines during the      war with Israel  However  a thorough investigation into the incident has not yet been launched 
A few months before the incident  the National Council for Human Rights  NCHR  and government ministry officials held an urgent conference to discuss ways to make Egypt a        mine free country   calling on local authorities to address the problems and help campaign for international aid 
According to the LM      report on Egypt  Egypt has been reluctant to comply with the Mine Ban Treaty  a widely publicized international accord that prohibits any country from having antipersonnel mines on its land or even removing the killer landmines  adding that the country rarely assists in mine clearance 
According to the same report  Egypt has also refrained from voting on a U N  General Assembly Resolution promoting universal and full implementation of the Mine Ban Treaty  The deputy foreign minister was quoted as saying that mines were particularly important to Egypt because of the country       s        expansive borders that would otherwise be difficult to protect  and would render them susceptible to terrorist infiltration  arms and explosive smuggling  banditry and drug trafficking  
Egypt       s reluctance to remove landmines or to undergo humanitarian mine clearance could lead to more serious damages  injuries and possibly deaths  As reported by LM  World War II era landmines and UXO could easily affect        an estimated         civilians in the western desert   as a result of the Egypt Israel wars  mines and UXO  could  affect some         civilians in the eastern areas   The report added that        very few mined areas are marked or mapped  and  that  Egyptian civilians continue to use the mine affected areas for cultivation  grazing  infrastructure projects and housing  
The United Nations has also annually published reports  including warnings and recommendations  about what they have called        the adverse impact  of Egypt       s mine problem on the humanitarian  economic and industrial environment in Egypt  especially in areas like the Western Sahara 
In response  Egyptian authorities called on international communities for aid and monetary funds  officials saying that countries that infested the lands during the war should have a role in clearing them and a duty toward this        national crisis   In the latest Cairo based conference  Minister of Foreign Affairs Ahmad Abul Gheit declared that the mine problem has gone beyond the realm of being a national issue and that the international community is bound to help
