Name and etymology
Main article  Names of Singapore
The English name of  Singapore  is an anglicisation of the native Malay name for the country  Singapura  Malay pronunciation       si apura          which was in turn derived from the Sanskrit word for  lion city   Sanskrit           romanised  Si hapura  Brahmi                  literally  lion city   si ha means  lion   pura means  city  or  fortress               Pulau Ujong was one of the earliest references to Singapore Island  which corresponds to a Chinese account from the third century referred to a place as P  Lu  Zh ng  Chinese              a transcription of the Malay name for  island at the end of a peninsula               Early references to the name Temasek  or Tumasik  are found in the Nagarakretagama  a Javanese eulogy written in       and a Vietnamese source from the same time period  The name possibly means Sea Town  being derived from the Malay tasek  meaning  sea  or  lake               The Chinese traveller Wang Dayuan visited a place around      named Danmaxi  Chinese           pinyin      D nm x   Wade Giles      Tan Ma Hsi  or Tam ma siak  depending on pronunciation  this may be a transcription of Temasek  alternatively  it may be a combination of the Malay Tanah meaning  land  and Chinese xi meaning  tin   which was traded on the island                         
Variations of the name Si hapura were used for a number of cities throughout the region prior to the establishment of the Kingdom of Singapura  In Hindu Buddhist culture  lions were associated with power and protection  which may explain the attraction of such a name                          The name Singapura supplanted Temasek sometime before the   th century  after the establishment of the Kingdom of Singapura on the island by a fleeing Sumatran Raja  prince  from Palembang  However  the precise time and reason for the name change is unknown  The semi historical Malay Annals state that Temasek was christened Singapura by Sang Nila Utama  a   th century Sumatran Raja from Palembang  The Annals state that Sang Nila Utama encountered a strange beast on the island that he took to be a lion  Seeing this as an omen  he established the town of Singapura where he encountered the beast                                                                                    The second hypothesis  drawn from Portuguese sources  postulates that this mythical story is based on the real life Parameswara of Palembang  Parameswara declared independence from Majapahit and mounted a Lion Throne  After then being driven into exile by the Javanese  he usurped control over Temasek  He may have rechristened the area as Singapura  recalling the throne he had been driven from             
Under Japanese occupation  Singapore was renamed Syonan to  Japanese       Hepburn  Sh nan   meaning  light of the south                           Singapore is sometimes referred to by the nickname the  Garden City   in reference to its parks and tree lined streets              Another informal name  the  Little Red Dot   was adopted after an article in the Asian Wall Street Journal of   August      said that Indonesian President B  J  Habibie referred to Singapore as a red dot on a map

Further information  Early history of Singapore
In       according to the Malay Annals  the Kingdom of Singapura was founded on the island by Sang Nila Utama              Although the historicity of the accounts as given in the Malay Annals is the subject of academic debates              it is nevertheless known from various documents that Singapore in the   th century  then known as Temasek  was a trading port under the influence of both the Majapahit Empire and the Siamese kingdoms              and was a part of the Indosphere                                                              These Indianised kingdoms were characterised by surprising resilience  political integrity and administrative stability              Historical sources also indicate that around the end of the   th century  its ruler Parameswara was attacked by either the Majapahit or the Siamese  forcing him to move to Malacca where he founded the Sultanate of Malacca              Archaeological evidence suggests that the main settlement on Fort Canning Hill was abandoned around this time  although a small trading settlement continued in Singapore for some time afterwards              In       Portuguese raiders burned down the settlement  and the island faded into obscurity for the next two centuries              By then  Singapore was nominally part of the Johor Sultanate              The wider maritime region and much trade was under Dutch control for the following period after the      Dutch conquest of Malacca

Letter from William Farquhar to Sultan Muhammad Kanzul Alam  the   st Sultan of Brunei  dated    November       In the first line  Farquhar mentions that Sultan Hussein Shah and Temenggong Abdul Rahman allowed the British East India Company to establish a factory in Singapore on   February                              
The British governor Stamford Raffles arrived in Singapore on    January      and soon recognised the island as a natural choice for the new port              The island was then nominally ruled by Tengku Abdul Rahman  the Sultan of Johor  who was controlled by the Dutch and the Bugis              However  the Sultanate was weakened by factional division  Abdul Rahman  the Temenggong of Johor to Tengku Abdul Rahman  as well as his officials  were loyal to the Sultan s elder brother Tengku Long  who was living in exile in Penyengat Island  Riau Islands  With the Temenggong s help  Raffles managed to smuggle Tengku Long back into Singapore  Raffles offered to recognise Tengku Long as the rightful Sultan of Johor  under the title of Sultan Hussein  as well as provide him with a yearly payment of       and another       to the Temenggong  in return  Sultan Hussein would grant the British the right to establish a trading post on Singapore              The Treaty of Singapore was signed on   February

In       a further treaty with the Sultan led to the entire island becoming a part of the British Empire              In       Singapore became part of the Straits Settlements  then under the jurisdiction of British India  Singapore became the regional capital in                   Prior to Raffles  arrival  there were only about a thousand people living on the island  mostly indigenous Malays along with a handful of Chinese              By      the population had swelled to over         more than half being Chinese              Many of these early immigrants came to work on the pepper and gambier plantations              In       the Straits Settlements were separated from British India  coming under the direct control of Britain              Later  in the     s  when the rubber industry became established in Malaya and Singapore              the island became a global centre for rubber sorting and export

Singapore was not greatly affected by the First World War            as the conflict did not spread to Southeast Asia  The only significant event during the war was the      Singapore Mutiny by Muslim sepoys from British India  who were garrisoned in Singapore              After hearing rumours that they were to be sent to fight the Ottoman Empire  a Muslim state  the soldiers rebelled  killing their officers and several British civilians before the mutiny was suppressed by non Muslim troops arriving from Johore and Burma             
After World War I  the British built the large Singapore Naval Base as part of the defensive Singapore strategy              Originally announced in       the construction of the base proceeded at a slow pace until the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in       Costing          million and not fully completed in       it was nonetheless the largest dry dock in the world  the third largest floating dock  and had enough fuel tanks to support the entire British navy for six months                                      The base was defended by heavy    inch           mm  naval guns stationed at Fort Siloso  Fort Canning and Labrador  as well as a Royal Air Force airfield at Tengah Air Base  Winston Churchill touted it as the  Gibraltar of the East   and military discussions often referred to the base as simply  East of Suez   However  the British Home Fleet was stationed in Europe  and the British could not afford to build a second fleet to protect their interests in Asia  The plan was for the Home Fleet to sail quickly to Singapore in the event of an emergency  As a consequence  after World War II broke out in       the fleet was fully occupied with defending Britain  leaving Singapore vulnerable to Japanese invasion

During the Pacific War  the Japanese invasion of Malaya culminated in the Battle of Singapore  When the British force of        troops surrendered on    February       British prime minister Winston Churchill called the defeat  the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history               British and Empire losses during the fighting for Singapore were heavy  with a total of nearly        personnel captured              About       were killed or wounded              of which Australians made up the majority                                      Japanese casualties during the fighting in Singapore amounted to       killed and       wounded                  g      The occupation was to become a major turning point in the histories of several nations  including those of Japan  Britain  and Singapore  Japanese newspapers triumphantly declared the victory as deciding the general situation of the war                          Between       and        ethnic Chinese people were killed in the subsequent Sook Ching massacre              British forces had planned to liberate Singapore in            however  the war ended before these operations could be carried out

After the Japanese surrender to the Allies on    August       Singapore fell into a brief state of violence and disorder  looting and revenge killing were widespread  British  Australian  and Indian troops led by Lord Louis Mountbatten returned to Singapore to receive the formal surrender of Japanese forces in the region from General Seishir  Itagaki on behalf of General Hisaichi Terauchi on    September                               Meanwhile  Tomoyuki Yamashita was tried by a US military commission for war crimes  but not for crimes committed by his troops in Malaya or Singapore  He was convicted and hanged in the Philippines on    February                              
Much of the infrastructure in Singapore had been destroyed during the war  including those needed to supply utilities  A shortage of food led to malnutrition  disease  and rampant crime and violence  A series of strikes in      caused massive stoppages in public transport and other services  However  by late      the economy began to recover  facilitated by a growing international demand for tin and rubber              The failure of Britain to successfully defend its colony against the Japanese changed its image in the eyes of Singaporeans  British Military Administration ended on   April       and Singapore became a separate Crown Colony              In July       separate Executive and Legislative Councils were established and the election of six members of the Legislative Council was scheduled for the following year             
During the     s  Chinese communists  with strong ties to the trade unions and Chinese schools  waged a guerrilla war against the government  leading to the Malayan Emergency  The      National Service riots  Hock Lee bus riots  and Chinese middle schools riots in Singapore were all linked to these events              David Marshall  pro independence leader of the Labour Front  won Singapore s first general election in                   He led a delegation to London  and Britain rejected his demand for complete self rule  He resigned and was replaced by Lim Yew Hock in       and after further negotiations Britain agreed to grant Singapore full internal self government for all matters except defence and foreign affairs on   June                   Days before  in the    May      election  the People s Action Party  PAP  won a landslide victory              Governor Sir William Allmond Codrington Goode served as the first Yang di Pertuan Negara  Head of State

Singapore thrived as an entrep t  In the     s  bumboats were used to transport cargoes and supplies between nearshore ships and Singapore River 
PAP leaders believed that Singapore s future lay with Malaya  due to strong ties between the two  It was thought that reuniting with Malaya would benefit the economy by creating a common market  alleviating ongoing unemployment woes in Singapore  However  a sizeable left wing faction of the PAP was strongly opposed to the merger  fearing a loss of influence  and hence formed the Barisan Sosialis  after being kicked out from the PAP                          The ruling party of Malaya  United Malays National Organisation  UMNO   was staunchly anti communist  and it was suspected UMNO would support the non communist factions of PAP  UMNO  initially sceptical of the idea of a merger due to distrust of the PAP government and concern that the large ethnic Chinese population in Singapore would alter the racial balance in Malaya on which their political power base depended  became supportive of the idea of the merger due to joint fear of a communist takeover             
On    May       Malaya s prime minister  Tunku Abdul Rahman  made a surprise proposal for a new Federation called Malaysia  which would unite the current and former British possessions in the region  the Federation of Malaya  Singapore  Brunei  North Borneo  and Sarawak                          UMNO leaders believed that the additional Malay population in the Bornean territories would balance Singapore s Chinese population              The British government  for its part  believed that the merger would prevent Singapore from becoming a haven for communism              To obtain a mandate for a merger  the PAP held a referendum on the merger  This referendum included a choice of different terms for a merger with Malaysia and had no option for avoiding merger altogether                          On    September       Singapore joined with Malaya  the North Borneo  and Sarawak to form the new Federation of Malaysia under the terms of the Malaysia Agreement              Under this Agreement  Singapore had a relatively high level of autonomy compared to the other states of Malaysia             
Indonesia opposed the formation of Malaysia due to its own claims over Borneo and launched Konfrontasi   Confrontation  in Indonesian  in response to the formation of Malaysia              On    March       a bomb planted by Indonesian saboteurs on a mezzanine floor of MacDonald House exploded  killing three people and injuring    others  It was the deadliest of at least    bomb incidents which occurred during the confrontation              Two members of the Indonesian Marine Corps  Osman bin Haji Mohamed Ali and Harun bin Said  were eventually convicted and executed for the crime              The explosion caused US          equivalent to US               in       in damages to MacDonald House                         
Even after the merger  the Singaporean government and the Malaysian central government disagreed on many political and economic issues              Despite an agreement to establish a common market  Singapore continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of Malaysia  In retaliation  Singapore did not extend to Sabah and Sarawak the full extent of the loans agreed to for economic development of the two eastern states  Talks soon broke down  and abusive speeches and writing became rife on both sides  This led to communal strife in Singapore  culminating in the      race riots              On   August       Malaysian prime minister Tunku Abdul Rahman  seeing no alternative to avoid further bloodshed  and with the help of secret negotiations by PAP leaders  as revealed in                   advised the Parliament of Malaysia that it should vote to expel Singapore from Malaysia              On   August       the Malaysian Parliament voted     to   to move a bill to amend the constitution  expelling Singapore from Malaysia  which left Singapore as a newly independent country

Lee Kuan Yew  the first prime minister of Singapore 
After being expelled from Malaysia  Singapore became independent as the Republic of Singapore on   August                                with Lee Kuan Yew and Yusof bin Ishak as the first prime minister and president respectively                            In       the country co founded the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  ASEAN                Race riots broke out once more in                    Lee Kuan Yew s emphasis on rapid economic growth  support for business entrepreneurship  and limitations on internal democracy shaped Singapore s policies for the next half century                            Economic growth continued throughout the     s  with the unemployment rate falling to    and real GDP growth averaging at about    up until       During the     s  Singapore began to shift towards high tech industries  such as the wafer fabrication sector  in order to remain competitive as neighbouring countries began manufacturing with cheaper labour  Singapore Changi Airport was opened in      and Singapore Airlines was formed               The Port of Singapore became one of the world s busiest ports and the service and tourism industries also grew immensely during this period                           
The PAP has remained in power since independence  Some activists and opposition politicians see the government s strict regulation of political and media activities as an infringement on political rights               In response  Singapore has seen several significant political changes  such as the introduction of the non constituency members of parliament in      to allow up to three losing candidates from opposition parties to be appointed as MPs  Group representation constituencies  GRCs  were introduced in      to create multi seat electoral divisions  intended to ensure minority representation in parliament               Nominated members of parliament were introduced in      to allow non elected non partisan MPs               The constitution was amended in      to provide for an elected president who has veto power in the use of past reserves and appointments to certain public offices              
In       Goh Chok Tong succeeded Lee and became Singapore s second prime minister               During Goh s tenure  the country went through the      Asian financial crisis and the      SARS outbreak                            In       Lee Hsien Loong  the eldest son of Lee Kuan Yew  became the country s third prime minister               Lee Hsien Loong s tenure included the      financial crisis  the resolution of a dispute over land ownership at Tanjong Pagar railway station between Singapore and Malaysia  the introduction of the two integrated resorts  IRs   located at the Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa  and the COVID    pandemic               The PAP suffered its worst ever electoral results in       winning just     of votes  amidst debate over issues including the influx of foreign workers and the high cost of living               On    March       Lee Kuan Yew died  and a one week period of public mourning was observed nationwide               Subsequently  the PAP regained its dominance in Parliament through the September general election  receiving       of the popular vote               although this remained lower than the      tally of                    and the      tally of                     The      election held in July saw the PAP drop to     of the vote  while the Workers  Party took    of the    seats  the highest number ever won by another party              
On    May       Lawrence Wong became Singapore s fourth Prime Minister  he is the first prime minister born after independence               His first electoral test in the      election saw the PAP winning       of the vote and    out of    seats in Parliament

Legislature  The Singapore Parliament is unicameral and  together with the president  comprises the legislature               Members of parliament  MP  consist of elected  non constituency  and nominated members  The majority of MPs are elected into parliament at a general election  The Singapore Parliament is collectively responsible for enacting the laws governing the state               The president holds limited discretionary powers of oversight over the government  The president s veto powers are further subject to parliamentary overruling                           
Judiciary  The judiciary s function is to independently administer justice and is headed by the chief justice of the Republic of Singapore  The judges and judicial commissioners are appointed by the president on the advice of the prime minister               The Supreme Court and State Courts adjudicates in civil disputes between persons  convicts or acquits accused persons in criminal prosecutions  and interprets laws to decide on its constitutionality  Any law or provision of a law found to be unconstitutional can be struck down by the Supreme Court              
The president is directly elected by popular vote for a renewable six year term  Requirements for this position  which were enacted by the PAP government  are extremely stringent  such that only a handful of people qualify for the candidacy                            These qualifications include that a candidate needs to be a person at least    years of age who is no longer a member of a political party  to either have held public office for at least   years in a number of specific public service leadership roles  or to have   years experience as chief executive of a fully profitable private sector company with at least S     million in shareholders  equity  be a resident in Singapore for at least    years  not have a criminal record  and more                                         Candidates must also  satisfy  the Presidential Elections Committee  PEC  that he or she is a person of integrity  good character and reputation              
From       the Constitution requires that presidential elections be  reserved  for a racial community if no one from that ethnic group has been elected to the presidency in the five most recent terms               Only members of that community may qualify as candidates in a reserved presidential election               In the      presidential election  this combination of stringent requirements and a reserved election that required the candidate to be of the     Malay ethnic group led to the PEC approving a single candidate for the presidency               Halimah Yacob  considered part of the Malay community  won in an uncontested election  She also became Singapore s first female president 
Members of Parliament  MPs  are elected at least every five years  or sooner with a snap election   The   th and current Parliament has     members     were directly elected from the    constituencies  nine are nonpartisan nominated members appointed by the president  and three are non constituency members from opposition parties who were not elected in the last general election but appointed to the legislature to increase opposition party representation  In group representation constituencies  GRCs   political parties assemble teams of candidates to contest elections  At least one MP in a GRC must be of an ethnic minority background  All elections are held using first past the post voting               MPs host weekly political surgeries  called  Meet the People Sessions   where they help constituents resolve personal issues which can be related to housing  financial assistance  and immigration              
The People s Action Party occupies a dominant position in Singaporean politics  having won large parliamentary majorities in every election since self governance was granted in       The PAP  self described as pragmatic  have a syncretic ideology combining free market principles  civil nationalism  and welfarism                                         Despite promulgating restrictions on civil liberties  Singapore under the PAP has seen consistent economic growth and political stability               The most represented and popular opposition party is the centre left Workers  Party  which holds   seats in Parliament              
The long standing hegemony of the People s Action Party has led to Singapore being described by academics as an illiberal democracy                                                      or a soft authoritarian state in which the PAP faces little to no feasible political competition to its rule of the country                                                      The multi party democratic process of Singapore has been described as  minimal  in comparison to the state s focus on economic development and social order               According to Gordon P  Means  professor emeritus of political science at McMaster University  Singapore reinvented the  benevolent  yet  highly authoritarian  colonial system of governance inherited from Britain rather than forging a full democracy  A conservative ideology of  Asian values  evolved to replace British rule  based on  communal loyalty  distrust of government  and avoidance of individual or collective responsibility for wider public interests   with less regard for human rights in the nascent Western sense               The fact that  neither the public nor elites had experience with democracy  helped create Singapore s political culture  as dominated by status focused hierarchies committed to economic development               The legacy of Asian values and the limited political culture within Singapore has led to the country being described as  classic illustration of soft authoritarianism                and  profoundly illiberal               
The judicial system is based on English common law  continuing the legal tradition established during British rule and with substantial local differences  Criminal law is based on the Indian Penal Code originally intended for British India  and was at the time as a crown colony also adopted by the British colonial authorities in Singapore and remains the basis of the criminal code in the country with a few exceptions  amendments and repeals since it came into force               Trial by jury was abolished in                    Singapore is known for its strict laws and conservative stances on crime  both corporal punishment  by caning                            and capital punishment  by hanging  are retained and commonly used as legal penalties              
The right to freedom of speech and association is guaranteed by Article       of the Constitution of Singapore  although there are provisions in the subsequent subsection that regulate them               The government has restricted freedom of speech and freedom of the press as well as some civil and political rights               In       Singapore was ranked    th out of     nations by Reporters Without Borders on the global Press Freedom Index               Freedom House ranks Singapore as  partly free  in its Freedom in the World report                            and the Economist Intelligence Unit ranks Singapore as a  flawed democracy   the second freest rank of four  in its  Democracy Index                             All public gatherings of five or more people require police permits  and protests may legally be held only at the Speakers  Corner              
In the Corruption Perceptions Index  which ranks countries by  perceived levels of public sector corruption   Singapore has consistently ranked as one of the least corrupt countries in the world  in spite of being illiberal               Singapore s unique combination of a strong  soft authoritarian government with an emphasis on meritocracy is known as the  Singapore model   and is regarded as a key factor behind Singapore s political stability  economic growth  and harmonious social order                                                      In       the World Justice Project s Rule of Law Index ranked Singapore as   th overall among the world s     countries for adherence to the rule of law  Singapore ranked high on the factors of order and security       absence of corruption       regulatory enforcement       civil justice       and criminal justice       and ranked significantly lower on factors of open government        constraints on government powers        and fundamental rights

The Singaporean military  arguably the most technologically advanced in Southeast Asia               consists of the Army  the Navy  the Air Force and the Digital and Intelligence Service  It is seen as the guarantor of the country s independence               translating into Singapore culture  involving all citizens in the country s defence               The government spent      of the country s GDP on the military in       the highest in the region              
After its independence  Singapore had only two infantry regiments commanded by British officers  Considered too small to provide effective security for the new country  the development of its military forces became a priority               In addition  in October       Britain pulled its military out of Singapore  leaving behind only a small British  Australian and New Zealand force as a token military presence               A great deal of initial support came from Israel               a country unrecognised by Singapore s neighbouring Muslim majority nations of Malaysia and Indonesia                                         The Israel Defense Forces  IDF  commanders were tasked by the Singapore Government to create the Singapore Armed Forces  SAF  from scratch  and Israeli instructors were brought in to train Singaporean soldiers  Military courses were conducted according to the IDF s format  and Singapore adopted a system of conscription and reserve service based on the Israeli model               Singapore still maintains strong security ties with Israel and is one of the biggest buyers of Israeli arms and weapons systems               with one recent example being the MATADOR anti tank weapon              
The SAF is being developed to respond to a wide range of issues in both conventional and unconventional warfare  The Defence Science and Technology Agency  DSTA  is responsible for procuring resources for the military               The geographic restrictions of Singapore mean that the SAF must plan to fully repulse an attack  as they cannot fall back and re group  The small size of the population has also affected the way the SAF has been designed  with a small active force and a large number of reserves

English is the lingua franca                                                     and the main language used in business  government  law and education                            The Constitution of Singapore and all government legislation is written in English  and interpreters are required if a language other than English is used in the Singaporean courts                            Statutory corporations conduct their businesses in English  while any official documents written in a non English official language such as Malay  Mandarin  or Tamil are typically translated into English to be accepted for use                                        
Malay was designated as a national language by the Singaporean government after independence from Britain in the     s to avoid friction with Singapore s Malay speaking neighbours of Malaysia and Indonesia               It has a symbolic  rather than functional purpose                                         It is used in the national anthem Majulah Singapura               in citations of Singaporean orders and decorations and in military commands                            Singaporean Malay is officially written in the Latin based Rumi script  though some Singaporean Malays also learn the Arabic based Jawi script               Jawi is considered an ethnic script for use on Singaporean identity cards              
Singaporeans are mostly bilingual  typically with English as their common language and their mother tongue as a second language taught in schools  in order to preserve each individual s ethnic identity and values  According to the      census  English was the language most spoken at home  used by       of the population  Mandarin was next  spoken at home by                                  Nearly half a million speak other ancestral Southern varieties of Chinese  mainly Hokkien  Teochew  and Cantonese  as their home language  although the use of these is declining in favour of Mandarin or just English               Singapore Chinese characters are written using simplified Chinese characters              
Singaporean English is largely based on British English  owing to the country s status as a former crown colony                            However  forms of English spoken in Singapore range from Standard Singapore English to a colloquial form known as Singlish  which is discouraged by the government as it claims it to be a substandard English creole that handicaps Singaporeans  presenting an obstacle to learning standard English and rendering the speaker incomprehensible to everyone except to another Singlish speaker               Standard Singapore English is fully understandable to all Standard English speakers  while most English speaking people do not understand Singlish  Nevertheless  Singaporeans have a strong sense of identity and connection to Singlish  whereby the existence of Singlish is recognised as a distinctive cultural marker for many Singaporeans               As such  in recent times  the government has tolerated the diglossia of both Singlish and Standard English  only for those who are fluent in both   whilst continuously reinforcing the importance of Standard English amongst those who speak only Singlish  which is not mutually intelligible with the Standard English of other English speaking countries
