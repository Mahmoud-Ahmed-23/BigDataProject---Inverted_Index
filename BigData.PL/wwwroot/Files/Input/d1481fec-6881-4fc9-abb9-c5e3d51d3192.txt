The trail of employees of foreign funded non governmental organisations  NGOs  resumed on Saturday to hear the general prosecution s case after being postponed several times 
The case involves    Egyptian  American  German and Arab employees from five NGOs  The defendants are facing accusations of working for unregistered organisations  without legal permission  and accordingly receiving foreign funds illegally 
Marwa Farid  an activist who attended the hearing  stated that  the prosecution depended in their pleading on Article    of the Penal Code with its provisions on establishing organisations  institutions and associations  
According to Farid  the prosecution accused the NGOs employees of using democracy and good governance as a disguise for training political parties and disrupting stability 
The prosecution cited the testimonies of prosecution witnesses such as Fayza Aboul Naga  the former minister of international cooperation 
Farid stated   one of the civil plaintiffs demanded the court impose the harshest punishment on the defendants because they followed their desires and took money from the US  He accused them of treason  but did not provide evidence for these accusations  
Inside the court and for the first time the judge allowed cameras into the court  Farid said   usually they allow journalists only  but today cameras were inside the court which was unprecedented  
Farid described the protests outside the court  She said   many of Omar Abdul Rahman s  the former leader of El Gam a El Islamiya who is currently serving a life sentence in the US due to his involvement in terrorist attacks  supporters protested outside the court using megaphones  They demanded the release of Abdul Rahman in exchange for the American defendants  
Negad El Borie  a defence lawyer  demanded that the case should be postponed in order for the court to hear the defence s case  according to Al Ahram 
The trial was adjourned to   December when the court will hear the defence 
While civil society waits for a final verdict in the case  NGOs in Egypt  local and foreign  continue operating in an uncertain atmosphere
