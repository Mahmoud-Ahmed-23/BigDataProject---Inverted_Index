							US President Donald Trump said he is not seeking a third presidential term and confirmed he would not dismiss Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell before his term concludes  according to an interview with NBC News broadcast on Sunday 
Trump also discussed US relations with China  Iran  and the conflict in Ukraine during the wide ranging interview 
Addressing his own political future  Trump  who has previously suggested he might seek a third term  stated         It       s something I don       t seek to do and I       m not allowed to         He pointed to the   nd Amendment of the US Constitution  which limits presidents to two terms  and identified Vice President J D  Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as potential successors 
Regarding the Federal Reserve  Trump affirmed Powell would remain in his post until the end of his term in       When asked directly if he would dismiss Powell before his term ends next year  Trump replied emphatically         No  no  no        Why would I do that  I       ll be able to replace him after a short period        
Trump commented on his relationship with the Fed chair  saying         He       s not a fan of mine  but I expect the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates at some point         In the interview  recorded on Friday in Florida  he added         He should lower them  He will do it at some point  He prefers not to do it because he s not a fan of mine  You know  he simply doesn t like me because I think he s very stiff        
Trump       s remarks represent his clearest indication to date that he intends for Powell to complete his term  This could offer some reassurance to financial markets concerned about central bank independence  particularly after sharp stock declines on Wall Street last month followed intensified criticism of Powell by Trump  Markets had reacted negatively to concerns about the Fed       s autonomy following the president       s comments  after which Trump appeared to moderate his stance 
On foreign policy  Trump expressed doubt about the prospects for peace between Russia and Ukraine  a shift from previous assertions of his ability to broker an agreement         Peace between Russia and Ukraine may not be achieved  Putin and Zelenskyy intensely dislike each other         Trump said  This marked his first public suggestion that US supported negotiations  which he has advocated for  might fail 
Concerning Iran  Trump said his objective is the complete dismantlement of Tehran       s nuclear programme  He noted  however  that he is        ready to discuss the possibility of allowing Iran to have nuclear energy while ending its nuclear weapons programme        
Discussing US China relations  Trump acknowledged taking a        tough stance        that had significantly reduced trade between the world       s two largest economies  but said Beijing is now seeking an agreement         Beijing now wants to make a deal         he asserted         We won       t lose a trillion dollars           because we are not currently doing business with them  They want to make a deal        they want it badly  We       ll see how things go  but it has to be a fair deal        
His administration imposed     tariffs on imports from most countries on April  nd  along with higher tariffs on several trading partners  before suspending them for    days  Tariffs of     were also applied to automobiles  steel  and aluminium  as well as specific     tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods  and      on Chinese goods  Negotiations on trade deals are underway with over    countries  potentially allowing them to avoid the higher tariffs 
This comes amid reports suggesting a potential easing of tensions  The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday  citing informed sources  that Beijing is considering how to address US concerns over China       s alleged role in the fentanyl trade  The sources suggested this could open dialogue and that Beijing wishes to        soften        Trump       s position in the ongoing trade dispute  The trade conflict has seen both nations impose significant barriers  impacting China       s economy  which faces existing challenges from a real estate crisis  deflationary pressures  and low confidence 
Trump also addressed the situation surrounding the social media app TikTok  expressing hope for finalising a deal for its US operations and suggesting a deadline extension might be possible if required  The US government passed a law last year requiring TikTok       s Chinese parent company  ByteDance  to sell the app       s US operations due to national security concerns  or face a ban  Trump had previously signed an executive order granting a    day extension beyond an initial April  th deadline  TikTok  used by about half of Americans  briefly ceased US operations in January after a Supreme Court decision upheld a ban  but resumed service shortly after Trump took office  The number of potential bidders for the platform is reportedly increasing as the divestment deadline nears 
Additionally  Trump touched on past discussions about annexing Greenland and Canada  While hinting military force could be considered  he described it as        inappropriate         He stated         I would like to annex Canada to become the   st state  but it is inappropriate to annex it by military force
