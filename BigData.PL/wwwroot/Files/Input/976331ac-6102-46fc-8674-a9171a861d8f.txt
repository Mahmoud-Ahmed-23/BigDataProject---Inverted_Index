Impact of artificial intelligence on workers
AI enabled wearable sensor networks may improve worker safety and health through access to real time  personalized data  but also presents psychosocial hazards such as micromanagement  a perception of surveillance  and information security concerns 
The impact of artificial intelligence on workers includes both applications to improve worker safety and health  and potential hazards that must be controlled 
One potential application is using AI to eliminate hazards by removing humans from hazardous situations that involve risk of stress  overwork  or musculoskeletal injuries   Predictive analytics may also be used to identify conditions that may lead to hazards such as fatigue  repetitive strain injuries  or toxic substance exposure  leading to earlier interventions   Another is to streamline workplace safety and health workflows through automating repetitive tasks  enhancing safety training programs through virtual reality  or detecting and reporting near misses 
When used in the workplace  AI also presents the possibility of new hazards   These may arise from machine learning techniques leading to unpredictable behavior and inscrutability in their decision making  or from cybersecurity and information privacy issues   Many hazards of AI are psychosocial due to its potential to cause changes in work organization   These include changes in the skills required of workers             increased monitoring leading to micromanagement  algorithms unintentionally or intentionally mimicking undesirable human biases  and assigning blame for machine errors to the human operator instead   AI may also lead to physical hazards in the form of human robot collisions  and ergonomic risks of control interfaces and human machine interactions   Hazard controls include cybersecurity and information privacy measures  communication and transparency with workers about data usage  and limitations on collaborative robots 
From a workplace safety and health perspective  only  weak  or  narrow  AI that is tailored to a specific task is relevant  as there are many examples that are currently in use or expected to come into use in the near future   Strong  or  general  AI is not expected to be feasible in the near future      according to whom       and discussion of its risks is within the purview of futurists and philosophers rather than industrial hygienists 
Certain digital technologies are predicted to result in job losses  Starting in the     s  the adoption of modern robotics has led to net employment growth  However  many businesses anticipate that automation  or employing robots would result in job losses in the future  This is especially true for companies in Central and Eastern Europe                                   Other digital technologies  such as platforms or big data  are projected to have a more neutral impact on employment                        A large number of tech workers have been laid off starting in                  many such job cuts have been attributed to artificial intelligence            


Health and safety applications edit 
In order for any potential AI health and safety application to be adopted  it requires acceptance by both managers and workers   For example  worker acceptance may be diminished by concerns about information privacy             or from a lack of trust and acceptance of the new technology  which may arise from inadequate transparency or training                                                   Alternatively  managers may emphasize increases in economic productivity rather than gains in worker safety and health when implementing AI based systems            

Eliminating hazardous tasks edit 
Call centers involve significant psychosocial hazards due to surveillance and overwork   AI enabled chatbots can remove workers from the most basic and repetitive of these tasks 
AI may increase the scope of work tasks where a worker can be removed from a situation that carries risk   In a sense  while traditional automation can replace the functions of a worker s body with a robot  AI effectively replaces the functions of their brain with a computer   Hazards that can be avoided include stress  overwork  musculoskeletal injuries  and boredom                                   
This can expand the range of affected job sectors into white collar and service sector jobs such as in medicine  finance  and information technology               As an example  call center workers face extensive health and safety risks due to its repetitive and demanding nature and its high rates of micro surveillance  AI enabled chatbots lower the need for humans to perform the most basic call center tasks                                   

Analytics to reduce risk edit 
The NIOSH lifting equation                         is calibrated for a typical healthy worker to avoid back injuries  but AI based methods may instead allow real time  personalized calculation of risk 
Machine learning is used for people analytics to make predictions about worker behavior to assist management decision making  such as hiring and performance assessment   These could also be used to improve worker health   The analytics may be based on inputs such as online activities  monitoring of communications  location tracking  and voice analysis and body language analysis of filmed interviews   For example  sentiment analysis may be used to spot fatigue to prevent overwork                                     Decision support systems have a similar ability to be used to  for example  prevent industrial disasters or make disaster response more efficient             
For manual material handling workers  predictive analytics and artificial intelligence may be used to reduce musculoskeletal injury   Traditional guidelines are based on statistical averages and are geared towards anthropometrically typical humans   The analysis of large amounts of data from wearable sensors may allow real time  personalized calculation of ergonomic risk and fatigue management  as well as better analysis of the risk associated with specific job roles            
Wearable sensors may also enable earlier intervention against exposure to toxic substances than is possible with area or breathing zone testing on a periodic basis  Furthermore  the large data sets generated could improve workplace health surveillance  risk assessment  and research             

Streamlining safety and health workflows edit 
AI can also be used to make the workplace safety and health workflow more efficient  Digital assistants  like Amazon Alexa  Google Assistant  and Apple Siri  are increasingly adopted in workplaces to enhance productivity by automating routine tasks  These AI based tools can manage administrative duties  such as scheduling meetings  sending reminders  processing orders  and organizing travel plans  This automation can improve workflow efficiency by reducing time spent on repetitive tasks  thus supporting employees to focus on higher priority responsibilities              Digital assistants are especially valuable in streamlining customer service workflows  where they can handle basic inquiries  reducing the demand on human employees              However  there remain challenges in fully integrating these assistants due to concerns over data privacy  accuracy  and organizational readiness             
One example is coding of workers  compensation claims  which are submitted in a prose narrative form and must manually be assigned standardized codes   AI is being investigated to perform this task faster  more cheaply  and with fewer errors                         
AI enabled virtual reality systems may be useful for safety training for hazard recognition             
Artificial intelligence may be used to more efficiently detect near misses   Reporting and analysis of near misses are important in reducing accident rates  but they are often underreported because they are not noticed by humans  or are not reported by workers due to social factors             

Hazards edit 
Some machine learning training methods are prone to unpredictabiliy and inscrutability in their decision making  which can lead to hazards if managers or workers cannot predict or understand an AI based system s behavior 
There are several broad aspects of AI that may give rise to specific hazards   The risks depend on implementation rather than the mere presence of AI                                   
Systems using sub symbolic AI such as machine learning may behave unpredictably and are more prone to inscrutability in their decision making   This is especially true if a situation is encountered that was not part of the AI s training dataset  and is exacerbated in environments that are less structured   Undesired behavior may also arise from flaws in the system s perception  arising either from within the software or from sensor degradation   knowledge representation and reasoning  or from software bugs                                      They may arise from improper training  such as a user applying the same algorithm to two problems that do not have the same requirements                                       Machine learning applied during the design phase may have different implications than that applied at runtime   Systems using symbolic AI are less prone to unpredictable behavior                                    
The use of AI also increases cybersecurity risks relative to platforms that do not use AI                                  and information privacy concerns about collected data may pose a hazard to workers            

Psychosocial edit 
Introduction of new AI enabled technologies may lead to changes in work practices that carry psychosocial hazards such as a need for retraining or fear of technological unemployment 
Psychosocial hazards are those that arise from the way work is designed  organized  and managed  or its economic and social contexts  rather than arising from a physical substance or object   They cause not only psychiatric and psychological outcomes such as occupational burnout  anxiety disorders  and depression  but they can also cause physical injury or illness such as cardiovascular disease or musculoskeletal injury               Many hazards of AI are psychosocial in nature due to its potential to cause changes in work organization  in terms of increasing complexity and interaction between different organizational factors   However  psychosocial risks are often overlooked by designers of advanced manufacturing systems            

Changes in work practices edit 
AI is expected to lead to changes in the skills required of workers  requiring training of existing workers  flexibility  and openness to change              The requirement for combining conventional expertise with computer skills may be challenging for existing workers              Over reliance on AI tools may lead to deskilling of some professions             
Increased monitoring may lead to micromanagement and thus to stress and anxiety   A perception of surveillance may also lead to stress   Controls for these include consultation with worker groups  extensive testing  and attention to introduced bias   Wearable sensors  activity trackers  and augmented reality may also lead to stress from micromanagement  both for assembly line workers and gig workers   Gig workers also lack the legal protections and rights of formal workers                                    
There is also the risk of people being forced to work at a robot s pace  or to monitor robot performance at nonstandard hours                                   

Bias edit 
Main article  Algorithmic bias
Algorithms trained on past decisions may mimic undesirable human biases  for example  past discriminatory hiring and firing practices   Information asymmetry between management and workers may lead to stress  if workers do not have access to the data or algorithms that are the basis for decision making                                   
In addition to building a model with inadvertently discriminatory features  intentional discrimination may occur through designing metrics that covertly result in discrimination through correlated variables in a non obvious way                                     
In complex human machine interactions  some approaches to accident analysis may be biased to safeguard a technological system and its developers by assigning blame to the individual human operator instead             

Physical edit 
Automated guided vehicles are examples of cobots currently in common use   Use of AI to operate these robots may affect the risk of physical hazards such as the robot or its moving parts colliding with workers 
Physical hazards in the form of human robot collisions may arise from robots using AI  especially collaborative robots  cobots    Cobots are intended to operate in close proximity to humans  which makes impossible the common hazard control of isolating the robot using fences or other barriers  which is widely used for traditional industrial robots   Automated guided vehicles are a type of cobot that as of      are in common use  often as forklifts or pallet jacks in warehouses or factories                                               For cobots  sensor malfunctions or unexpected work environment conditions can lead to unpredictable robot behavior and thus to human robot collisions                                   
Self driving cars are another example of AI enabled robots   In addition  the ergonomics of control interfaces and human machine interactions may give rise to hazards            

Hazard controls edit 
AI  in common with other computational technologies  requires cybersecurity measures to stop software breaches and intrusions                                  as well as information privacy measures              Communication and transparency with workers about data usage is a control for psychosocial hazards arising from security and privacy issues             Proposed best practices for employer sponsored worker monitoring programs include using only validated sensor technologies  ensuring voluntary worker participation  ceasing data collection outside the workplace  disclosing all data uses  and ensuring secure data storage             
For industrial cobots equipped with AI enabled sensors  the International Organization for Standardization  ISO  recommended   a  safety related monitored stopping controls   b  human hand guiding of the cobot   c  speed and separation monitoring controls  and  d  power and force limitations   Networked AI enabled cobots may share safety improvements with each other              Human oversight is another general hazard control for AI                                     

Risk management edit 
Both applications and hazards arising from AI can be considered as part of existing frameworks for occupational health and safety risk management   As with all hazards  risk identification is most effective and least costly when done in the design phase            
Workplace health surveillance  the collection and analysis of health data on workers  is challenging for AI because labor data are often reported in aggregate and does not provide breakdowns between different types of work  and is focused on economic data such as wages and employment rates rather than skill content of jobs   Proxies for skill content include educational requirements and classifications of routine versus non routine  and cognitive versus physical jobs   However  these may still not be specific enough to distinguish specific occupations that have distinct impacts from AI   The United States Department of Labor s Occupational Information Network is an example of a database with a detailed taxonomy of skills   Additionally  data are often reported on a national level  while there is much geographical variation  especially between urban and rural areas             

Standards and regulation edit 
Main article  Regulation of artificial intelligence
As of          update       ISO was developing a standard on the use of metrics and dashboards  information displays presenting company metrics for managers  in workplaces   The standard is planned to include guidelines for both gathering data and displaying it in a viewable and useful manner                                                          
In the European Union  the General Data Protection Regulation  while oriented towards consumer data  is also relevant for workplace data collection   Data subjects  including workers  have  the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing    Other relevant EU directives include the Machinery Directive          EC   the Radio Equipment Directive          EU   and the General Product Safety Directive          EC
