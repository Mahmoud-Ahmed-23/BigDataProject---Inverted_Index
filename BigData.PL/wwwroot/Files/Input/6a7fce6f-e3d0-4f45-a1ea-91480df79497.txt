Hanna  Alex  and Emily M  Bender   Theoretical AI Harms Are a Distraction  Fearmongering about artificial intelligence s potential to end humanity shrouds the real harm it already causes   Scientific American                                 H ype  about  existential risks   surrounds many AI firms  but their technology already enables myriad harms  including    discrimination in housing  criminal justice  and health care  as well as the spread of hate speech and misinformation    Large language models extrude    fluent    coherent seeming text but have no understanding of what the text means  let alone the ability to reason      p        T hat output    becomes a noxious    insidious pollutant of our information ecosystem      T oo many    publications  about  AI come from corporate labs or    academic groups that receive    industry funding  Many of these publications are based on junk science  that  is nonreproducible    is full of hype  and uses evaluation methods that do not measure what they purport to    Meanwhile  AI doomers  cite this junk science    to  misdirect  attention  to  the fantasy of all powerful machines possibly going rogue and destroying humanity    p      
Hughes Castleberry  Kenna   A Murder Mystery Puzzle  The literary puzzle Cain s Jawbone  which has stumped humans for decades  reveals the limitations of natural language processing algorithms   Scientific American                                      CS                                    This murder mystery competition has revealed that although NLP  natural language processing  models are capable of incredible feats  their abilities are very much limited by the amount of context they receive  This       could cause  difficulties  for researchers who hope to use them to do things such as analyze ancient languages  In some cases  there are few historical records on long gone civilizations to serve as training data for such a purpose    p           
Immerwahr  Daniel   Your Lying Eyes  People now use A I  to generate fake videos indistinguishable from real ones  How much does it matter    The New Yorker     November       pp               If by  deepfakes  we mean realistic videos produced using artificial intelligence that actually deceive people  then they barely exist  The fakes aren t deep  and the deeps aren t fake        A I  generated videos are not  in general  operating in our media as counterfeited evidence  Their role better resembles that of cartoons  especially smutty ones    p

Marcus  Gary   Am I Human   Researchers need new ways to distinguish artificial intelligence from the natural kind   Scientific American                                  CS                                   Marcus points out a so far insuperable stumbling block to artificial intelligence  an incapacity for reliable disambiguation    V irtually every sentence  that people generate  is ambiguous  often in multiple ways  Our brain is so good at comprehending language that we do not usually notice   A prominent example is the  pronoun disambiguation problem    PDP    a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a pronoun in a sentence such as  he    she  or  it  refers
