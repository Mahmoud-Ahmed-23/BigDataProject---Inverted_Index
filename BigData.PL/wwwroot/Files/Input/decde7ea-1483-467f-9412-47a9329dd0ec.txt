Regulation of algorithms  or algorithmic regulation  is the creation of laws  rules and public sector policies for promotion and regulation of algorithms  particularly in artificial intelligence and machine learning                                   For the subset of AI algorithms  the term regulation of artificial intelligence is used  The regulatory and  policy landscape for artificial intelligence  AI  is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally  including in the European Union             Regulation of AI is considered necessary to both encourage AI and manage associated risks  but challenging             Another emerging topic is the regulation of blockchain algorithms  Use of the smart contracts must be regulated  and is mentioned along with regulation of AI algorithms             Many countries have enacted regulations of high frequency trades  which is shifting due to technological progress into the realm of AI algorithms      citation needed     
The motivation for regulation of algorithms is the apprehension of losing control over the algorithms  whose impact on human life increases  Multiple countries have already introduced regulations in case of automated credit score calculation right to explanation is mandatory for those algorithms                         For example  The IEEE has begun developing a new standard to explicitly address ethical issues and the values of potential future users             Bias  transparency  and ethics concerns have emerged with respect to the use of algorithms in diverse domains ranging from criminal justice             to healthcare             many fear that artificial intelligence could replicate existing social inequalities along race  class  gender  and sexuality lines 


Regulation of artificial intelligence edit 
Main article  Regulation of artificial intelligence
Public discussion edit 
In       Joy Buolamwini founded Algorithmic Justice League after a personal experience with biased facial detection software in order to raise awareness of the social implications of artificial intelligence through art and research             
In      Elon Musk advocated regulation of algorithms in the context of the existential risk from artificial general intelligence                                      According to NPR  the Tesla CEO was  clearly not thrilled  to be advocating for government scrutiny that could impact his own industry  but believed the risks of going completely without oversight are too high   Normally the way regulations are set up is when a bunch of bad things happen  there s a public outcry  and after many years a regulatory agency is set up to regulate that industry  It takes forever  That  in the past  has been bad but not something which represented a fundamental risk to the existence of civilisation              
In response  some politicians expressed skepticism about the wisdom of regulating a technology that is still in development              Responding both to Musk and to February      proposals by European Union lawmakers to regulate AI and robotics  Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has argued that artificial intelligence is in its infancy and that it is too early to regulate the technology              Instead of trying to regulate the technology itself  some scholars suggest to rather develop common norms including requirements for the testing and transparency of algorithms  possibly in combination with some form of warranty              One suggestion has been for the development of a global governance board to regulate AI development              In       the European Union published its draft strategy paper for promoting and regulating AI             
Algorithmic tacit collusion is a legally dubious antitrust practise committed by means of algorithms  which the courts are not able to prosecute              This danger concerns scientists and regulators in EU  US and beyond              European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager mentioned an early example of algorithmic tacit collusion in her speech on  Algorithms and Collusion  on March           described as follows             

 A few years ago  two companies were selling a textbook called The Making of a Fly  One of those sellers used an algorithm which essentially matched its rival s price  That rival had an algorithm which always set a price     higher than the first  The result was that prices kept spiralling upwards  until finally someone noticed what was going on  and adjusted the price manually  By that time  the book was selling   or rather  not selling   for    million dollars a copy  
In       the Netherlands employed an algorithmic system SyRI  Systeem Risico Indicatie  to detect citizens perceived being high risk for committing welfare fraud  which quietly flagged thousands of people to investigators              This caused a public protest  The district court of Hague shut down SyRI referencing Article   of the European Convention on Human Rights  ECHR              
In       algorithms assigning exam grades to students in the UK sparked open protest under the banner  Fuck the algorithm               This protest was successful and the grades were taken back             

Implementation edit 
AI law and regulations can be divided into three main topics  namely governance of autonomous intelligence systems  responsibility and accountability for the systems  and privacy and safety issues             The development of public sector strategies for management and regulation of AI has been increasingly deemed necessary at the local  national              and international levels             and in fields from public service management             to law enforcement              the financial sector              robotics              the military              and international law                           There are many concerns that there is not enough visibility and monitoring of AI in these sectors               In the United States financial sector  for example  there have been calls for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to more closely examine source code and algorithms when conducting audits of financial institutions  non public data             
In the United States  on January          following an Executive Order on  Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence   the White House s Office of Science and Technology Policy released a draft Guidance for Regulation of Artificial Intelligence Applications  which includes ten principles for United States agencies when deciding whether and how to regulate AI                          In response  the National Institute of Standards and Technology has released a position paper              the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has published an interim report              and the Defense Innovation Board has issued recommendations on the ethical use of AI             
In April       for the first time in more than two decades  the European Parliament adopted a set of comprehensive regulations for the collection  storage  and use of personal information  the General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR    European Union  Parliament and Council            The GDPR s policy on the right of citizens to receive an explanation for algorithmic decisions highlights the pressing importance of human interpretability in algorithm design             
In       China published a position paper questioning the adequacy of existing international law to address the eventuality of fully autonomous weapons  becoming the first permanent member of the U N  Security Council to broach the issue              and leading to proposals for global regulation              In the United States  steering on regulating security related AI is provided by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence             
In       the U K  Vehicle Technology and Aviation Bill imposes liability on the owner of an uninsured automated vehicle when driving itself and makes provisions for cases where the owner has made  unauthorized alterations  to the vehicle or failed to update its software  Further ethical issues arise when  e g   a self driving car swerves to avoid a pedestrian and causes a fatal accident             
In       the European Commission proposed the Artificial Intelligence Act             

Algorithm certification edit 
There is a concept of algorithm certification emerging as a method of regulating algorithms  Algorithm certification involves auditing whether the algorithm used during the life cycle    conforms to the protocoled requirements  e g   for correctness  completeness  consistency  and accuracy      satisfies the standards  practices  and conventions  and    solves the right problem  e g   correctly model physical laws   and satisfies the intended use and user needs in the operational environment

Blockchain systems provide transparent and fixed records of transactions and hereby contradict the goal of the European GDPR  which is to give individuals full control of their private data                         
By implementing the Decree on Development of Digital Economy  Belarus has become the first ever country to legalize smart contracts  Belarusian lawyer Denis Aleinikov is considered to be the author of a smart contract legal concept introduced by the decree                                      There are strong arguments that the existing US state laws are already a sound basis for the smart contracts  enforceability   Arizona  Nevada  Ohio and Tennessee have amended their laws specifically to allow for the enforceability of blockchain based contracts nevertheless             

Regulation of robots and autonomous algorithms edit 
There have been proposals to regulate robots and autonomous algorithms  These include 

the South Korean Government s proposal in      of a Robot Ethics Charter 
a      proposal from the U K  Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council of five ethical  principles for designers  builders  and users of robots  
the Association for Computing Machinery s seven principles for algorithmic transparency and accountability  published in                 
In popular culture edit 
In       author Isaac Asimov addressed regulation of algorithms by introducing the fictional Three Laws of Robotics 

A robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm 
A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law 
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws             
The main alternative to regulation is a ban  and the banning of algorithms is presently highly unlikely  However  in Frank Herbert s Dune universe  thinking machines is a collective term for artificial intelligence  which were completely destroyed and banned after a revolt known as the Butlerian Jihad             

JIHAD  BUTLERIAN   see also Great Revolt    the crusade against computers  thinking machines  and conscious robots begun in     B G  and concluded in     B G  Its chief commandment remains in the O C  Bible as  Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind
