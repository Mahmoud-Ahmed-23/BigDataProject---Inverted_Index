							Hala Shukrallah
Dr Hala Shukrallah was elected president of Al Dostour Party in February       The party fractured after its founder Mohamed El Baradei left it  In recent years  the party has rejected practices against freedom of expression and united with a bloc of parties that generally represent opposition  inclined towards leftist views  Daily News Egypt spoke to Shukrallah about the future of politics in Egypt  and whether the rule of the military is serving democracy 
Â 
Let s begin with freedoms and rights  First  how many party members are detained 
I think the final count is     and two of them were released 
President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi made many promises to release political detainees  especially the young  Those promises went unfulfilled  How does that feel  How do you see the future of those promises  
It is disappointing  and I am afraid that the future carries more disappointments  As you stated  the promises have been made more than once  Every time  we think the government will implement logic  The government was afraid that there would be incitements to the Muslim Brotherhood to take the streets  But we have seen that this is not happening as much as before  The political unrest has eased  Keeping the youth inside prisons is just inflaming the situation  It is stupidity  and its goal is to keep the society in a cycle of desperation 
Many political parties and human rights organisations  including the state s National Council for Human Rights  debated the Protest Law and presented amendment suggestions  yet nothing has been done  Is there a new approach that can be more effective  
Indeed  many alternatives have been suggested and we did not even propose a different law  just some amendments  We did ask for the suspension of the law until the issue is resolved  and yet nothing has been adopted by the government  Again  we are in front of an inexplicable situation  We continue to present alternatives and that s all we can do  keep fighting 
What about the security crackdown and pursuit of the Socialist Popular Alliance Party  to which Shaimaa Al Sabbagh belonged  Should concerns be raised over such practices against a legitimate entity 
It definitely is alarming  Regarding the latest incident  arguments in the security s defence stated their office was not raided but that it was a  mistake   It was not  and it poses serious concerns  When a legitimate party takes the street in a very limited rally  that poses no threats whatsoever  yet they are killed and arrested  this tells us that the future of political parties in Egypt is in danger 
What is your opinion on the situation of local residents of North Sinai  between the narratives of the state and those of the militants 
We don t know and that s the problem  Information on what happens there is filtered by officials  statements  and we have very little access to the citizens there  We can t hear the collective voice of the people  all we know is that the situation is dangerous  there are militant groups of course but the impact of their presence on the rights of regular citizens is alarming  People s livelihoods  such as curfew hours which have been there for so long  are supposed to be debated and discussed socially for attempts and solutions  taking into consideration how to address people s rights  Unfortunately  this is not a part of the state s strategy  security solutions are isolated from people s rights 
We heard a  collective voice  during the border evacuation 
Again the priority is always security  During the evacuation  we heard that government assistance to the  displaced  was limited  that the residential camps were not well equipped and that people were not comfortable  The voices we heard did not present any rosy pictures of what happened  they were complaints  The problem is that this approach is a pattern even outside Sinai  Crisis management does not take into consideration inhabitants  rights  it s not an integral part of problem solving  The political current believes that the military intervention is the only security solution available 
You had expected before the presidential elections that military control of the country halts the democratic process 
Yes  this was our critique 
Freedom of speech  freedom of expression  has it become more or less oppressive  Some  such as Mohamed Aboul Ghar  head of the Egyptian Social Democratic Party  seem to have the liberty of writing what they want  to which the presidency has even responded  
Only certain people enjoy this kind of space  Our media does not have absolute freedom and actually means of oppression are getting worse  This is obvious in TV shows  where the agenda of topics is clearly defined  Again  this reflects the government s non readiness to accept any form of serious and sustained criticism which would force them into a real social dialogue 
In the last uncompleted parliamentary elections you decided to boycott the elections  First  why did the decision come so late after some back and forth among party members 
Our party composition is complicated  it contains different factions  Some of our members were already mobilising to run for the elections  while on the other hand a group advocated boycotting  We were trying to assess both opinions in order to have a true representation on a final decision  I was unable to make any announcements in the name of the party  but was stating my own opinion  I saw that we should participate  believing it was the way to fight for people s interests  Then  on the day we were voting on the matter inside the party  with a majority inclined to go through with the elections  we heard of Al Sabbagh s killing and this was a turning point  you cannot consider the elections a tool of democracy  while at the same time you are using guns 
What sort of influence was the party hoping to achieve from boycotting the elections 
Actually  we did not boycott  We stated that we were not going to participate  The difference is boycotting calls on others to do so  We just thought that in such times  our participation or absence did not make any difference  neither did the political atmosphere allow real competition  Besides  in such a violent environment  how can we deal with the elections seriously  Our rejection of the elections was accompanied by requests  on top of which bringing the perpetuators of Al Sabbagh s death to justice and amending the Protest Law  Now the constitutional court settled the issue  I hate to say we  told you so  but we did and here is the result  Egypt will remain without a parliament for a while  laws issued  no monitoring 
Would you reconsider participation after parliamentary laws are changed 
Yes  if the amendments are suitable 
Since you took the leadership of Al Dostour Party  you knew there were challenges in the structure of the party  which was mainly about members not getting along  and it is still happening  Why is that 
It was a real challenge  My vision was that people could unite around one political stance when they exclude personal issues  The party did not bring people together into a common ideology  which led to the failure of uniting the group from different backgrounds and ideological frameworks  Although to some extent some groups merged with others  the majority did not  especially that the party is extended to other governorates 
But you seem to know where the problem is  Can the party be without a specific ideology 
It was founded on that concept  I think it does not necessarily need to be based on an ideology  but rather on a framework of common beliefs and goals to have an identity  Lack of financial resources prevents us from hosting regular events that bring people together  Challenges were a lot  Another obstacle is also the pressure put on the youth who represent the majority of the country 
What about the founder  Mohamed El Baradei  is he in contact with the party 
No  not since he was offered a position in the government  Except for some messages of greeting at the beginning  he stopped having ties with the party 
Political parties are blamed for  not interacting enough  with the people and accused of not working on real grounds  Where are you in the media 
I speak a lot in the media  but the media does not care about interviewing the youth  despite my having asked TV channels many times to shed light on young people s activities  Our media officer is also actively trying  but they are not enthusiastic  I think it is not on their agenda  Media focuses on party heads or topics such as elections 
Alright  so where are you on the streets 
The role of any party is to be present among the people  but I think that two things that challenge us include the Protest Law  which scares the young from presence in the streets and interaction with people  The fear goes the other way around  people are exposed to media campaigns against political parties  which weaken their presence in the streets  However  the party is very active in small local centres in other governorates  working on identifying people s needs  Overall  there is an accumulation of experience taking place  which is very valuable but receives little exposure  although it is in an important part of empowering people and transferring their voices to the government 
When we speak of the political crisis  you previously stated that  political parties are too slow to respond and do not take quick action to respond   Is this still your opinion 
I think that this is one of the chronic problems that we are trying to fix  by pushing for more coordination with each other  This is why we established the Democratic Current to act together as a group  The statement in general is true but there are efforts to address the problem  I believe that if we are going to be allowed to continue to work  we will achieve something  We are speaking of parties that were never allowed a real experience  always under the government s wing  Are we going to be able to evolve 
What do you think 
 Laughing  This is one of my questions also 
Previous presidents gave importance to political stability  Hosni Mubarak even said that political stability leads to economic growth and brings in investors  Have priorities changed  The narrative we are given seems to be the other way around  Is this true  Is this a good way 
I think that this is the current assumption  You are right  there is a shift in priorities  but also because the context has changed  This government was facing war from the very beginning  That s why it s dealing as if there isn t political stability and there s not going to be for some time  They are more focused on establishing the country s regional strength and this how they believe they will be able to gain upper hand in international relations  this will bring investments 
What did you think of the Economic Summit 
The summit proved to a certain extent  the government was  able to achieve gains  However  I think they were limited to specific types of investment projects such as construction rather than production  which does not lead to real development  Even during Mubarak s era  lands were for big investors  big construction and real estate projects  There is no radical change in the economic situation  We have a problem that our middle class is falling  while the government is supposed to encourage the middle classes to invest through young entrepreneurs and innovative projects  But we are still in a monopoly  where only a very small crust of the society keeps getting richer 
Are you saying we are taking a path that has no bread  no freedom and no social justice 
I am saying we definitely need a different approach 
How do you see the progress of women empowerment and women s causes 
Like all rights issues  the cause does not get what it deserves  All human rights issues are going downwards  The constitution supposedly achieved some balance for marginalised communities  However this was not translated into laws and real action  We are still seeing no women in the government s decision making division  or in any other entity  We are still demanding laws fighting sexual violence and domestic violence against women  The potential of laws and increased awareness are faced by the government s absence of any political will 
What does the party plan to do in order to move beyond the reactive role 
All you can do is build up your own strength and continue to speak up  We are doing this with all we have  We just had a conference with two proposals to the electoral law  a delegation plans to ask to meet the Prime Minister to ask for a social dialogue  Some are going for historical record and say   Nobody will care   Others say it is a fight they will continue  This is something that you and coming generations must keep doing  Power balances eventually change  A butterfly effect could turn things upside down 
Do the political parties that could be able to carry on represent the    January Revolution  If given a chance  will they commit to doing so or seek personal interests 
The more the actions of the government do not make sense  the more people s voices rise and come together  These are all things that can change thing and start to have a ripple effect  increase pressure and so change the political will  These are all assumptions  but that is how it happens  With Mubarak  it didn t happen overnight  but at the end he found himself isolated  and as a result found he no longer made sense to the people  The more the situation we are currently in cannot be justified  the more people are going to speak out
