Plot edit 
Synopsis edit 
The play begins in a factory that makes artificial workers from synthetic organic matter   As living creatures of artificial flesh and blood  that later terminology would call androids  the playwright s  roboti  differ from later fictional and scientific concepts of inorganic constructs   Robots may be mistaken for humans but have no original thoughts  Though most are content to work for humans  eventually a rebellion causes the extinction of the human race 

Prologue  Act I in the Selver translation  edit 
A scene from the play  showing three robots
Helena  the daughter of the president of a major industrial power  arrives at the island factory of Rossum s Universal Robots  Here  she meets Domin  the General Manager of R U R   who relates to her the history of the company  Rossum had come to the island in      to study marine biology  In       Rossum had invented a substance like organic matter  though with a different chemical composition  He argued with his nephew about their motivations for creating artificial life  While the elder wanted to create animals to prove or disprove the existence of God  his nephew  only wanted to become rich  Young Rossum finally locked away his uncle in a lab to play with the monstrosities he had created and created thousands of robots  By the time the play takes place  circa the year                    robots are cheap and available all over the world  They have become essential for industry 
After meeting the heads of R U R   Helena reveals that she is a representative of the League of Humanity  an organization that wishes to liberate the robots  The managers of the factory find this absurd  They see robots as appliances  Helena asks that the robots be paid  but according to R U R  management  the robots do not  like  anything 
Eventually Helena is convinced that the League of Humanity is a waste of money  but still argues robots have a  soul   Later  Domin confesses that he loves Helena and forces her into an engagement 

Act I  Act II in Selver  edit 
Ten years have passed  Helena and her nurse Nana discuss current events  the decline in human births in particular  Helena and Domin reminisce about the day they met and summarize the last ten years of world history  which has been shaped by the new worldwide robot based economy  Helena meets Dr  Gall s new experiment  Radius  Dr  Gall describes his experimental robotess  also named Helena  Both are more advanced  fully featured robots  In secret  Helena burns the formula required to create robots   The revolt of the robots reaches Rossum s island as the act ends 

Act II  Act III in Selver  edit 
Final scene of Act      II
The characters sense that the very universality of the robots presents a danger  Echoing the story of the Tower of Babel  the characters discuss whether creating national robots who were unable to communicate beyond their languages would have been a good idea  As robot forces lay siege to the factory  Helena reveals she has burned the formula necessary to make new robots   The characters lament the end of humanity and defend their actions  despite the fact that their imminent deaths are a direct result of their choices   Busman is killed while attempting to negotiate a peace with the robots  The robots storm the factory and kill all the humans except for Alquist  the company s Clerk of the Works  Head of Construction   The robots spare him because they recognize that  He works with his hands like a robot  He builds houses  He can work              

Act III  Epilogue in Selver  edit 
Years have passed  Alquist  who still lives  attempts to recreate the formula that Helena destroyed  He is a mechanical engineer  though  with insufficient knowledge of biochemistry  so he has made little progress  The robot government has searched for surviving humans to help Alquist and found none alive  Officials from the robot government beg him to complete the formula  even if it means he will have to kill and dissect other robots for it  Alquist yields  He will kill and dissect robots  thus completing the circle of violence begun in Act Two  Alquist is disgusted  Robot Primus and Helena develop human feelings and fall in love  Playing a hunch  Alquist threatens to dissect Primus and then Helena  each begs him to take him  or herself and spare the other  Alquist now realizes that Primus and Helena are the new Adam and Eve  and gives the charge of the world to them 

 apek s conception of robots edit 
U S  WPA Federal Theatre Project poster for the production by the Marionette Theatre  New York      
The robots described in  apek s play are not robots in the popularly understood sense of an automaton  They are not mechanical devices  but rather artificial
biological organisms that may be mistaken for humans  A comic scene at the beginning of the play shows Helena arguing with her future husband  Harry Domin  because she cannot believe his secretary is a robotess 


DOMIN  Sulla  let Miss Glory have a look at you 
HELENA   stands and offers her hand  Pleased to meet you   It must be very hard for you out here  cut off from the rest of the world 
SULLA  I do not know the rest of the world Miss Glory  Please sit down 
HELENA   sits  Where are you from 
SULLA  From here  the factory 
HELENA  Oh  you were born here 
SULLA  Yes I was made here 
HELENA   startled  What 
DOMIN   laughing  Sulla isn t a person  Miss Glory  she s a robot 
HELENA  Oh  please forgive me   


His robots resemble more modern conceptions of man made life forms  such as the Replicants in Blade Runner  the  hosts  in the Westworld TV series and the humanoid Cylons in the re imagined Battlestar Galactica  but in  apek s time there was no conception of modern genetic engineering  DNA s role in heredity was not confirmed until        There are descriptions of kneading troughs for robot skin  great vats for liver and brains  and a factory for producing bones  Nerve fibers  arteries  and intestines are spun on factory bobbins  while the robots themselves are assembled like automobiles               apek s robots are living biological beings  but they are still assembled  as opposed to grown or born 
One critic has described  apek s robots as epitomizing  the traumatic transformation of modern society by the First World War and the Fordist assembly line              

Origin of the word robot edit 
Logo of Rossum s Universal Robots corporation  from the first edition title page       
The play introduced the word robot  which displaced older words such as  automaton  or  android  in languages around the world   In an article in Lidov  noviny  Karel  apek named his brother Josef as the true inventor of the word                           In Czech  robota means forced labour of the kind that serfs had to perform on their masters  lands and is derived from rab  meaning  slave              
The name Rossum is an allusion to the Czech word rozum  meaning  reason    wisdom    intellect  or  common sense               It has been suggested that the allusion might be preserved by translating  Rossum  as  Reason  but only the Majer Porter version translates the word as  Reason              

Production history and translations edit 
Poster for a Federal Theatre Project production of R U R  directed by Remo Bufano in New York      
The work was published in two differing versions in Prague by Aventinum  first in       followed by a revised version in                   After being postponed  it premiered at the city s National Theatre on    January       although an amateur group had by then already presented a production      note       
By       Paul Selver translated either the original      edition of R U R  or a manuscript copy close to this version into English      note        He probably translated the play freelance  and sold it to St Martin s Theatre in London  Selver s translation was adapted for the British stage by Nigel Playfair in       but it was not produced straight away  Later that year performance rights for the U S  and Canada were sold to the New York Theatre Guild  perhaps during Lawrence Langner s visit to Britain  Playfair s version included several changes to  apek s original play  such as renaming the acts  the prologue became act one  and the heavily abridged final act became the epilogue   omitting around sixty lines  including most of Alquist s final speech   adding several more lines  and removing the robot character Damon  giving his lines to Radius   The omission of some lines may have been censorship from the Lord Chamberlain s Office  or self censorship in anticipation of this  while some other changes might have been made by  apek himself if Selver was working from a manuscript copy      note        An edition of Playfair s adaptation was published by the Oxford University Press in       and Selver went on to write a satiric novel One  Two  Three        based on his experiences getting R U R  staged             
The American premi re was produced by the Theatre Guild at the Garrick Theatre in New York City in October       where it ran for     performances  In the first performance  Domin was portrayed by Basil Sydney  Marius by John Merton  Hallemeier by Moffat Johnston  Alquist by Louis Calvert  Busman by Henry Travers  the robot Helena by antiwar activist Mary Crane Hone in her Broadway debut  and Primus by John Roche                          Spencer Tracy and Pat O Brien played robots     which       in their Broadway debuts              This production was based on Playfair s adaptation  though Theresa Helburn claimed that  together with two Czechs  they closely compared his version against  apek s original text  and that all changes from the original were made by the Theatre Guild as part of the rehearsal process              Doubleday published this version of the play in       though it omitted a change noted by John Corbin in the New York Times  of the robot Helena holding a robot baby in the final scene             
In April      Basil Dean produced R U R  in Britain for the Reandean Company at St Martin s Theatre  London              This version was based on Playfair s adaptation  but omitted the characters Fabry and Hallemeier  and included several of the New York Theatre Guild revisions  The British Library holds a typescript copy of this version of the play  which had been submitted by St Martin s Theatre to the Lord Chamberlain s Office two weeks before the play opened             
In the     s  the play was performed in a number of American and British cities  including the Theatre Guild  Road  in Chicago and Los Angeles during                  
In June        apek sent a letter to Edward Marsh  with the final lines of R U R  that had been omitted from the Selver Playfair editions  which he described as being  suppressed in  the  English version       note        This letter is held in Southern Illinois University Carbondale s Morris Library  along with an English translation of these lines  perhaps in Marsh s handwriting              This translation was published in the journal Science Fiction Studies                     A full translation of the final lines of the      version of the play was published in the journal ICarbS                    
In       a new  unabridged translation by Claudia Novack Jones  based on  apek s revised      version  restored the elements of the play eliminated by Playfair                                      Another unabridged translation was produced by Peter Majer and Cathy Porter for Methuen Drama in                                         An open access unabridged translation by David Wyllie was published by the University of Adelaide in                   and updated in                  
In       MIT Press published the book R U R  and the Vision of Artificial Life              which offered a new translation of the original      edition by  t p n  imek  The book also contained a collection of essays reflecting on the play s legacy from scientists and scholars who work in artificial life and robotics 

Critical reception edit 
Reviewing the New York production of  R U R  in       The Forum magazine described the play as  thought provoking  and  a highly original thriller               John Clute has lauded R U R  as  a play of exorbitant wit and almost demonic energy  and lists the play as one of the  classic titles  of inter war science fiction              Luciano Floridi has described the play thus   Philosophically rich and controversial  R U R  was unanimously acknowledged as a masterpiece from its first appearance  and has become a classic of technologically dystopian literature               Jarka M  Burien called R U R  a  theatrically effective  prototypal sci fi melodrama             
On the other hand  Isaac Asimov  author of the Robot series of books and creator of the Three Laws of Robotics  stated    apek s play is  in my own opinion  a terribly bad one  but it is immortal for that one word  It contributed the word  robot  not only to English  but through English  to all the languages in which science fiction is now written              In fact  Asimov s  Laws of Robotics  are specifically and explicitly designed to prevent the kind of situation depicted in R U R   since Asimov s robots are created with a built in total inhibition against harming human beings or disobeying them 
Despite getting mostly positive responses   apek himself was very disappointed by critics  simplistic understanding of the play  He saw the play as part comedy  and ending with faith that humanity would survive albeit in a different form  while the critics often considered it to be pessimistic or nihilistic  and purely either an updated Frankenstein  an anti capitalist satire  or a critique of contemporary political ideologies  The critics  interpretation may have been influenced by how heavily abridged the final act  or Epilogue  was in the Selver Playfair translation

Notes edit 


  The world premiere was planned to be in the National Theater in Prague  but had to be postponed to    January       The amateur theater group Klicpera in Hradec Kr lov   which was supposed to mount a production after the premiere  was not informed about the date change in the National Theater  so  their opening night on   January      was the actual world premiere             

  No copies of Selver s original translation are known to exist  An approximation of the original translation can be reconstructed from the Doubleday and Oxford University Press editions  as well as copies of the Theatre Guild prompt book and a version submitted to the Lord Chamberlain s Office by St Martin s Theatre  though all these versions are based on Playfair s adaptation  and most include at least some changes by the Theatre Guild             

  The possibility that Selver was working from a partially revised manuscript by  apek is supported by textual evidence of the Doubleday and Oxford University Press editions  and also a copy of the final lines of the play in a letter from  apek to Edward Marsh             

  The final lines written by  apek in this letter miss out sentences that are in both published Czech editions  Mary Anne Fox suggested that this may have been as a result of  apek recalling the lines from memory              while Robert M  Philmus wrote that it could have been taken from a partially revised draft that was sent to Selver  as the sentences missing are also missing from every edition of Selver s translation  One of the Lord Chamberlain s Office s objections to the play was that Alquist quoted the Bible in these final lines  which may account for their removal  as the suppression that  apek referred to
