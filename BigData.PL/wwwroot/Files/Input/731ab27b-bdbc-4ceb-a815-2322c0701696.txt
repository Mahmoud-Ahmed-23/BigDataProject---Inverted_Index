Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep   retrospectively titled Blade Runner  Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep  in some later printings  is a      dystopian science fiction novel by American writer Philip K  Dick  It is set in a post apocalyptic San Francisco  where Earth s life has been greatly damaged by a nuclear global war  The main plot follows Rick Deckard  a bounty hunter who has to  retire   i e  kill  six escaped Nexus   model androids  while a secondary plot follows John Isidore  a man of sub par IQ who aids the fugitive androids 
The book served as the basis for the      film Blade Runner and  even though some aspects of the novel were changed  many elements and themes from it were used in the film s      sequel Blade Runner      


Plot summary edit 
In a futuristic            in later editions   after a global war that rendered Earth s atmosphere highly radioactive  most animal species are now endangered or extinct  As a result  owning real animals has become a fashionable and expensive status symbol  while poor people can only afford realistic electric robotic imitations of animals  Also  due to the radiation  people are encouraged to move to off world colonies with the incentive of free androids  robot servants so similar in appearance to humans that only an empathy test can confirm their identities 
Rick Deckard  a bounty hunter for the San Francisco Police Department  is assigned to  retire   kill  six defiant and violent androids of the new Nexus   model which have recently escaped from Mars and traveled to Earth  Deckard hopes this mission will earn him enough money to buy a live animal to replace his lone electric sheep  which would comfort his depressed wife Iran  First  Deckard visits the Seattle headquarters of the Rosen Association  which makes the androids  to confirm the accuracy of the empathy test on the new model  For business reasons  Rosen wishes to discredit the test and nearly succeeds  However  the test confirms twice that Rachael Rosen  his host in Seattle  is a Nexus   android  which she ultimately admits  Deckard returns to San Francisco to begin his hunt for the group of rebel androids 
Deckard meets and kills a Soviet police contact who turns out to be one of the Nexus   renegades in disguise  He then moves to kill his next target  an android living as an opera singer  Meeting her backstage  Deckard attempts to administer the test  but she calls the police  who arrest Deckard and detain him at a police station staffed with officers he is surprised to have never met  An official named Garland accuses Deckard himself of being an android with implanted memories  However  after a test conclusively proves that Deckard s work is legitimate  Garland draws a gun on Deckard and reveals that the entire station is a sham  claiming that both Deckard and Phil Resch  the station s resident bounty hunter  are also androids  Resch  unaware of Garland s revelation  shoots Garland in the head  escaping with Deckard back to the opera singer  whom Resch next retires in cold blood  Desperate to know the truth  Resch asks Deckard to administer the empathy test on him  The test indicates Resch has sociopathic tendencies but confirms he is human  Deckard then tests himself  confirming that he is also human but has a sense of empathy for certain androids 
Having killed three androids in a day  Deckard is now able to buy his wife Iran an authentic Nubian goat  His next target is an abandoned apartment building where the three remaining android fugitives are assumed to be hiding  Deckard suddenly experiences hallucinations of a man named Mercer  the main martyr like character in a popular religious movement who is depicted as being continuously assailed by falling rocks  The vision of Mercer tells Deckard to proceed  despite the immorality of the mission  Deckard calls on Rachael Rosen since her knowledge of android psychology may aid his investigation  Rachael declines to help  but reluctantly agrees to meet Deckard at a hotel in exchange for him abandoning the case  At the hotel  she reveals that one of the fugitive androids is the same model as her  meaning that he will have to kill an android that looks like her  Despite having initial doubts about Rachael  Deckard has sex with her  after which they confess their love for each another  Rachael reveals she has slept with many bounty hunters  having been programmed to do so in order to dissuade them from their missions  Deckard threatens to kill her but ultimately holds back and leaves for the abandoned apartment building 
The three remaining android fugitives plan to outwit Deckard  The building s only other inhabitant  John R  Isidore  a radioactively damaged and intellectually below average human  attempts to befriend them  He is shocked when they callously torture and mutilate a rare spider he discovers  Deckard enters the building  experiencing strange  supernatural vision again  notifying him of an ambush  When the androids attack him first  Deckard is legally justified to kill all three without testing them beforehand  Isidore is devastated and Deckard is rewarded for a record number of Nexus   kills in a day  Returning home  Deckard finds Iran grieving because  while he was away  Rachael stopped by their apartment and killed their goat 
Deckard travels to an uninhabited  obliterated region near the border with Oregon to reflect  He climbs a hill and is hit by falling rocks  realizing this is an experience eerily similar to the plight of the prophet Mercer  He stumbles upon a toad  an animal thought to be extinct  but  when he returns home with it  he is crestfallen when Iran discovers it is merely a robot  As he goes to sleep  she prepares to care for the electric toad anyway 

Influence and inspiration edit 
Dick intentionally imitates noir fiction styles of scene delivery  a hard boiled investigator dealing coldly with a brutal world full of corruption and stupidity             Another influence on Dick was author Theodore Sturgeon  writer of More Than Human  a surrealistic story of humanity broken into different tiers  one controlling another through telepathic means  A few years after the publication of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep   the author spoke about man s animate creations in a famous      speech   The Android and the Human  

Our environment   and I mean our man made world of machines  artificial constructs  computers  electronic systems  interlinking homeostatic components   all of this is in fact beginning more and more to possess what the earnest psychologists fear the primitive sees in his environment  animation  In a very real sense our environment is becoming alive  or at least quasi alive  and in ways specifically and fundamentally analogous to ourselves    Rather than learning about ourselves by studying our constructs  perhaps we should make the attempt to comprehend what our constructs are up to by looking into what we ourselves are up to           
In the novel  the android antagonists are indeed more human than the human protagonist  intentionally  They are a mirror held up to human action  contrasted with a culture losing its own humanity            

Influence edit 
Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep  influenced generations of science fiction writers  becoming a founding document of the new wave science fiction movement as well as a basic model for its cyberpunk heirs  It influenced other genres such as scifi based metal from artists including Rob Zombie and Powerman

Blade Runner    Replicant Night       
Blade Runner    Eye and Talon

Critical reception edit 
Critical reception of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep  has been overshadowed by the popularity of its      film adaptation  Blade Runner  Of those critics who focus on the novel  several nest it predominantly in the history of Philip K  Dick s body of work  In particular  Dick s      speech  The Human and the Android  is cited in this connection  Jill Galvan             calls attention to the correspondence between Dick s portrayal of the narrative s dystopian  polluted  man made setting and the description Dick gives in his speech of the increasingly artificial and potentially sentient or  quasi alive  environment of his present  Summarizing the essential point of Dick s speech  Galvan argues    o nly by recognizing how  technology  has encroached upon our understanding of  life  can we come to full terms with the technologies we have produced         As a  bildungsroman of the cybernetic age   Galvan maintains  Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep  follows one person s gradual acceptance of the new reality  Christopher Palmer             emphasizes Dick s speech to bring to attention the increasingly dangerous risk of humans becoming  mechanical                Androids threaten reduction of what makes life valuable  yet promise expansion or redefinition of it  and so do aliens and gods               Gregg Rickman             cites another  earlier  and lesser known Dick novel that also deals with androids  We Can Build You  asserting that Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep  can be read as a sequel 
In a departure from the tendency among most critics to examine the novel in relation to Dick s other texts  Klaus Benesch             examined Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep  primarily in connection with Jacques Lacan s essay on the mirror stage  There  Lacan claims that the formation and reassurance of the self depends on the construction of an Other through imagery  beginning with a double as seen in the mirror  The androids  Benesch argues  perform a doubling function similar to the mirror image of the self  but they do this on a social  not individual  scale  Therefore  human anxiety about androids expresses uncertainty about human identity and society  Benesch draws on Kathleen Woodward s             emphasis on the body to illustrate the shape of human anxiety about an android Other  Woodward asserts that the debate over distinctions between human and machine usually fails to acknowledge the presence of the body   If machines are invariably contrived as technological prostheses that are designed to amplify the physical faculties of the body  they are also built  according to this logic  to outdo  to surpass the human in the sphere of physicality altogether              
Sherryl Vint emphasizes the importance of animals for the novel s exploration of the alienation of humans from their authentic being  In wrestling with his role as a bounty hunter who is supposedly defending society from those who lack empathy  Deckard comes to realize the artificiality of the distinctions that have been used in American culture to exclude animals and  animalized  humans from ethical consideration   The central role of animals in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep  and the issues of species being that they raise show the need to struggle for a different way of being in the world  This way resists commodification in our relations with one another and with nature to produce a better future  one in which humans might be fully human once again by repairing our social relations with animals and nature
