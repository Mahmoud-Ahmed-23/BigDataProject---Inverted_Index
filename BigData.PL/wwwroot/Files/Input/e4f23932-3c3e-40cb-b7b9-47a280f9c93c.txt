The philosophy of artificial intelligence is a branch of the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of computer science            that explores artificial intelligence and its implications for knowledge and understanding of intelligence  ethics  consciousness  epistemology              and free will                        Furthermore  the technology is concerned with the creation of artificial animals or artificial people  or  at least  artificial creatures  see artificial life  so the discipline is of considerable interest to philosophers             These factors contributed to the emergence of the philosophy of artificial intelligence 
The philosophy of artificial intelligence attempts to answer such questions as follows            

Can a machine act intelligently  Can it solve any problem that a person would solve by thinking 
Are human intelligence and machine intelligence the same  Is the human brain essentially a computer 
Can a machine have a mind  mental states  and consciousness in the same sense that a human being can  Can it feel how things are   i e  does it have qualia  
Questions like these reflect the divergent interests of AI researchers  cognitive scientists and philosophers respectively  The scientific answers to these questions depend on the definition of  intelligence  and  consciousness  and exactly which  machines  are under discussion 
Important propositions in the philosophy of AI include some of the following 

Turing s  polite convention   If a machine behaves as intelligently as a human being  then it is as intelligent as a human being            
The Dartmouth proposal   Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it             
Allen Newell and Herbert A  Simon s physical symbol system hypothesis   A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action             
John Searle s strong AI hypothesis   The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds              
Hobbes  mechanism   For  reason           is nothing but  reckoning   that is adding and subtracting  of the consequences of general names agreed upon for the  marking  and  signifying  of our thoughts                

Can a machine display general intelligence  edit 
Is it possible to create a machine that can solve all the problems humans solve using their intelligence  This question defines the scope of what machines could do in the future and guides the direction of AI research  It only concerns the behavior of machines and ignores the issues of interest to psychologists  cognitive scientists and philosophers  evoking the question  does it matter whether a machine is really thinking  as a person thinks  rather than just producing outcomes that appear to result from thinking             
The basic position of most AI researchers is summed up in this statement  which appeared in the proposal for the Dartmouth workshop of      

 Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it             
Arguments against the basic premise must show that building a working AI system is impossible because there is some practical limit to the abilities of computers or that there is some special quality of the human mind that is necessary for intelligent behavior and yet cannot be duplicated by a machine  or by the methods of current AI research   Arguments in favor of the basic premise must show that such a system is possible 
It is also possible to sidestep the connection between the two parts of the above proposal  For instance  machine learning  beginning with Turing s infamous child machine proposal              essentially achieves the desired feature of intelligence without a precise design time description as to how it would exactly work  The account on robot tacit knowledge             eliminates the need for a precise description altogether 
The first step to answering the question is to clearly define  intelligence  

Intelligence edit 
The  standard interpretation  of the Turing test            
Turing test edit 
Main article  Turing test
Alan Turing             reduced the problem of defining intelligence to a simple question about conversation  He suggests that  if a machine can answer any question posed to it  using the same words that an ordinary person would  then we may call that machine intelligent  A modern version of his experimental design would use an online chat room  where one of the participants is a real person and one of the participants is a computer program  The program passes the test if no one can tell which of the two participants is human             Turing notes that no one  except philosophers  ever asks the question  can people think   He writes  instead of arguing continually over this point  it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks               Turing s test extends this polite convention to machines 

If a machine acts as intelligently as a human being  then it is as intelligent as a human being 
One criticism of the Turing test is that it only measures the  humanness  of the machine s behavior  rather than the  intelligence  of the behavior  Since human behavior and intelligent behavior are not exactly the same thing  the test fails to measure intelligence  Stuart J  Russell and Peter Norvig write that  aeronautical engineering texts do not define the goal of their field as  making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons               

Intelligence as achieving goals edit 
Simple reflex agent
Twenty first century AI research defines intelligence in terms of goal directed behavior  It views intelligence as a set of problems that the machine is expected to solve   the more problems it can solve  and the better its solutions are  the more intelligent the program is  AI founder John McCarthy defined intelligence as  the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world              
Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig formalized this definition using abstract intelligent agents  An  agent  is something which perceives and acts in an environment  A  performance measure  defines what counts as success for the agent              

 If an agent acts so as to maximize the expected value of a performance measure based on past experience and knowledge then it is intelligent              
Definitions like this one try to capture the essence of intelligence  They have the advantage that  unlike the Turing test  they do not also test for unintelligent human traits such as making typing mistakes              
They have the disadvantage that they can fail to differentiate between  things that think  and  things that do not   By this definition  even a thermostat has a rudimentary intelligence             

Arguments that a machine can display general intelligence edit 
The brain can be simulated edit 
Main article  Artificial brain
An MRI scan of a normal adult human brain
Hubert Dreyfus describes this argument as claiming that  if the nervous system obeys the laws of physics and chemistry  which we have every reason to suppose it does  then          we          ought to be able to reproduce the behavior of the nervous system with some physical device               This argument  first introduced as early as                  and vividly described by Hans Moravec in                   
is now associated with futurist Ray Kurzweil  who estimates that computer power will be sufficient for a complete brain simulation by the year                   A non real time simulation of a thalamocortical model that has the size of the human brain       neurons  was performed in                   and it took    days to simulate   second of brain dynamics on a cluster of    processors 
Even AI s harshest critics  such as Hubert Dreyfus and John Searle  agree that a brain simulation is possible in theory      a     
However  Searle points out that  in principle  anything can be simulated by a computer  thus  bringing the definition to its breaking point leads to the conclusion that any process at all can technically be considered  computation    What we wanted to know is what distinguishes the mind from thermostats and livers   he writes              Thus  merely simulating the functioning of a living brain would in itself be an admission of ignorance regarding intelligence and the nature of the mind  like trying to build a jet airliner by copying a living bird precisely  feather by feather  with no theoretical understanding of aeronautical engineering             

Human thinking is symbol processing edit 
Main article  Physical symbol system
In       Allen Newell and Herbert A  Simon proposed that  symbol manipulation  was the essence of both human and machine intelligence  They wrote  

 A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action             
This claim is very strong  it implies both that human thinking is a kind of symbol manipulation  because a symbol system is necessary for intelligence  and that machines can be intelligent  because a symbol system is sufficient for intelligence              
Another version of this position was described by philosopher Hubert Dreyfus  who called it  the psychological assumption  

 The mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of information according to formal rules              
The  symbols  that Newell  Simon and Dreyfus discussed were word like and high level symbols that directly correspond with objects in the world  such as  lt dog gt  and  lt tail gt   Most AI programs written between      and      used this kind of symbol  Modern AI  based on statistics and mathematical optimization  does not use the high level  symbol processing  that Newell and Simon discussed 

Arguments against symbol processing edit 
These arguments show that human thinking does not consist  solely  of high level symbol manipulation  They do not show that artificial intelligence is impossible  only that more than symbol processing is required 

G delian anti mechanist arguments edit 
Main article  Mechanism  philosophy   G delian arguments
In       Kurt G del proved with an incompleteness theorem that it is always possible to construct a  G del statement  that a given consistent formal system of logic  such as a high level symbol manipulation program  could not prove  Despite being a true statement  the constructed G del statement is unprovable in the given system   The truth of the constructed G del statement is contingent on the consistency of the given system  applying the same process to a subtly inconsistent system will appear to succeed  but will actually yield a false  G del statement  instead       citation needed      More speculatively  G del conjectured that the human mind can eventually correctly determine the truth or falsity of any well grounded mathematical statement  including any possible G del statement   and that therefore the human mind s power is not reducible to a mechanism              Philosopher John Lucas  since       and Roger Penrose  since       have championed this philosophical anti mechanist argument             
G delian anti mechanist arguments tend to rely on the innocuous seeming claim that a system of human mathematicians  or some idealization of human mathematicians  is both consistent  completely free of error  and believes fully in its own consistency  and can make all logical inferences that follow from its own consistency  including belief in its G del statement       citation needed       This is probably impossible for a Turing machine to do  see Halting problem   therefore  the G delian concludes that human reasoning is too powerful to be captured by a Turing machine  and by extension  any digital mechanical device 
However  the modern consensus in the scientific and mathematical community is that actual human reasoning is inconsistent  that any consistent  idealized version  H of human reasoning would logically be forced to adopt a healthy but counter intuitive open minded skepticism about the consistency of H  otherwise H is provably inconsistent   and that G del s theorems do not lead to any valid argument that humans have mathematical reasoning capabilities beyond what a machine could ever duplicate                                      This consensus that G delian anti mechanist arguments are doomed to failure is laid out strongly in Artificial Intelligence   any attempt to utilize  G del s incompleteness results  to attack the computationalist thesis is bound to be illegitimate  since these results are quite consistent with the computationalist thesis              
Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig agree that G del s argument does not consider the nature of real world human reasoning  It applies to what can theoretically be proved  given an infinite amount of memory and time  In practice  real machines  including humans  have finite resources and will have difficulty proving many theorems  It is not necessary to be able to prove everything in order to be an intelligent person             
Less formally  Douglas Hofstadter  in his Pulitzer Prize winning book G del  Escher  Bach  An Eternal Golden Braid  states that these  G del statements  always refer to the system itself  drawing an analogy to the way the Epimenides paradox uses statements that refer to themselves  such as  this statement is false  or  I am lying               But  of course  the Epimenides paradox applies to anything that makes statements  whether it is a machine or a human  even Lucas himself  Consider 

Lucas can t assert the truth of this statement             
This statement is true but cannot be asserted by Lucas  This shows that Lucas himself is subject to the same limits that he describes for machines  as are all people  and so Lucas s argument is pointless             
After concluding that human reasoning is non computable  Penrose went on to controversially speculate that some kind of hypothetical non computable processes involving the collapse of quantum mechanical states give humans a special advantage over existing computers  Existing quantum computers are only capable of reducing the complexity of Turing computable tasks and are still restricted to tasks within the scope of Turing machines       citation needed           clarification needed       By Penrose and Lucas s arguments  the fact that quantum computers are only able to complete Turing computable tasks implies that they cannot be sufficient for emulating the human mind      citation needed      Therefore  Penrose seeks for some other process involving new physics  for instance quantum gravity which might manifest new physics at the scale of the Planck mass via spontaneous quantum collapse of the wave function  These states  he suggested  occur both within neurons and also spanning more than one neuron              However  other scientists point out that there is no plausible organic mechanism in the brain for harnessing any sort of quantum computation  and furthermore that the timescale of quantum decoherence seems too fast to influence neuron firing             

Dreyfus  the primacy of implicit skills edit 
Main article  Hubert Dreyfus s views on artificial intelligence
Hubert Dreyfus argued that human intelligence and expertise depended primarily on fast intuitive judgements rather than step by step symbolic manipulation  and argued that these skills would never be captured in formal rules             
Dreyfus s argument had been anticipated by Turing in his      paper Computing machinery and intelligence  where he had classified this as the  argument from the informality of behavior               Turing argued in response that  just because we do not know the rules that govern a complex behavior  this does not mean that no such rules exist  He wrote   we cannot so easily convince ourselves of the absence of complete laws of behaviour          The only way we know of for finding such laws is scientific observation  and we certainly know of no circumstances under which we could say   We have searched enough  There are no such laws               
Russell and Norvig point out that  in the years since Dreyfus published his critique  progress has been made towards discovering the  rules  that govern unconscious reasoning              The situated movement in robotics research attempts to capture our unconscious skills at perception and attention              Computational intelligence paradigms  such as neural nets  evolutionary algorithms and so on are mostly directed at simulated unconscious reasoning and learning  Statistical approaches to AI can make predictions which approach the accuracy of human intuitive guesses  Research into commonsense knowledge has focused on reproducing the  background  or context of knowledge  In fact  AI research in general has moved away from high level symbol manipulation  towards new models that are intended to capture more of our intuitive reasoning             
Cognitive science and psychology eventually came to agree with Dreyfus  description of human expertise  Daniel Kahnemann and others developed a similar theory where they identified two  systems  that humans use to solve problems  which he called  System     fast intuitive judgements  and  System     slow deliberate step by step thinking              
Although Dreyfus  views have been vindicated in many ways  the work in cognitive science and in AI was in response to specific problems in those fields and was not directly influenced by Dreyfus  Historian and AI researcher Daniel Crevier wrote that  time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus s comments  Had he formulated them less aggressively  constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier              

Can a machine have a mind  consciousness  and mental states  edit 
This is a philosophical question  related to the problem of other minds and the hard problem of consciousness  The question revolves around a position defined by John Searle as  strong AI  

A physical symbol system can have a mind and mental states             
Searle distinguished this position from what he called  weak AI  

A physical symbol system can act intelligently             
Searle introduced the terms to isolate strong AI from weak AI so he could focus on what he thought was the more interesting and debatable issue  He argued that even if we assume that we had a computer program that acted exactly like a human mind  there would still be a difficult philosophical question that needed to be answered             
Neither of Searle s two positions are of great concern to AI research  since they do not directly answer the question  can a machine display general intelligence    unless it can also be shown that consciousness is necessary for intelligence   Turing wrote  I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness   b ut I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question  of whether machines can think                Russell and Norvig agree   Most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted  and don t care about the strong AI hypothesis              
There are a few researchers who believe that consciousness is an essential element in intelligence  such as Igor Aleksander  Stan Franklin  Ron Sun  and Pentti Haikonen  although their definition of  consciousness  strays very close to  intelligence    See artificial consciousness  
Before we can answer this question  we must be clear what we mean by  minds    mental states  and  consciousness  

Consciousness  minds  mental states  meaning edit 
The words  mind  and  consciousness  are used by different communities in different ways  Some new age thinkers  for example  use the word  consciousness  to describe something similar to Bergson s   lan vital   an invisible  energetic fluid that permeates life and especially the mind  Science fiction writers use the word to describe some essential property that makes us human  a machine or alien that is  conscious  will be presented as a fully human character  with intelligence  desires  will  insight  pride and so on   Science fiction writers also use the words  sentience    sapience    self awareness  or  ghost  as in the Ghost in the Shell manga and anime series to describe this essential human property   For others      who        the words  mind  or  consciousness  are used as a kind of secular synonym for the soul 
For philosophers  neuroscientists and cognitive scientists  the words are used in a way that is both more precise and more mundane  they refer to the familiar  everyday experience of having a  thought in your head   like a perception  a dream  an intention or a plan  and to the way we see something  know something  mean something or understand something               It s not hard to give a commonsense definition of consciousness  observes philosopher John Searle              What is mysterious and fascinating is not so much what it is but how it is  how does a lump of fatty tissue and electricity give rise to this  familiar  experience of perceiving  meaning or thinking 
Philosophers call this the hard problem of consciousness  It is the latest version of a classic problem in the philosophy of mind called the  mind body problem               A related problem is the problem of meaning or understanding  which philosophers call  intentionality    what is the connection between our thoughts and what we are thinking about  i e  objects and situations out in the world   A third issue is the problem of experience  or  phenomenology    If two people see the same thing  do they have the same experience  Or are there things  inside their head   called  qualia   that can be different from person to person             
Neurobiologists believe all these problems will be solved as we begin to identify the neural correlates of consciousness  the actual relationship between the machinery in our heads and its collective properties  such as the mind  experience and understanding  Some of the harshest critics of artificial intelligence agree that the brain is just a machine  and that consciousness and intelligence are the result of physical processes in the brain              The difficult philosophical question is this  can a computer program  running on a digital machine that shuffles the binary digits of zero and one  duplicate the ability of the neurons to create minds  with mental states  like understanding or perceiving   and ultimately  the experience of consciousness 

Arguments that a computer cannot have a mind and mental states edit 
Searle s Chinese room edit 
Main article  Chinese room
John Searle asks us to consider a thought experiment  suppose we have written a computer program that passes the Turing test and demonstrates general intelligent action  Suppose  specifically that the program can converse in fluent Chinese  Write the program on  x  cards and give them to an ordinary person who does not speak Chinese  Lock the person into a room and have him follow the instructions on the cards  He will copy out Chinese characters and pass them in and out of the room through a slot  From the outside  it will appear that the Chinese room contains a fully intelligent person who speaks Chinese  The question is this  is there anyone  or anything  in the room that understands Chinese  That is  is there anything that has the mental state of understanding  or which has conscious awareness of what is being discussed in Chinese  The man is clearly not aware  The room cannot be aware  The cards certainly are not aware  Searle concludes that the Chinese room  or any other physical symbol system  cannot have a mind             
Searle goes on to argue that actual mental states and consciousness require  yet to be described   actual physical chemical properties of actual human brains               He argues there are special  causal properties  of brains and neurons that gives rise to minds  in his words  brains cause minds              

Related arguments  Leibniz  mill  Davis s telephone exchange  Block s Chinese nation and Blockhead edit 
Gottfried Leibniz made essentially the same argument as Searle in       using the thought experiment of expanding the brain until it was the size of a mill              In       Lawrence Davis imagined duplicating the brain using telephone lines and offices staffed by people  and in      Ned Block envisioned the entire population of China involved in such a brain simulation  This thought experiment is called  the Chinese Nation  or  the Chinese Gym               Ned Block also proposed his Blockhead argument  which is a version of the Chinese room in which the program has been re factored into a simple set of rules of the form  see this  do that   removing all mystery from the program 

Responses to the Chinese room edit 
Responses to the Chinese room emphasize several different points  

The systems reply and the virtual mind reply              This reply argues that the system  including the man  the program  the room  and the cards  is what understands Chinese  Searle claims that the man in the room is the only thing which could possibly  have a mind  or  understand   but others disagree  arguing that it is possible for there to be two minds in the same physical place  similar to the way a computer can simultaneously  be  two machines at once  one physical  like a Macintosh  and one  virtual   like a word processor  
Speed  power and complexity replies              Several critics point out that the man in the room would probably take millions of years to respond to a simple question  and would require  filing cabinets  of astronomical proportions  This brings the clarity of Searle s intuition into doubt 
Robot reply              To truly understand  some believe the Chinese Room needs eyes and hands  Hans Moravec writes   If we could graft a robot to a reasoning program  we wouldn t need a person to provide the meaning anymore  it would come from the physical world              
Brain simulator reply              What if the program simulates the sequence of nerve firings at the synapses of an actual brain of an actual Chinese speaker  The man in the room would be simulating an actual brain  This is a variation on the  systems reply  that appears more plausible because  the system  now clearly operates like a human brain  which strengthens the intuition that there is something besides the man in the room that could understand Chinese 
Other minds reply and the epiphenomena reply              Several people have noted that Searle s argument is just a version of the problem of other minds  applied to machines  Since it is difficult to decide if people are  actually  thinking  we should not be surprised that it is difficult to answer the same question about machines 
A related question is whether  consciousness   as Searle understands it  exists  Searle argues that the experience of consciousness cannot be detected by examining the behavior of a machine  a human being or any other animal  Daniel Dennett points out that natural selection cannot preserve a feature of an animal that has no effect on the behavior of the animal  and thus consciousness  as Searle understands it  cannot be produced by natural selection  Therefore  either natural selection did not produce consciousness  or  strong AI  is correct in that consciousness can be detected by suitably designed Turing test 
Is thinking a kind of computation  edit 
Main article  Computational theory of mind
The computational theory of mind or  computationalism  claims that the relationship between mind and brain is similar  if not identical  to the relationship between a running program  software  and a computer  hardware   The idea has philosophical roots in Hobbes  who claimed reasoning was  nothing more than reckoning    Leibniz  who attempted to create a logical calculus of all human ideas   Hume  who thought perception could be reduced to  atomic impressions   and even Kant  who analyzed all experience as controlled by formal rules               The latest version is associated with philosophers Hilary Putnam and Jerry Fodor             
This question bears on our earlier questions  if the human brain is a kind of computer then computers can be both intelligent and conscious  answering both the practical and philosophical questions of AI  In terms of the practical question of AI   Can a machine display general intelligence     some versions of computationalism make the claim that  as Hobbes wrote  

Reasoning is nothing but reckoning             
In other words  our intelligence derives from a form of calculation  similar to arithmetic  This is the physical symbol system hypothesis discussed above  and it implies that artificial intelligence is possible  In terms of the philosophical question of AI   Can a machine have mind  mental states and consciousness     most versions of computationalism claim that  as Stevan Harnad characterizes it  

Mental states are just implementations of  the right  computer programs             
This is John Searle s  strong AI  discussed above  and it is the real target of the Chinese room argument  according to Harnad              

Other related questions edit 
Can a machine have emotions  edit 
If  emotions  are defined only in terms of their effect on behavior or on how they function inside an organism  then emotions can be viewed as a mechanism that an intelligent agent uses to maximize the utility of its actions  Given this definition of emotion  Hans Moravec believes that  robots in general will be quite emotional about being nice people               Fear is a source of urgency  Empathy is a necessary component of good human computer interaction  He says robots  will try to please you in an apparently selfless manner because it will get a thrill out of this positive reinforcement  You can interpret this as a kind of love               Daniel Crevier writes  Moravec s point is that emotions are just devices for channeling behavior in a direction beneficial to the survival of one s species              

Can a machine be self aware  edit 
 Self awareness   as noted above  is sometimes used by science fiction writers as a name for the essential human property that makes a character fully human  Turing strips away all other properties of human beings and reduces the question to  can a machine be the subject of its own thought   Can it think about itself  Viewed in this way  a program can be written that can report on its own internal states  such as a debugger             

Can a machine be original or creative  edit 
Turing reduces this to the question of whether a machine can  take us by surprise  and argues that this is obviously true  as any programmer can attest              He notes that  with enough storage capacity  a computer can behave in an astronomical number of different ways              It must be possible  even trivial  for a computer that can represent ideas to combine them in new ways   Douglas Lenat s Automated Mathematician  as one example  combined ideas to discover new mathematical truths   Kaplan and Haenlein suggest that machines can display scientific creativity  while it seems likely that humans will have the upper hand where artistic creativity is concerned             
In       scientists at Aberystwyth University in Wales and the U K s University of Cambridge designed a robot called Adam that they believe to be the first machine to independently come up with new scientific findings              Also in       researchers at Cornell developed Eureqa  a computer program that extrapolates formulas to fit the data inputted  such as finding the laws of motion from a pendulum s motion 

Can a machine be benevolent or hostile  edit 
Main article  Ethics of artificial intelligence
This question  like many others in the philosophy of artificial intelligence  can be presented in two forms   Hostility  can be defined in terms function or behavior  in which case  hostile  becomes synonymous with  dangerous   Or it can be defined in terms of intent  can a machine  deliberately  set out to do harm  The latter is the question  can a machine have conscious states    such as intentions  in another form             
The question of whether highly intelligent and completely autonomous machines would be dangerous has been examined in detail by futurists  such as the Machine Intelligence Research Institute   The obvious element of drama has also made the subject popular in science fiction  which has considered many differently possible scenarios where intelligent machines pose a threat to mankind  see Artificial intelligence in fiction 
One issue is that machines may acquire the autonomy and intelligence required to be dangerous very quickly  Vernor Vinge has suggested that over just a few years  computers will suddenly become thousands or millions of times more intelligent than humans  He calls this  the Singularity               He suggests that it may be somewhat or possibly very dangerous for humans              This is discussed by a philosophy called Singularitarianism 
In       academics and technical experts attended a conference to discuss the potential impact of robots and computers and the impact of the hypothetical possibility that they could become self sufficient and able to make their own decisions  They discussed the possibility and the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire any level of autonomy  and to what degree they could use such abilities to possibly pose any threat or hazard  They noted that some machines have acquired various forms of semi autonomy  including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons  They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved  cockroach intelligence   They noted that self awareness as depicted in science fiction is probably unlikely  but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls             
Some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat  especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions              The US Navy has funded a report which indicates that as military robots become more complex  there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions                         
The President of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence has commissioned a study to look at this issue              They point to programs like the Language Acquisition Device which can emulate human interaction 
Some have suggested a need to build  Friendly AI   a term coined by Eliezer Yudkowsky  meaning that the advances which are already occurring with AI should also include an effort to make AI intrinsically friendly and humane             

Can a machine imitate all human characteristics  edit 
Turing said  It is customary          to offer a grain of comfort  in the form of a statement that some peculiarly human characteristic could never be imitated by a machine      I cannot offer any such comfort  for I believe that no such bounds can be set              
Turing noted that there are many arguments of the form  a machine will never do X   where X can be many things  such as 

Be kind  resourceful  beautiful  friendly  have initiative  have a sense of humor  tell right from wrong  make mistakes  fall in love  enjoy strawberries and cream  make someone fall in love with it  learn from experience  use words properly  be the subject of its own thought  have as much diversity of behaviour as a man  do something really new             
Turing argues that these objections are often based on naive assumptions about the versatility of machines or are  disguised forms of the argument from consciousness   Writing a program that exhibits one of these behaviors  will not make much of an impression               All of these arguments are tangential to the basic premise of AI  unless it can be shown that one of these traits is essential for general intelligence 

Can a machine have a soul  edit 
Finally  those who believe in the existence of a soul may argue that  Thinking is a function of man s immortal soul   Alan Turing called this  the theological objection   He writes 

In attempting to construct such machines we should not be irreverently usurping His power of creating souls  any more than we are in the procreation of children  rather we are  in either case  instruments of His will providing mansions for the souls that He creates             The discussion on the topic has been reignited as a result of recent claims made by Google s LaMDA artificial intelligence system that it is sentient and had a  soul              
LaMDA  Language Model for Dialogue Applications  is an artificial intelligence system that creates chatbots AI robots designed to communicate with humans by gathering vast amounts of text from the internet and using algorithms to respond to queries in the most fluid and natural way possible 
The transcripts of conversations between scientists and LaMDA reveal that the AI system excels at this  providing answers to challenging topics about the nature of emotions  generating Aesop style fables on the moment  and even describing its alleged fears              Pretty much all philosophers doubt LaMDA s sentience             

Views on the role of philosophy edit 
Some scholars argue that the AI community s dismissal of philosophy is detrimental  In the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  some philosophers argue that the role of philosophy in AI is underappreciated             Physicist David Deutsch argues that without an understanding of philosophy or its concepts  AI development would suffer from a lack of progress             

Conferences and literature edit 
The main conference series on the issue is  Philosophy and Theory of AI   PT AI   run by Vincent C  M ller 
The main bibliography on the subject  with several sub sections  is on PhilPapers 
A recent survey for Philosophy of AI is M ller

Notes edit 


  Hubert Dreyfus writes   In general  by accepting the fundamental assumptions that the nervous system is part of the physical world and that all physical processes can be described in a mathematical formalism which can  in turn  be manipulated by a digital computer  one can arrive at the strong claim that the behavior which results from human  information processing   whether directly formalizable or not  can always be indirectly reproduced on a digital machine                 John Searle writes   Could a man made machine think  Assuming it possible produce artificially a machine with a nervous system      the answer to the question seems to be obviously  yes     Could a digital computer think  If by  digital computer  you mean anything at all that has a level of description where it can be correctly described as the instantiation of a computer program  then again the answer is  of course  yes  since we are the instantiations of any number of computer programs  and we can think
