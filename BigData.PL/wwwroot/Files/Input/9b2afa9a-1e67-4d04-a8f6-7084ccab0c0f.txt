Vehicular automation is the use of technology to assist or replace the operator of a vehicle such as a car  truck  aircraft  rocket  military vehicle  or boat                                                         Assisted vehicles are semi autonomous  whereas vehicles that can travel without a human operator are autonomous             The degree of autonomy may be subject to various constraints such as conditions  Autonomy is enabled by advanced driver assistance systems  ADAS  of varying capacity 
Related technology includes advanced software  maps  vehicle changes  and support outside the vehicle  
Autonomy presents varying issues for road travel  air travel  and marine travel  Roads present the greatest complexity given the unpredictability of the driving environment  including diverse road designs  driving conditions  traffic  obstacles  and geographical cultural differences            
Autonomy implies that the vehicle is responsible for all perception  monitoring  and control functions            


SAE autonomy levels edit 
Main article  Self driving car        Classifications
Further information  Automatic train operation        Grades of automation
The Society of Automotive Engineers  SAE  classifies road vehicle autonomy in six levels                         

   No automation 
   Driver assistance  the vehicle controls steering or speed autonomously in specific circumstances 
   Partial automation  the vehicle controls both steering and speed autonomously in specific circumstances 
   Conditional automation  the vehicle controls both steering and speed under normal environmental conditions  but requires the driver to be ready to take control in other circumstances 
   High automation  the vehicle travels autonomously under normal environmental conditions  not requiring driver oversight 
   Full autonomy  where the vehicle can complete travel autonomously in any environmental conditions 
Level   refers  for instance  to vehicles without adaptive cruise control  Level   and   refer to vehicles where one part of the driving task is performed by the ADAS under the responsibility liability of the driver 
From level    the driver can transfer the driving task to the vehicle  but the driver must assume control when the ADAS reaches its limits  For instance an automated traffic jam pilot can drive in a traffic jam  but otherwise passes control to the driver  Level   refers to a vehicle that can handle any situation             

Technology edit 
Software edit 
Autonomous systems typically rely on machine learning software to operate              Systems must perceive the driving environment  control the vehicle  monitor vehicle status  and provide detailed driving directions  

Perception edit 
The perception system is responsible for observing the environment  It must identify everything that could affect the trip  including other vehicles  pedestrians  cyclists  their movements  road conditions  obstacles  and other issues              Various makers use cameras  radar  lidar  sonar  and microphones that can collaboratively minimize errors                         

Navigation edit 
Navigation systems are a necessary element in autonomous vehicles  The Global Positioning System  GPS  is used for navigation by air and water vehicles  and by land vehicles as well  particularly for off road navigation 
For road vehicles  two approaches are prominent  One is to use maps that hold data about lanes and intersections  relying on the vehicle s perception system to fill in the details  The other is to use highly detailed maps that reduce the scope of realtime decision making  but require significant maintenance as the environment evolves              Some systems crowdsource their map updates  using the vehicles themselves to update the map to reflect changes such as construction or traffic that is then used by the entire vehicle fleet             
Another potential source of information is the environment itself  Traffic data may be supplied by roadside monitoring systems and used to route vehicles to best use a limited road system              Additionally  modern GNSS enhancement technologies  such as real time kinematic  RTK  and precise point positioning  PPP   enhance the accuracy of vehicle positioning to sub meter level precision  which is crucial for autonomous navigation and decision making             

History edit 
Automated vehicles in European Union legislation refer specifically to road vehicles  car  truck  or bus               For those vehicles  a specific difference is legally defined between advanced driver assistance system and autonomous automated vehicles  based on liability differences 
AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety tested two automatic emergency braking systems  some designed to prevent crashes and others that aim to make a crash less severe  The test looked at popular models like the      Volvo XC    Subaru Legacy  Lincoln MKX  Honda Civic  and Volkswagen Passat  Researchers tested how well each system stopped when approaching moving and nonmoving targets  It found that systems capable of preventing crashes reduced vehicle speeds by twice that of the systems designed to mitigate crash severity  When the two test vehicles traveled within         mph of each other  even those designed to simply lessen crash severity avoided crashes    percent of the time             

Sartre edit 
The SAfe Road TRains for the Environment  Sartre  project s goal was to enable platooning  in which a line of cars and trucks  a  train   follow a human driven vehicle  Trains were predicted to provide comfort and allow the following vehicles to travel safely to a destination  Human drivers encountering a train could join and delegate driving to the human driver               

Tests edit 
Self driving Uber vehicles were tested in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  The tests were paused after an autonomous car killed a woman in Arizona                          Automated busses have been tested in California              In San Diego  California  an automated bus test used magnetic markers  The longitudinal control of automated truck platoons used millimeter wave radio and radar  Waymo and Tesla have conducted tests  Tesla FSD allows drivers to enter a destination and let the car take over 

Risks and liabilities edit

Ford offers Blue Cruise  technology that allows geofenced cars to drive autonomously              
Drivers are directed to stay attentive and safety warnings are implemented to alert the driver when corrective action is needed              Tesla  Incorporated has one recorded incident that resulted in a fatality involving the automated driving system in the Tesla Model S              The accident report reveals the accident was a result of the driver being inattentive and the autopilot system not recognizing the obstruction ahead              Tesla has also had multiple instances where the vehicle crashed into a garage door  According to the book  The Driver in the Driverless Car  How Your Technology Choices Create the Future  a Tesla performed an update overnight automatically  The morning after the update the driver used his app to  summon  his car  it crashed into his garage door 
Another flaw with automated driving systems is that in situations where unpredictable events such as weather or the driving behavior of others may cause fatal accidents due to sensors that monitor the surroundings of the vehicle not being able to provide corrective action             
To overcome some of the challenges for automated driving systems  novel methodologies based on virtual testing  traffic flow simulation and digital prototypes have been proposed              especially when novel algorithms based on Artificial Intelligence approaches are employed which require extensive training and validation data sets 
The implementation of automated driving systems poses the possibility of changing built environments in urban areas  such as the expansion of suburban areas due to the increased ease of mobility             

Challenges edit 
Around       several self driving car companies including Nissan and Toyota promised self driving cars by       However  the predictions turned out to be far too optimistic             
There are still many obstacles in developing fully autonomous Level   vehicles  which is the ability to operate in any conditions  Currently  companies are focused on Level   automation  which is able to operate under certain environmental circumstances             
There is still debate about what an autonomous vehicle should look like  For example  whether to incorporate lidar to autonomous driving systems is still being argued  Some researchers have come up with algorithms using camera only data that achieve the performance that rival those of lidar  On the other hand  camera only data sometimes draw inaccurate bounding boxes  and thus lead to poor predictions  This is due to the nature of superficial information that stereo cameras provide  whereas incorporating lidar gives autonomous vehicles precise distance to each point on the vehicle             

Technical challenges edit 
Software Integration  Because of the large number of sensors and safety processes required by autonomous vehicles  software integration remains a challenging task  A robust autonomous vehicle should ensure that the integration of hardware and software can recover from component failures             
Prediction and trust among autonomous vehicles  Fully autonomous cars should be able to anticipate the actions of other cars like humans do  Human drivers are great at predicting other drivers  behaviors  even with a small amount of data such as eye contact or hand gestures  In the first place  the cars should agree on traffic rules  whose turn it is to drive in an intersection  and so on  This scales into a larger issue when there exists both human operated cars and self driving cars due to more uncertainties  A robust autonomous vehicle is expected to improve on understanding the environment better to address this issue             
Scaling up  The coverage of autonomous vehicles testing could not be accurate enough  In cases where heavy traffic and obstruction exist  it requires faster response time or better tracking algorithms from the autonomous vehicles  In cases where unseen objects are encountered  it is important that the algorithms are able to track these objects and avoid collisions             
These features require numerous sensors  many of which rely on micro electro mechanical systems  MEMS  to maintain a small size  high efficiency  and low cost  Foremost among MEMS sensors in vehicles are accelerometers and gyroscopes to measure acceleration around multiple orthogonal axes critical to detecting and controlling the vehicle s motion 

Societal challenges edit 
One critical step to achieve the implementation of autonomous vehicles is the acceptance by the general public  It provides guidelines for the automobile industry to improve their design and technology  Studies have shown that many people believe that using autonomous vehicles is safer  which underlines the necessity for the automobile companies to assure that autonomous vehicles improve safety benefits  The TAM research model breaks down important factors that affect the consumer s acceptance into  usefulness  ease to use  trust  and social influence             

The usefulness factor studies whether or not autonomous vehicles are useful in that they provide benefits that save consumers  time and make their lives simpler  How well the consumers believe autonomous vehicles will be useful compared to other forms of transportation solutions is a determining factor             
The ease to use factor studies the user friendliness of the autonomous vehicles  While the notion that consumers care more about ease to use than safety has been challenged  It still remains an important factor that has indirect effects on the public s intention to use autonomous vehicles             
The trust factor studies the safety  data privacy and security protection of autonomous vehicles  A more trusted system has a positive impact on the consumer s decision to use autonomous vehicles             
The social influence factor studies whether the influence of others would influence consumer s likelihood of having autonomous vehicles  Studies have shown that the social influence factor is positively related to behavioral intention  This might be due to the fact that cars traditionally serve as a status symbol that represents one s intent to use and his social environment             
Regulatory challenges edit 
See also  Regulation of self driving cars
Real time testing of autonomous vehicles is an inevitable part of the process  At the same time  vehicular automation regulators are faced with challenges to protect public safety and yet allow autonomous vehicle companies to test their products  Groups representing autonomous vehicle companies are resisting most regulations  whereas groups representing vulnerable road users and traffic safety are pushing for regulatory barriers  To improve traffic safety  the regulators are encouraged to find a middle ground that protects the public from immature technology while allowing autonomous vehicle companies to test the implementation of their systems              There have also been proposals to adopt the aviation automation safety regulatory knowledge into the discussions of safe implementation of autonomous vehicles  due to the experience that has been gained over the decades by the aviation sector on safety topics             

Ground vehicles edit 
Further information  Unmanned ground vehicle
In some countries  specific laws and regulations apply to road traffic motor vehicles  such as cars  bus and trucks  while other laws and regulations apply to other ground vehicles such as tram  train or automated guided vehicles making them to operate in different environments and conditions 

Road traffic vehicles edit 
An automated driving system is defined in a proposed amendment to Article   of the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic 

 ab   Automated driving system  refers to a vehicle system that uses both hardware and
software to exercise dynamic control of a vehicle on a sustained basis  ac   Dynamic control  refers to carrying out all the real time operational and tactical functions required to move the vehicle  This includes controlling the vehicle s lateral and longitudinal motion  monitoring the road environment  responding to events in the road traffic environment  and planning and signalling for manoeuvres             
This amendment will enter into force on    July       unless it is rejected before    January                  

An automated driving feature must be described sufficiently clearly so that it is distinguished from an assisted driving feature         SMMT            
There are two clear states   a vehicle is either assisted with a driver being supported by technology or automated where the technology is effectively and safely replacing the driver         SMMT            
Ground vehicles employing automation and teleoperation include shipyard gantries  mining trucks  bomb disposal robots  robotic insects  and driverless tractors 
There are many autonomous and semi autonomous ground vehicles being made for the purpose of transporting passengers  One such example is the free ranging on grid  FROG  technology which consists of autonomous vehicles  a magnetic track and a supervisory system  The FROG system is deployed for industrial purposes in factory sites and has been in use since      on the ParkShuttle  a PRT style public transport system in the city of Capelle aan den IJssel to connect the Rivium business park with the neighboring city of Rotterdam  where the route terminates at the Kralingse Zoom metro station   The system experienced a crash in                  that proved to be caused by a human error             
Applications for automation in ground vehicles include the following 

Vehicle tracking system system ESITrack  Lojack 
Rear view alarm  to detect obstacles behind 
Anti lock braking system  ABS   also Emergency Braking Assistance  EBA    often coupled with Electronic brake force distribution  EBD   which prevents the brakes from locking and losing traction while braking  This shortens stopping distances in most cases and  more importantly  allows the driver to steer the vehicle while braking 
Traction control system  TCS  actuates brakes or reduces throttle to restore traction if driven wheels begin to spin 
Four wheel drive  AWD  with a centre differential  Distributing power to all four wheels lessens the chances of wheel spin  It also suffers less from oversteer and understeer 
Electronic Stability Control  ESC   also known for Mercedes Benz proprietary Electronic Stability Program  ESP   Acceleration Slip Regulation  ASR  and Electronic differential lock  EDL    Uses various sensors to intervene when the car senses a possible loss of control  The car s control unit can reduce power from the engine and even apply the brakes on individual wheels to prevent the car from understeering or oversteering 
Dynamic steering response  DSR  corrects the rate of power steering system to adapt it to vehicle s speed and road conditions 
Research is ongoing and prototypes of autonomous ground vehicles exist 

Cars edit 
See also  Self driving car
Extensive automation for cars focuses on either introducing robotic cars or modifying modern car designs to be semi autonomous 
Semi autonomous designs could be implemented sooner as they rely less on technology that is still at the forefront of research  An example is the dual mode monorail  Groups such as RUF  Denmark  and TriTrack  USA  are working on projects consisting of specialized private cars that are driven manually on normal roads but also that dock onto a monorail guideway along which they are driven autonomously 
As a method of automating cars without extensively modifying the cars as much as a robotic car  Automated highway systems  AHS  aims to construct lanes on highways that would be equipped with  for example  magnets to guide the vehicles  Automation vehicles have auto brakes named as Auto Vehicles Braking System  AVBS   Highway computers would manage the traffic and direct the cars to avoid crashes 
In       The European Commission has established a smart car development program called the Intelligent Car Flagship Initiative              The goals of that program include 

Adaptive cruise control
Lane departure warning system
Project AWAKE for drowsy drivers
There are further uses for automation in relation to cars  These include 

Assured Clear Distance Ahead
Adaptive headlamps
Advanced Automatic Collision Notification  such as OnStar
Intelligent Parking Assist System

Distance control assist   as developed by Nissan            
Dead man s switch   there is a move to introduce deadman s braking into automotive application  primarily heavy vehicles  and there may also be a need to add penalty switches to cruise controls 
Singapore also announced a set of provisional national standards on January           to guide the autonomous vehicle industry  The standards  known as Technical Reference     TR     will promote the safe deployment of fully driverless vehicles in Singapore  according to a joint press release by Enterprise Singapore  ESG   Land Transport Authority  LTA   Standards Development Organisation and Singapore Standards Council  SSC              

Shuttle edit 
Parkshuttle
Navya Autonom Shuttle
Easymile EZ  
King Long Apolong
Since       the    seat    standing ParkShuttle has been operating on an     kilometres           mi  exclusive right of way in the city of Capelle aan den IJssel in The Netherlands  The system uses small magnets in the road surface to allow the vehicle to determine its position  The use of shared autonomous vehicles was trialed around      in a hospital car park in Portugal              From      to       the European Union funded CityMobil  project examined the use of shared autonomous vehicles and passenger experience including short term trials in seven cities  This project led to the development of the EasyMile EZ               
In the     s  self driving shuttle became able to run in mixed traffic without the need for embedded guidance markers              So far the focus has been on low speed     miles per hour          km h   with short  fixed routes for the  last mile  of journeys  This means issues of collision avoidance and safety are significantly less challenging than those for automated cars  which seek to match the performance of conventional vehicles  Many trials have been undertaken  mainly on quiet roads with little traffic or on public pathways or private roadways and specialised test sites      citation needed      The capacity of different models varies significantly  between   seats and    seats   Above this size there are conventional buses that have driverless technology installed  
In December       the Jacksonville Transportation Authority has announced its intention to replace the Jacksonville Skyway monorail with driverless vehicles that would run on the existing elevated superstructure as well as continue onto ordinary roads              The project has since been named the  Ultimate Urban Circulator  or  U C  and testing has been carried out on shuttles from six different manufacturers  The cost of the project is estimated at      million             
In January       it was announced the ParkShuttle system in the Netherlands will be renewed and expanded including extending the route network beyond the exclusive right of way so vehicles will run in mixed traffic on ordinary roads              The plans were delayed and the extension into mixed traffic was expected in                  
In July       Baidu stated it had built     of its   seat Apolong model  with plans for commercial sales              As of July       they had not gone into volume production 
In August       it was reported there were    autonomous shuttle manufacturers              including the  GetThere  Local Motors  Navya  Baidu  Easymile  Toyota and Ohmio 
In December       Toyota showcased its    passenger  e Palette  vehicle  which is due to be used at the      Tokyo Olympic Games              Toyota announced it intends to have the vehicle available for commercial applications before                  
In January       Navya released an investor report which predicted global autonomous shuttle sales will reach        units by       with a market value of EUR     billion             
In June       Chinese maker Yutong claimed to have delivered     models of its    seat Xiaoyu     autonomous bus for use in Zhengzhou  Testing has been carried out in a number of cities since      with trials open to the public planned for July                  
Self driving shuttles are already in use on some private roads  such as at the Yutong factory in Zhengzhou where they are used to transport workers between buildings of the world s largest bus factory             

Trials edit 
A large number of trials have been conducted since       with most involving only one vehicle on a short route for a short period of time and with an onboard conductor  The purpose of the trials has been to both provide technical data and to familiarize the public with the driverless technology  A      survey of over     shuttle experiments across Europe concluded that low speed         kilometres per hour                mph    was the major barrier to implementation of autonomous shuttle buses  The current cost of the vehicles at          and the need for onboard attendants were also issues

Buses edit 
The United Kingdom s first autonomous bus  currently on trial with Stagecoach Manchester
Autonomous buses are proposed as well as self driving cars and trucks  Grade   level automated minibuses were trialed for a few weeks in Stockholm                            China has a small fleet of self driving public buses in the tech district of Shenzhen  Guangdong              
The first autonomous bus trial in the United Kingdom commenced in mid       with an Alexander Dennis Enviro    MMC single decker bus modified with autonomous software from Fusion Processing able to operate in driverless mode within Stagecoach Manchester s Sharston bus depot  performing tasks such as driving to the washing station  refuelling point and then parking at a dedicated parking space in the depot               Passenger carrying driverless bus trials in Scotland commenced in January       with a fleet of five identical vehicles to the Manchester trial used on a    miles          km  Stagecoach Fife park and ride route across the Forth Road Bridge  from the north bank of the Forth to Edinburgh Park station                           
Another autonomous trial in Oxfordshire  England  which uses a battery electric Fiat Ducato minibus on a circular service to Milton Park  operated by FirstBus with support from Fusion Processing  Oxfordshire County Council and the University of the West of England  entered full passenger service also in January       The trial route is planned to be extended to Didcot Parkway railway station following the acquisition of a larger single decker by the end of                                
In July      in Japan  AIST Human Centered Mobility Research Center with Nippon Koei and Isuzu started a series of demonstration tests for mid sized buses  Isuzu  Erga Mio  with autonomous driving systems  in five areas   tsu city in Shiga prefecture  Sanda city in Hy go Prefecture and other three areas in sequence                                        
In October       Imagry  an Israeli AI startup  introduced its mapless autonomous driving solution at Busworld Europe  leveraging a real time image recognition system and a spatial deep convolutional neural network  DCNN  to mimic human driving behavior              

Trucks edit 
Further information  Self driving truck
The concept for autonomous vehicles has been applied for commercial uses  such as autonomous or nearly autonomous trucks 
Companies such as Suncor Energy  a Canadian energy company  and Rio Tinto Group were among the first to replace human operated trucks with driverless commercial trucks run by computers               In April       trucks from major manufacturers including Volvo and the Daimler Company completed a week of autonomous driving across Europe  organized by the Dutch  in an effort to get self driving trucks on the road  With developments in self driving trucks progressing  U S  self driving truck sales is expected to reach        by      according to a report released by IHS Incorporated in June                   
As reported in June      in Popular Science magazine  self driving trucks were being developed for combat convoys  whereby only the lead truck would be driven by a human and the following trucks would rely on satellite  an inertial guidance system and ground speed sensors               Caterpillar Incorporated made early developments in      with the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University to improve efficiency and reduce cost at various mining and construction sites              
In Europe  the Safe Road Trains for the Environment is such an approach 
From PWC s Strategy  amp  Report               self driving trucks will be the source of concern around how this technology will impact around   million truck drivers in the US  as well as   million employees in support of the trucking economy in gas stations  restaurants  bars and hotels  At the same time  some companies like Starsky  are aiming for Level   Autonomy  which would see the driver playing a control role around the truck s environment  The company s project  remote truck driving  would give truck drivers a greater work life balance  enabling them to avoid long periods away from their home  This would however provoke a potential mismatch between the driver s skills with the technological redefinition of the job 
Companies that buy driverless trucks could massively cut costs  human drivers would no longer be required  companies  liabilities due to truck accidents would diminish  and productivity would increase  as the driverless truck doesn t need to rest   The usage of self driving trucks will go hand in hand with the use of real time data to optimize both efficiency and productivity of the service delivered  as a way to tackle traffic congestion for example  Driverless trucks could enable new business models that would see deliveries shift from day time to night time or time slots in which traffic is less heavily dense

Several self balancing autonomous motorcycles were demonstrated in      and      from BMW  Honda and Yamaha                                        

This list is incomplete  you can help by adding missing items    June       



Company Location
Details


Honda motorcycle
Inspired by the Uni cub  Honda implemented a self balancing technology into their motorcycles  Due to the weight of motorcycles  it is often a challenge for motorcycle owners to keep balance of their vehicles at low speeds or at a stop  Honda s motorcycle concept has a self balancing feature that will keep the vehicle upright  It automatically lowers the center of balance by extending the wheelbase  It then takes control of the steering to keep the vehicle balanced  This allows users to navigate the vehicle more easily when walking or driving in stop and go traffic  However  this system is not for high speed driving                           


BMWs Motorrad Vision concept motorcycle
BMW Motorrad developed the ConnectRide self driving motorcycle in order to push the boundaries of motorcycle safety  The autonomous features of the motorcycle include emergency braking  negotiating intersections  assisting during tight turns  and front impact avoidance  These are features similar to current technologies that are being developed and implemented in autonomous cars  This motorcycle can also fully drive on its own at normal driving speed  making turns and returning to a designated location  It lacks the self standing feature that Honda has implemented              


Yamaha s riderless motorcycle
 Motoroid  can hold its balance  autonomously driving  recognizing riders and go to a designated location with a hand gesture  Yamaha used the  Human beings react a hell of a lot quicker  research philosophy into the motoroid  The idea is that the autonomous vehicle is not attempting to replace human beings  but to augment the abilities of the human with advanced technology  They have tactile feedback such as a gentle squeeze to a rider s lower back as a reassuring caress at dangerous speeds  as if the vehicle was responding and communicating with the rider  Their goal is to  meld  the machine and human together to form one experience              


Harley Davidson
While their motorcycles are popular  one of the largest problems of owning a Harley Davidson is the reliability of the vehicle  It is difficult to manage the weight of the vehicle at low speeds and picking it up from the ground can be a difficult process even with correct techniques  In order to attract more customers  they filed a patent for having a gyroscope at the back of the vehicle that will keep the balance of the motorcycle for the rider at low speeds  After   miles per hour  the system disengages  However anything below that  the gyroscope can handle the balance of the vehicle which means it can balance even at a stop  This system can be removed if the rider feels ready without it  meaning it is modular               

Trains edit 
Main article  Automatic train operation
The concept for autonomous vehicles has also been applied for commercial uses  like for autonomous trains  The world s first driverless urban transit system is the Port Island Line in Kobe  Japan  opened in                    The first self driving train in the UK was launched in London on the Thameslink route              
An example of an automated train network is the Docklands Light Railway in London

Trams edit 
In      the first autonomous trams in Potsdam were trialed              

Automated guided vehicle edit 
Main article  Automated guided vehicle
An automated guided vehicle or automatic guided vehicle  AGV  is a mobile robot that follows markers or wires in the floor  or uses vision  magnets  or lasers for navigation  They are most often used in industrial applications to move materials around a manufacturing facility or warehouse  Application of the automatic guided vehicle had broadened during the late   th century 

Aircraft edit 
Main article  Unmanned aerial vehicle
Aircraft have received much attention for automation  especially for navigation  A system capable of autonomously navigating a vehicle  especially aircraft  is known as autopilot 

Delivery drones edit 
Main article  Delivery drone
Various industries such as packages and food have experimented with delivery drones  Traditional and new transportation companies are competing in the market  For example  UPS Flight Forward  Alphabet Wing  and Amazon Prime Air are all developing delivery drones               Zipline  an American medical drone delivery company  has the largest active drone delivery operations in the world  and its drones are capable of Level   autonomy              
However  even if technology seems to allow for those solutions to function correctly as various tests of various companies show  the main throwback to the market launch and use of such drones is inevitably the legislation in place and regulatory agencies have to decide on the framework they wish to take to draft regulation  This process is in different phases across the world as each country will tackle the topic independently  For example  Iceland s government and departments of transport  aviation  police have already started issuing licenses for drone operations  It has a permissive approach and together with Costa Rica  Italy  the UAE  Sweden and Norway  has a fairly unrestricted legislation on commercial drone use  Those countries are characterized by a body of regulation that may give operational guidelines or require licensing  registration and insurance              
On the other side  other countries have decided to ban  either directly  outright ban  or indirectly  effective ban   the use of commercial drones  The RAND Corporation thus notes the difference between countries forbidding drones and those that have a formal process for commercial drone licensing  but requirements are either impossible to meet or licenses do not appear to have been approved  In the US  United Parcel Service is the only delivery service with the Part     Standard certification that is required to use drones to deliver to real customers              
However  most countries seem to be struggling on the integration of drones for commercial uses into their aviation regulatory frameworks  Thus  constraints are placed on the use of those drones such as that they must be operating within the visual line of sight  VLOS  of the pilot and thus limiting their potential range  This would be the case of the Netherlands and Belgium  Most countries let pilots operate outside the VLOS but is subject to restrictions and pilot ratings  which would be the case of the US 
The general trend is that legislation is moving fast and laws are constantly being reevaluated  Countries are moving towards a more permissive approach but the industry still lacks infrastructures to ensure the success of such a transition  To provide safety and efficiency  specialized training courses  pilot exams  type of UAV and flying conditions  as well as liability management measures regarding insurances may need to be developed 
There is a sense of urgency related to this innovation as competition is high and companies lobby to integrate them rapidly in their products and services offerings  Since June       the US Senate legislation reauthorized the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Transportation to create a carrier certificate allowing for package deliveries by drones              

Watercraft edit 
Main article  Unmanned surface vehicle
Autonomous boats can provide security  perform research  or conduct hazardous or repetitive tasks  such as guiding a large ship into a harbor or transporting cargo  

Sea Machines edit 
Sea Machines offers an autonomous system for workboats  While it requires a human operator to oversee its actions  the system takes care of many active domain perception and navigation duties that normally a few members of the crew would have to do  They use AI to have situational awareness for different ships within the route  They use camera  lidar  and proprietary software to inform the operator of its status                           

Buffalo Automation edit 
Buffalo Automation  a team formed from the University of Buffalo  creates technology for semi autonomous features for boats  They started by creating navigation assist technologies for freighters called AutoMate  which is like having another very experienced  first mate  that will look out for the ship               The system helps navigate difficult waterways                           

Autonomous Marine Systems edit 
This Massachusetts based company has led the forefront of unmanned sailing drones  The Datamarans are autonomously sailing to collect ocean data  They are created to enable large payload packages  Due to the automated system and their solar panels  they are able to navigate for longer periods of time  Their technologies on advanced metocean surveys  collect  wind velocity profiles with altitude  water current  conductivity  temperature profiles with depth  hi resolution bathymetry  sub bottom profiling   and  magnetometer measurements                            

Mayflower edit 
The autonomous vessel called Mayflower is expected to be the first large ship that makes an unmanned transatlantic journey              

Saildrones edit

Underwater vehicles have been a focus for automation for tasks such as pipeline inspection and underwater mapping 

Assistance robots edit 
Spot edit 
This four legged robot was created to be able to navigate through many different terrain outdoors and indoors  It can walk on its own without colliding into anything  It uses many different sensors  including     degree vision cameras and gyroscopes  It is able to keep its balance even when pushed over  This vehicle  while it is not intended to be ridden  can carry heavy loads for construction workers or military personnel through rough terrain              

Regulation edit 
See also  Regulation of self driving cars
The British Highway Code states that  

By self driving vehicles  we mean those listed as automated vehicles by the Secretary of State for Transport under the Automated and Electric Vehicles Act              The Highway Code               p   
The UK considers the way to update its British Highway Code for automated code 

Automated vehicles can perform all the tasks involved in driving  in at least some situations  They differ from vehicles fitted with assisted driving features  like cruise control and lane keeping assistance   which carry out some tasks  but where the driver is still responsible for driving  If you are driving a vehicle with assisted driving features  you MUST stay in control of the vehicle         proposed changes to The Highway Code             
If the vehicle is designed to require you to resume driving after being prompted to  while the vehicle is driving itself  you MUST remain in a position to be able to take control  For example  you should not move out of the driving seat  You should not be so distracted that you cannot take back control when prompted by the vehicle         proposed changes to The Highway Code             
Concerns edit 
Lack of control edit 
Through the autonomy level  it is shown that the higher the level of autonomy  the less control humans have on their vehicles  highest level of autonomy needing zero human interventions   One concerns regarding the development of vehicular automation is related to the end users  trust in the technology that controls automated vehicles               According to a nationally conducted survey made by Kelley Blue Book  KBB  in       it was shown that the majority of people would choose to have a certain level of control behind their own vehicle rather than having the vehicle operate in Level   autonomy  or in other words  complete autonomy               According to half of the respondents  the idea of safety in an autonomous vehicle diminishes as the level of autonomy increases               This distrust of autonomous driving systems proved to be unchanged throughout the years when a nationwide survey conducted by AAA Foundation for Traffic and Safety  AAAFTS  in      showed the same outcome as the survey KBB did in       AAAFTS survey showed that even though people have a certain level of trust in automated vehicles  most people also have doubts and distrust towards the technology used in autonomous vehicles  with most distrust in Level   autonomous vehicles               It is shown by AAAFTS  survey that people s trust in autonomous driving systems increased when their level of understanding increased              

Malfunctions edit 
A prototype of an autonomous Uber car being tested in San Francisco  California
The possibility of autonomous vehicle s technology to experience malfunctions is also one of the causes of user s distrust in autonomous driving systems               It is the concern that most respondents voted for in the AAAFTS survey               Even though autonomous vehicles are made to improve traffic safety by minimizing crashes and their severity               they still caused fatalities  At least     autonomous vehicle related accidents have occurred until                    In       Google declared that their automated vehicles experienced at least     failures  and drivers had to intervene around    times to prevent fatalities               Furthermore  other automated vehicles  manufacturers also reported automated vehicles  failures  including the Uber car incident               A self driving Uber car accident in      is an example of autonomous vehicle accidents that are also listed among self driving car fatalities  A report made by the National Transportation Safety Board  NTSB  showed that the self driving Uber car was unable to identify the victim in a sufficient amount of time for the vehicle to slow down and avoid crashing into the victim              

Ethical edit 
Another concern related to vehicle automation is its ethical issues  In reality  autonomous vehicles can encounter inevitable traffic accidents  In such situations  many risks and calculations need to be made in order to minimize the amount of damage the accident could cause               When a human driver encounters an inevitable accident  the driver will take a spontaneous action based on ethical and moral logic  However  when a driver has no control over the vehicle  Level   autonomy   the system of an autonomous vehicle needs to make that quick decision               Unlike humans  autonomous vehicles can only make decisions based on what it is programmed to do               However  the situation and circumstances of accidents differ from one another  and any one decision might not be the best decision for certain accidents  Based on two research studies in                                 the implementation of fully automated vehicles in traffic where semi automated and non automated vehicles are still present might lead to complications               Some flaws that still need consideration include the structure of liability  distribution of responsibilities               efficiency in decision making  and the performance of autonomous vehicles with its diverse surroundings               Still  researchers Steven Umbrello and Roman V  Yampolskiy propose that the value sensitive design approach is one method that can be used to design autonomous vehicles to avoid some of these ethical issues and design for human values
