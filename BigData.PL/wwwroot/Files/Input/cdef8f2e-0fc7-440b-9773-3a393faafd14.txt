Methods for developing expert systems
This article is about methods for developing expert systems  For application of knowledge based technology to the domain of manufacturing and CAD  see Knowledge based engineering 
Knowledge engineering  KE  refers to all aspects involved in knowledge based systems 


Background edit 
Expert systems edit 
One of the first examples of an expert system was MYCIN  an application to perform medical diagnosis  In the MYCIN example  the domain experts were medical doctors and the knowledge represented was their expertise in diagnosis 
Expert systems were first developed in artificial intelligence laboratories as an attempt to understand complex human decision making  Based on positive results from these initial prototypes  the technology was adopted by the US business community  and later worldwide  in the     s  The Stanford heuristic programming project led by Edward Feigenbaum was one of the leaders in defining and developing the first expert systems 

History edit 
In the earliest days of expert systems  there was little or no formal process for the creation of the software  Researchers just sat down with domain experts and started programming  often developing the required tools  e g  inference engines  at the same time as the applications themselves  As expert systems moved from academic prototypes to deployed business systems it was realized that a methodology was required to bring predictability and control to the process of building the software  There were essentially two approaches that were attempted 

Use conventional software development methodologies
Develop special methodologies tuned to the requirements of building expert systems
Many of the early expert systems were developed by large consulting and system integration firms such as Andersen Consulting  These firms already had well tested conventional waterfall methodologies  e g  Method   for Andersen  that they trained all their staff in and that were virtually always used to develop software for their clients  One trend in early expert systems development was to simply apply these waterfall methods to expert systems development 
Another issue with using conventional methods to develop expert systems was that due to the unprecedented nature of expert systems  they were one of the first applications to adopt rapid application development methods that feature iteration and prototyping as well as or instead of detailed analysis and design  In the     s few conventional software methods supported this type of approach 
The final issue with using conventional methods to develop expert systems was the need for knowledge acquisition  Knowledge acquisition refers to the process of gathering expert knowledge and capturing it in the form of rules and ontologies  Knowledge acquisition has special requirements beyond the conventional specification process used to capture most business requirements 
These issues led to the second approach to knowledge engineering  the development of custom methodologies specifically designed to build expert systems             One of the first and most popular of such methodologies custom designed for expert systems was the Knowledge Acquisition and Documentation Structuring  KADS  methodology developed in Europe  KADS had great success in Europe and was also used in the United States
