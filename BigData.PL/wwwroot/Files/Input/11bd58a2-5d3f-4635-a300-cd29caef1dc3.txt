Ant behavior was the inspiration for the metaheuristic optimization technique
When a colony of ants is confronted with the choice of reaching their food via two different routes of which one is much shorter than the other  their choice is entirely random  However  those who use the shorter route reach the food faster and therefore go back and forth more often between the anthill and the food            
In computer science and operations research  the ant colony optimization algorithm  ACO  is a probabilistic technique for solving computational problems that can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs  Artificial ants represent multi agent methods inspired by the behavior of real ants 
The pheromone based communication of biological ants is often the predominant paradigm used             Combinations of artificial ants and local search algorithms have become a preferred method for numerous optimization tasks involving some sort of graph  e g   vehicle routing and internet routing 
As an example  ant colony optimization            is a class of optimization algorithms modeled on the actions of an ant colony             Artificial  ants   e g  simulation agents  locate optimal solutions by moving through a parameter space representing all possible solutions  Real ants lay down pheromones to direct each other to resources while exploring their environment   The simulated  ants  similarly record their positions and the quality of their solutions  so that in later simulation iterations more ants locate better solutions              One variation on this approach is the bees algorithm  which is more analogous to the foraging patterns of the honey bee  another social insect 
This algorithm is a member of the ant colony algorithms family  in swarm intelligence methods  and it constitutes some metaheuristic optimizations  Initially proposed by Marco Dorigo in      in his PhD thesis                        the first algorithm was aiming to search for an optimal path in a graph  based on the behavior of ants seeking a path between their colony and a source of food  The original idea has since diversified to solve a wider class of numerical problems  and as a result  several problems have emerged  drawing on various aspects of the behavior of ants  From a broader perspective  ACO performs a model based search            and shares some similarities with estimation of distribution algorithms 


Overview edit 
In the natural world  ants of some species  initially  wander randomly   and upon finding food return to their colony while laying down pheromone trails  If other ants find such a path  they are likely to stop travelling at random and instead follow the trail  returning and reinforcing it if they eventually find food  see Ant communication             
Over time  however  the pheromone trail starts to evaporate  thus reducing its attractive strength  The more time it takes for an ant to travel down the path and back again  the more time the pheromones have to evaporate  A short path  by comparison  is marched over more frequently  and thus the pheromone density becomes higher on shorter paths than longer ones  Pheromone evaporation also has the advantage of avoiding the convergence to a locally optimal solution  If there were no evaporation at all  the paths chosen by the first ants would tend to be excessively attractive to the following ones  In that case  the exploration of the solution space would be constrained  The influence of pheromone evaporation in real ant systems is unclear  but it is very important in artificial systems             
The overall result is that when one ant finds a good  i e   short  path from the colony to a food source  other ants are more likely to follow that path  and positive feedback eventually leads to many ants following a single path  The idea of the ant colony algorithm is to mimic this behavior with  simulated ants  walking around the graph representing the problem to be solved 

Ambient networks of intelligent objects edit 
New concepts are required since  intelligence  is no longer centralized but can be found throughout all minuscule objects  Anthropocentric concepts have been known to lead to the production of IT systems in which data processing  control units and calculating power are centralized  These centralized units have continually increased their performance and can be compared to the human brain  The model of the brain has become the ultimate vision of computers  Ambient networks of intelligent objects and  sooner or later  a new generation of information systems that are even more diffused and based on nanotechnology  will profoundly change this concept  Small devices that can be compared to insects do not  possess a high intelligence on their own  Indeed  their intelligence can be classed as fairly limited  It is  for example  impossible to integrate a high performance calculator with the power to solve any kind of mathematical problem into a biochip that is implanted into the human body or integrated in an intelligent tag designed to trace commercial articles  However  once those objects are interconnected they develop a form of intelligence that can be compared to a colony of ants or bees  In the case of certain problems  this type of intelligence can be superior to the reasoning of a centralized system similar to the brain             
Nature offers several examples of how minuscule organisms  if they all follow the same basic rule  can create a form of collective intelligence on the macroscopic level  Colonies of social insects perfectly illustrate this model which greatly differs from human societies  This model is based on the cooperation of independent units with simple and unpredictable behavior              They move through their surrounding area to carry out certain tasks and only possess a very limited amount of information to do so  A colony of ants  for example  represents numerous qualities that can also be applied to a network of ambient objects  Colonies of ants have a very high capacity to adapt themselves to changes in the environment  as well as great strength in dealing with situations where one individual fails to carry out a given task  This kind of flexibility would also be very useful for mobile networks of objects which are perpetually developing  Parcels of information that move from a computer to a digital object behave in the same way as ants would do  They move through the network and pass from one node to the next with the objective of arriving at their final destination as quickly as possible             

Artificial pheromone system edit 
Pheromone based communication is one of the most effective ways of communication which is widely observed in nature  Pheromone is used by social insects such as
bees  ants and termites  both for inter agent and agent swarm communications  Due to its feasibility  artificial pheromones have been adopted in multi robot and swarm robotic systems  Pheromone based communication was implemented by different means such as chemical                                      or physical  RFID tags              light                                                  sound              ways  However  those implementations were not able to replicate all the aspects of pheromones as seen in nature 
Using projected light was presented in a      IEEE paper by Garnier  Simon  et al  as an experimental setup to study pheromone based communication with micro autonomous robots              Another study presented a system in which pheromones were implemented via a horizontal LCD screen on which the robots moved  with the robots having downward facing light sensors to register the patterns beneath them                         

Algorithm and formula edit 
In the ant colony optimization algorithms  an artificial ant is a simple computational agent that searches for good solutions to a given optimization problem  To apply an ant colony algorithm  the optimization problem needs to be converted into the problem of finding the shortest path on a weighted graph  In the first step of each iteration  each ant stochastically constructs a solution  i e  the order in which the edges in the graph should be followed  In the second step  the paths found by the different ants are compared   The last step consists of updating the pheromone levels on each edge

Edge selection edit 
Each ant needs to construct a solution to move through the graph   To select the next edge in its tour  an ant will consider the length of each edge available from its current position  as well as the corresponding pheromone level  At each step of the algorithm  each ant moves from a state

Pheromone update edit 
Trails are usually updated when all ants have completed their solution  increasing or decreasing the level of trails corresponding to moves that were part of  good  or  bad  solutions  respectively  An example of a global pheromone updating rule is now

Common extensions edit 
Here are some of the most popular variations of ACO algorithms 

Ant system  AS  edit 
The ant system is the first ACO algorithm  This algorithm corresponds to the one presented above  It was developed by Dorigo             

Ant colony system  ACS  edit 
In the ant colony system algorithm  the original ant system was modified in three aspects 

The edge selection is biased towards exploitation  i e  favoring the probability of selecting the shortest edges with a large amount of pheromone  
While building a solution  ants change the pheromone level of the edges they are selecting by applying a local pheromone updating rule 
At the end of each iteration  only the best ant is allowed to update the trails by applying a modified global pheromone updating rule             
Elitist ant system edit 
In this algorithm  the global best solution deposits pheromone on its trail after every iteration  even if this trail has not been revisited   along with all the other ants  The elitist strategy has as its objective directing the search of all ants to construct a solution to contain links of the current best route 

Max min ant system  MMAS  edit 
This algorithm controls the maximum and minimum pheromone amounts on each trail  Only the global best tour or the iteration best tour are allowed to add pheromone to its trail  To avoid stagnation of the search algorithm  the range of possible pheromone amounts on each trail is limited to an interval   max  min   All edges are initialized to  max to force a higher exploration of solutions   The trails are reinitialized to  max when nearing stagnation             

Rank based ant system  ASrank  edit 
All solutions are ranked according to their length  Only a fixed number of the best ants in this iteration are allowed to update their trials  The amount of pheromone deposited is weighted for each solution  such that solutions with shorter paths deposit more pheromone than the solutions with longer paths 

Parallel ant colony optimization  PACO  edit 
An ant colony system  ACS  with communication strategies is developed  The artificial ants are partitioned into several groups  Seven communication
methods for updating the pheromone level between groups in ACS are proposed and work on the traveling salesman problem 
            

Continuous orthogonal ant colony  COAC  edit 
The pheromone deposit mechanism of COAC is to enable ants to search for solutions collaboratively and effectively  By using an orthogonal design method  ants in the feasible domain can explore their chosen regions rapidly and efficiently  with enhanced global search capability and accuracy  The orthogonal design method and the adaptive radius adjustment method can also be extended to other optimization algorithms for delivering wider advantages in solving practical problems             

Recursive ant colony optimization edit 
It is a recursive form of ant system which divides the whole search domain into several sub domains and solves the objective on these subdomains              The results from all the subdomains are compared and the best few of them are promoted for the next level  The subdomains corresponding to the selected results are further subdivided and the process is repeated until an output of desired precision is obtained  This method has been tested on ill posed geophysical inversion problems and works well             

Convergence edit 
For some versions of the algorithm  it is possible to prove that it is convergent  i e   it is able to find the global optimum in finite time   The first evidence of convergence for an ant colony algorithm was made in       the graph based ant system algorithm  and later on for the ACS and MMAS algorithms  Like most metaheuristics  it is very difficult to estimate the theoretical speed of convergence  A performance analysis of a continuous ant colony algorithm with respect to its various parameters  edge selection strategy  distance measure metric  and pheromone evaporation rate  showed that its performance and rate of convergence are sensitive to the chosen parameter values  and especially to the value of the pheromone evaporation rate              In       Zlochin and his colleagues            showed that ACO type algorithms are closely related to  stochastic gradient descent  Cross entropy method and estimation of distribution algorithm  They proposed an umbrella term  Model based search  to describe this class of metaheuristics 

Applications edit 
Knapsack problem  The ants prefer the smaller drop of honey over the more abundant  but less nutritious  sugar
Ant colony optimization algorithms have been applied to many combinatorial optimization problems  ranging from quadratic assignment to protein folding or routing vehicles and a lot of derived methods have been adapted to dynamic problems in real variables  stochastic problems  multi targets and parallel implementations 
It has also been used to produce near optimal solutions to the travelling salesman problem  They have an advantage over simulated annealing and genetic algorithm approaches of similar problems when the graph may change dynamically  the ant colony algorithm can be run continuously and adapt to changes in real time  This is of interest in network routing and urban transportation systems 
The first ACO algorithm was called the ant system             and it was aimed to solve the travelling salesman problem  in which the goal is to find the shortest round trip to link a series of cities  The general algorithm is relatively simple and based on a set of ants  each making one of the possible round trips along the cities  At each stage  the ant chooses to move from one city to another according to some rules 

Visualization of the ant colony algorithm applied to the travelling salesman problem  The green lines are the paths chosen by each ant  The blue lines are the paths it may take at each point  When the ant finishes  the pheromone levels are represented in red 
It must visit each city exactly once 
A distant city has less chance of being chosen  the visibility  
The more intense the pheromone trail laid out on an edge between two cities  the greater the probability that that edge will be chosen 
Having completed its journey  the ant deposits more pheromones on all edges it traversed  if the journey is short 
After each iteration  trails of pheromones evaporate

Image processing edit 
The ACO algorithm is used in image processing for image edge detection and edge linking                         

Edge detection 
The graph here is the   D image and the ants traverse from one pixel depositing pheromone  The movement of ants from one pixel to another is directed by the local variation of the image s intensity values  This movement causes the highest density of the pheromone to be deposited at the edges 
The following are the steps involved in edge detection using ACO

Definition difficulty edit 

With an ACO algorithm  the shortest path in a graph  between two points A and B  is built from a combination of several paths               It is not easy to give a precise definition of what algorithm is or is not an ant colony  because the definition may vary according to the authors and uses  Broadly speaking  ant colony algorithms are regarded as populated metaheuristics with each solution represented by an ant moving in the search space               Ants mark the best solutions and take account of previous markings to optimize their search  They can be seen as probabilistic multi agent algorithms using a probability distribution to make the transition between each iteration               In their versions for combinatorial problems  they use an iterative construction of solutions               According to some authors  the thing which distinguishes ACO algorithms from other relatives  such as algorithms to estimate the distribution or particle swarm optimization  is precisely their constructive aspect  In combinatorial problems  it is possible that the best solution eventually be found  even though no ant would prove effective  Thus  in the example of the travelling salesman problem  it is not necessary that an ant actually travels the shortest route  the shortest route can be built from the strongest segments of the best solutions  However  this definition can be problematic in the case of problems in real variables  where no structure of  neighbours  exists  The collective behaviour of social insects remains a source of inspiration for researchers  The wide variety of algorithms  for optimization or not  seeking self organization in biological systems has led to the concept of  swarm intelligence               which is a very general framework in which ant colony algorithms fit 

Stigmergy algorithms edit 
There is in practice a large number of algorithms claiming to be  ant colonies   without always sharing the general framework of optimization by canonical ant colonies               In practice  the use of an exchange of information between ants via the environment  a principle called  stigmergy   is deemed enough for an algorithm to belong to the class of ant colony algorithms  This principle has led some authors to create the term  value  to organize methods and behavior based on search of food  sorting larvae  division of labour and cooperative transportation

Genetic algorithms  GA 
These maintain a pool of solutions rather than just one  The process of finding superior solutions mimics that of evolution  with solutions being combined or mutated to alter the pool of solutions  with solutions of inferior quality being discarded 
Estimation of distribution algorithm  EDA 
An evolutionary algorithm that substitutes traditional reproduction operators by model guided operators  Such models are learned from the population by employing machine learning techniques and represented as probabilistic graphical models  from which new solutions can be sampled                           or generated from guided crossover                           
Simulated annealing  SA 
A related global optimization technique which traverses the search space by generating neighboring solutions of the current solution  A superior neighbor is always accepted  An inferior neighbor is accepted probabilistically based on the difference in quality and a temperature parameter  The temperature parameter is modified as the algorithm progresses to alter the nature of the search 
Reactive search optimization
Focuses on combining machine learning with optimization  by adding an internal feedback loop to self tune the free parameters of an algorithm to the characteristics of the problem  of the instance  and of the local situation around the current solution 
Tabu search  TS 
Similar to simulated annealing in that both traverse the solution space by testing mutations of an individual solution  While simulated annealing generates only one mutated solution  tabu search generates many mutated solutions and moves to the solution with the lowest fitness of those generated  To prevent cycling and encourage greater movement through the solution space  a tabu list is maintained of partial or complete solutions  It is forbidden to move to a solution that contains elements of the tabu list  which is updated as the solution traverses the solution space
