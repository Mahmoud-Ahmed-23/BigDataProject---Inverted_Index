Logical consequence  also entailment or logical implication  is a fundamental concept in logic which describes the relationship between statements that hold true when one statement logically follows from one or more statements  A valid logical argument is one in which the conclusion is entailed by the premises  because the conclusion is the consequence of the premises  The philosophical analysis of logical consequence involves the questions  In what sense does a conclusion follow from its premises  and What does it mean for a conclusion to be a consequence of premises             All of philosophical logic is meant to provide accounts of the nature of logical consequence and the nature of logical truth            
Logical consequence is necessary and formal  by way of examples that explain with formal proof and models of interpretation             A sentence is said to be a logical consequence of a set of sentences  for a given language  if and only if  using only logic  i e   without regard to any personal interpretations of the sentences  the sentence must be true if every sentence in the set is true            
Logicians make precise accounts of logical consequence regarding a given language 
  
    
      
        
          
            L
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle   mathcal  L   
  
  either by constructing a deductive system for 
  
    
      
        
          
            L
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle   mathcal  L   
  
 or by formal intended semantics for language 
  
    
      
        
          
            L
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle   mathcal  L   
  
  The Polish logician Alfred Tarski identified three features of an adequate characterization of entailment      The logical consequence relation relies on the logical form of the sentences      The relation is a priori  i e   it can be determined with or without regard to empirical evidence  sense experience   and     The logical consequence relation has a modal component            


Formal accounts edit 
The most widely prevailing view on how best to account for logical consequence is to appeal to formality  This is to say that whether statements follow from one another logically depends on the structure or logical form of the statements without regard to the contents of that form 
Syntactic accounts of logical consequence rely on schemes using inference rules  For instance  we can express the logical form of a valid argument as 

All X are Y
All Y are Z
Therefore  all X are Z 
This argument is formally valid  because every instance of arguments constructed using this scheme is valid 
This is in contrast to an argument like  Fred is Mike s brother s son  Therefore Fred is Mike s nephew   Since this argument depends on the meanings of the words  brother    son   and  nephew   the statement  Fred is Mike s nephew  is a so called material consequence of  Fred is Mike s brother s son   not a formal consequence  A formal consequence must be true in all cases  however this is an incomplete definition of formal consequence  since even the argument  P is Q     s brother s son  therefore P is Q     s nephew  is valid in all cases  but is not a formal argument            

A priori property of logical consequence edit 
If it is known that 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle Q 
  
 follows logically from 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
  then no information about the possible interpretations of 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 or 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle Q 
  
 will affect that knowledge  Our knowledge that 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
      displaystyle Q 
  
 is a logical consequence of 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
      displaystyle P 
  
 cannot be influenced by empirical knowledge             Deductively valid arguments can be known to be so without recourse to experience  so they must be knowable a priori             However  formality alone does not guarantee that logical consequence is not influenced by empirical knowledge  So the a priori property of logical consequence is considered to be independent of formality            

Proofs and models edit 
The two prevailing techniques for providing accounts of logical consequence involve expressing the concept in terms of proofs and via models  The study of the syntactic consequence  of a logic  is called  its  proof theory whereas the study of  its  semantic consequence is called  its  model theory

 true is a subset of the set of the interpretations that make 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
      displaystyle A 
  
 true 

Modal accounts edit 
Modal accounts of logical consequence are variations on the following basic idea 


  
    
      
          x    
      
    
      displaystyle  Gamma  
  
 
  
    
      
          x  a  
      
    
      displaystyle  vdash  
  
 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
      displaystyle A 
  
 is true if and only if it is necessary that if all of the elements of 
  
    
      
          x    
      
    
      displaystyle  Gamma  
  
 are true  then 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
      displaystyle A 
  
 is true 
Alternatively  and  most would say  equivalently  


  
    
      
          x    
      
    
      displaystyle  Gamma  
  
 
  
    
      
          x  a  
      
    
      displaystyle  vdash  
  
 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
      displaystyle A 
  
 is true if and only if it is impossible for all of the elements of 
  
    
      
          x    
      
    
      displaystyle  Gamma  
  
 to be true and 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
      displaystyle A 
  
 false 
Such accounts are called  modal  because they appeal to the modal notions of logical necessity and logical possibility   It is necessary that  is often expressed as a universal quantifier over possible worlds  so that the accounts above translate as 


  
    
      
          x    
      
    
      displaystyle  Gamma  
  
 
  
    
      
          x  a  
      
    
      displaystyle  vdash  
  
 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
      displaystyle A 
  
 is true if and only if there is no possible world at which all of the elements of 
  
    
      
          x    
      
    
      displaystyle  Gamma  
  
 are true and 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
      displaystyle A 
  
 is false  untrue  
Consider the modal account in terms of the argument given as an example above 

All frogs are green 
Kermit is a frog 
Therefore  Kermit is green 
The conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises because we can not imagine a possible world where  a  all frogs are green   b  Kermit is a frog  and  c  Kermit is not green 

Modal formal accounts edit 
Modal formal accounts of logical consequence combine the modal and formal accounts above  yielding variations on the following basic idea 


  
    
      
          x    
      
    
      displaystyle  Gamma  
  
 
  
    
      
          x  a  
      
    
      displaystyle  vdash  
  
 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
      displaystyle A 
  
 if and only if it is impossible for an argument with the same logical form as 
  
    
      
          x    
      
    
      displaystyle  Gamma  
  
 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
      displaystyle A 
  
 to have true premises and a false conclusion 
Warrant based accounts edit 
The accounts considered above are all  truth preservational   in that they all assume that the characteristic feature of a good inference is that it never allows one to move from true premises to an untrue conclusion  As an alternative  some have proposed  warrant preservational  accounts  according to which the characteristic feature of a good inference is that it never allows one to move from justifiably assertible premises to a conclusion that is not justifiably assertible  This is  roughly  the account favored by intuitionists 

Non monotonic logical consequence edit 
See also  Non monotonic logic and Belief revision        Non monotonic inference relation
The accounts discussed above all yield monotonic consequence relations  i e  ones such that if 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
      displaystyle A 
  
 is a consequence of 
  
    
      
          x    
      
    
      displaystyle  Gamma  
  
  then 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
      displaystyle A 
  
 is a consequence of any superset of 
  
    
      
          x    
      
    
      displaystyle  Gamma  
  
  It is also possible to specify non monotonic consequence relations to capture the idea that  e g    Tweety can fly  is a logical consequence of

 Birds can typically fly  Tweety is a bird 
but not of

 Birds can typically fly  Tweety is a bird  Tweety is a penguin
