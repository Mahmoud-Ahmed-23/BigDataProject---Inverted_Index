							In a bid to attract more Chinese tourists into the country  Cambodia is accepting payments in yuan  But many Cambodians oppose the measure  saying the government should promote the use of its own currency instead 
Cambodia       s government aims to more than double the number of Chinese tourists visiting the country by       China is currently the second largest source of tourists to Cambodia after Vietnam  with nearly         Chinese visitors traveling to the country in       according to Cambodia       s Ministry of Tourism 
Although the number has been growing rapidly in recent years  the government wants to boost the arrivals further  to reach about   million Chinese tourists per year by       To that end  it is encouraging the use of the Chinese currency  the yuan or the renminbi  RMB   within Cambodia 
       With this decision  Chinese tourists in Cambodia will be spared the hassle of having to go to money exchangers to convert their currency into either the US dollars or the riel         Tith Chantha  a secretary of state at the tourism ministry  told DW 
The official noted that the government has also been implementing other measures to make it easier for Chinese nationals to visit the Southeast Asian country         We are taking a host of steps such as simplifying the visa process for Chinese citizens and increasing the usage of Chinese language at tourist sites         Chantha said 
A close relationship
Cambodia       s tourism sector already relies heavily on visitors from China  with many hotels and casinos catering to predominantly Chinese tourists 
       More businesses may decide to accept payments in RMB if that makes them more profitable  but the concerns about exchange rate fluctuation and counterfeiting are likely to limit this         Joseph Lovell of the American Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia  told the Reuters news agency  Lovell said that if Chinese tourists knew they could readily use RMB in Cambodia  it might encourage more visits 
Moreover  Phnom Penh has been one of Beijing       s closest allies in the region in recent years  Both countries also share a deep economic engagement  with China emerging as a major source of foreign investment and aid for Cambodia 
Trade volume between the two countries stood at around      billion in       an    percent increase year on year  And both sides aim to raise it to about    billion by      
And the latest move to accept yuan payments is seen by many as part of the efforts by Prime Minister Hun Sen       s government to deepen Cambodia       s partnership with China 
Still  many in Cambodia view the decision with concern  particularly given that the country       s economy is already heavily dollarized 
The dollarization
It is estimated that the US dollar accounts for some    percent of total transactions and over    percent of banking deposits in Cambodia  While the widespread use of the dollar has made the country an attractive destination for foreign investment  it has also meant a loss of monetary independence  which leaves the country more vulnerable to swings in the global economy 
Its central bank therefore encouraged Cambodians last year to use the riel  As part of the strategy  it wanted to organize public education and marketing campaigns to raise awareness about the benefits of using the local currency 
Against this backdrop  many are surprised by the government       s recent decision to encourage use of the yuan and fear a negative effect on the central bank       s riel drive 
       Although the decision will bolster bilateral trade relations  it will negatively affect the efforts of Cambodia       s central bank to increase the usage of the riel in domestic transactions         Chan Sophal  the spokesman for the Cambodian Economic Association  CEA   told DW 
An unnecessary move 
The announcement on the yuan also drew a negative reaction on social media  with some accusing the government of sufficiently promoting the riel 
This measure is not needed  Serey N  Hum wrote on Facebook         What the ministry should do is to promote our notes rather than others        currency notes  If our country provides firm security  good services  good environment  cleanliness   tourists will come         Serey said 
       It       s gonna be a strategy but it gonna ruin our currency as well  See  Thailand use Baht everywhere and how many tourists they get  Find other ways please         another Facebook user Leangheang Lim noted 
Leangheang was referring to the fact that Thailand allows only the use of its domestic currency for payments within the country  And still      million Chinese tourists visited Thailand in       ten times more than the number of those who traveled to Cambodia 
Analysts therefore believe the issue of currency doesn       t play a major role in terms of attracting more tourists into the country 
       Compared to other Southeast Asian countries  we       re still lagging when it comes to our infrastructure  services and transportation         underlined CEA spokesperson Sophal         The government has to pay more attention to these areas if it wants to achieve its goal of boosting the tourism sector on a large scale
