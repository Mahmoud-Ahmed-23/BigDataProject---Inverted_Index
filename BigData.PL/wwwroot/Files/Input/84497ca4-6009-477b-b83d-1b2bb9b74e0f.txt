This year       s edition of the festival has encountered significant challenges  particularly following the postponement of last year       s event  What are the key difficulties faced in this edition 

This year has presented numerous obstacles  especially as last year       s postponement heavily impacted Palestinian communities  We skillfully navigated logistical hurdles  reorganizing travel and accommodations while expertly coordinating with jurors and the International Federation of Film Producers Associations 
Now that the festival is in full swing  we have rebuilt from the ground up  establishing new juries and selecting outstanding films  Our objective is clear  to present an exceptional edition that showcases the industry       s resilience and underscores the critical importance of cultural dialogue

How have budget and financial circumstances created obstacles 

Regarding budget and financial circumstances  these challenges are a well known issue for film festivals worldwide  affecting cultural institutions everywhere  Conversations with colleagues and festival directors from various regions have highlighted that we all face similar hurdles  However  what distinguishes us is our proactive approach  we operate within a robust dual framework that effectively combines support from both public and private sectors  bolstered by sponsorships and governmental assistance 
This year  we have successfully regained our sponsors        trust  and government support continues to provide the essential resources necessary for the festival s success  I am proud to confirm that our financial situation is solid  The budget remains steady  and we have achieved remarkable operational efficiency  Our partners  many of whom are based in Egypt  demonstrate our unwavering commitment to fostering the local industry 
Noteworthy is our collaboration with        Fresh         a completely Egyptian company  in addition to returning partners like        Spiro Spathis        and Banque Misr  a significant contributor to Egyptian cinema known for establishing Studio Misr  Collaborations with EgyptAir and the Tourism Promotion Authority  as well as accommodating our guests at the Sofitel Hotel  further strengthen this year       s festival foundation 
These strategic partnerships have allowed us to launch the festival smoothly  despite various challenges  It s also important to emphasize that we have taken a strong stance by boycotting any company or entity listed on the boycott list  as our support for the Palestinian cause is a fundamental principle no obstacle will change that  The decision to defer last year       s festival was made as a sign of solidarity with the Palestinian people  and hosting this year       s event only strengthens our commitment to this cause  During my attendance at international festivals like Berlin and Venice  I noticed an emphasis on political issues such as the war in Ukraine  For us at the Cairo International Film Festival  it is equally important to bring attention to our own urgent matters  particularly the Palestinian and Lebanese causes  which we prioritize

How has the collaboration and collective effort of the festival       s leadership influenced its direction during these challenging times 

Collaboration and teamwork have been essential to the growth and success of the Cairo International Film Festival  particularly during these trying times  The festival occupies a prominent position within the global film industry  and upholding the high standards that have garnered us international acclaim remains a primary focus  Our dedication to excellence is not merely a guiding principle  it is fundamental to our mission  bringing our team together in pursuit of a common goal 
Throughout the years  I have cultivated a unique vision for the festival one that pushes boundaries and enhances the cultural landscape  Achieving this vision has demanded commitment  innovation  and  above all  collaboration  This year  with a newly formed team  I have observed an exceptional spirit of unity  This solidarity has enabled us to tackle and overcome the obstacles we have encountered  The collective strength and alignment within our team have not only ensured the festival       s continued success but have also positioned us for future accomplishments  Together  we are reinforcing our shared values and striving for an even more promising future for the Cairo International Film Festival

What do you consider to be the most notable features of this year       s edition 

This year       s program features a rich and impactful array of films  but what distinguishes it is our profound emphasis on the Palestinian cause  prominently showcased through Palestinian cinema  We recognize the transformative potential of art  particularly film  to shed light on the narratives and challenges faced by marginalized communities  Each film serves as a compelling reflection of the strength and dreams of its people  Additionally  we are placing a strong focus on Lebanese cinema  further amplifying voices from the region that deserve global recognition 
Our festival transcends mere film appreciation  it serves as a vital platform for meaningful conversations and solidarity  We are providing filmmakers from Palestine and Lebanon the chance to present their work to an international audience  enhancing their messages of hope  resistance  and resilience  At its heart  this year       s festival is dedicated to promoting universal human values of justice  peace  and freedom principles that cross borders and resonate profoundly with audiences around the world

What are the festival       s goals this year for enhancing support for emerging filmmakers  students  and professionals in the cinema industry 

Having served as the director of the Cairo International Film Festival from      to      and returning in       I am committed to nurturing young filmmakers and students  My own journey at the Film Institute highlighted the significance of accessible cinema  and I aim to create similar opportunities today  During my previous tenure  I arranged special screenings and provided discounted tickets to ensure that students could experience global cinema 
The festival acts as a conduit for cultural exchange  enabling young filmmakers and enthusiasts to delve into diverse narratives that often transcend mainstream offerings  This year  we are reinforcing our dedication by expanding the Cairo Industry Days and revitalizing the Cairo Industry Market  which has been inactive for several years  thereby transforming the festival into a more vibrant player in the global film arena 
Additionally  we are strengthening our ties to Egypt s cinematic heritage by restoring classic films  facilitated by our collaboration with the Holding Company for Cultural  amp  Cinematic Investment and The Egyptian Media Production City  This year  we have successfully restored ten iconic films and are in the process of restoring twelve more  complete with subtitles to enhance accessibility for international audiences  By emphasizing both the future and the historical aspects of cinema  the Cairo International Film Festival promotes global collaboration  supports emerging talent  and honors our rich cinematic legacy 
Â 

What objectives are driving the expansion of the festival       s screenings beyond the Opera House and Cairo Downtown 

Traditionally  our screenings have taken place at the Opera House in the center of Cairo  However  this year marks a significant shift as we venture into new residential areas on the outskirts of the city  including  th of October City and New Cairo  in collaboration with Vox Cinemas  This expansion is both exciting and essential  As Cairo continues to evolve  the central district is no longer the primary hub for many residents  particularly those in these emerging neighborhoods  By bringing the festival to these locations  we are welcoming a broader and more diverse audience that may have had limited access in the past  This initiative helps us eliminate geographical barriers and ensures that the enchantment of the Cairo International Film Festival reaches those eager to experience global cinema  Ultimately  our goal is to enhance inclusivity and provide a rich cultural experience for everyone  regardless of their location

Do you believe that the growing influence of both Arab and international media is important for revitalizing the festival       s global reputation 

The attention that the Cairo International Film Festival has received from both Arab and international media this year is truly impressive  We are witnessing extensive coverage from various Arab nations  complemented by a robust presence of international journalists  In addition to traditional media  we have enhanced our collaborations with prominent outlets such as Forbes USA  Variety  Screen Daily  and Film Verdict  Notable platforms like        Watch It        and        Shahid        have also expressed considerable interest  further broadening the festival       s visibility  I am excited about this surge in media engagement and anticipate its continued growth 
The Cairo International Film Festival is experiencing a significant resurgence  The hiatus we took last year allowed us to reflect and realign our goals  It feels like a rejuvenating new beginning  This year       s edition is poised not only to signify our return but also to help the festival reclaim its esteemed position on the global stage  I encourage audiences to participate in this thrilling edition  which features a diverse and engaging film lineup  important events  and opportunities to connect with filmmakers and stars  In       we achieved remarkable ticket sales  attracting over        attendees  This year  our goal is to exceed that figure and reach an even broader audience worldwide
