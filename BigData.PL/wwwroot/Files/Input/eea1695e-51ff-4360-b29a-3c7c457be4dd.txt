							Minister of Petroleum  Tarek El Molla  revealed that    bn in new investments will be injected in petroleum exploration and production during the current fiscal year          
El Molla said in a press statement on Saturday  that the turnout by major international companies in the ministry s oil and gas exploration bids represents a clear message of the confidence of foreign companies in Egypt s investment climate 
He added that the international bid of the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation for the year      for oil and gas exploration in    regions in the Gulf of Suez and Eastern and the Western Desert has been closed  and the bids are being evaluated to announce the winning companies 
Moreover  El Molla pointed out that preparations are underway to launch an international bid for oil and gas exploration in the Red Sea region for the first time at the end of this year  
A source in the oil and gas sector told Daily News Egypt that the Red Sea international bid will be under a new form of agreements Â  offering more incentives  such as  increasing the partner s share  reducing the expense recovery period  and setting the gas price after the commercial discovery  according to the size of the investments required for development  with the possibility of reviewing this price periodically 
Egypt currently pays       to foreign partners for every million BTU in most of its agreements  except for some areas of deep water in the Mediterranean
