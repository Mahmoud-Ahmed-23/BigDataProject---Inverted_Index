Statistics  from German  Statistik  orig   description of a state  a country              is the discipline that concerns the collection  organization  analysis  interpretation  and presentation of data             In applying statistics to a scientific  industrial  or social problem  it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied  Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as  all people living in a country  or  every atom composing a crystal   Statistics deals with every aspect of data  including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments            
When census data  comprising every member of the target population  cannot be collected  statisticians collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples  Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole  An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study  manipulating the system  and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements  In contrast  an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation 
Two main statistical methods are used in data analysis  descriptive statistics  which summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation  and inferential statistics  which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation  e g   observational errors  sampling variation              Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution  sample or population   central tendency  or location  seeks to characterize the distribution s central or typical value  while dispersion  or variability  characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other  Inferences made using mathematical statistics employ the framework of probability theory  which deals with the analysis of random phenomena 
A standard statistical procedure involves the collection of data leading to a test of the relationship between two statistical data sets  or a data set and synthetic data drawn from an idealized model  A hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets  an alternative to an idealized null hypothesis of no relationship between two data sets  Rejecting or disproving the null hypothesis is done using statistical tests that quantify the sense in which the null can be proven false  given the data that are used in the test  Working from a null hypothesis  two basic forms of error are recognized  Type I errors  null hypothesis is rejected when it is in fact true  giving a  false positive   and Type II errors  null hypothesis fails to be rejected when it is in fact false  giving a  false negative    Multiple problems have come to be associated with this framework  ranging from obtaining a sufficient sample size to specifying an adequate null hypothesis            
Statistical measurement processes are also prone to error in regards to the data that they generate  Many of these errors are classified as random  noise  or systematic  bias   but other types of errors  e g   blunder  such as when an analyst reports incorrect units  can also occur  The presence of missing data or censoring may result in biased estimates and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems 


Introduction edit 
Main article  Outline of statistics
 Statistics is both the science of uncertainty and the technology of extracting information from data     featured in the International Encyclopedia of Statistical Science            Statistics is the discipline that deals with data  facts and figures with which meaningful information is inferred  Data may represent a numerical value  in form of quantitative data  or a label  as with qualitative data  Data may be collected  presented and summarised  in one of two methods called descriptive statistics  Two elementary summaries of data  singularly called a statistic  are the mean and dispersion  Whereas inferential statistics interprets data from a population sample to induce statements and predictions about a population                                  
Statistics is regarded as a body of science            or a branch of mathematics             It is based on probability  a branch of mathematics that studies random events  Statistics is considered the science of uncertainty  This arises from the ways to cope with measurement and sampling error as well as dealing with uncertanties in modelling  Although probability and statistics was once paired together as a single subject  they are conceptually distinct from one another  The former is based on deducing answers to specific situations from a general theory of probability  meanwhile statistics induces statements about a population based on a data set  Statistics serves to bridge the gap between probability and applied mathematical fields                                    
Some consider statistics to be a distinct mathematical science rather than a branch of mathematics  While many scientific investigations make use of data  statistics is generally concerned with the use of data in the context of uncertainty and decision making in the face of uncertainty                          Statistics is indexed at     a subclass of probability theory and stochastic processes  in the Mathematics Subject Classification              Mathematical statistics is covered in the range         of subclass QA  science  gt  mathematics  in the Library of Congress Classification             
The word statistics ultimately comes from the Latin word Status  meaning  situation  or  condition  in society  which in late Latin adopted the meaning  state   Derived from this  political scientist Gottfried Achenwall  coined the German word statistik  a summary of how things stand   In       the term entered the English language through German and referred to the study of political arrangements  The term gained its modern meaning in the     s in John Sinclair s works                          In modern German  the term statistik is synonymous with mathematical statistics  The term statistic  in singular form  is used to describe a function that returns its value of the same name             

Statistical data edit 
Main article  Statistical data
Data collection edit 
Sampling edit 
When full census data cannot be collected  statisticians collect sample data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples  Statistics itself also provides tools for prediction and forecasting through statistical models 
To use a sample as a guide to an entire population  it is important that it truly represents the overall population  Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole  A major problem lies in determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative  Statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures  There are also methods of experimental design that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study  strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population 
Sampling theory is part of the mathematical discipline of probability theory  Probability is used in mathematical statistics to study the sampling distributions of sample statistics and  more generally  the properties of statistical procedures  The use of any statistical method is valid when the system or population under consideration satisfies the assumptions of the method  The difference in point of view between classic probability theory and sampling theory is  roughly  that probability theory starts from the given parameters of a total population to deduce probabilities that pertain to samples  Statistical inference  however  moves in the opposite direction inductively inferring from samples to the parameters of a larger or total population 

Experimental and observational studies edit 
A common goal for a statistical research project is to investigate causality  and in particular to draw a conclusion on the effect of changes in the values of predictors or independent variables on dependent variables  There are two major types of causal statistical studies  experimental studies and observational studies  In both types of studies  the effect of differences of an independent variable  or variables  on the behavior of the dependent variable are observed  The difference between the two types lies in how the study is actually conducted  Each can be very effective  An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study  manipulating the system  and then taking additional measurements with different levels using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements  In contrast  an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation  Instead  data are gathered and correlations between predictors and response are investigated  While the tools of data analysis work best on data from randomized studies  they are also applied to other kinds of data like natural experiments and observational studies             for which a statistician would use a modified  more structured estimation method  e g   difference in differences estimation and instrumental variables  among many others  that produce consistent estimators 

Experiments edit 
The basic steps of a statistical experiment are 

Planning the research  including finding the number of replicates of the study  using the following information   preliminary estimates regarding the size of treatment effects  alternative hypotheses  and the estimated experimental variability  Consideration of the selection of experimental subjects and the ethics of research is necessary  Statisticians recommend that experiments compare  at least  one new treatment with a standard treatment or control  to allow an unbiased estimate of the difference in treatment effects 
Design of experiments  using blocking to reduce the influence of confounding variables  and randomized assignment of treatments to subjects to allow unbiased estimates of treatment effects and experimental error  At this stage  the experimenters and statisticians write the experimental protocol that will guide the performance of the experiment and which specifies the primary analysis of the experimental data 
Performing the experiment following the experimental protocol and analyzing the data following the experimental protocol 
Further examining the data set in secondary analyses  to suggest new hypotheses for future study 
Documenting and presenting the results of the study 
Experiments on human behavior have special concerns  The famous Hawthorne study examined changes to the working environment at the Hawthorne plant of the Western Electric Company  The researchers were interested in determining whether increased illumination would increase the productivity of the assembly line workers  The researchers first measured the productivity in the plant  then modified the illumination in an area of the plant and checked if the changes in illumination affected productivity  It turned out that productivity indeed improved  under the experimental conditions   However  the study is heavily criticized today for errors in experimental procedures  specifically for the lack of a control group and blindness  The Hawthorne effect refers to finding that an outcome  in this case  worker productivity  changed due to observation itself  Those in the Hawthorne study became more productive not because the lighting was changed but because they were being observed             

Observational study edit 
An example of an observational study is one that explores the association between smoking and lung cancer  This type of study typically uses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest and then performs statistical analysis  In this case  the researchers would collect observations of both smokers and non smokers  perhaps through a cohort study  and then look for the number of cases of lung cancer in each group              A case control study is another type of observational study in which people with and without the outcome of interest  e g  lung cancer  are invited to participate and their exposure histories are collected 

Types of data edit 
Main articles  Statistical data type and Levels of measurement
Various attempts have been made to produce a taxonomy of levels of measurement  The psychophysicist Stanley Smith Stevens defined nominal  ordinal  interval  and ratio scales  Nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among values  and permit any one to one  injective  transformation  Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values  but have a meaningful order to those values  and permit any order preserving transformation  Interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined  but the zero value is arbitrary  as in the case with longitude and temperature measurements in Celsius or Fahrenheit   and permit any linear transformation  Ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined  and permit any rescaling transformation 
Because variables conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements cannot be reasonably measured numerically  sometimes they are grouped together as categorical variables  whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as quantitative variables  which can be either discrete or continuous  due to their numerical nature  Such distinctions can often be loosely correlated with data type in computer science  in that dichotomous categorical variables may be represented with the Boolean data type  polytomous categorical variables with arbitrarily assigned integers in the integral data type  and continuous variables with the real data type involving floating point arithmetic  But the mapping of computer science data types to statistical data types depends on which categorization of the latter is being implemented 
Other categorizations have been proposed  For example  Mosteller and Tukey                    distinguished grades  ranks  counted fractions  counts  amounts  and balances  Nelder                    described continuous counts  continuous ratios  count ratios  and categorical modes of data   See also  Chrisman                     van den Berg                     
The issue of whether or not it is appropriate to apply different kinds of statistical methods to data obtained from different kinds of measurement procedures is complicated by issues concerning the transformation of variables and the precise interpretation of research questions   The relationship between the data and what they describe merely reflects the fact that certain kinds of statistical statements may have truth values which are not invariant under some transformations  Whether or not a transformation is sensible to contemplate depends on the question one is trying to answer

Descriptive statistics edit 
Main article  Descriptive statistics
A descriptive statistic  in the count noun sense  is a summary statistic that quantitatively describes or summarizes features of a collection of information              while descriptive statistics in the mass noun sense is the process of using and analyzing those statistics  Descriptive statistics is distinguished from inferential statistics  or inductive statistics   in that descriptive statistics aims to summarize a sample  rather than use the data to learn about the population that the sample of data is thought to represent             

Inferential statistics edit 
Main article  Statistical inference
Statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution              Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a population  for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates   It is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population  Inferential statistics can be contrasted with descriptive statistics  Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data  and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population             

Terminology and theory of inferential statistics edit 
Statistics  estimators and pivotal quantities edit 
Consider independent identically distributed  IID  random variables with a given probability distribution  standard statistical inference and estimation theory defines a random sample as the random vector given by the column vector of these IID variables              The population being examined is described by a probability distribution that may have unknown parameters 
A statistic is a random variable that is a function of the random sample  but not a function of unknown parameters  The probability distribution of the statistic  though  may have unknown parameters  Consider now a function of the unknown parameter  an estimator is a statistic used to estimate such function  Commonly used estimators include sample mean  unbiased sample variance and sample covariance 
A random variable that is a function of the random sample and of the unknown parameter  but whose probability distribution does not depend on the unknown parameter is called a pivotal quantity or pivot  Widely used pivots include the z score  the chi square statistic and Student s t value 
Between two estimators of a given parameter  the one with lower mean squared error is said to be more efficient  Furthermore  an estimator is said to be unbiased if its expected value is equal to the true value of the unknown parameter being estimated  and asymptotically unbiased if its expected value converges at the limit to the true value of such parameter 
Other desirable properties for estimators include  UMVUE estimators that have the lowest variance for all possible values of the parameter to be estimated  this is usually an easier property to verify than efficiency  and consistent estimators which converges in probability to the true value of such parameter 
This still leaves the question of how to obtain estimators in a given situation and carry the computation  several methods have been proposed  the method of moments  the maximum likelihood method  the least squares method and the more recent method of estimating equations 

Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis edit 
Interpretation of statistical information can often involve the development of a null hypothesis which is usually  but not necessarily  that no relationship exists among variables or that no change occurred over time                         
The best illustration for a novice is the predicament encountered by a criminal trial  The null hypothesis  H   asserts that the defendant is innocent  whereas the alternative hypothesis  H   asserts that the defendant is guilty  The indictment comes because of suspicion of the guilt  The H   status quo  stands in opposition to H  and is maintained unless H  is supported by evidence  beyond a reasonable doubt   However   failure to reject H   in this case does not imply innocence  but merely that the evidence was insufficient to convict  So the jury does not necessarily accept H  but fails to reject H   While one can not  prove  a null hypothesis  one can test how close it is to being true with a power test  which tests for type II errors 
What statisticians call an alternative hypothesis is simply a hypothesis that contradicts the null hypothesis 

Error edit 
Working from a null hypothesis  two broad categories of error are recognized 

Type I errors where the null hypothesis is falsely rejected  giving a  false positive  
Type II errors where the null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual difference between populations is missed  giving a  false negative  
Standard deviation refers to the extent to which individual observations in a sample differ from a central value  such as the sample or population mean  while Standard error refers to an estimate of difference between sample mean and population mean 
A statistical error is the amount by which an observation differs from its expected value  A residual is the amount an observation differs from the value the estimator of the expected value assumes on a given sample  also called prediction  
Mean squared error is used for obtaining efficient estimators  a widely used class of estimators  Root mean square error is simply the square root of mean squared error 

A least squares fit  in red the points to be fitted  in blue the fitted line 
Many statistical methods seek to minimize the residual sum of squares  and these are called  methods of least squares  in contrast to Least absolute deviations  The latter gives equal weight to small and big errors  while the former gives more weight to large errors  Residual sum of squares is also differentiable  which provides a handy property for doing regression  Least squares applied to linear regression is called ordinary least squares method and least squares applied to nonlinear regression is called non linear least squares  Also in a linear regression model the non deterministic part of the model is called error term  disturbance or more simply noise  Both linear regression and non linear regression are addressed in polynomial least squares  which also describes the variance in a prediction of the dependent variable  y axis  as a function of the independent variable  x axis  and the deviations  errors  noise  disturbances  from the estimated  fitted  curve 
Measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error   Many of these errors are classified as random  noise  or systematic  bias   but other types of errors  e g   blunder  such as when an analyst reports incorrect units  can also be important  The presence of missing data or censoring may result in biased estimates and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems             

Interval estimation edit 
Main article  Interval estimation
Confidence intervals  the red line is true value for the mean in this example  the blue lines are random confidence intervals for     realizations 
Most studies only sample part of a population  so results do not fully represent the whole population  Any estimates obtained from the sample only approximate the population value  Confidence intervals allow statisticians to express how closely the sample estimate matches the true value in the whole population  Often they are expressed as     confidence intervals  Formally  a     confidence interval for a value is a range where  if the sampling and analysis were repeated under the same conditions  yielding a different dataset   the interval would include the true  population  value in     of all possible cases  This does not imply that the probability that the true value is in the confidence interval is      From the frequentist perspective  such a claim does not even make sense  as the true value is not a random variable   Either the true value is or is not within the given interval  However  it is true that  before any data are sampled and given a plan for how to construct the confidence interval  the probability is     that the yet to be calculated interval will cover the true value  at this point  the limits of the interval are yet to be observed random variables  One approach that does yield an interval that can be interpreted as having a given probability of containing the true value is to use a credible interval from Bayesian statistics  this approach depends on a different way of interpreting what is meant by  probability   that is as a Bayesian probability 
In principle confidence intervals can be symmetrical or asymmetrical  An interval can be asymmetrical because it works as lower or upper bound for a parameter  left sided interval or right sided interval   but it can also be asymmetrical because the two sided interval is built violating symmetry around the estimate  Sometimes the bounds for a confidence interval are reached asymptotically and these are used to approximate the true bounds 

Significance edit 
Main article  Statistical significance
Statistics rarely give a simple Yes No type answer to the question under analysis  Interpretation often comes down to the level of statistical significance applied to the numbers and often refers to the probability of a value accurately rejecting the null hypothesis  sometimes referred to as the p value  

In this graph the black line is probability distribution for the test statistic  the critical region is the set of values to the right of the observed data point  observed value of the test statistic  and the p value is represented by the green area 
The standard approach             is to test a null hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis  A critical region is the set of values of the estimator that leads to refuting the null hypothesis  The probability of type I error is therefore the probability that the estimator belongs to the critical region given that null hypothesis is true  statistical significance  and the probability of type II error is the probability that the estimator does not belong to the critical region given that the alternative hypothesis is true  The statistical power of a test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false 
Referring to statistical significance does not necessarily mean that the overall result is significant in real world terms  For example  in a large study of a drug it may be shown that the drug has a statistically significant but very small beneficial effect  such that the drug is unlikely to help the patient noticeably 
Although in principle the acceptable level of statistical significance may be subject to debate  the significance level is the largest p value that allows the test to reject the null hypothesis  This test is logically equivalent to saying that the p value is the probability  assuming the null hypothesis is true  of observing a result at least as extreme as the test statistic  Therefore  the smaller the significance level  the lower the probability of committing type I error 
Some problems are usually associated with this framework  See criticism of hypothesis testing  

A difference that is highly statistically significant can still be of no practical significance  but it is possible to properly formulate tests to account for this  One response involves going beyond reporting only the significance level to include the p value when reporting whether a hypothesis is rejected or accepted  The p value  however  does not indicate the size or importance of the observed effect and can also seem to exaggerate the importance of minor differences in large studies  A better and increasingly common approach is to report confidence intervals  Although these are produced from the same calculations as those of hypothesis tests or p values  they describe both the size of the effect and the uncertainty surrounding it 
Fallacy of the transposed conditional  aka prosecutor s fallacy  criticisms arise because the hypothesis testing approach forces one hypothesis  the null hypothesis  to be favored  since what is being evaluated is the probability of the observed result given the null hypothesis and not probability of the null hypothesis given the observed result  An alternative to this approach is offered by Bayesian inference  although it requires establishing a prior probability             
Rejecting the null hypothesis does not automatically prove the alternative hypothesis 
As everything in inferential statistics it relies on sample size  and therefore under fat tails p values may be seriously mis computed      clarification needed

Bayesian Statistics edit 
Main article  Bayesian Statistics
An alternative paradigm to the popular frequentist paradigm is to use Bayes  theorem to update the prior probability of the hypotheses in consideration based on the relative likelihood of the evidence gathered to obtain a posterior probability  Bayesian methods have been aided by the increase in available computing power to compute the posterior probability using numerical approximation techniques like Markov Chain Monte Carlo  
For statistically modelling purposes  Bayesian models tend to be hierarchical  for example  one could model each Youtube channel as having video views distributed as a normal distribution with channel dependent mean and variance

The concept of using likelihood ratio can also be prominently seen in medical diagnostic testing 

Exploratory data analysis edit 
Main article  Exploratory data analysis
Exploratory data analysis  EDA  is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics  often with visual methods  A statistical model can be used or not  but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task 

Mathematical statistics edit 
Main article  Mathematical statistics
Mathematical statistics is the application of mathematics to statistics  Mathematical techniques used for this include mathematical analysis  linear algebra  stochastic analysis  differential equations  and measure theoretic probability theory                        All statistical analyses make use of at least some mathematics  and mathematical statistics can therefore be regarded as a fundamental component of general statistics            

History edit 
Main articles  History of statistics and Founders of statistics
Bernoulli s Ars Conjectandi was the first work that dealt with probability theory as currently understood 
Formal discussions on inference date back to the mathematicians and cryptographers of the Islamic Golden Age between the  th and   th centuries  Al Khalil           wrote the Book of Cryptographic Messages  which contains one of the first uses of permutations and combinations  to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels              Al Kindi s Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages gave a detailed description of how to use frequency analysis to decipher encrypted messages  providing an early example of statistical inference for decoding  Ibn Adlan             later made an important contribution on the use of sample size in frequency analysis             
Although the term statistic was introduced by the Italian scholar Girolamo Ghilini in      with reference to a collection of facts and information about a state  it was the German Gottfried Achenwall in      who started using the term as a collection of quantitative information  in the modern use for this science                          The earliest writing containing statistics in Europe dates back to       with the publication of Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality by John Graunt              Early applications of statistical thinking revolved around the needs of states to base policy on demographic and economic data  hence its stat  etymology  The scope of the discipline of statistics broadened in the early   th century to include the collection and analysis of data in general  Today  statistics is widely employed in government  business  and natural and social sciences 

Carl Friedrich Gauss made major contributions to probabilistic methods leading to statistics 
The mathematical foundations of statistics developed from discussions concerning games of chance among mathematicians such as Gerolamo Cardano  Blaise Pascal  Pierre de Fermat  and Christiaan Huygens  Although the idea of probability was already examined in ancient and medieval law and philosophy  such as the work of Juan Caramuel   probability theory as a mathematical discipline only took shape at the very end of the   th century  particularly in Jacob Bernoulli s posthumous work Ars Conjectandi              This was the first book where the realm of games of chance and the realm of the probable  which concerned opinion  evidence  and argument  were combined and submitted to mathematical analysis              The method of least squares was first described by Adrien Marie Legendre in       though Carl Friedrich Gauss presumably made use of it a decade earlier in                  

Karl Pearson  a founder of mathematical statistics
The modern field of statistics emerged in the late   th and early   th century in three stages              The first wave  at the turn of the century  was led by the work of Francis Galton and Karl Pearson  who transformed statistics into a rigorous mathematical discipline used for analysis  not just in science  but in industry and politics as well  Galton s contributions included introducing the concepts of standard deviation  correlation  regression analysis and the application of these methods to the study of the variety of human characteristics height  weight and eyelash length among others              Pearson developed the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient  defined as a product moment              the method of moments for the fitting of distributions to samples and the Pearson distribution  among many other things              Galton and Pearson founded Biometrika as the first journal of mathematical statistics and biostatistics  then called biometry   and the latter founded the world s first university statistics department at University College London             
The second wave of the     s and   s was initiated by William Sealy Gosset  and reached its culmination in the insights of Ronald Fisher  who wrote the textbooks that were to define the academic discipline in universities around the world  Fisher s most important publications were his      seminal paper The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance  which was the first to use the statistical term  variance   his classic      work Statistical Methods for Research Workers and his      The Design of Experiments                                      where he developed rigorous design of experiments models  He originated the concepts of sufficiency  ancillary statistics  Fisher s linear discriminator and Fisher information              He also coined the term null hypothesis during the Lady tasting tea experiment  which  is never proved or established  but is possibly disproved  in the course of experimentation                           In his      book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection  he applied statistics to various biological concepts such as Fisher s principle              which A  W  F  Edwards called  probably the most celebrated argument in evolutionary biology   and Fisherian runaway                                                                          a concept in sexual selection about a positive feedback runaway effect found in evolution 
The final wave  which mainly saw the refinement and expansion of earlier developments  emerged from the collaborative work between Egon Pearson and Jerzy Neyman in the     s  They introduced the concepts of  Type II  error  power of a test and confidence intervals  Jerzy Neyman in      showed that stratified random sampling was in general a better method of estimation than purposive  quota  sampling             
Today  statistical methods are applied in all fields that involve decision making  for making accurate inferences from a collated body of data and for making decisions in the face of uncertainty based on statistical methodology  The use of modern computers has expedited large scale statistical computations and has also made possible new methods that are impractical to perform manually  Statistics continues to be an area of active research  for example on the problem of how to analyze big data             

Applications edit 
Applied statistics  theoretical statistics and mathematical statistics edit 
Applied statistics  sometimes referred to as Statistical science              comprises descriptive statistics and the application of inferential statistics                          Theoretical statistics concerns the logical arguments underlying justification of approaches to statistical inference  as well as encompassing mathematical statistics  Mathematical statistics includes not only the manipulation of probability distributions necessary for deriving results related to methods of estimation and inference  but also various aspects of computational statistics and the design of experiments 
Statistical consultants can help organizations and companies that do not have in house expertise relevant to their particular questions 

Machine learning and data mining edit 
Machine learning models are statistical and probabilistic models that capture patterns in the data through use of computational algorithms 

Statistics in academia edit 
Statistics is applicable to a wide variety of academic disciplines  including natural and social sciences  government  and business  Business statistics applies statistical methods in econometrics  auditing and production and operations  including services improvement and marketing research              A study of two journals in tropical biology found that the    most frequent statistical tests are  analysis of variance  ANOVA   chi squared test  Student s t test  linear regression  Pearson s correlation coefficient  Mann Whitney U test  Kruskal Wallis test  Shannon s diversity index  Tukey s range test  cluster analysis  Spearman s rank correlation coefficient and principal component analysis             
A typical statistics course covers descriptive statistics  probability  binomial and normal distributions  test of hypotheses and confidence intervals  linear regression  and correlation              Modern fundamental statistical courses for undergraduate students focus on correct test selection  results interpretation  and use of free statistics software             

Statistical computing edit

The rapid and sustained increases in computing power starting from the second half of the   th century have had a substantial impact on the practice of statistical science  Early statistical models were almost always from the class of linear models  but powerful computers  coupled with suitable numerical algorithms  caused an increased interest in nonlinear models  such as neural networks  as well as the creation of new types  such as generalized linear models and multilevel models 
Increased computing power has also led to the growing popularity of computationally intensive methods based on resampling  such as permutation tests and the bootstrap  while techniques such as Gibbs sampling have made use of Bayesian models more feasible  The computer revolution has implications for the future of statistics with a new emphasis on  experimental  and  empirical  statistics  A large number of both general and special purpose statistical software are now available  Examples of available software capable of complex statistical computation include programs such as Mathematica  SAS  SPSS  and R 

Business statistics edit

Statistics form a key basis tool in business and manufacturing as well  It is used to understand measurement systems variability  control processes  as in statistical process control or SPC   for summarizing data  and to make data driven decisions 

Misuse edit 
Main article  Misuse of statistics
Misuse of statistics can produce subtle but serious errors in description and interpretation subtle in the sense that even experienced professionals make such errors  and serious in the sense that they can lead to devastating decision errors  For instance  social policy  medical practice  and the reliability of structures like bridges all rely on the proper use of statistics 
Even when statistical techniques are correctly applied  the results can be difficult to interpret for those lacking expertise  The statistical significance of a trend in the data which measures the extent to which a trend could be caused by random variation in the sample may or may not agree with an intuitive sense of its significance  The set of basic statistical skills  and skepticism  that people need to deal with information in their everyday lives properly is referred to as statistical literacy 
There is a general perception that statistical knowledge is all too frequently intentionally misused by finding ways to interpret only the data that are favorable to the presenter              A mistrust and misunderstanding of statistics is associated with the quotation   There are three kinds of lies  lies  damned lies  and statistics   Misuse of statistics can be both inadvertent and intentional  and the book How to Lie with Statistics              by Darrell Huff  outlines a range of considerations  In an attempt to shed light on the use and misuse of statistics  reviews of statistical techniques used in particular fields are conducted  e g  Warne  Lazo  Ramos  and Ritter                     
Ways to avoid misuse of statistics include using proper diagrams and avoiding bias              Misuse can occur when conclusions are overgeneralized and claimed to be representative of more than they really are  often by either deliberately or unconsciously overlooking sampling bias              Bar graphs are arguably the easiest diagrams to use and understand  and they can be made either by hand or with simple computer programs              Most people do not look for bias or errors  so they are not noticed  Thus  people may often believe that something is true even if it is not well represented              To make data gathered from statistics believable and accurate  the sample taken must be representative of the whole              According to Huff   The dependability of a sample can be destroyed by  bias     allow yourself some degree of skepticism              
To assist in the understanding of statistics Huff proposed a series of questions to be asked in each case             

Who says so   Does he she have an axe to grind  
How does he she know   Does he she have the resources to know the facts  
What s missing   Does he she give us a complete picture  
Did someone change the subject   Does he she offer us the right answer to the wrong problem  
Does it make sense   Is his her conclusion logical and consistent with what we already know  
Misinterpretation  correlation edit 
See also  Correlation does not imply causation
The confounding variable problem  X and Y may be correlated  not because there is causal relationship between them  but because both depend on a third variable Z  Z is called a confounding factor 
The concept of correlation is particularly noteworthy for the potential confusion it can cause  Statistical analysis of a data set often reveals that two variables  properties  of the population under consideration tend to vary together  as if they were connected  For example  a study of annual income that also looks at age of death  might find that poor people tend to have shorter lives than affluent people  The two variables are said to be correlated  however  they may or may not be the cause of one another  The correlation phenomena could be caused by a third  previously unconsidered phenomenon  called a lurking variable or confounding variable  For this reason  there is no way to immediately infer the existence of a causal relationship between the two variables
