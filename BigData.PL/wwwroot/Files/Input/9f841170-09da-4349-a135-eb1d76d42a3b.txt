Probabilistic graphical model
Dynamic Bayesian Network composed by   variables 
Bayesian Network developed on   time steps 
Simplified Dynamic Bayesian Network  All the variables do not need to be duplicated in the graphical model  but they are dynamic  too 
A dynamic Bayesian network  DBN  is a Bayesian network  BN  which relates variables to each other over adjacent time steps  


History edit 
A dynamic Bayesian network  DBN  is often called a  two timeslice  BN   TBN  because it says that at any point in time T  the value of a variable can be calculated from the internal regressors and the immediate prior value  time T      DBNs were developed by Paul Dagum in the early     s at Stanford University s Section on Medical Informatics                        Dagum developed DBNs to unify and extend traditional linear state space models such as Kalman filters  linear and normal forecasting models such as ARMA and simple dependency models such as hidden Markov models into a general probabilistic representation and inference mechanism for arbitrary nonlinear and non normal time dependent domains                       
Today  DBNs are common in robotics  and have shown potential for a wide range of data mining applications   For example  they have been used in speech recognition  digital forensics  protein sequencing  and bioinformatics   DBN is a generalization of hidden Markov models and Kalman filters            
DBNs are conceptually related to probabilistic Boolean networks            and can  similarly  be used to model dynamical systems at steady state
