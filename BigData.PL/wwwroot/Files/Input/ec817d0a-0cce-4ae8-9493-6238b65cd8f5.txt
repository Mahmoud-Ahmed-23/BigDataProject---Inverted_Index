Research is creative and systematic work undertaken to increase the stock of knowledge             It involves the collection  organization  and analysis of evidence to increase understanding of a topic  characterized by a particular attentiveness to controlling sources of bias and error  These activities are characterized by accounting and controlling for biases  A research project may be an expansion of past work in the field  To test the validity of instruments  procedures  or experiments  research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole 
The primary purposes of basic research  as opposed to applied research  are documentation  discovery  interpretation  and the research and development  R amp D  of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge  Approaches to research depend on epistemologies  which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences  There are several forms of research  scientific  humanities  artistic  economic  social  business  marketing  practitioner research  life  technological  etc  The scientific study of research practices is known as meta research 
A researcher is a person who conducts research  especially in order to discover new information or to reach a new understanding             In order to be a social researcher or a social scientist  one should have enormous knowledge of subjects related to social science that they are specialized in  Similarly  in order to be a natural science researcher  the person should have knowledge of fields related to natural science  physics  chemistry  biology  astronomy  zoology and so on   Professional associations provide one pathway to mature in the research profession            


Etymology
Aristotle           BC   an Ancient Greek philosopher and pioneer in developing the scientific method           
The word research is derived from the Middle French  recherche   which means  to go about seeking   the term itself being derived from the Old French term  recerchier   a compound word from  re      cerchier   or  sercher   meaning  search              The earliest recorded use of the term was in                 

Definitions
Research has been defined in a number of different ways  and while there are similarities  there does not appear to be a single  all encompassing definition that is embraced by all who engage in it 
Research  in its simplest terms  is searching for knowledge and searching for truth  In a formal sense  it is a systematic study of a problem attacked by a deliberately chosen strategy  which starts with choosing an approach to preparing a blueprint  design  and acting upon it in terms of designing research hypotheses  choosing methods and techniques  selecting or developing data collection tools  processing the data  interpretation  and ending with presenting solution s  of the problem            
Another definition of research is given by John W  Creswell  who states that  research is a process of steps used to collect and analyze information to increase our understanding of a topic or issue   It consists of three steps  pose a question  collect data to answer the question  and present an answer to the question                 page      needed     
The Merriam Webster Online Dictionary defines research more generally to also include studying already existing knowledge   studious inquiry or examination  especially  investigation or experimentation aimed at the discovery and interpretation of facts  revision of accepted theories or laws in the light of new facts  or practical application of such new or revised theories or laws             

Forms of research
Original research
 Original research  redirects here  For the Wikipedia prohibition against user generated  unpublished research  see Wikipedia No original research 
Original research  also called primary research  is research that is not exclusively based on a summary  review  or synthesis of earlier publications on the subject of research  This material is of a primary source character  The purpose of the original research is to produce new knowledge rather than present the existing knowledge in a new form  e g   summarized or classified                         Original research can take various forms  depending on the discipline it pertains to  In experimental work  it typically involves direct or indirect observation of the researched subject s   e g   in the laboratory or in the field  documents the methodology  results  and conclusions of an experiment or set of experiments  or offers a novel interpretation of previous results  In analytical work  there are typically some new  for example  mathematical results produced or a new way of approaching an existing problem  In some subjects which do not typically carry out experimentation or analysis of this kind  the originality is in the particular way existing understanding is changed or re interpreted based on the outcome of the work of the researcher             
The degree of originality of the research is among the major criteria for articles to be published in academic journals and usually established by means of peer review              Graduate students are commonly required to perform original research as part of a dissertation

Scientific research is a systematic way of gathering data and harnessing curiosity      citation needed      This research provides scientific information and theories for the explanation of the nature and the properties of the world  It makes practical applications possible  Scientific research may be funded by public authorities  charitable organizations  and private organizations  Scientific research can be subdivided by discipline 
Generally  research is understood to follow a certain structural process  Though the order may vary depending on the subject matter and researcher  the following steps are usually part of most formal research  both basic and applied 

Observations and formation of the topic  Consists of the subject area of one s interest and following that subject area to conduct subject related research  The subject area should not be randomly chosen since it requires reading a vast amount of literature on the topic to determine the gap in the literature the researcher intends to narrow  A keen interest in the chosen subject area is advisable  The research will have to be justified by linking its importance to already existing knowledge about the topic 
Hypothesis  A testable prediction which designates the relationship between two or more variables 
Conceptual definition  Description of a concept by relating it to other concepts 
Operational definition  Details in regards to defining the variables and how they will be measured assessed in the study 
Gathering of data  Consists of identifying a population and selecting samples  gathering information from or about these samples by using specific research instruments  The instruments used for data collection must be valid and reliable 
Analysis of data  Involves breaking down the individual pieces of data to draw conclusions about it 
Data Interpretation  This can be represented through tables  figures  and pictures  and then described in words 
Test  revising of hypothesis
Conclusion  reiteration if necessary
A common misconception is that a hypothesis will be proven  see  rather  null hypothesis   Generally  a hypothesis is used to make predictions that can be tested by observing the outcome of an experiment  If the outcome is inconsistent with the hypothesis  then the hypothesis is rejected  see falsifiability   However  if the outcome is consistent with the hypothesis  the experiment is said to support the hypothesis  This careful language is used because researchers recognize that alternative hypotheses may also be consistent with the observations  In this sense  a hypothesis can never be proven  but rather only supported by surviving rounds of scientific testing and  eventually  becoming widely thought of as true 
A useful hypothesis allows prediction and within the accuracy of observation of the time  the prediction will be verified  As the accuracy of observation improves with time  the hypothesis may no longer provide an accurate prediction  In this case  a new hypothesis will arise to challenge the old  and to the extent that the new hypothesis makes more accurate predictions than the old  the new will supplant it  Researchers can also use a null hypothesis  which states no relationship or difference between the independent or dependent variables 

Research in the humanities
Research in the humanities involves different methods such as for example hermeneutics and semiotics  Humanities scholars usually do not search for the ultimate correct answer to a question  but instead  explore the issues and details that surround it  Context is always important  and context can be social  historical  political  cultural  or ethnic  An example of research in the humanities is historical research  which is embodied in historical method  Historians use primary sources and other evidence to systematically investigate a topic  and then to write histories in the form of accounts of the past  Other studies aim to merely examine the occurrence of behaviours in societies and communities  without particularly looking for reasons or motivations to explain these  These studies may be qualitative or quantitative  and can use a variety of approaches  such as queer theory or feminist theory             

Artistic research
Artistic research  also seen as  practice based research   can take form when creative works are considered both the research and the object of research itself  It is the debatable body of thought which offers an alternative to purely scientific methods in research in its search for knowledge and truth 
The controversial trend of artistic teaching becoming more academics oriented is leading to artistic research being accepted as the primary mode of enquiry in art as in the case of other disciplines              One of the characteristics of artistic research is that it must accept subjectivity as opposed to the classical scientific methods  As such  it is similar to the social sciences in using qualitative research and intersubjectivity as tools to apply measurement and critical analysis             
Artistic research has been defined by the School of Dance and Circus  Dans och Cirkush gskolan  DOCH   Stockholm in the following manner    Artistic research is to investigate and test with the purpose of gaining knowledge within and for our artistic disciplines  It is based on artistic practices  methods  and criticality  Through presented documentation  the insights gained shall be placed in a context               Artistic research aims to enhance knowledge and understanding with presentation of the arts              A simpler understanding by Julian Klein defines artistic research as any kind of research employing the artistic mode of perception              For a survey of the central problematics of today s artistic research  see Giaco Schiesser             
According to artist Hakan Topal  in artistic research   perhaps more so than other disciplines  intuition is utilized as a method to identify a wide range of new and unexpected productive modalities               Most writers  whether of fiction or non fiction books  also have to do research to support their creative work  This may be factual  historical  or background research  Background research could include  for example  geographical or procedural research             
The Society for Artistic Research  SAR  publishes the triannual Journal for Artistic Research  JAR                           an international  online  open access  and peer reviewed journal for the identification  publication  and dissemination of artistic research and its methodologies  from all arts disciplines and it runs the Research Catalogue  RC                                       a searchable  documentary database of artistic research  to which anyone can contribute 
Patricia Leavy addresses eight arts based research  ABR  genres  narrative inquiry  fiction based research  poetry  music  dance  theatre  film  and visual art

Main article  Historical method
Leopold von Ranke              a German historian and a founder of modern source based history
The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use historical sources and other evidence to research and then to write history  There are various history guidelines that are commonly used by historians in their work  under the headings of external criticism  internal criticism  and synthesis  This includes lower criticism and sensual criticism  Though items may vary depending on the subject matter and researcher  the following concepts are part of most formal historical research

Research is often conducted using the hourglass model structure of research              The hourglass model starts with a broad spectrum for research  focusing in on the required information through the method of the project  like the neck of the hourglass   then expands the research in the form of discussion and results  The major steps in conducting research are

The steps generally represent the overall process  however  they should be viewed as an ever changing iterative process rather than a fixed set of steps              Most research begins with a general statement of the problem  or rather  the purpose for engaging in the study              The literature review identifies flaws or holes in previous research which provides justification for the study  Often  a literature review is conducted in a given subject area before a research question is identified  A gap in the current literature  as identified by a researcher  then engenders a research question  The research question may be parallel to the hypothesis  The hypothesis is the supposition to be tested  The researcher s  collects data to test the hypothesis  The researcher s  then analyzes and interprets the data via a variety of statistical methods  engaging in what is known as empirical research  The results of the data analysis in rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis are then reported and evaluated  At the end  the researcher may discuss avenues for further research  However  some researchers advocate for the reverse approach  starting with articulating findings and discussion of them  moving  up  to identification of a research problem that emerges in the findings and literature review  The reverse approach is justified by the transactional nature of the research endeavor where research inquiry  research questions  research method  relevant research literature  and so on are not fully known until the findings have fully emerged and been interpreted 
Rudolph Rummel says       no researcher should accept any one or two tests as definitive  It is only when a range of tests are consistent over many kinds of data  researchers  and methods can one have confidence in the results              
Plato in Meno talks about an inherent difficulty  if not a paradox  of doing research that can be paraphrased in the following way   If you know what you re searching for  why do you search for it    i e   you have already found it  If you don t know what you re searching for  what are you searching for

The goal of the research process is to produce new knowledge or deepen understanding of a topic or issue  This process takes three main forms  although  as previously discussed  the boundaries between them may be obscure  

Exploratory research  which helps to identify and define a problem or question 
Constructive research  which tests theories and proposes solutions to a problem or question 
Empirical research  which tests the feasibility of a solution using empirical evidence 
There are two major types of empirical research design  qualitative research and quantitative research  Researchers choose qualitative or quantitative methods according to the nature of the research topic they want to investigate and the research questions they aim to answer 
Qualitative research
Qualitative research refers to much more subjective non quantitative  use different methods of collecting data  analyzing data  interpreting data for meanings  definitions  characteristics  symbols metaphors of things  Qualitative research further classified into the following types  Ethnography  This research mainly focus on culture of group of people which includes share attributes  language  practices  structure  value  norms and material things  evaluate human lifestyle  Ethno  people  Grapho  to write  this disciple may include ethnic groups  ethno genesis  composition  resettlement and social welfare characteristics  Phenomenology  It is very powerful strategy for demonstrating methodology to health professions education as well as best suited for exploring challenging problems in health professions educations              In addition  PMP researcher Mandy Sha argued that a project management approach is necessary to control the scope  schedule  and cost related to qualitative research design  participant recruitment  data collection  reporting  as well as stakeholder engagement                         
Quantitative research
Quantitative research involves systematic empirical investigation of quantitative properties and phenomena and their relationships  by asking a narrow question and collecting numerical data to analyze it utilizing statistical methods  The quantitative research designs are experimental  correlational  and survey  or descriptive              Statistics derived from quantitative research can be used to establish the existence of associative or causal relationships between variables  Quantitative research is linked with the philosophical and theoretical stance of positivism 
The quantitative data collection methods rely on random sampling and structured data collection instruments that fit diverse experiences into predetermined response categories  These methods produce results that can be summarized  compared  and generalized to larger populations if the data are collected using proper sampling and data collection strategies              Quantitative research is concerned with testing hypotheses derived from theory or being able to estimate the size of a phenomenon of interest             
If the research question is about people  participants may be randomly assigned to different treatments  this is the only way that a quantitative study can be considered a true experiment       citation needed      If this is not feasible  the researcher may collect data on participant and situational characteristics to statistically control for their influence on the dependent  or outcome  variable  If the intent is to generalize from the research participants to a larger population  the researcher will employ probability sampling to select participants             
In either qualitative or quantitative research  the researcher s  may collect primary or secondary data              Primary data is data collected specifically for the research  such as through interviews or questionnaires  Secondary data is data that already exists  such as census data  which can be re used for the research  It is good ethical research practice to use secondary data wherever possible             
Mixed method research  i e  research that includes qualitative and quantitative elements  using both primary and secondary data  is becoming more common              This method has benefits that using one method alone cannot offer  For example  a researcher may choose to conduct a qualitative study and follow it up with a quantitative study to gain additional insights             
Big data has brought big impacts on research methods so that now many researchers do not put much effort into data collection  furthermore  methods to analyze easily available huge amounts of data have also been developed 
Non empirical research
Non empirical  theoretical  research is an approach that involves the development of theory as opposed to using observation and experimentation  As such  non empirical research seeks solutions to problems using existing knowledge as its source  This  however  does not mean that new ideas and innovations cannot be found within the pool of existing and established knowledge  Non empirical research is not an absolute alternative to empirical research because they may be used together to strengthen a research approach  Neither one is less effective than the other since they have their particular purpose in science  Typically empirical research produces observations that need to be explained  then theoretical research tries to explain them  and in so doing generates empirically testable hypotheses  these hypotheses are then tested empirically  giving more observations that may need further explanation  and so on  See Scientific method 
A simple example of a non empirical task is the prototyping of a new drug using a differentiated application of existing knowledge  another is the development of a business process in the form of a flow chart and texts where all the ingredients are from established knowledge  Much of cosmological research is theoretical in nature  Mathematics research does not rely on externally available data  rather  it seeks to prove theorems about mathematical objects 

Research ethics
This section is an excerpt from Research ethics  edit 
Research ethics is a discipline within the study of applied ethics  Its scope ranges from general scientific integrity and misconduct to the treatment of human and animal subjects  The social responsibilities of scientists and researchers are not traditionally included and are less well defined 
The discipline is most developed in medical research  Beyond the issues of falsification  fabrication  and plagiarism that arise in every scientific field  research design in human subject research and animal testing are the areas that raise ethical questions most often 
The list of historic cases includes many large scale violations and crimes against humanity such as Nazi human experimentation and the Tuskegee syphilis experiment which led to international codes of research ethics  No approach has been universally accepted  but typically cited codes are the      Nuremberg Code  the      Declaration of Helsinki  and the      Belmont Report 
Today  research ethics committees  such as those of the US  UK  and EU  govern and oversee the responsible conduct of research  One major goal being to reduce questionable research practices 

Research in other fields such as social sciences  information technology  biotechnology  or engineering may generate ethical concerns 
Problems in research

Metascience
Metascience is the study of research through the use of research methods  Also known as  research on research   it aims to reduce waste and increase the quality of research in all fields  Meta research concerns itself with the detection of bias  methodological flaws  and other errors and inefficiencies  Among the finding of meta research is a low rates of reproducibility across a large number of fields             

Replication crisis
See also  Publish or perish

The replication crisis     a      is an ongoing methodological crisis in which the results of many scientific studies are difficult or impossible to reproduce  Because the reproducibility of empirical results is an essential part of the scientific method              such failures undermine the credibility of theories building on them and potentially call into question substantial parts of scientific knowledge 
Academic bias
See also  Politicization of science and Sexism in academia

Academic bias is the bias or perceived bias in academia shaping research and the scientific community  Academic bias can involve discrimination based on race  sex  religion  ideology or protected group 
Funding bias
See also  Author level metrics        Criticism  and Impact factor        Criticism

Funding bias  also known as sponsorship bias  funding outcome bias  funding publication bias  and funding effect  is a tendency of a scientific study to support the interests of the study s financial sponsor  This phenomenon is recognized sufficiently that researchers undertake studies to examine bias in past published studies  Funding bias has been associated  in particular  with research into chemical toxicity  tobacco  and pharmaceutical drugs              It is an instance of experimenter s bias 
Publication bias
See also  Conflicts of interest in academic publishing

In published academic research  publication bias occurs when the outcome of an experiment or research study biases the decision to publish or otherwise distribute it  Publishing only results that show a significant finding disturbs the balance of findings in favor of positive results              The study of publication bias is an important topic in metascience 
Non western methods
See also  Indigenous science and Neo colonial science
In many disciplines  Western methods of conducting research are predominant              Researchers are overwhelmingly taught Western methods of data collection and study  The increasing participation of indigenous peoples as researchers has brought increased attention to the scientific lacuna in culturally sensitive methods of data collection              Western methods of data collection may not be the most accurate or relevant for research on non Western societies  For example   Hua Oranga  was created as a criterion for psychological evaluation in M ori populations  and is based on dimensions of mental health important to the M ori people    taha wairua  the spiritual dimension   taha hinengaro  the mental dimension   taha tinana  the physical dimension   and taha whanau  the family dimension               
Even though Western dominance seems to be prominent in research  some scholars  such as Simon Marginson  argue for  the need  for  a plural university world               Marginson argues that the East Asian Confucian model could take over the Western model 
This could be due to changes in funding for research both in the East and the West  Focused on emphasizing educational achievement  East Asian cultures  mainly in China and South Korea  have encouraged the increase of funding for research expansion              In contrast  in the Western academic world  notably in the United Kingdom as well as in some state governments in the United States  funding cuts for university research have occurred  which some      who       say may lead to the future decline of Western dominance in research 

Language
Research is often biased in the languages that are preferred  linguicism  and the geographic locations where research occurs 
Periphery scholars face the challenges of exclusion and linguicism in research and academic publication  As the great majority of mainstream academic journals are written in English  multilingual periphery scholars often must translate their work to be accepted to elite Western dominated journals              Multilingual scholars  influences from their native communicative styles can be assumed to be incompetence instead of difference              Patterns of geographic bias also show a relationship with linguicism  countries whose official languages are French or Arabic are far less likely to be the focus of single country studies than countries with different official languages  Within Africa  English speaking countries are more represented than other countries             

Generalizability
See also  External validity
Generalization is the process of more broadly applying the valid results of one study              Studies with a narrow scope can result in a lack of generalizability  meaning that the results may not be applicable to other populations or regions  In comparative politics  this can result from using a single country study  rather than a study design that uses data from multiple countries  Despite the issue of generalizability  single country studies have risen in prevalence since the late     s              
For comparative politics  Western countries are over represented in single country studies  with heavy emphasis on Western Europe  Canada  Australia  and New Zealand  Since       Latin American countries have become more popular in single country studies  In contrast  countries in Oceania and the Caribbean are the focus of very few studies              

Publication peer review
See also  Open peer review
Peer review is a form of self regulation by qualified members of a profession within the relevant field  Peer review methods are employed to maintain standards of quality  improve performance  and provide credibility  In academia  scholarly peer review is often used to determine an academic paper s suitability for publication  Usually  the peer review process involves experts in the same field who are consulted by editors to give a review of the scholarly works produced by a colleague of theirs from an unbiased and impartial point of view  and this is usually done free of charge  The tradition of peer reviews being done for free has however brought many pitfalls which are also indicative of why most peer reviewers decline many invitations to review              It was observed that publications from periphery countries rarely rise to the same elite status as those of North America and Europe             

Open research
The open research  open science and open access movements assume that all information generally deemed useful should be free and belongs to a  public domain   that of  humanity               This idea gained prevalence as a result of Western colonial history and ignores alternative conceptions of knowledge circulation  For instance  most indigenous communities consider that access to certain information proper to the group should be determined by relationships              There is alleged to be a double standard in the Western knowledge system  On the one hand   digital right management  used to restrict access to personal information on social networking platforms is celebrated as a protection of privacy  while simultaneously when similar functions are used by cultural groups  i e  indigenous communities  this is denounced as  access control  and reprehended as censorship

Academic publishing is a system that is necessary for academic scholars to peer review the work and make it available for a wider audience  The system varies widely by field and is also always changing  if often slowly  Most academic work is published in journal article or book form  There is also a large body of research that exists in either a thesis or dissertation form  These forms of research can be found in databases explicitly for theses and dissertations  In publishing  STM publishing is an abbreviation for academic publications in science  technology  and medicine 
Most established academic fields have their own scientific journals and other outlets for publication  though many academic journals are somewhat interdisciplinary  and publish work from several distinct fields or subfields  The kinds of publications that are accepted as contributions of knowledge or research vary greatly between fields  from the print to the electronic format  A study suggests that researchers should not give great consideration to findings that are not replicated frequently              It has also been suggested that all published studies should be subjected to some measure for assessing the validity or reliability of its procedures to prevent the publication of unproven findings              Business models are different in the electronic environment  Since about the early     s  licensing of electronic resources  particularly journals  has been very common  Presently  a major trend  particularly with respect to scholarly journals  is open access              There are two main forms of open access  open access publishing  in which the articles or the whole journal is freely available from the time of publication  and self archiving  where the author makes a copy of their own work freely available on the web

Most funding for scientific research comes from three major sources  corporate research and development departments  private foundations  and government research councils such as the National Institutes of Health in the US             and the Medical Research Council in the UK  These are managed primarily through universities and in some cases through military contractors  Many senior researchers  such as group leaders  spend a significant amount of their time applying for grants for research funds  These grants are necessary not only for researchers to carry out their research but also as a source of merit  The Social Psychology Network provides a comprehensive list of U S  Government and private foundation funding sources
