Artillery observers
Forward observers in the U S  military are artillery observers who carry the Military Occupational Specialty designator of   F in the United States Army and       in the United States Marine Corps  They are officially called  joint fire support specialists  in the U S  Army and  fire support marines  in the U S  Marine Corps  They are colloquially known as  FiSTers   regardless of whether they are members of a FiST  fire support team   A battalion fire support officer  FSO  is the officer in charge of a battalion fire support element 


U S  Army edit 
Forward observers in the U S  Army hold the Military Occupational Specialty of   F for enlisted and   A for officers designating them as members of the field artillery corps  After completion of basic combat training  enlisted soldiers attend an eleven week course  AIT  on the fundamentals of call for fire techniques as well as general field craft and small unit tactics at Fort Sill  Oklahoma             From there those being assigned to airborne units  most notably the   nd Airborne Division     rd Airborne Brigade  and   th Ranger Regiment will attend the United States Army Airborne School after the completion of training at Fort Sill  Additionally  Ranger School is open to both enlisted and officers serving as forward observers  Members of forward observer teams are required to attain and maintain a secret security clearance due to the requirement for forward observers to be aware of not only the mission of their own unit but of other U S  and allied units in the same operating area             Officers are referred to as  fire support officers   FSO  while enlisted troops hold the title of forward observers 

Calling in and adjusting artillery fire on a target
Once training is complete members are assigned to a forward observer platoon generally part of a headquarters and headquarters company inside a larger infantry  cavalry  armor  or artillery battalion  Observer teams are expected to be able to move  communicate  interact and carry out missions as members of these units with a high level of proficiency in addition to their responsibilities as forward observers  Observers must be able to work independently for long periods of time and  because the clandestine nature of their work and their frequent placement on or behind enemy lines  the ability to operate with minimal support is of great importance as some missions can often last for days or weeks 
Currently three methods of directing artillery fire are taught in the U S  Army  The first and most common is called a  grid mission   where artillery fire is directed based on the map grid coordinate of the target based on a standard map  The second is  shift from known point  where artillery based on his direction and distance from a fixed  pre established geographic or man made point  The third and least common is  polar   where the observer gives their current grid location and provides distance and direction to the target  This is typically unpopular due to the FDC confusing the observer s location as the target            
Combat observation lasing teams  COLTs  are a sub specialization within the Army s   F career field which train in the directing of long range fire such as rocket assisted artillery or GPS guided munitions like the          mm Excalibur series weaponry  They have a secondary spotting reconnaissance capability and are trained to operate with other unconventional forces such as sniper and scout teams for long periods of time with minimal support 
Since      the U S  Army has also used the RQ  B Shadow unmanned aircraft  flown by soldiers in the   W MOS  in Iraq and Afghanistan for artillery correction  close air support and reconnaissance      citation needed     
With the need for coordinated indirect fire support control at higher levels  fire support specialists are also assigned to the  fire support element   at the battalion level  and as the  fires  section of the operations staff from brigade or regiment level through to the corps level 

Field artillery forward observer      edit 
Field artillery forward observer      was a World War II Army officer position  Officer classification  commissioned and warrant military classification and coding            
The primary duties of the      was to  direct the fire of an artillery unit from a forward position  Observes shell bursts and adjusts fire by forward observation or computation methods  consults with commanders of supported unit in determination of appropriate artillery targets  normal barrage  and zones of defense  trains personnel in procedures of artillery operation  organizes observation posts  sets up and maintains communication systems  

U S  Marine Corps edit 
The requirements for USMC observers are nearly identical to their Army counterparts  They attend training at Fort Sill  are required to obtain a secret security clearance  and are generally assigned as specialist members of larger combat units or specialized units like Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company   Both the Army and USMC observers may be certified as joint fires observers  JFOs  which allows them to assist the joint terminal attack controller in conducting aerial strikes 

U S  Navy edit 
The U S  Navy has a small corps of Naval gunfire liaison officers trained to provide observation and correction of naval gunfire in support of Army and Marine Corps ground units during amphibious and coastal operations  As early as      the United States Marine Corps identified naval gunfire as one of the six key elements for amphibious operations             The trajectory of high velocity naval artillery was significantly different from field artillery howitzers typically used for gunfire support  Infantry officers were surprised by the inability of flat trajectory naval guns to hit targets behind low hills  and the relatively wide distribution of fall of shot along the axis of fire sometimes endangered friendly troops behind or in front of the target  Shells intended to penetrate armored ships produced a relatively small damage radius against unfortified targets  and shipboard observation devices designed to observe shell splashes at sea were unable to determine whether their shells were striking intended shore targets 
Although Marine Corps officers who have served aboard warships are more familiar with naval artillery  Army officers without such experience are often in positions requiring gunfire support during amphibious landings  Naval officers familiar with shipboard guns are able to advise infantry officers ashore concerning the capabilities of naval artillery to engage specific targets  The naval officer s familiarity with shipboard communications systems enables him to translate the infantry objectives and fall of shot observations to the appropriate shipboard personnel for effective engagement of targets  The tentative manual of      became Fleet Training Publication     in       and the Army issued a field manual with virtually identical text in                  The use of naval gunfire support reached its peak during WWII with the numerous amphibious landings  to include a small number who completed the Army s elite Airborne School and parachuted into Normandy to provide gun fire support for paratroopers during the D Day landings            
In the modern age NGLOs are assigned to a marine artillery battalion or marine artillery regiment to assist in providing naval gunfire support   When deploying as part of a marine expeditionary unit  the NGLO is typically attached to the operations section  S    of the ground combat element and is responsible for a shore fire control party consisting of RT operators and forward observers            
While NGLOs are trained to spot naval gunfire  their primary responsibilities are in the fire support coordination center  to plan and coordinate naval gunfire with other firing agencies  artillery  close air support  and mortars  in conjunction with the fire support coordinator and fire support team leaders  and advise him on its employment  NGLOs can also be assigned to air naval gunfire liaison companies  ANGLICO   or the various marine expeditionary force or division headquarters staff            
Specific training consists of the Naval Gunfire Liaison Officer Course  a five week resident course taught in Coronado  California  NGLOs assigned to ANGLICO units may receive further training as JTACs at the discretion of the assigned unit and are jump qualified 

U S  Air Force edit 
Although the U S  Air Force has no formal forward observer training of its own  members of the special tactics community are generally required to have a basic familiarity with techniques of call for fire and artillery spotting in addition to their normal duties  The closest thing the Air Force has to forward observers are Joint Terminal Attack Controllers  JTACs   who are specialized in calling in air support  and TACPs  who may or may not be JTAC certified  and typically embed within both conventional and special operations units from the Army             

Joint fires observer edit 
The joint fires observer  JFO  course is a two week course which provides select personnel from all branches of the military with standardized training to engage targets with joint fires through the detailed integration with TACs and fire support teams  FSTs   Students who graduate this course will be able to request  control  and adjust mortar  field artillery  and naval gunfire support  provide targeting information for A     AC      and other close air support  CAS  aircraft  terminal guidance operations  initial terminal guidance operations  SOF gunship call for fire  close combat attack and joint fire support planning at the company level  Additionally  a JFO is trained in controlling multiple ground and air based fire support assets at the same time  ensuring the different assets are deconflicted by time  lateral or vertical space  or a combination of the two tactics             
JFOs in the Army and Marine Corps are typically officers or enlisted forward observers or special operations personnel who are awarded the L  additional skill identifier  The first certifying JFO course was established at Nellis Air Force Base in       It was then moved to Fort Sill in       and also Einsiedlerhof  Germany  at the Warrior Preparation Center  The Marines have also established their own JFO course in Quantico  Virginia             
The JFO course consists of seven graded simulations with numerous fire missions and CAS missions  In these simulations the trainee conducts mortar  artillery  naval  attack aviation and special operations call for fire missions  and CAS with JTAC or FAC A   using night vision devices  laser guided bombs  JDAMs  Hellfire missiles  rockets  with laser designators or just a map  protractor and compass
