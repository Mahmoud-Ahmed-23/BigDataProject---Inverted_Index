							The US dollar crisis has escalated in the domestic market amid increasing speculation  leading the US dollar value to reach a record high against the national currency  In response  calls have emerged in favour of shutting down exchange companies  claiming they are the main reason behind the problem 
These calls are no longer limited to ordinary citizens ranting on the streets or even economy experts  but the words have now spread and been repeated by government and parliament officials 
Parliamentary speaker Ali Abdul Aal said during a plenary session last week that some countries posed the death penalty on informal currency market traders  adding that Egypt is at war  He expressed his concern over the exchange companies  describing them as cancer cells growing in the Egyptian economy 
Also last week  the House of Representatives voted to amend some articles of the banking law at the request of the Central Bank of Egypt  CBE  to tighten punishment on currency traders 
Meanwhile  the CBE has closed down    exchange companies since early this year until last week  on charges of manipulating currency prices  Among these companies     were permanently closed  while    companies have been ordered to close for periods ranging between three months to a year 
The Egyptian market currently houses    registered exchange companies  in comparison to the     that existed at the end of December      
Daily News Egypt asked bankers and experts for their opinion on the matter to answer the question and present the debate 
Those in favour of the decision say it has become necessary to give the CBE more control over the market  as exchange companies only care for their personal interests  Opponents to the proposal point to the companies  role in securing hard cash to non bank customers  and claim that controlling them is easier than chasing traders on the streets

Exchange companies work out of the frame of law and must be shut down until the state stabilises  senior banker
Mohamed Abdel Aal  a board member of both the Suez Canal Bank and the Arab Sudanese Bank  said that exchange companies operating in the Egyptian market work outside of the frame of the law 
He explained that ordinary exchange companies should only buy and sell small amounts of foreign currency to clients who do not deal with banks  whether Egyptians or foreign tourists  The prices  he noted  should be allocated by banks with a small profit margin 
But the situation now is the opposite  he added         Exchange companies now set the exchange rate they see fit         Abdel Aal explained         They acquired the largest share of the exchange market  unlike the situation around the globe even countries with similar conditions        
He noted that the size of transactions on the parallel market of exchange companies amount to    bn something he described as unthinkable and unacceptable 
According to Abdel Aal  establishing exchange companies in the first place had some mistakes  including the lack of the Central Bank of Egypt s  CBE  intervention in appointing managers and executives of these companies         Those  heads of exchange companies  should have been hired under the CBE s supervision after thorough investigations  proving them to be competent bank leaders         he added 
He pointed out that Egypt is undergoing harsh conditions and fighting a fierce economic war  which requires exceptional measures to be taken  He called for the CBE to shut down exchange companies that work outside of the frame of law or do not abide by the CBE instructions 
Abdel Aal explained that each exchange company deals with a certain bank in Egypt  which sets its rates  where the companies settle their accounts at their corresponding bank at the end of every working day  They should then sell the surplus hard cash to banks  but that does not happen right now  according to him 
In Abdel Aal       s opinion  exchange companies must be shut down for three years  at least  until the state stabilises and obtains the necessary flow of foreign currencies to control the exchange market         Lack of tourism fails to justify this huge number of exchange companies right now         he pointed out

Currency trading should be limited to banks under current circumstances  banking expert

The current circumstances of the state should limit currency trading to banks only  said the general director of a private bank in Egypt Ahmed Selim  adding that exchange companies must be shut down  even if temporarily  until the harsh conditions pass 
He said that he urged the state to shut down exchange companies three months ago  considering the exceptional circumstances that require more than economic solutions         Extraordinary measures must be taken         he noted 
Moreover  Selim added that banks should deal well with the circumstances and to show some concern and fear for the country         They  banks  should not aim to maximise their profits in the meantime  but rather see the profits they make from investing in government debt instruments as sufficient        
He stressed that shutting down exchange companies has become necessary  but not sufficient  to solving the US dollar crisis         We began working from the top down  but every time we remove the head of the beast  another grows         he explained         Now  we have to eradicate the problem at its roots by limiting the demand on the US dollar through banning consumption imports        
Selim pointed to the past saying that President Gamal Abdel Nasser did not consider the nationalisation of companies until he was driven to that  pushed by the behaviour of profit seekers and the state s inability to control the economy  He added that the current situation is even more vigorous than the time of Nasser         Time is not on our side         he noted  He urged the state to take exceptional decision  even if aggressive         Sometimes  amputation becomes the sole solution

Closing exchange companies will reduce Egypt to informal currency market  banking expert
Ezz El Din Hassanein  a banking and economic expert and general manager at an Arab bank in Egypt  expressed his opposition to calls for the closure of exchange companies  saying that this procedure will reduce the entirety of Egypt to little more than an informal currency market 
He explained that the aim of demanding the closure of exchange companies is to move the flow of US dollars into the banking system channels  reduce imports funded by exchange companies  and facilitate the process of floating the Egyptian pound after the Central Bank of Egypt  CBE  lost control of the dollar supply  However  such measures will have further negative repercussions  he noted 
These consequences include a declining supply of US dollars  as exchange companies will resort to smuggling dollars or hiding any stashed amounts  he added         This would make all exchange company workers leave their jobs and become informal market traders all across Egypt        
Furthermore  Hassanein said that shutting down exchange companies will reduce the size of imports  leading many goods to disappear off the shelves  which would then drive inflation to unsafe levels  erode domestic manufacturing  push small investors out of the market  and shut down factories due to lack of dollars needed to cover their manufacturing requirements         This would even increase unemployment and lead importers  manufacturers  and dollar seekers to foreign exchange companies to secure their requirements  especially from the Gulf countries        
To avoid these negative impacts  Hassanein said that the CBE must have foreign exchange reserves of no less than    bn to meet the dollar needs of the government  importers  and manufacturers

CBE will not approve closing exchange companies  stricter penalties can erode informal market  banking expert
The establishment of exchange companies dates back to the beginning of the     s as one of the economic reform measures taken to meet the foreign exchange market crisis at that time  The move aimed to transform the informal market for currency trading to an organised market overseen by the Central Bank of Egypt  CBE   explained the director of the risk management department at an international financial institution  Zakaria Salah 
He added that exchange companies represent important channels for foreign currency  and at the same time fall under the control and supervision of the CBE  Therefore  the CBE will not approve shutting them down  in Salah       s opinion 
He described the parliamentary approval of the CBE       s proposal to amend the banking law to stiffen punishment of illegal currency trading and regulate the foreign exchange market to counter speculation as a good move         This will scare exchange companies and currency traders         he added 
Salah said that the CBE will not allow the shutdown of exchange companies  explaining that to the CBE       s knowledge it is easy to control them  while shutting them down will lead them to hide and the parallel market will become an actual black market  where transactions would take place in grocery stores and houses  making supervision an unprecedented challenge 
Moreover  he added that closing companies will strengthen the informal economy  which would counteract the policies that the government has been adopting to merge the informal economy into the formal economy 
The solution  according to Salah  is penning a regulated framework for these companies  with a reinforced role of governance  to link them more to banks  He explained that all companies should adhere to supplying a specific figure of hard currency to the bank they deal with         In a digital age  it should not be hard to set electronic data systems to enable the CBE to monitor every transaction they conduct         he pointed out 
He added that the CBE could also allow exchange companies to practice some banking activities to increase their revenues  which would be an incentive for them not to violate the law and maintain good relations with the CBE

Exchange companies are key in the Egyptian exchange market  capital markets expert

Exchange companies are a key element in the Egyptian exchange market  said capital market expert Mohamed Deshnawy  adding that they cover places where banks do not operate  such as villages and rural areas where remittances are often sent 
Closing them will only confuse both the official and the parallel market  and will not bridge the gap between the value of the Egyptian pound and the US dollar  he noted 
       Exchange companies did not create the US dollar crisis         Deshnawy explained         They only made it worse         He pointed out that the problem could be solved only through tighter measures and stricter sanctions  in addition to increased supervision over them by the Central Bank of Egypt  CBE  
He added that closure of exchange companies will not eliminate the informal market  but would rather make it deeper transferring transactions from known markets to new unknown ones  expanding the circle of shadow deals to include not only the companies but also kiosks  grocery stores  and even public transportation 
Deshnawy continued by saying that the problem is not with those who exploit situations  but the core lies within the slow measures and the weak oversight         If all activities that exploited a crisis were shut down  nothing would be left open in Egypt         he added 
According to Deshnawy  exchange companies only made use of an already bad situation  which he described as usual in all countries undergoing similar situations  He pointed fingers at supervisory authorities that should counter such exploitation to fix the market  without collective punishment 
Shutting down exchange companies highlights the failure of supervisory authorities  Deshnawy added
