Four approaches summarize past attempts to define the field  

The study of systems that think like humans 
The study of systems that think rationally 
The study of systems that act like humans 
The study of systems that act rationally 
Of these approaches  the former two are considered to be  white box  approaches because they require our analysis of intelligence to be based on the rationale for the behaviour rather than the behaviour itself  The latter two are considered  black box  approaches because they operationalize intelligence by measuring performance over a task domain  We prefer the latter two because they allow for quantitative comparisons between systems rather than requiring a qualitative comparison of rationales  We realize that the ultimate performance of a system will depend heavily on the task domain that it is situated in  and this motivates our preference for studying activity  behaviour  rather than thought  rationale   
Although the third approach   known as cognitive modelling   is of great importance to cognitive scientists  we concern ourselves with the fourth approach  Of the four  this approach allows to consider the performance of a theoretical system that yields the behaviour optimally suited to achieve its goals  given the information available to it 
This approach motivates us to provide a model for our intelligent systems known as the intelligent agent 

Learning projects edit   edit source 




See  Learning Projects and the Wikiversity Learning model   
Learning materials and learning projects are located in the main Wikiversity namespace  Simply make a link to the name of the learning project  learning projects are independent pages in the main namespace  and start writing   We suggest the use of the learning project template  use  subst Learning project boilerplate  on the new page  inside the double curved brackets       
Learning materials and learning projects can be used by multiple departments  Cooperate with other departments that use the same learning resource 
Understanding AI as a field of Computer Science involves a thorough understanding of the following topics 


Artificial intelligence
History of AI
Intelligent Agents
Search techniques
Constraint Satisfaction
Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
Reasoning under Uncertainty
Theory based Semantics
Decision Making
Learning and Neural Networks
Bots and automatons

Remember  Wikiversity has adopted the  learning by doing  model for education  Lessons should center on learning activities for Wikiversity participants  We learn by doing
